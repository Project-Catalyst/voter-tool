The team seems strong, but there are signs of poor / lax management and weak governance. Orbis also asks for the entire funding in the challenge. Voting for it translates into uniquely supporting it vs. any other funding request for a scaling solution, at least during this funding round.     \n\nThe problem. Like any permissionless blockchain, Cardano will face formidable challenges when striving to achieve the transaction capacity necessary to sustain all up-coming real world applications (payment processors, games, NFTs, oracles, etc.). \n\nThe solution. Orbis\u2019 value proposition is to position itself as a fundamental infrastructure, bringing to Cardano a scaling solution (layer 2) through a ZK rollup (a mechanism to bunch up multiple transactions into one piece of data in order to save space and computing power on the blockchain). Strategically, an ecosystem of strong layer 2 solutions would allow Cardano layer 1 to remain focused on decentralization and security. \n\nScalability. Orbis would function as a stand-alone solution and would have the potential to be built upon, including in non-Haskel languages (layer 3 solutions), allegedly with a very high potential scalability. However, since other Cardano scaling solutions are already in development (think Hydra), a few additions would have been extremely valuable in terms of describing how Orbis fits into the wider strategic picture of Cardano\u2019s future:\n\nComing up with indicators of how scalable Cardano will be with Orbis vs. without it. For instance, through quantifying throughput or transaction finality, in easy to digest figures or comparisons with other scaling solutions.  \nPerforming beforehand and disclosing within the proposal simulations of envisaged performance under a variety of load and network scenarios - stress testing the solution a priori.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Orbis should be ready by the end of 2022 - beginning of 2023, with a full open source solution right from the start. \n\nRyan, the project leader, is an extremely well articulated leader in the current blockchain industry, and he has a unique capacity to explain complicated topics in very simple terms. The team behind him is very solid, with a wide array of competencies necessary for such a complex project, including mathematicians, cryptographers, engineers and software developers. They are also backed by a solid track record. For instance they are behind the Ardana project, a future Cardano stablecoin ecosystem. \n\nUnfortunately, the budget aspects of the project have not been offered the same level of detail as the technical aspects. The budget is not broken down at all, and at this stage there is little to go through and analyze. Such a massive mistake for a proposal asking for a 1 million USD is thus a major red flag not due to the budget not being detailed (I would offer the team the benefit of the doubt that perhaps a regrettable error was behind the mistake, and budget breakdowns actually exist) but rather that this blunder offers a clear view into the team\u2019s practices and QA controls in place, and maybe the overall governance mechanisms are not that strong. \n\nA consolation comes from the fact that the project has been live for a few months, self-funded so far, but we do not have a lot of details with regards to the progress made. It would have been very useful as well for the team to shed light on whether the project would continue in the case of not being funded during this round. Also, the project went for a high risk / high reward approach and asked for the entire funding in the challenge. So any other better positioned proposal would render it unfundable. A more humble approach and perhaps showing consideration to the community would have been to identify solutions that split the budget along discrete milestones and ask for more modest funding during several rounds. \n\nFrom a technical perspective I highlight two points for reflection:\n \nWhile personally understanding the choice of selecting elliptic curve zkSNARKs (not quantum computing safe) due to current blockchain size limitations, it would have been beneficial for the proposers to offer comfort whether the Orbis solution can be easily and effectively \u201cquantum proofed\u201d into the future if the need arises. \nIn the beginning Orbis will be launched using only one single validating node, run internally by Orbis Labs. It is not very clear how Orbis intends to maintain \u201cliveliness\u201d in case of the node being taken off-line, and also the proposal does not offer any insight into what disaster recovery plans shall be put in place in order to minimize the likelihood of this happening. This risk of course would diminish during phase 2, when up to 100 nodes are planned to be introduced, and phase 3 with permissionless nodes would of course bring an end to this risk. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A strength of the proposal is that several of the individual system components are already under development. I would have been extremely glad to see those details complemented by easy to understand metrics, like percentages of completion added right next to the items. It was also extremely interesting to hear a very recent podcast with Ryan discussing Orbis in a very articulate manner - a good sign that the community can expect future updates in the future from the project heavyweights.  \n\nIt is rather disappointing that other auditability key aspects are not thoroughly detailed. For example the risks section has not been touched-upon at all, which is another strong red flag into the lax management culture within the team. Similarly, there are no proposed metrics and KPIs, or other visible communication channels with the community.  Proposing for instance a dedicated communications person to liaison with the Cardano community would have been an indication that the team truly stands behind its promise to deliver timely and useful information regarding the development of Orbis in the coming months.

Full implementation of this project would take years, so providing detailed timelines would increase the feasibility of the proposal. And the proposer also has plans to prevent risks during the research and implementation of the proposal. Why do you need detailed timelines, I can take an example of 1 items that can be considered as suggestions for the proponent (just 1 suggestion because in terms of technical level of programming I am not equal to proposer for sure)\n1. circuit research, after the circuit will be a polynomial proof study, then program it into a program for the prover and receiver to use together. This is the initial hard work for which the proposal must have a detailed plan. Because it will not be possible to use studies of existing solutions, current solutions build rules according to the model of Ethereum (Accounting ledger or merkle tree structure).\nThe team that made the proposal is a team of many experienced programmers, including Ryan Matovu, the founder of the famous project on Cardano: Ardana. This team I think is fully qualified to carry out the project.\nrequested budget: 1mil USD. However the most interesting part perhaps is the detailed budget breakdown: nothing? The criterion of the challenge is to not limit the budget if it is possible to come up with a clear plan and demonstrate it.

It is very unfortunate that the proposer did not complete this detail. However, in the case of funding, the proposer can completely add to this section. If this proposal can be completed, I can see a breakthrough in solving the problem of transaction speed, reducing transaction fees for many Defi projects or NFT projects.

We all know how layer 2 such as Polygon on Ethereum exploded the growth and improved usability of Ethereum. We also have seen that this year is primarily devoted to bringing different scalability improvements (such as pipelining, Hydra) to Cardano. Nevertheless, layer 2 solutions on Cardano will have at least as strong potential as the likes of Polygon had on Ethereum. \n\nCardano is a better designed system built with mathematically verified theorems and state of the art software engineering principles. As a senior developer myself, I know how important this is in terms of scalability. The ZK roll ups (based on ZK Snarks) that Orbis is proposing is an attempt to bring in the zero knowledge proof- based layer 2 solution to Cardano. They want to do this via having on-chain smart contracts that utilize one way zero-knowledge proofs that  don't require any knowledge to validate if a statement is true. These proofs already validate that transaction have already occurred on Layer 2 and only needs validation via smart contracts on Layer 1 which is Cardano. Therefore, bringing similar security (and many other similar benefits) to layer 2.\n\nThis is clearly a huge step forward and in addition to Hydra head, that IOHK is working upon, it must have to make Cardano a billions of users operating system. Good luck to the team, and amazing work been done already.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Firstly, I would like to say that the team that is working on Orbis and hence this proposal, is very very well experienced. The team members' profiles are public (with also Github links with active commit history) and the founder of this project is also the founder of Ardana, which is already very popular (a stable coin eco system built on Cardano) in the Cardano community. So from the perspective of team abilities, the full point from my side.\n\nAdditionally, the detailed plan presented is very technical. The different components that are required for this proposal to be successfully implemented are under development and work in progress. I believe that whoever wrote this proposal came from a technical background or under heavy workload. The reason I mention this is that at times this proposal just seems too complicated in different areas. For example, the breakdown of the plan is very difficult to understand for a non technical voter (which is indeed a big proportion among all voters out there). Another issue I see is that budget details were not provided and left as - to be filled - but were never filled (which they forgot, even after providing hints on the comments section, if it is possible to split this budget). \n\nWith such a big project and big team, I would also expect a lot of professionalism in their approach to project management. To me it feels like this project is driven by technologists (nothing wrong with it) but it is also the responsibility of the proposer to fulfill the Catalyst requirements in every dimension. E.g. Risk section is left as NA, I do not agree that such a complex project will not have any complications that might push back the deadlines ?\n\nThe total budget asked is 1 million in Ada and there are no details provided on how this number was reached. The voters should also understand that if this proposal is funded then none of the other proposals might get funded from this challenge. Overall, I feel that this project will be implemented successfully (as I am a developer myself), however, with this much budget requirements I expected better writeup from the team. Therefore, I can not strongly agree.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has provided a lot of technical details on how they will track the progress of this proposal. Additionally the success metrics provided by the team gives an in-depth insight from the usability perspective. The full decentralized layer 2 solution built up on Cardano, encapsulating away the nitty gritty technical marvel of roll ups and zero knowledge proofs and hence allowing similar security to users which Cardano offers at layer one.\n\nNevertheless, i think the auditability section could have provided additional details complimenting the technical details such as writing Plutus core to C compiler, in my opinion for non technical voters it would have been a great help to understand things in layman terms. Regardless, since i am an experienced developer myself and the overall writeup and currently in progress work, in addition to the team sharing progress/knowledge on Twitter open spaces, i feel that the proposal team is working tirelessly and regularly sharing their progress/current state with the community.

The goal here is be able to scale to millions of users without sacrificing the decentralization of the blockchain. If you have used cardano lately, you may experience delays on your transaction as the network can be pretty congested. zk rollups allows the transactions to be done off chain and be sent on chain on bundles. So instead of having for instance 10 transactions on cardano, those 10 transactions will be done off chain and be sent once on the cardano network.

The proposers would do their proposal a favour if they included KPIs for their solution and especially detailed milestones that would allow for the tracking of the proposals progress. As it stands now, a $1,000,000 proposal without a timeline and budget breakdown will be very difficult to audit.

The project lead indicates that Orbis will be introducing features beyond what Hydra is expected to introduce, but has not said specifically what those will be.  There is also the potential for horizontal scalability here as well, since Orbis will decentralize just like Hydra is supposed to, and the two protocols can leverage eachother if needed.  Like most decentralized protocols, Orbis will be starting as a centralized node, and the funding from this proposal is not intended to drive the decentralizing of the network, however this is a subject that the Ardana development team has spoken often about (the team behind Orbis).  In their own ISPO they focused on fair and decentralized, and they have said they are committed to Orbis reaching full decentralization in order to improve to the protocol.  One issue is that this proposal effectively takes the entire funding pool for scaling solutions during this fund, so voters would do well to consider whether it outweighs all other considerations in the scaling challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Across the board the team looks to be some of the best, and the budget definitely reflects that!  For example, they wanted to work in  plutarch, so they pulled the top plutarch contributor from Github over to their team. There is an excellent breakdown of the architecture involved and where the workflows will be applied.  Understanding little about the actual protocol I was still able to bounce back and forth between the repositories and the descriptions of the architecture to piece together how the they add up to a scaling solution.

The team has indicated that a 2022 MVP is expected, but they have also indicated that it will \"be ready when its ready.\"  As much as I respect that project management cannot be as emergent as it needs to be for dynamic systems like Cardano, the team is still requesting a million dollars from the treasury.

The team has proposed Orbis as the best possible scaling solution and explained the reason why. This shows that they have confidence about their product.

At least, they should give the specific time or targets so that readers know what they will make or achieve and when they will move to the next stage.

I am assessing the merits of the proposal - not the technology! While I started carding IBM mainframes in the 70's and had some understanding of basic, fortran, linux, c, c++ and am currently in the Prisim Pioneer class and did a stint as an IT tech I am not an engineer, programmer or developer. I have done reading on the tech stuff being proposed where I could find stuff, cause of my geeky curiosity, BUT I am only assessing the proposal. Please DYOR on the tech due to the potential ramifications to the Cardano network if we adopt one of these technologies.\n___________________________________________________\nThis proposal effectively addresses the Challenge, the Campaign brief and several of the topic areas and highlights.\n__________________________________________________\nPREDIGEST: ZK = Zero Knowledge; SNARK = Succinct, Non-Interactive ARgument of Knowledge; zkSnark= Zero Knowledge Snark; Recursive SNARKS = purpose - to allow proof generation to be split into pieces, which can be farmed to different computers to permit limitless linearly scaling; Prover= off chain system with purpose of constructing zkSNARK; Verifyer= on chain smart contract, purpose to settle transactions happening on-rollup on Cardano;( Pluto=programming language - easy to learn; Plutarch= Programing language - Haskell embedded domain specific - both are alts to Plutus Tx - purpose writing on chain scripts); Halo 2 = proving system developed by Electric Coin Co/Zcash; Orbis = built using Halo2 ZK.\n__________________________________________________\nThe Proposal states success is Orbis as a decent layer 2 protocol..... to support global finance and other mass scale apps such as DIDS, Defi, social graphs, NFTs and micropayments. There is more but their vision, as proposed addresses the bulwark of the challenge for blockchain scalability by using Novel; Research; Borrowing; Niche Defi Markets; Novel scaling solutions, etc.\n__________________________________________________\nIn short Orbis is proposed to be a ZK rollup layer 2 to Cardano to support DeFi apps. TXs are bundled off chain (L2) into single zk proof using Plutus smart contracts and submitted to Cardano (L1) for verification. Orbis will use zkSNARKS which do not require two way (State Channel) between Prover & Verifier so it allows off chain proofs. Additionally, Orbis uses Recursive SNARKS for scaling. The Prover is off-chain while the verifier is on chain smart contract. Orbis will enable PlutusTx smart contracts to be ported over. The Orbis system using Halo2 ZK proving system is trustless and supports recursive proofs. The proposal states that this will be a more decentralized system; though in the beginning there will only be one verifier - Orbis Labs.\n\nAdditionally, Orbis will support L3 using Recursive ZK proofs for specific rollups. These specific use cases are stated as Defi, NFTs, supply chains and micropayments.\n_________________________________________________\nThe objectives and key metrics in this proposal and it's vision of success meets the Challenge by addressing: scalability of blockchain activity, novel scaling solutions, niche Defi market, research into alt solutions and it has market specific scalability solutions in at least NFTs and Micropayments.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team in the proposal would appear to be qualified with the required skills and experience. The Tech was very well explained and I believe it could be one methodology to solve the issue(s) in the Challenge and Campaign Brief.\n__________________________________________________\nUnfortunately, in my opinion and assessment the proposal is incomplete and without the missing segments, I do not agree (I disagree) that the proposal would be successfully implemented.\n__________________________________________________\nFirst reason, is the budget clarity. This proposal requests the entire amount of this Challenge category of $1,000,000. In the proposals' section for providing a detailed budget breakdown the response is- \"To be added soon\".   My advice to the Proposal team, for this to be considered by the voters and other assessors as a valid proposal, is to provide a very detailed budget for the project (and perhaps  justification of why this proposal should be awarded the entire Challenge budget).\nSecond, is in the Risk Management section. This is a large proposal with many different pieces to it with several different solutions across L1, L2, & L3. To the question of : What main challenges or risks do you foresee to deliver this project successfully?, The proposals response is : \"N/A\".  My advice for this project to make voters comfortable is to provide a very detailed SWOT analysis and a comprehensive Risk Management Assessment to the Cardano network as well as to budget. Third, is the question of a 'Realistic Timetable'. There are what appear to be stages or milestones of different segments for this project, yet there are no timeframes or accountability metrics provided. My suggestion, especially for the size and technical aspect of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive Roadmap with dates (by quarter or month or year) as your plan schedules out, towards completion and success. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The Proposal has a number of milestones for it's development which is why I rated it as four stars. The proposal highlights a number of the key segments for the development process. However, due to the size of the budget request, the ambitious solutions I suggest the  milestones have a more quantifiable nature for voter consideration. One specific example is in the section of the proposal about the initial Prover that states: \"Initially, Orbis will launch with a single prover operated by Orbis Labs. Orbis will transition into a fully decentralized, distributed stack whereby network participants will exist in an open, permissionless network\". \nMy advice would be to have a metric of when this would be completed. I think the voters may be more comfortable knowing when the project will be at full decentralization. Though, the tech is not in my scope of review I would suggest you might look at a potential colab with Atala Prisim.\n__________________________________________________\nOne section that many advisors and voters look for are KPIs. Though this has evolved over Catalyst iterations and does not seem to be a requirement some voters appreciate these. Again, due to the size of the budget request and the complexity of the Proposal I would suggest that a developed KPI metric system be included in the proposal.
