Even though, there is no direct scaling effect when accepting the proposal, the outcomes of the research might pave the way for further improvements long term. Two things could especially have a long term effect, this is one, the research done in terms of current weaknesses of Cardano and the comparison to other chains and two and much more important the buildup of an independent research group within Cardano that is community driven. Even though currently IOHK is doing a supreme job in doing these kinds of research, an independent group outside of IOHK also diving deep into the Cardano research tunnel may provide not only benefits but also a second opinion.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers seem to be capable of providing what is described in the proposal.

The proposal takes an 20/80 approach to the expensing of the development of this multi-fund Guild of Researchers, which appears well thought out. 20% of funds are targeted to Infrastructure and Administration and 80% towards the research project(s) actual work.\n__________________________________________________\nThe three lead proposers appear to have the education and experience needed in forming this Research Guild. The proposal has a realistic timetable and implementation plan. Though this does appear that it will need to become a Legacy Challenge Proposal across several Catalyst funds to reach full viability.\n__________________________________________________\nThe research budget is well researched and documented which is stated to be 80% of expenditures.

The Guild will use Fixed KPIs for their Research campaign specific reports which keeps with the 20/80 budget structure proposed of Infrastructure vs. Research.\n___________________________________________________\nThe 20% Infrastructure side would utilize variable KPIs which will evolve over successive iterations of the Guilds formation.

I would suggest the Guild establish more formal Monitoring Criteria as they develop and focus, due to the large number of audit metrics proposed.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1339", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2148, "q0": "NOTE for VCAs and voters: The Research Guild is a network that has launched 6 proposals during this funding round. This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider Research Guild framework. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (the network\u2019s organizational aspects, competency, research approach, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms and budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals and parts specific to each proposal.\n\nKey takeaway: spot on problem identification, perfect alignment with the challenge, tremendous potential for added value for Cardano if the report is shared with the community and thoroughly digested by future proposers before designing scalability solutions. With a research-oriented background myself, I can only applaud the overall quality and level of detail of the proposal. \n\nThis proposal aims to deliver a customized scalability report that will review scaling solutions across blockchains and share them with the wider Cardano community. Such a report can be  an extremely helpful tool to future Catalyst proposals when designing and proposing scalability solutions. This proposal not only aligns, but matches perfectly with the challenge and I think it is of utmost importance that the ecosystem finances similar research undertakings well before costly scaling solutions.\n\nHaving in mind Cardano\u2019s research-driven ethos, there are incredibly valuable insights that such a community-driven research would bring for future projects, for instance (1) removing guesswork, (2) identifying knowledge gaps, (3) challenging false assumptions or (4) offering off the shelf SWOT material. The added value for the community stems from the fact that such a report can be an instrumental tool for future proposers that aim to introduce layer 2 solutions or other projects that increase Cardano\u2019s scalability / efficiency if used in the early stages of product development / selecting implementations solutions. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Key takeaway: A solid academic-oriented team behind the proposal, a clear plan and recruitment process for the actual researchers and an understandably long but reasonable timeline for completion. Good value for money overall. A big risk is over-promising, since this is by far the most complex Guild\u2019s proposal, with the highest budget and longest timeline. \n\nThe plan. The core team consists of 3 PhD / PhD candidates from Auckland University, Renmin University respectively University of Osnabr\u00fcck, all currently undergoing blockchain-oriented activities. They would NOT conduct the research themselves, but instead they would extend invitations to their networks of academic and professional colleagues to participate in the actual research. Perhaps the standout of the team is the wide-net that they can cast within their own respective networks when searching for viable research candidates. They would subsequently undergo a recruitment / selection process based on received resumes / review of academic work published / blockchain experience. The actual work itself would be undertaken by this collective of independent researchers onboarded as above. \n\nThe team correctly pin-points a significant risk facing the project, that being the sheer number of hours required to complete such a large research project given their team size. To address this they promise to dedicate time to on-board additional team members within the next months, which of course will be highly dependent on whether the project will be funded or not. \n\nBudget talk. 20% of the budget would go towards building the research network (research identification, outreach, project management, support, designing reporting templates, etc.). 80% of the budget would go to creating tailored research projects following a loosely based pathway which makes sense considering the knowledge-building capacity of the project. Payment for individual researchers would follow a determined base hourly rate, based on the average of online surveys already undertaken. There are extensive figures offered in the proposal, but the key figure to remember is the overall base pay of USD 32/hour and US 60/hour for highly specialized work.\n\nThe team estimates that a research report of this scale and complexity will take nine months to complete: from May 2022 until January 2023. There is a detailed project roadmap outlined in the proposal, with great granularity down to weeks necessary for each intermediary step.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Key takeaway: very clear roadmap and extensive KPI list, great verification potential and clear communication channels for work undertaken.\n\nThis work will be delivered in the form of a public report with key research insights and recommendations that can be implemented by the community immediately, or pursued through future Project Catalyst funding proposals.\n\nThe project team will approach auditability in three ways: (1) establishing a set of project indicators, (2) engaging in internal peer review processes for each deliverable and (3) engaging in Project Catalyst community advisor review processes. \n\nSuccess would be measured 20% through the success of establishing a research network and 80% on the report itself. The KPI list for both items above is extensive and quite possibly very challenging to implement in practice, but they are definitely an excellent starting point.

From here, the community benefits from the successful implementation of the project. And Cardano can handle its scaling requirements as well.

The author has detailed planning on specific time and stages of project implementation, which shows the feasibility of this proposal.

Both stages have specific goals to be achieved (KPIs) to promote and create efficiency, avoiding wasting time, money and effort.\n- This proposal requires high quality personnel to meet in-depth specialized research to find out the causes, solutions, and the effectiveness of those solutions. From there publishes a report on Cardano scaling solutions.\n- However, in the proposal, it is necessary to show more clearly the effectiveness of implementing and solving the challenge.
