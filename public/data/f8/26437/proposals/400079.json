I am assessing the merits of the proposal - not the technology! While I started carding IBM mainframes in the 70's and had some understanding of basic, fortran, linux, c, c++ and am currently in the Prisim Pioneer class and did a stint as an IT tech I am not an engineer, programmer or developer. I have done reading on the tech stuff being proposed where I could find stuff, cause of my geeky curiosity, BUT I am only assessing the proposal. Please DYOR on the tech due to the potential ramifications to the Cardano network if we adopt one of these technologies.\n__________________________________________________\nPre-digest: State Channel - a) general form of payment channel; b) process of Tx's with one another, off chain; c) channels off chain and private.  PERUN.network = off chain framework that supports real-time payments, claiming unlimited scalability and provable security.  ERDSTALL.dev = L2 blockchain allows massive scaling on Ethereum. GO = aka Golang is an open source programing language designed by Google.  GO CLIENT = graphical interface to GO servers and Go programs.\n_________________________________________________\nThis proposal is extremely well written and in my opinion meets the Challenge objectives. The objectives it meets include: Hydra add ons; State Channels; Borrowing from other blockchains; Novel scaling solutions and Research.\n_________________________________________________\nPerun has already implemented channels for Ethereum, Cosmos and Polkadot. It proposes to implement Perun Channels for Cardano which would enable P2P TX's with unlimited scalability and cross chain potential. This will require research in part due to:  Perun account based protocol translation to eUTXO; Perun library is written in Go however, a Go Client is not available on Cardano; potential need to build an adaptor between Go and Cardano; availability into libraries to verify signatures in Cardano smart contracts and information encoding in off chain client and then how to encode it in smart contract logic. These are all areas of topic and objectives in the Challenge.\n___________________________________________________\nSuccess and key metrics according to the proposal is to demonstrate (at a minimum) the feasibility of Perun channels on Cardano. This would open space for APPS that need scalable and low fees e.g. games and micropayments.

It requests a budget of \"roughly $30K USD/month\", with no breakdown. My other concern is they have had apparently discussions with Hydra team about using some components of Hydra, but were \"made aware that we might have underestimated the required effort and therefore adjusted our timeline and budget accordingly\". My assessment is this was a good catch - prior to funding and project genesis. My advice would be for the team to do a more comprehensive budget with salary and time breakdowns. Many voters appreciate the analytics that accompany a Projects proposal budget.\n__________________________________________________\nThe implementation plan and risk management is an area of concern. The proposal acknowledges a \"Steep learning curve\". This is based on the technology challenges of Account based model to eUTEXO. Also the need for Go Client adaptor. The biggest challenge to the successful implementation  seems to be the availability of external libraries for smart contract logic. In what I understand as full transparency the proposal states (re: libraries for Cardano smart contract signature verification) \"if none of it is readily available, this may in fact put the whole project at risk\". \n__________________________________________________ \nThe timeline is in my assessment a good timeline. According to the proposal team it and the budget was adjusted after receiving advice. The current timeline estimate is for 9 months and is broken into 3  - three month segments of what should be accomplished.\n____________________________________________________\nThe proposal does include a Disclaimer about a dual proposal they have submitted for Erdstall, a different scaling solution.

Due to the complexity of handling the state of the Eutxo ledger, creating a perfect state channel for Cardano will take a long time. It can be seen as Hydra, in order to create a state channel that is not only fast, but also has to be synchronized with the entire Eutxo ledger state from all hydra heads, Hydra must be designed as an isomorphic state channel, not an common state channel like state channel that running on blockchains using the Accounting ledger model. Therefore, more solutions are needed to create new state channels running on Cardano before a perfect Hydra is launched on the mainnet. Perun channel has been developed based on the design of state channels running on blockchains using the Accounting ledger model. In the solution described by the proponent, Perun researched and deployed on Cardano will be a cross-chain state channel. This is a very cool idea although difficult to implement like the synchronization of account states of the Accounting and Eutxo ledgers, the difference between Full turing programming language (Solidity) and Non-Turing programming language (Plutus).
