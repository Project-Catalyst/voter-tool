Since way before the pandemic hit, videos started to become more important for learning in a flipped classroom/ blended learning environment. In this proposal, videos are proposed to be used both as educational material as well as for showing success stories/ emotional onboarding, therefore providing two possible pathways of attracting new users. From the trailer provided, I would say that it points more towards a motivational/ emotional aspect as well as transporting the vision of ADA to help people understand, how valuable the project is. Using real world usecases is a very good idea, since one of the key criticisms that is held against Cardano is, that it doesn\u00b4t provide smart contracts, yet. So the scope is very useful and can work as a way to promote the idea and give an overview on how active the Cardano Community actually is.

The team in the background reflect a typical video-crew as far as I understand and would probably guarantee, that the produced videos are very professional as well. \r\n\r\nSince there is not enough information about the intended content for the videos, I cannot really estimate if the team can cover all the topics that would be necessary to put together the Cardano Ecosystem for new members and outsiders. But even with technical and developer content, a documentary film crew might be able to instruct a developer good enough to explain his or her dApp or project without having the same technical knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe proposer already showed commitment by producing a teaser video and there\u00b4s already a team in the background, that might already have worked before on other projects, so the objective of creating videos will be conducted by a team of professionals.

I\u00b4m also not sure if the videos will be portraying the real-world success stories from the outside, or if the team of the project will be involved. One of the challenges could be to get enough people to participate in a video production in this short amount of time (3 months). Another challenge, as always, is visibility. It would be important to find ways to promote the videos and to share them so community engagement with the project would be important. \r\n\r\nIt was mentioned, that as a documentary filmer + crew, a lot of other proposals and ideas might be interested in cooperating, so in general, the experience of the proposer is much needed and appreciated in the community I\u00b4d think. I\u00b4d always advise, that to create educational content, it\u00b4s important to have a diverse team that would in the best-case scenario include a film-maker, a teacher and a developer or whoever is best involved in the content, so the community should always try to build interdisciplinary teams for best results.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}], "solution": "Short, precisely articulated educational videos will work as a gateway to Cardano attracting developers / ada holders.
