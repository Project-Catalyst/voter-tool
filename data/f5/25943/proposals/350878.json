How the students would see receiving an email from something that they don't know. I really thing that they wouldn't open it \u2013 since nowadays the selling of private information like email to industries and companies are present, they might receive thousands of emails every day.\r\nI really think that a project more community involved would be of a greater impact. We already have lots of members across the world with great credentials and who are willing to help. Maybe create a platform which put these people together and which aims create a presentation and validate a method that could be presented inside the universities and colleges around the world, but presential \u2013 would be much more appealing.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "This plan seems optimistic, but feasible.

I really think that explore the people in lots of locations across the world and providing them with a platform to share experiences of presentation in the universities would be a great thing.\r\n\r\nAnother question that arises is that your proposal is only feasible if you get funded every time (until a point that is self-sustainable), however, lets imagine that you get fund now and in the next one not \u2013 will the project over?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is not clear the intention of deploying a website \u2013 what it will be for?
