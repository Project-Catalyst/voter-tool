This would definitely make it easier for community members to collaborate and give a simple 'first step' to participating in PC (project catalyst).  However, even though there is budget for 'Marketing' it is unclear how the proposal will encourage 'outside proposers' - people from outside of the community.  This is only a slight problem with alignment to the campaign.  The proposal could be more clear in how it would bring 'outside proposers' into the community.
