If the link between Cardano and Sustainability was formed, I believe it will be beneficial for everyone, and at the same time it can attract new entrepreneurs and members to our community (thus being in accordance with the objectives of this challenge) and benefiting the planet.

With that we can get to know him more particularly, and seeing him describing the idea generates a lot of confidence and credibility for the project.
