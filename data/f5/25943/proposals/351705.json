Because I think that this might be not scalable and the costs would be huge. This idea could culminate in the community participation, where you can open to the community to find a solution and maybe a partnership with the business, or even a reward \u2013 which I think would be less spending than have your own team and would show how the community works together.\r\n\r\nOther than that, if you win this fund and start this project together with the Catalyst it is of your intention to make it annual, the \"Culture of Innovation\" \u2013 however it has costs, as you've shown.
