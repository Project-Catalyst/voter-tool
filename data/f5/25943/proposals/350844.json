The proposal takes in consideration the next steps after the first contact through the marketing campaign, the concept behind the landing page I consider appropriate. The entire catalyst community and ultimately the Cardano community will benefit from the successful implementation of this proposal. The result of the implementation of this proposal can give us key information that allows us to make decisions as a community to improve the on boarding experience of new entrepreneurs. To improve this proposal I would suggest the inclusion of content that promotes or reinforces \"Catalyst\" as a brand. That the new members understand that this is not just a funding opportunity, but rather a new way to add value to the world.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is well written and the team behind seems to be hard at work at succeeding.

The platform and decentralized nature is actually amazing, but more people need to hear about it. I think a lot of people ended up here kind of randomly. An ad campaign targetting entrepreneurs, both blockchain savvy and those with ideas that would benefit from blockchain (like I was when I found Catalyst) would be very useful for attracting more people.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "An online marketing campaign has surely the possibility to impact in a positive manner outreach for future proposers", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 2, "note": "Team is looking very good and suitable for the job.

Likewise, a second company appears on its Linkedin page, of which it mentions if it was a founder called \"IMOVA\", this company does not exist in linkedin and does not have an associated website. In his profile webpage he says that he has been part of many companies but this is not shown in the LinkedIn profile. Strange. The two teammates have full time jobs.
