Looking to the suggestions of video's content, it is very clear that not only the CA would benefit from them, but actually it seems that maybe the proposer would benefit even more. \r\nOne thing that kept my attention is that you helped to create the CA guideline, which is a written 'FAQ' and that gave you several insights and feedback which helped you to think about this proposal. However, have you received lots of messages suggesting that a video series would benefit the community? I am saying this because it seems to me that ask 10% of the challenge funds to change the format of an information is a lot. It would be of a great value if you share some of the feedbacks and the requests \u2013 would clarify how many more people would be reached compared with the written format.\r\n", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "As I have clearly expressed in the proposal, the video content will be \"screen-sharing content\", so it is more like a webinar and not a classic video, where video skills like cutting/editing are required.", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal id's a current problem. The exponential growth in number of proposals adds a strain on CA's, most of them which are also new to the system. The proposal would benefit of some real figures e.g. current proposals per registered CA, number of flagged assessment in previous rounds.\r\nWell written and updated guidelines already solve this problem but having video complements would certainly help and likely prove a better medium for some people, and have a positive impact on the progress of Catalyst.

The tutorials were well structured and will be organized in modules so that they can be updated in a practical way as the documentation and the assessment process is updated.
