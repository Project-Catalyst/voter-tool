Offering financial incentives through tokens and bounties is a way to encourage community participation in the discussion of improvements for Catalyst and in my view having more people actively participating in Catalyst is a step towards wisdom of the crowds and an improvement in the ability to decision-making in relation to Catalyst itself. The proposal goes beyond creating solutions in decision making, being a promising idea to organize and distribute the workload. \r\n\r\nThe distribution of contribution tokens to poll /proposals participants can help increase community participation in internal proposals for improving Catalyst and create a reputation model where members with more tokens end up being seen as more participatory, but as one of the objectives of the proposal is creating a tokenomics model there is still no way to know the effectiveness and impact of this.
