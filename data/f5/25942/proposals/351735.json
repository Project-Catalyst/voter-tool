The proposal would benefit from offering a brief description of the role and expected effect of the visual resources created for the Catalyst Community Advisors on the Distributed decision-making of the community. This brief description could be used by the proponent to demonstrate his understanding of the process within Catalyst and its articulation with the broader community.

In particular, I am concerned regarding the absence of evidence of previous successful execution and the little use of visual communication resources in the examples provided (Catalyst's landing page and teleolog web page). I found the following statement concerning: \"A full list of proposed Infographic will be developed at the time of funding\". The proponent has demonstrated experience with the process but nevertheless could not, or, chose not to, enunciate or demonstrate their understanding of the requirement for visual resources to explain it.  Furthermore, there are incomplete and undeveloped statements like \"Look at build out a more detailed process of funding graphics and engaging a wider range of graphic designers - for future funding rounds.\", which seems to be leftover from a previous assessment.

In relation to design, the professional to be well prepared, talented and capable, according to their work posted on the social network. However, in relation to the selection of information that would be included in the graphics, I think it would be safer if someone specializing in blockshain were hired as well. Because despite being very involved with Catalyst, it is not certain that the author has deep experience in cryptocurrencies.

Another point that I thought was that it is not said where these graphics would be available, how they would reach the public, since the ultimate goal is to better guide the members of the community. Regarding the division of expenses, it is said that an amount would be shared in 50/50 for the designer and the author, who would do the research. But for example, if someone else was also hired, that account would need to be rethought.
