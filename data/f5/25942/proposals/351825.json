The proposal is within the scope of the challenge and has great potential to not only improve decision making, but to create tools and a data management model to improve various processes that today are problematic and fragmented between IdeaScale and independent tools. There is a long-term plan, which is a positive point and increases the long-term impact.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is a continuation of a work that is already being developed and is already showing positive results in decision making through several swarm sessions where several members of Catalyst participate regularly to improve several points of Catalyst, among them decision making.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal has a very confusing layout so took me a while to understand the objective. For example the objectives of this proposal are well layed out in the end in the \"Impact\" section, this should have been layed out in the beginning. There is also a lot of unnecessary content, like the \"Truth about Data\" section which is not required to understand the proposal. Saying that the proposal identifies real issues with IdeaScale, like the difficulty in finding information from previous funds and so it address the challenge. I'm not sure if replacing IdeaScale with a new platform is the best solution, specially when no concrete alternative is being proposed.

In the proposal there is a description that several administrators will be \"hired\" to assist in the management of the platforms as well.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is a continuation of the \"Adagov.org (Co-creation)\" proposal. The plan and the established budget are reasonable and are detailed, giving continuity to what was presented in the proposal of Fund4.\r\n\r\nDue to the complexity of the proposal, there is a risk that Adagov.org will not be used as intended. The decision to use a platform other than IdeaScale is uncertain and depends on several factors.

Maybe addressing these two problems to clarify everything would be a great incrementation to the project.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in 'feasibility' would be a good thing to see things more well explained.
