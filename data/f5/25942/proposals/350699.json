Therefore, it will potentially improve the decision making.\r\nSome ideas that could help with this project in the future is: if possible, create graphs that make clear the common points among the successful projects and another one with those who failed; open a channel to allow the failed project's team to talk about why they think it failed, where they could have improved \u2013 it might help another proposer.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 5, "no_vca": 6, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "The List of projects being funded and their progress are diligently covered in town halls however a website can provide a ready reference and can definitely improve the visibility of progress and transparency.
