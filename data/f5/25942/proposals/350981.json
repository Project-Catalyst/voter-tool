What do we (community) expect to see as a result of 20% engagement in the tool by C.A;\r\nb.\tAdd a \"homogeneity metric\" as KPI: One of the problems described was the uneven reviews, therefore if with the use of the tool this parameter gets better, we could associate this evolution with the tool;\r\nc.\tAdd another filter to C.A.'s tool: If there is a possibility to add a required knowledge in order to avoid waste of time by them (mainly by newcomers to this world).

Maybe it would be easier to implement this if this kind of information starts in the proposal itself;\r\nd.\tTry to implement a correlation of access and time in the proposal page to account as 'assessed': Imagine if there is lots of people who decides analyze and write their comments in other app (word or excel, eg) and only in the final days starts to pass it to the platform itself.
