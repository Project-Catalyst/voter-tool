However, since it is an 8-week sprint to get the majority up and running, one can assume most of the budget is spent in the first two months which is about the burn rate of the MuKn contractors who will build the system.  Please note we chose this route because blockchain interoperability is a huge factor in the success of this product to reach the \"ocean\" of open source developers that handshake.org airdropped a large quanity of their token to.
