My only real criticism is that I am afraid there are going to be people that miss some of your documentation because it wasn't linked directly in the main proposal.

You covered almost all the angles (I did not see a section for challenges but I am going to give you a pass for that based on your overall proposal). \r\n\r\nThere is going to be a crowdfunding Cardano App. I have seen many proposals for this but yours stands out as the best I have seen so far.
