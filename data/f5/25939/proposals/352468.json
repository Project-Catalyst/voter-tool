Promoting the learn-and-earn system directly at Universities is a great way to find new talent and interest students at the beginning of their career. \r\n\r\nThe proposal connects to a couple of the key metrics of the fund (Incentivization structures, how to attract developers from outside, how to get developers motivated) and the impact would be directly tied to the objective of attracting new developers onto the Cardano Network. Implementing the learn-and-earn system in Latin America and Africa would be adding to the general interest of Cardano to include and invite people from poorer regions of the world to participate and open the doors to a career in blockchain. \r\n\r\nGame-based learning is highly motivating and adding incentives will further increase motivation. \r\n\r\nIt might be important to look into factors that can limit the risks of abuse of the learn-and-earn system.

It's made clear that over half of the funding will be used to incentivize learners with rewards in ADA. But there is no mention indicating what will happen once the initial funding is depleted. I guess there is potential to operate a stake pool or multiple pools to generate more ADA to use as rewards, but that has limitations in scalability.  I have issued 2 stars for feasibility because theoretically free education (rather than incentive based education) is still a positive outcome, despite not being the exact goal of the proposal.
