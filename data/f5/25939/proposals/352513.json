Nonetheless, this proposal could have equally placed in any of the other five challenges: Distributed decision making, Proposer outreach, Catalyst value onboarding, Grow Africa or Scale UP!. The proposal is of clear value to Cardano and I believe the proponents have tried to leverage their expertise to maximize the returns (focus on more technical materials), which I find positive.
