This proposal aims to provide an SDK for iOS and OSX developers making Cardano an option for all these existing developers, given the reach of Apple's devices there is no doubt that this proposal perfectly addresses the dev eco system challenge.\r\n\r\nWithout SDK, each developer needs to reinvent the wheel in order to solve common problems instead of focusing on their real project.\r\n\r\nA quality SDK ensures reliability for all the application depending on it and rapid development. The availability of an SDK is many time what will make the difference when choosing a platform to develop on.

More information on their experience in cryptography is needed though ; as one of the first rule for devs dealing with cryptography is \"don't create your own crypto library\". This lack of experience or mention of it could be compensated with a planned audit of their code but there is no mention of such an audit (mandatory when dealing with cryptography of this magnitude).\r\n\r\nWe also really regret that they don't go into any detail on how the API their library will provide will actually work: to what backend will it connect to?\r\nThe goal of such SDKs is to provide a solid bridge for developer to the Cardano blockchain but we don't know how their bridge will look like, how long it will be or where it will land. This lack of information makes it difficult to properly assess its feasibility or future strength, although there are several ways to achieve this, some are more decentralized than others and directly impact the longevity of such a project.\r\n\r\nThere is also no mention of long term support. The project focus on a very short 8 weeks development plan with very little details on what features the SDK will actually provide so even if it is successfully implemented we don't really know what to expect... The experience of the developer implies that they must have thought about this, we can only give them the benefit of the doubt but the lack of information is unfortunately too important to give this proposal more than 2 stars in feasibility. \r\n\r\nThey've built their proposal to explain the non-developers why it is useful but they forgot that the Community Advisors spending time reviewing proposals in the dev eco system are often other engineers who need real details about how things will actually work in order to assess if their project is viable.

That is nearly all the information we are provided once you remove the \"Why it's useful part\".
