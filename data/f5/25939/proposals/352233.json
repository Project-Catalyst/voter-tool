This limited addition to the Developer Ecosystem challenge in my personal view does open up the way - in a wider sense - for attracting developers to the ecosystem and educating them on how to build applications, especially as it is linked to a specific and existing Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP 12) that the proposing team co-authored.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Will sort out CIP12 stakepool operator communications to Yoroi backend software ,needed by Yoroi lightweight wallets and other lightweight wallets.
