One of the goals is to improve the feedback that project developers will receive as the number of proposals increases, by providing them with expert feedback in their project area. The problem posed is only described by a few very open questions and lacks concrete illustrations. It seems to me that experienced developers don't necessarily feel as lost in the Catalyst environment as the author suggests.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The Catalyst Common Idea Funnel is interesting and fits within the challenge, however, more information should be added to increase the score. Specifically, additional efforts could be made to link this proposal with the key metrics to measure within the challenge brief. The proposal could be expanded to explain how it can reduce the overwhelming burden that people face in order to get more external interest in Cardano. New proposers would still be faced with a deluge of information and without ongoing oversight, how would the system adapt or grow based on the level of interest/participation? The reliance on community is one potential way but it may also create further challenges since it's all volunteer leading to individual experiences being very different and inconsistent.

There is also a disconnect between the funnel process that is explained in detail and then the final request for funding to run prize competitions to get individuals into catalyst. It is unclear to me how these two are directly linked. If the funding requested here is for the prize competitions then that should be more prominent across the whole proposal, with better explanations of how the prize competition then leads to success of the funnel. \r\n\r\nI also cannot assess the feasibility given the budget as there is no breakdown.
