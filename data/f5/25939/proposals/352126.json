Still, the proposal would benefit from a detailed rationale as to how they came to the 70K number, and how funds will be allocated in each stage.  As it is, we can follow github and expect an MVP in 3 months and a functioning product in 6 months.  Due to a lack of additional details or reporting, It will be difficult to audit how efficiently the funds are used. I suggest, if funded, they improve their transparency in this respect.

The rationale is we will need a good six months of core developer time and without a comprehensive breakdown of exactly what we will need to do to make this a reality, we have to use rough estimates.  A typical Dev month is $10K-$15K and with 6-months of work you can see $70K is a conservative number.  The CAs should have enough experience reviewing a technical proposal to understand the standard reasonable cost structure for a development project so they can assess if it is within bounds of reality.  If not, then perhaps they aren't in a good position to take on this kind of proposal.
