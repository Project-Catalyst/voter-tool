The proposal also doesn't address the risks of people abusing this system e.g. requesting funding for tasks that are part of an already funded Catalyst proposal.\r\nThe proposal would benefit from breaking the budget down further, why are we paying each member $900, to write guidelines, for specific training, management of proposals ? Overall $2700 ($900 x 3) to develop a proposal system that is based on the project Catalyst system, seems steep and is likely to deter voters.

As you said under the heading - Defining success - 'We hope to design new ways to collaborate together.' If you can find a way to break down big proposals into microtasks, you have succeeded indeed. Maybe you should collaborate with Project Catalyst to assist with the voting and funding of microtasks. Keep up the good work and keep refining this idea.
