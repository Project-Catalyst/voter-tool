This doesn't seem to be a problem for most developers, and is not something that is specific to Cardano. As a developer, I am finding it difficult to understand what utility this approach affords over the regular workflow of using git and submodules for my own projects, and pushing change requests to contribute to open source projects. The discoverability of useful Cardano-related libraries as well as documentation of what problem that library solves and examples of how to use it would be very helpful, but I am not sure if that is what is being proposed here.", "rating": 1, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "In theory the usefulness of such a library to the subset of the JavaScript developers working on Cardano could result in improvements to their experience and effectiveness.
