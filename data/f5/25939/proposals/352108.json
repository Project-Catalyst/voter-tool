The writing is easy to follow and understand. Only one thing I would like to see is an experimental stage of the system when these 2 games are online, especially my concerns are on the security side of these 'Currency Servers'- from what I understand these kind of servers exist and you are familiar with these concepts, but it is unclear to me if you are fully qualified to create and manage these by yourself. As mentioned, the roadmap is extensive but there is no sandbox period to test the security of the system. I would like to see more documentation on these concepts. Also one more thing is not fully clear to me, this in game currency, how will it be denominated? I think this must be defind clearly before even making an API. And if it is in most likely event pegged to a Fiat currency then this needs more regulative understanding and clearence. In general, my two concerns are for non-blockchain server security and in-game currency implementation (concepts, issuance, governance).
