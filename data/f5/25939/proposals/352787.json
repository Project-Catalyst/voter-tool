The team has provided enough information on background, plans and pricing to build confidence that it would address the challenge and would be of great benefit to the community, especially given how CNFTs have grown. However, it didn't receive a 5-star rating as the proposal does not provide insight on what happens after six months when the funds requested is obviously spent. How does this tie in with Cardano releases and what if there are delays in the Mainnet releases? It might be beneficial if 'what-if' scenarios are added to the proposal seeing as though this is a short-term solution. Points given for presenting server solutions spread across the globe however, the pricing presented is from a single source (currently the provider being used by the proposers themselves). There may be benefits to Catalyst if the lowest possible price is presented and/or costing from other providers for comparison with pros and cons. This would be in case an extension past six months is required by the team and any additional cost to further provide the service past six months is required.
