I'm kind of at a loss for words, because it is a research project to determine how we can create interoperable NFTs that work across ecosystems, or blockchains.  It is clearly a developer centric issue as it involves coding to different standards currently and interoperability of those developer standards.  I submit this is clearly a dev ecosystem issue.  Beyond that, if you even think it is simply use cases, then even that becomes a developer eco system issue as developers build tech to solve use cases.  In this use case we are seeking to make NFTs work acros eco systems.
