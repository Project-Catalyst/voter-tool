This proposal aims to provide a Flutter SDK specifically for wallet operations.\r\nFlutter is a new platform allowing developers to maintain only one code base for iOS and Android mobile devices, it also supports web and desktop deployment of the same base code... Flutter is still young (just a few years) as a platform but is backed by Google.\r\nMaking a Flutter SDK is very important as it will make Cardano an option for literally tens of thousands of developers on just all the existing consumer platforms.\r\nFlutters will streamline mobile development for every mobile devices on the planet lowering the maintenance cost. Although the proposal depicted is a long term project and only sets the bases it is a very important one.\r\n\r\nWithout SDK, each developer needs to reinvent the wheel in order to solve common problems instead of focusing on their real project.\r\n\r\nA quality SDK ensures reliability for all the application depending on it and rapid development. The availability of an SDK is many times what will make the difference when choosing a platform to develop on. Since there are many other blockchain projects competing with Cardano, the more SDKs there are the better.\r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The stated experience is very convincing and I am very happy that Blockfrost is mentioned in the proposal.
