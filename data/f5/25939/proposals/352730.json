Targeted developing of blockchain applications (which is complex considering cardano uses two programming languages, two layers. peer-to-peer functionalities etc. I don't think it would be very money efficient to write a game that would probably take a lot more money to build than what is in the budget and would also produce a lot of non-functional code rather than producing tools that simplify developing for developers with different levels of experience.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The goal of the challenge is to incentivize developers to build on top of Cardano.

The concept is an interesting one however details execution are missing. A budget of $100000 is a lot considering the challenge is $600000.

Building such a wide technology demands several aspects, which are not exposed here. The author also includes an expectation of results by project time, measured in months.
