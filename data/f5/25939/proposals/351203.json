I don't think Cardano is mature enough at this point  to attract that kind of interest. Developing such a platform could help developers in the future, though, so I do see some value.  However the proposal is too ambitious and costly at this stage, in my opinion. A proposal with more modest costs  would be better matched to the expected immediate impact.  In fact, the goals for success are only numbers of listings or sales on the platform. Since the platform already exists, it seems like a small marketing team could achieve these goals without investing in an office etc. Once Cardano is more developed, this industry-friendly appearance will be more important, but that could come in later funding rounds.
