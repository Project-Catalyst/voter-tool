Creating financial incentives for comments and reading inserts vulnerabilities where people can exploit the system through fake accounts or bots. There is no mention of this problem or how to mitigate it. There is also mention of a voting app, but voting for what? Proposals? We already have a voting app for Catalyst proposals and soon this will be done by official portfolios, so what is the purpose of a voting app? There is mention of allowing video conferences in the app, but how does this relate to the challenge?\r\n\r\nI recommend clarifying the points mentioned above and that the proposer follow the Catalyst documentation to write the proposal, addressing the points.\r\n\r\nFinally, the proposer completed the self assessment checklist, but clearly the proposal lacks details.", "rating": 1, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The assessed budget is not at all enough to develop an app and a new crypto token.
