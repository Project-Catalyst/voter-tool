This is a great idea and an impressive and thorough proposal. We need more entry level introductions to Catalyst and this format is concise and informative. The only reason I am not going with 5 starts here is because the topics quickly stray away from Catalyst. I am personally very interested in all 10 of these topics, but the goal here is to onboard new people into Catalyst.  ", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 9, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem and solution description is clear and reasonable. I see this proposal as a tutorial created specifically for this challenge, through a series of 10 videos that will introduce people to Catalyst and how to participate.\r\n\r\nAlthough some videos have a theme unrelated to Catalyst (Nodes / Staking, tokens, NFTs, smart contracts and roadmap) I believe that this material can help many people with little or no knowledge in blockchain as an introduction to the deeper Catalyst videos of the series , related to the creation of proposals, voting and roles of several members within Catalyst.\r\n\r\nThis is a tutorial that can be consumed by novices in the blockchain space or by people with prior knowledge who only need to understand the specific parts of Catalyst and this shows that it has the potential to impact the challenge.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 10, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "Project catalyst will be the driver of Cardano and is the driver of innovation using Cardano.

It is known that the crypto world is not intuitive nor easy to understand to the public. It mixes several themes that are not often well grounded to the people such as concepts of economy and computational technology.\r\nThe idea to create a not long series of easy-to-understand videos that creates a solid ground to the people at least start to walk by their selves is great.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it would be more productive if we could add some base knowledge into the first video. Assuming that the people that are seeking this kind of content do not know this world, as stated, then we want them to first understand what being into this world mean. Thus, we must introduce the concept of decentralization and why it's a good way to embrace it in the world as it is today and as it'll be tomorrow, introduce the concept of DeFi (because money is a great incentive), the concept of validation and the difference between PoW and PoS associating them with the environmental problem (always bringing the content to the real world).\r\nAfter these little introductions and explanations, and just then, enter with the second theme video (What is Cardano and Project Catalyst). At this point, you've introduced the major and simpler concepts that makes the eyes bright when we think about the future of technology, world and practicality.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think this may be a good approach is because the best way to attract someone without knowledge of the subject is to create an idea of profitability, not only due to money, but also due to practicality, sustainability, trustless actions, etc.\r\n\r\nI really enjoy the adding of surveys as an attempt to try to measure the conversion of viewers to new participants to the Catalyst Project, and the understanding of the need to hire a professional to make these calculations and compose the data needed to know if the series is really giving result. \r\n\r\nSince it will use YT platform to promote the series, depending on how the proposer use the platform, it's very scalable to the general public, and if the series is well constructed, it will reach a vast public.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 9, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "What is the acronym KEWW?
