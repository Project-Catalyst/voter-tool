When we talk about a website simplifying the information it means that we are reaching people which are already interest to this project and want to participate already \u2013 because we can assume that they're allocating part of their time to read and understand and finally reaching the platform. However, to be fair, they're already a bit interested \u2013 and of course if they find a platform supplying with good information and intuitive navigation it'll help to aggregate them in the Project. But maybe if this platform includes more general information and educational (in a easy way) contents (starting from the beginning \u2013 decentralization, crypto potential, crypto intention, difference between the ecosystems, etc) and then present the Cardano and the Catalyst Project, I think it would have a greater strength to aggregate not only the people who are already looking and already know about it, but it could get newcomers into this world. \r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 5, "no_vca": 7, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "simplification of calendar and resources would be useful, though it may not directly affect the fund goal.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "I believe the idea is very good, we really need a centralized website to gather most of the information around Catalyst.

I recommend including links so that the community has access to more information about Jakob and Ben, so that the community can check their qualifications transparently. Recalling that the team has a proposal in this same challenge that deals with the creation of a webpage with details about the teams, so the members themselves are well aware of the importance of having details of the proposers and even so they forgot to include this information. It is important to note that the project is already under development and the team is already adding information about the updates, which shows commitment.\r\n\r\nThere is a confusing aspect to the plan, the creation of a calendar, information and documentation will require constant updating and the budget describes funding for only 3 weeks of work. How will be the update of this information? This is not clear. There is a mention that in the long run more information will be added, but would that involve more funding?\r\n\r\nThe point is that to understand the feasibility of the budget, there must be clear deliverables, if the budget is only intended to create a calendar and aggregate information (something that is subjective and unclear in the proposal description) I believe that budget is unreasonable and above what is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is not possible to be sure because the deliverables are not clear and there is no clarity as to whether the updates are included in the budget.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "Although creating a web platform is not the hardest thing, what came to my attention is that only one participant gave its linkedin reference.
