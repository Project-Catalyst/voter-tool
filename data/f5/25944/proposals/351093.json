I agree that teaching in a didactic way the pillars of the Catalyst ecosystem, such as what is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies and etc., is the best way to involve people and inspire them to join the community.

He would need people dedicated exclusively to feeding and maintaining the relevant profile, graphic design, for example, would be indispensable in the correct elaboration of the posts. The second point is how exactly the investment money would be allocated, what equipment the author intends to buy, how he will use it, what kind of professionals he intends to hire to form his team and with what functions they will work.
