At best they would have to use a text translator and in this case the purpose of this proposal is lost, because if we are counting on people to use text translators there is no sense that advisors need to read proposals translated manually.\r\n\r\nAlthough these factors that I mentioned above are not decisive for voters and proposers, they reduce the impact of the proposal on value onboarding impact.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "The idea of ALDEA Catalyst is to help, support and encourage meaningful collaboration in Project Catalyst from the Latin American Community. We understand that voters will still have to deal with an English voting app and, while at the moment we can't do much about it, it doesn't mean ALDEA won't try to guide and help these voters so they can have a better understanding of the process. On the other hand, we never mentioned that Proposers will submit their proposals in Spanish: we talked about them receiving language support to submit their proposals in English, as the process right now is working that way. Finally, we believe that this assessment is unfair since it is attributing flaws of Project Catalyst to our Proposal, not only with the Voting App statement but also when it says: \"Community Advisors are currently unable to participate without understanding some English, as there are no mechanisms that allow assessments in other languages. At best they would have to use a text translator and in this case the purpose of this proposal is lost, because if we are counting on people to use text translators there is no sense that advisors need to read proposals translated manually.\" This is exactly what we would like to address and fix with our Proposal, rather than something we are causing to be this way.", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Translation of proposals and other documents into different languages, especially Spanish, is crucial for the future of Project Catalyst and therefore Cardano.

From the development point of view there are indications that the team is able to execute the proposal. It is unclear who will perform the translation or the team's ability to translate. My point is:\r\n\r\nWill this be a professional translation? I don't see the need for a professional translation, as the focus is on transmitting the content, but about 80% of the proposal's budget will be used for the translation of proposals, and it should be noted that, using an extension in the browser, a user can achieve practically the same quality of translation and will probably achieve the same understanding.\r\n\r\nIf we are thinking about translation quality it may be that an automatic translator is not perfect, but if the aim is a professional translation it would be important to describe the team's experience in translation.\r\n\r\nTranslation costs are inconclusive, as the definition of translation cost was established in cost per hour and not cost per word, without a definition of proposals to be translated or payment to be made per translated word, the auditability became hard to measure.\r\n\r\nThere is a justified concern with the translation of Catalyst material to expand the reach in communities that speak other languages \u200b\u200b/ do not understand English, however it is necessary to reflect on the feasibility of translating proposals, as this would generate a great additional cost and would end up maintaining the community in silos, since for people who speak different languages \u200b\u200bthey need to interact at some point and this proposal doesn't solve this problem.\r\n\r\nSome risks that I think are important to mention:\r\n\r\nThere is mention that only part of the proposals will be translated, I think it is important to define this more clearly, as this makes the translation process arbitrary, it can be any number.
