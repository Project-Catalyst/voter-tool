But I do think your problem / solution statement could do with some refinement.  To play devil's advocate:\r\n\r\nProblem Statement:\r\n- Does it really address the campaign brief, given that the campaign brief seems to be emphasize more participation from existing community members, rather than funneling in new ones?\r\n\r\n Campaign scope aside, do you think this is actually a problem right now?  I thought Catalyst is currently the largest decentralized innovation fund in the world-- so relatively speaking, it may not necessarily be the most urgent problem, but please clarify why you think this is a problem.\r\n \r\nSolution Statement:\r\n\r\n - Will the platforms you suggest contain the sort of audience that will be valuable with respect to submitting proposals to Catalyst?  Will the participation be meaningful?  If so, why?\r\n\r\n - How will this increase 'efficiency', as you suggest?\r\n\r\n - It seems like cryptotexty is very Ukraine-centric, despite English translations being available.  I am not saying this is a bad thing, and I think it only helps to increase promotional efforts in all regions; but given Cardano's initial emphasis on Africa, and the limited funds available, why do you think it is valuable to concentrate promotional efforts in Ukraine (if my premise is correct)?\r\n", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem description doesn't describe a problem, I recommend modifying it to clarify the purpose of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe concept/plan is within the scope of the challenge, as it deals with the creation of articles related to Catalyst and the dissemination of material on different platforms.

Although, the cost per article is a bit misleading in my opinion, it should not account for number of platforms, by only for different articles. Let's say the same article was published in 240 platforms. It would have the same cost per article per platform, but the amount of information out there would be the same. Most people might find this information from googling instead of looking at specific platforms. In this way, the cost per article is $375, which is quite high. The proposer mentions it could very well do 30 articles, which would bring the cost down to $200 per article, which is better.
