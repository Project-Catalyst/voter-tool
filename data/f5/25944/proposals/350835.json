This is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe plan does not require complexity, it comes down to translating, subtitling and dubbing Charles Hoskinson's videos. The hourly budget is 260 USD. Dubbing costs vary widely according to several factors, but the established value is within the acceptable range. Dubbing costs are much higher than translation and subtitling.\r\n\r\nCharles has dozens of hours of recorded video and in most of the videos there are AMAs, which often deal with random subjects and not related to Cardano, in addition to a small part of the videos is related to Catalyst.
