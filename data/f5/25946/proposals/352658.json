There will probably be a overlap when part of Catalyst will be decentralized and another part would be the way it is today. The expectations should be aligned with IOG development plan.

From what I can see Catalyst is fairly decentralized, even though, it is, so far, very limited to the English 'speaking' population. This is not centralization, it is not an insurmountable difficulty for many,  but it definitively restricts the reach of Cardano. It is necessary that the proponent elaborate better (more clearly, more descriptively, providing verifiable examples) what is the problem that they see, for others to be able to propose effective solutions to those problems.

From a personal point of view every experience may be perceived as unique, at the same time if we are generous, we might say that 'all human life experiences' in the end are the same. The goal of the project seems laudable, nevertheless, for it to be feasible and verifiable, it is necessary that it is less ambiguous and open to interpretation, so that we can agree, what needs to be done? and when we have achieved it. Other examples of this lack of precision would be: \"measure number of custom catalyst experiences\", and \"quality of engagement\" (what does it mean that the experience is customed? and how do we measure in a standardized way \"quality of engagement\"? With respect and appreciation for the effort and the intention of the proponent, I believe that the prevalence of this lack of definition demonstrates the underdevelopment of the proposal and sufficiently questions its feasibility.

In this section I will try to signal how the proposal may be improved, focusing on the information provided specifically for the item on Verifiability. The proposal reads: \"measure number of custom catalyst experiences, quality of engagement during proposal iteration and during voting, etc\" 1. In this item etc. is not adequate. It is necessary to list specifically, the items the proponent believes need to be verified. The proponent could be right or wrong. There could be more items and people could identify more and better items, but it is necessary that the proponent does and shows their effort. It is necessary that the proponent reports their best work, for it to be improved by the community. Without their work, there is not much to build on. 2) It is important to define what a \"custom experience\" is in a manner that can be shared and therefore verified by many. There does not need to be a unique perfect definition but there needs to be a minimal definition that we can discuss and agree around. Furthermore, it is necessary that we can identify specific qualities of that definition that we can verify. This is the goal of this criteria. For example, you could say there will be experiences in the seven major world languages (or Cardano languages, English, Vietnamese, etc...), and you could say this would be measured by the number of catalysts web pages translated into those languages. From there you could go into as much detail as you believe is necessary. 3) Lastly, it is necessary to provide an idea of how to measure \"quality of engagement\". This is not easy and there probably is a lot of disagreement. But, if this is going to determine the verifiability of the project it is necessary to provide a definition and characteristics that we can agree on and verify. Furthermore, notice that this is required for different stages of the Catalysts process and therefore, I believe it could be expected that the definition and characteristics to verify \"quality of engagement\" across these different stages will need to be defined for each of those Catalyst stages.
