In the very short space of the proposal and the attachments provided, the author has clearly made me believe that the proposal is feasible, nevertheless, they could have done (or could do in the future) a better job at demonstrating that the experience to successfully execute this project exists out there in the world and that they have enough mastery of it to channel it for the particular case of Cardano. To greatly increase the potential for success of the proposal I would suggest two things. 1) That the proposal is focused on piloting a relatively small, well-known, and well-supported (regarding infrastructure) region. And, 2) That instead of creating Hubs 'de Novo' (new, from scratch, etc.), the proposal focuses on refurbishing existing hubs as Carnano Hubs. For the first point, I suggest the authors take an area they know well and propose to build the ten hubs there as a demonstration (this could be in a province in India, a city in Africa, or a small natural region in Latin America). It should be a region where there is electricity, internet, a minimal tradition of computers' use, stable government, etc. For the second point, I suggest that in such a region they can find existing institutions that can be transformed into Cardano Hubs, for example, a public school or a private school, a public library. In Latin America, we have places like cultural centers that function as meeting and teaching places, like Volkhochschule in Germany, places for continuous education. An even better example would be internet services (cafe internet) these are private places where the owner lends computers to the public for hours, to do government tasks (registers), homework, research or play video games. A place like this already has a technical and social infrastructure that can be harnessed for a Cardano Hub at a gain for the owner, the community, and Cardano.

It would be very important to adequately consider the involvement of social scientists to carefully and objectivelly document the last point. Finally, as mentioned in the previous point, documenting well the project would be a major requirement and that requires the involvement of someone versatile in communications (blogging, vlogging, video documentary, podcasting).
