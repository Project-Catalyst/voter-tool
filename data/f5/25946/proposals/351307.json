II am not sure how useful this would be until the Cardano ecosystem is more extensively developed however, and there are other industry commentators and information providers who are already seeking to help people navigate the crypto asset world more generally. It may be that a holistic view of the whole digital asset world ends up being more useful to people in the end. For example Google is a type agnostic search engine and universality is the direction such navigation systems tend to head in.
