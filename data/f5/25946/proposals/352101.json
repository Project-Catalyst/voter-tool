I am uncertain of the level of auditing currently being performed and whether IOHK publishes their data and findings, but I trust that it is being done correctly. Secondly, whilst I agree with the most of the details presented here on how and what to look for in validating quality of projects, keeping to standards & ROI, I find it hard to accept that this is better served & performed decentrally as opposed to a more central/appointed/annointed committee or company or a group of people who can maintain the sets of standards to measure. We as Cardano would do ourselves a disservice knowing our blockchain is peer-reviewed and rigorously wrung through academics and experts to then have to rely on a decentralised approach to validate the projects that are tacked on to Cardano and funded by Catalyst, by relatively unknown parties. At least now with IOG being in charge of auditing, there is comfort knowing its being done to a certain standard and one we can trust.
