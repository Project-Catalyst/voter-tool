There is still centralization in some aspects, but a concept that allows a more decentralized and fair model of price discovery (odds)\r\n\r\nLetting a person set their own odds is a poor design choice and not user friendly, as it does not allow liquidity. it's like placing a sales order on an order book exchange and waiting for someone to fill that order.\r\n\r\nSellers want to charge a value above the ideal and buyers want to pay for a value below the ideal, how to make the odds of the bets approach and make the proposal viable?\r\n\r\nBookmakers resemble market makers and in the context of supply and demand design they reduce spreads and make the service viable.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that the proposer better describe how this proposal will scale and how it will generate liquidity so that the bets are combined.\r\n\r\nThe proposal has a serious dependence on a centralized oracle and this makes room for corruption and liveliness.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough information to judge the feasibility of the budget, as the proposal does not describe enough details to understand the work required to develop the project.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "The concept and experience appears valid but the proposal lacks sufficient information to really shine.
