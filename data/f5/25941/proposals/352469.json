I think that the idea of investing in farms/farmers needs to be facilitated - but there are also important risks that need to be addressed. Probably for all sides. \r\nHence we come to the proposal. I think the proposal does focus on the technical side of using smart contracts and building a website platform - however, the success or failure of such an initiative will not be measured only by technical factors. \r\nThe proposal in the current state seems like a rough draft, more a conceptual contribution - although it does identify a problem which needs to be solved. The impact of the proposed platform and the DApp will be measured by its ultimate success in resolving a longstanding problem - hence the devil will be in the details of the relationship between farmers and citizen investors, in their communication, expectations, deliverables, progress measurement, addressing issues of production volumes/quality, insurance, force majeure, market disruptions. \r\nThere are many things that can go wrong in agriculture and a platform in which citizens can invest in farmers will have to take many things into account if it is to be effective. Building a platform by itself will not guarrantee success. The campaign brief states that \"Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano\". The idea does have quality, but what I would like to see more is the devilish detail that would indicate that the proposal will deliver solutions to difficult problems - that would put the \"Quality\" in the proposal and in the proposed DApp and platform and smart contracts. \r\n\r\n", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea seems to be good and the intention as well.

All these aspects related to ensuring that  average citizens can invest in farmers, protected by smart contracts will need to be audited, not only delivering the code or creating tokens. \r\nThere are legal issues/considerations, market considerations, price variability considerations, risks and threats inherent to farming systems - not sure if all of these are being and how are they being addressed with the proposed solution.
