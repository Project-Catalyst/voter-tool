So Artists are still grey...their value is as undefined content, as beneficiaries and not as drivers of the innovation. Artist's have local relationships to their community and  unique world views. It may be important to bring ortists onto the team, in the creation of the mechanism, which then may create from the artist up, rather than from the mechanism down, to the artist. Artists often create from unique disjunctures in cultures. These \"breaks\" in language create unique semantic structures.
