Furthermore, it states that it is secure, private, censorship-resistant and free. I like that. I've personally been searching for an open-source no-free, self-hosted, no-intermediary cryptocurrency payment processor and having one that integrates ADA would be excellent for the ecosystem, in my view. I know that it is not an easy thing to find - and having ADA included would be a boon. I think that the proposer has identified a clear case of an integration that merits attention and that will benefit the Cardano ecosystem. The proposed project to add Cardano support to BTCPay Server is something that would collectively advance the use of ADA & help to promote adoption. Effectively, I think the proposed project hits the nail on the head in terms of - increasing both utility & adoption of Cardano. I think that - if executed succesfully - the proposal would add value and more options to the Cardano ecosystem and its users and stakeholders.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "I give a 1 for impact because, while it is an interesting idea, the proposal does not indicate a timeline so I cannot know whether the proposal will bring value to Cardano users in 2021.

The data nowadays is that a very low percentage of BTC, e.g., is actually used to buy goods, since the currency is in its young stages \u2013 it is still growing in value and gaining maturity to actually become a tradable. Therefore, I think that in these few years to come by this won't be of much value.\r\nOther than that, I would be useful to find some key metrics to analyze.\r\n", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "How big is the BTCpay market?

I think this is a clear advantage for the proposer. \r\nThe IOHK website still hosts a webpage with information, confirming that he worked there:\r\nhttps://iohk.io/en/team/rob-cohen\r\nIt states that \"Rob joined IOHK after completing one of the company's Haskell courses in 2018.... He previously served in the military ... bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from Columbia  ... .bachelor's in economics and political science from Brown University.... Studying part-time at Georgia Tech to earn his master's degree in computer science...\r\nSo the relevant skill and experience seem to be in place. \r\nAlthough the proposal does not break down the budget into components (a potential weakness as the Community Advisor Assessment Guide asks that the budget be outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items). Fortunately, the proposer did respond to a comment about the budget and stated that he would be required to pay 25-30% of this amount in taxes plus some funds would be used for overhead for a web presence and ensuring that legal precautions are taken. So, we have some budget breakdown provided - although not a full one. Also the unspecified funds for overhead and legal precautions - should be quantified. \r\nAs regards future maintenance costs, the proposer does consider that (also in the comments) - and he maintains that if the API changes and ongoing development will be needed to support multi-assets - \"a startup could be formed that would make this service hosted\"... \r\nI didn't see a proposed timetable to complete the work. The proposal  would have been stronger if it included information on the timetable with clear milestones linked to time. \r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "I give a 1 for feasibility because there is almost no detail for the work that needs to be completed.
