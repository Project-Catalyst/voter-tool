In this way, the 3 groups would benefit, the fans, who in addition to directly helping the artists, can, as it says in the proposal, participate in decisions about the works. About this, I thought it was positive, but it is also a little problematic in the question of: would the artist be shaped by the public then? Artistic freedom would be a little compromised if these decisions are considered inflexible, but I believe that these details can be improved). The artists would benefit, and the Cardano community as well, since the app would use tokens and smart contracts to work. In other words, it would be an app that would add value to our community and have a good cultural return.\r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a very creative idea and a good application of the blockchain technology.

It would be interesting to add more details about each stage. For example, in the ninth month a marketing campaign would be carried out. But how, exactly? It would be through social networks, how would this project reach people? Because there is something similar already, like patreon on youtube. This new way of supporting artists needs to be well publicized, so that the public understands its advantages, not least because many people are still unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and intellectual contracts.
