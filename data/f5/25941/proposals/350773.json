In the absence of any blockchain-based password system (that I know of), this solution leverages the functionalities of Cardano in a novel way. There are numerous password applications currently on the market, all providing sustainable business models. This proposal does that with the added benefit of no 3rd party servers being involved (except for the authenticator) and more importantly provides an education pathway for users unaware of Cardano.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 5, "no_vca": 8, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea of password manager in the blockchain will assist in users being able to manage their accounts and in the same light control their data.

Password managers are certainly an application that more and more of us use on a daily basis, taking advantage of blockchain infrastructure to improve the technology and potentially expose the strengths of decentralisation and Cardano in the process is bound to have a large impact.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "Based on the addressed comments, self-identifying credentials, and GitHub profile, the proposer is very capable in implementing the proposal successfully.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 5, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "Given the proposers background and the GitHub information provided, there's a high likelihood the solution can be implemented.

The only thing I'm concerned about with this project is, something mentioned in one of the comments, the fact that you have to pay a fee each time the data is stored on the blockchain. Even at current rates of transaction fees, if someone has a really large number of logins that are constantly updated or if someone is constantly creating new ones, it could end up being prohibitively expensive.
