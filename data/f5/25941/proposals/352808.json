This proposal could be improved by explaining the complexity of the distribution mechanism so the challenge will appear blatant and the solution proposed is a good one. A secondary challenge is also presented in terms of newbie on-boarding and while this is a valid issue, the proposal may well benefit greatly if this was instead presented as an added advantage of the product rather than a prominent problem its aiming to solve. There are numerous staking tutorials produced by the community in graphic and video forms and both Yoroi and Daedalus have been improved to be user-friendly that a   2nd-grader can actually already follow instructions as is.
