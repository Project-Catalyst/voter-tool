The proposal specifically wants to increase participation in the delegation process by simplifying the decision making and tracking involved in delegation. The tools outlined could be attractive to new delegators and increase participation in the proof of stake mechanism.  But to really meet the challenge the proposal should focus on how  to attract first-time delegators.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer identifies several good ideas to provide utility for Cardano users and fits the challenge parameters. The solution statement given is very generic, but the services provided by the proposed platform are better explained further along in the proposal. However, since so many services are being proposed, there isin't very much information given about any one of them in particular and which problems they solve. It's my opinion that the proposal might be better served by focusing on a single service instead of an entire platform.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal has a good impact to make it easier for newcomers to stake their ADA as the system is currently designed. Although, I believe that other solutions, like intermediary solutions (without compromising security and ownership) or even improvements in the staking system itself, might solve the problems described in the problem statement in this proposal in the medium/long term. Although, this might be a good temporary solution until something directly related to the staking system changes.

No information is given on how onboarding participants would be achieved or how much participation would be required to make the project a success.
