In this regard, I think this proposal is very relevant for the Catalyst project overall. This proposal presents a quality dApp which have the potential to increase the utility and adoption of Cardano substantially if implemented well. The proposal ends with plans of scaling the platform into nearby related areas. This should not be too big of a challenge once it's implemented initially. In terms of impact, I agree that this proposal is strong.

A DApp that allows users to track their blood donations and inform what is being done with it provides with both a foundation of trust and a sense of wellbeing for doing something good like, for example, saving the life of someone who's had a motor accident. This alone is already a huge incentive out of a humanitarian perspective. Tokenising it for light utility bills just adds to the value and by doing this without pure cash payouts would avoid 'overfarming' of donors for financial benefit.

To gain the trust of the community you should try to back up these claim, otherwise it is very easy to question the feasibility of this project. \r\nYou ask for 35.000 dollars worth of funding which is 14% of this campaigns funds, yet there is not a single section that outlines the projects budget. I would like to have an elaborated and detailed budget in the proposal, this would give me confidence to support this proposal as a voter in the future. This proposal also lacks a timetable with milestones, as of now, it is hard to understand the scope of the project since no course of action is provided. \r\nHow do you go about to make RedToken a utility token that can be used locally? Do you have any prior contacts or agreements to make this a reality or is this a problem that needs to be solved?\r\nThis proposal needs to be revisited with the above mentioned points in mind, for now, I will rate this proposal a (2) in terms of feasibility.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team are planning to collaborate with established entities like WADA, ABCD, Gimbalabs and others, which creates confidence in their competence.
