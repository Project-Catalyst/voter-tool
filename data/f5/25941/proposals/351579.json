Both parties face a level of mistrust that is currently mitigated by 'time cards' and 'pay stubs' which for many employers can take days, and the administration cost for these is significant. For my small business pay roll processing with ADP costs $100's of dollars a month, and isn't 100% trusted. This would simplify that process and build trusting using escrow - something that is currently too expensive on the admin side to pull off.
