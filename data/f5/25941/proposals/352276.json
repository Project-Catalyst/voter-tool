As a CA I can't see the future of proposals in terms of implementation (I can just give my opinion based on presented information), but I know when I see a well prepared proposal. To be clear I mean a proposal that meets the requirements of the challenge and which has a clear pathway to attract new users to the platform. Furthermore, this proposal is heavily leveraging the advantages  of the Cardano ecosystem by proposing the usage of key Cardano advantages - easy NFT minting,  fractional ownership token minting contract (with Alonzo), a new decentralized protocol built on Cardano (Mosaic), etc.. I can see a new problem (full ownership of NFTs) that was identified and a clear and well-presented solution (fractional NFTs). Implementation of the solution - if successful - would attract new users to the platform, both investors and artists and ... fractional owners.
