I like idea it seems both simple and complex at the same time and it does seem novel. The proposed DubToken & digital marketplace that re linked to livestream content - effectively expands the NFT paradigma to include many more types of artists - or even wider - broadcasters in fact. The integration with YouTube and Twitch offers many possibilities.  It might have been good to envisage a partnership even with famous non-artist Youtubers from the Cardano ecosystem that would help to popularize the concept - but that doesn't detract from the value of the idea.

I do not see a rationale has been provided for allocating USD25,000 of funding to the 4 selected artists - instead of USD2,500 to 10 artists or USD50,000 to two artists (for example). \r\nThe specific use of the requested USD 80000 is also not provided in detail, but for a project of this scope - a breakdown of the budget and costs is needed in my view. \r\nI would have liked to see more word about the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation of this specific project - not just latency, but also from the point of view of users and artists.

The success metrics do not include parameters about the quality of the proposed solution and the user-friendliness of the entire experience. I think that those parameters are key to successful adoption of a project like this that has many integrations and moving pieces. So, the fullness of this proposal cannot be measured solely on technical merit - it aslo includes that issue of whether it has covered all the bases - meaning that it will lead to success when built. \r\nI have not been convinced that supporting four artists with 25000 of funding is the right way to proceed - although it is part of the offered solution. Maybe more possible paths to adoption could have been explored in the solution. The proposed metrics seem to be relatively underwhelming. \r\nDiversity of  artists by end of alpha period does not seem to be an important factor in my view, as it is not a true measure of success - when 4 artists are involved. The limited beta is anyway out of the scope of the F5 proposal. The weekly active platform-integrated users - demonstrating broad adoption - is a metric, but what will represent succcess is not clear from the proposal. Also the number of monthly private-stream events will be a number that can be clocked, but what is success? A trend? A finite number? The proposer hasn't quantified success, so almost anything might qualify as success in a sense. \r\nEssentially, I would have liked to see a much better and detailed consideration of success for this proposal that is not purely technical in nature.
