As the primary question of the challenge is \"What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2021\", I deduct one star. It feels like there are already a high number of NFT marketplaces out there. Another NFT marketplace would provide limited value to end users. Another star was reduced, because the current propsal is not about an app. It is about the creation of a website to promote the final product and digitalizing art and minting of 50 tokens. This does not provide any special value to the end-user.
