In this way, the use of tokens can be innovative and bring new uses to the cardan community. As it is a new activity, I believe that the process of implementing this practice is a long way, but it is beneficial for the author to have an example to start with. In fact, according to what has been said, this project already has investors from outside the Cardano system, but the author finds it more beneficial if the idea is made within our community. Because we already have an investment, we have more security in relation to the value of the project. The only thing that was still a bit confusing to me is how this project fits the challenge of the apps, I didn't understand where these tokens would be generated, what would be the chosen platform and so on.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Standardization of Native Token to represent a physical assert will provide a template and enable easier app creation in the future.

It is also clear how there is an intention to form a team, because a project as comprehensive as this needs more people involved, different types of professionals and so on.

In this way, we can have a very clear, objective and chronological view of what is to come. There is also a total estimate of time (2 months), which I believe encompasses all the actions listed numerically. However, it would also be interesting to determine a sense of how long each would take. The author says that the 10k requests for funding is an estimate. It would be safer if we knew how that money would be shared between the parties, from the shares and the participating professionals. Another positive point is that some success metrics are established; the author also claims that there will be feedback to the community, in the form of different media (from what I understand), something that I found very interesting, I did not see many proposals concerned with this part of the project. In this way, I believe that the applicability of the project is well structured, with only a few points missing to make it ideal.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "The details are in the open domain, and the project is proposed to be taking the inputs from the community to finalize the standard for a specific use case.
