So instead of presenting it as a problem we need to solve, we should try and advertise it as much as possible. If the idea presented in this solution would be implemented, it would most likely create mixed messaging and even have a negative impact on the adoption of Cardano, possibly driving users away instead of encouraging adoption.

An assessment of the risk of not being integrated into these wallets with a good visibility would help the community to assess the chance of success.

One cannot simply decide to create a tax on the network by the arbitrary will of anyone.\r\n\r\nIn addition, what is the environmental impact of Cardano's pools on the environment? This question needs to be answered before the feasibility and relevance of the proposal is understood.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe energy expenditure to operate pools is extremely lower than the costs with bockchains that use PoW, this is inherent to the consensus protocols derived from PoS in general. The energy expenditure of PoS blockchains is practically negligible in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\nWhere would these taxes be used?\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer describes himself as a graphic designer, yet this project would require a lot of technical knowledge in order to be implemented.
