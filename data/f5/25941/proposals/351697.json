It is great! The idea is massive and its implications.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the idea is great, the proposal has some weaknesses. \r\n\r\nIn effect the idea is great, but a Catalyst proposal is a step up from an idea. The proposal is being assessed here. \r\n\r\nThe proposer does identify a very big global market (and an initial one in Southeast Asia) that the DApp would focus on. I am wondering whether centralized Apps or traceability services exist for this market that this proposed DApp can be compared to? If yes, it would have been good to be able to compare their specific weaknesses and how the proposed DApp would address those issues and provide users with additional value. \r\n\r\nIf these centralized Apps or services do not exist yet, is there a reason why they are not available? \r\n\r\nBuilding a DApp (or application) is just one part of providing any true product traceability - it seems to require integration with a comprehensive traceability system with procedures and guidelines. \r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me whether this is a DApp that is part of a wider proposed system. Or is it a DApp that will also be able to integrate with existing traceability platforms. If a new traceability system is being proposed - I fail to see the details of that system in the proposal. \r\n\r\nA real-time traceable supply chain DApp would be one component- however the proposal would have benefited from fleshing out other aspects - such as strengths, limitations, and risks of the new traceability system or others that it will integrate with. The ultimate success of a decentralized insect related traceability system may not depend only on the DApp itself. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to see other components of the bigger jigsaw addressed as well - in order to assess its full impact and whether it will be able to add value to the Cardano ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that if the proposed traceability system is not up to par as a whole, the DApp might not add value to the Cardano ecosystem. How will compliance be ensured? How will consumers be able to rely on the soundness of information that is accessible via the DApp? How will identity be managed? WIll Atala Prism ( decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain) be used? Etc...\r\n\r\nThe proposer specifies that a full pitch deck and plan outline are available on request. The proposal would have benefited from their inclusion - as without them it is difficult to assess the impact of a DApp alone on such a sector. The DApp is a tool - but the full solution of the proposed traceability system (or integration with other systems) - is key to measure the potential benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe platform may be able to connect consumers, brands, and farmers in real time, removing the need for trust in institutions by transparent verification of the entire process - but the issue of trust among the participants remains. Maybe institutions do not need to be trusted, but how is the new DApp verifying that the information on the blockchain is correct? How are key elements verified (quality, volumes, sourcing, deliveries, etc..)? \r\n", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Great idea, however there is no implementation plan", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Seems like a valid use case for this challenge and therefore addresses the challenge.

We are informed of the first steps, up to 5 months of action, of what would happen. However, in a very superficial way ... I felt it speaks of a more detailed, more complete action plan, that would guide the action beyond the first 5 months.
