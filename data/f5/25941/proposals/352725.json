From what I understand, it is a kind of sponsorship, in which the user would pay to interact with a real animal through transactions in cryptocurrency, on a specific website for that. The idea is good when it comes to innovation and to focus on the use of technology that Cardano develops, and it is certainly a new way of looking at this relationship between people and pets. However, I am not sure if the public will find the proposal interesting and will be open to doing this, I think it is a matter of trying and observing the results. In my view, the proposal has a chance of working very well or being just an attempt that did not get much return, because it is very different from the other activities in this medium. A very important point to be considered is how these animals will be treated. An animal is not a toy, it should not be seen as a source of profit. If, for example, 4 users wish to play with the same rabbit on the same afternoon, that animal will be exhausted. I think it is essential to plan and supervise the treatment and welfare of rabbits very well, so that the project does not become just a source of profit that exploits animals.

They attached a link that talks more about the progress of the project, in other words, I believe they were very precise when it came to planning. In my view, the most problematic point of this project is the question of acceptance and how they will take care of the animals. It is also a little open to question whether the project will need more funding beyond the initial amount that was requested to be able to continue. But as the team determined that the money will be used to build the site, buy food for the animals, etc., I believe that from that initial investment the project would become self-sufficient.
