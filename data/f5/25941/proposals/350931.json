For example, in the budget that is provided, there are 3 engineers - why is 3 the right number? Could it be completed with 2? Why/why not? Also, the \"founder\" position is not described anywhere and I fail to understand what this position is, why it's valued at $76K and how it fits into the overall project design. \r\nFurther things I'd point out under implementation likelihood are:\r\nUnder \"Deliverables for first 4 months\", it states that the partnerships with custodians will be finalized. The proposal could benefit from providing additional information on where/with whom those partnerships currently are, what stage they are at, what challenges may still exist, and what form the final agreement will take. This would help determine the likelihood that implementation would be successful. \r\nMoreover, since the catalyst funding represents only a portion of the overall budget and experience required for the project there is some uncertainty (or at least it's not overly clear) as to how the rest would be funded.
