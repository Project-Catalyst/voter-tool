The PDF also clarifies that the eBook and audiobook would not be the NFT  itself, rather there would be accompanying NFTs of exclusive content for selective works.  In other words - our dapp is essentially a blockchain bookstore where you can buy eBooks and audiobooks with $ADA or a credit card.  You can then showcase your collection and engage with the Burblr Community.  In addition, there would be Box Drops that would contain new eBooks and audiobooks as well as the chance to receive exclusive author content in the form of NFTs.", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal adds a application of NFTs to the Cardano ecosystem that will benefit creators of literature, thus it is a great addition.

What isn't clear is how the media will be linked to the NFT, and if the media will be stored in perpetuity by burblr, hosted on some authenticated server, or even if the user would like to host their own copy on a local machine for offline use. If someone can't verify the checksum of the media themselves and can't store their own copies then that might be a significant speed bump in the plan.
