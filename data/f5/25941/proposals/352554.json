As the proposer himself admits, future Daedalus releases will deploy this very functionality in the official wallets (unsure of Yoroi but I assume there will be a light version too). Had this proposal been presented in Fund1 or Fund2, prior to Mary, its importance would have been higher and the need to address the challenge more immediate. Only a  middle rating was given this challenge because the date when wallet coin-minting functionality has not yet been confirmed and if it is in line with the release of Alonzo, then a 3/4 month wait is not that long. however, as it stands and if it can be delivered in the near future then there is a benefit...hence the middle rating.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem description and solution are reasonable. The proposal presented is within the scope of the challenge. Making the minting process for native assets more user friendly is an important step to increase adoption.

However, the admittance that an official minting functionality will be built in the official wallets almost forces the proposal to list more novel priorities. This proposal would benefit from a listing of the dev pathways for each of the items including a matrix of resources x costing, which breaks down the claimed 200 hours of work required. The timing of the release should also be prominent including what-if scenarios if there is a delay in the official releases or this proposed solution. Fund 5 funds are disbursed on the 26th of June so there should be clear statements about how the timeline of this dev matches with the IOHK minting functionality. When is the 200 hours of work starting? And if it starts after receiving the funds, how does its release align with the official version?
