The proposal says that by later this year 10 studios will be on board to host their content on the application but there are no business development people on the team. There is no evidence that there are connections to studios who would host their content on this application. So the challenge of getting this done in 2021 is just not going to be met. However, they could likely get their platform up and running it just won't have premium content at a level comparable to netflix. I think this app could add a lot of value to cardano users.

It would be useful to address the risks a bit more. In my eyes the biggest challenge is how to convince big studio or production house to join this movement and why they would do so.
