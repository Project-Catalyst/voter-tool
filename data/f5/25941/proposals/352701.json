The creation of such a game addresses the challenge because it could potentially generate transactions and add value to the ecosystem with a new asset built on top of it, which however remains limited to an aspect of pure entertainment.\r\nThe most intriguing part of the idea is related to the fact that the players will be incentivized to trade specific tokens based on categories or real-life events: this mechanism could generate attention on particular NTFs and could keep interest in the game alive: it would be really great to expand this concept and present it in more depth (e.g. by already presenting a detailed incentive mechanism for rarer cards or ADA), in order to have a greater impact on the challenge.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "I commend the desire to encourage less technical people into the Cardano ecosystem but I don't feel the proposal currently justifies why this needs to be a blockchain project.

In the proposal is clearly indicated that the fund requested will not be used for the development of the platform and therefore the technical aspects are not mandatory requirements: at the same time it would have been very useful to have some technical specification of the technology/languages involved for the development of website / apps / smart contracts and the architecture in general that will be used for generating tokens, buying, selling and bidding.\r\nAll these technical aspects, even if external to the funding, would help to have a much clearer idea of \u200b\u200bthe project in general and its feasibility.\r\n", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal needs additional information regarding the team and how the project will grow.
