The challenge is to bring value to users in 2021 but it does not seem feasible for this card to launch in 2021, as the proposer states - it is no easy task to become a card issuer.

Although, I don't see any great advantage of such a system. Since the ADA would be converted into FIAT to pop-up the debit card, the only difference between doing this via this Dapp and using an usual debit card is that it would be done in a single step. I believe it should be considered some way to keep the balance in ADA in the wallet, and also to find aspects to differentiate from other cards, for e.g. cashback. It would be good to check what other solutions already exist. The non-custodial aspect of this current solution already is a good differential.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "Challenge is \"What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2021?\".
