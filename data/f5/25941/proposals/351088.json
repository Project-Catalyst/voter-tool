However, it is important to keep in mind that many social platforms exist even in the centralized world and most of them are worth nothing. The very problem statement might be a problem for me as it specifies that \"most low level users in crypto's first and only experience with crypto is on Coinbase and then nothing after that\". Not sure how big of a problem is that and whether the statement is true at all. Is a general statement and the the proposal is designed to solve that \" problem statement\". Most people's experience with cash is to use it as much as they need and that in my view is not a \"problem\". The problem might be providing more different uses that will make crypto useful, not inventing new ways of engaging consumers in order to \"fool them\" (my words) to use it more. The proposed solution \"creation of a platform that anyone can join, buy crypto and actively transact on the blockchain (maybe without even knowing it)\" seems impossible because of the effective legislation that is in place around crypto. Most crypto exchanges will require cystomers to go through a crypto KYC (Know Your Customer) process before buying and cashing out and just swapping an exchange for a \"world building social platform\" will not exclude this platform from KYC requirements. This issue does not seem to be addressed although the proposal does propose a platform for buying crypto. So I am not sure whether the proposal will be able to result in a novel and viable application that will attract users in real life. So, I would include more information about the restrictions in buying crypto and trading it and how this will be addressed.

There is a lot of information about the social world/platform - but an idea is different from a funding proposal. A successful funding proposal needs to be on the cusp of realization, one step away from full implementation - practically ready-to-go as soon as funding is made available. In this case, I don't see those required elements. The experience listed states: \"I have been developing apps for the last 5 years and have helped scale multiple saas companies to 50k+ mrr.\" My quibble with this listed experience is that anyone can develop apps, what would prove relevant experience is successful apps or a trend of building better and more successful apps. What I am trying to say is that verifiable app building experience is best demonstrated by showing examples. Also it would be great if those multiple saas companies that have been helped to scale to 50k+ mrr were listed by name ... as well as the exact contribution of the proposer.
