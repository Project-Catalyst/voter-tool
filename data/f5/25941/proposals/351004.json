When building an application in which companies can create personalized contracts, get in direct contact with customers, etc., as mentioned by the author, review various business practices, it may be possible to make the situation fairer for everyone. Regarding the impact of the project on the Cardano community, I found it a bit confusing where our group's activities would fit. It would be beneficial if the author clarified these issues better.

There is no budget breakdown.\r\n\r\nThe issue of compliance with regulators and local governments was mentioned, but one of the problems with apps in the gig economy is that their dependence on government regulation creates a weakness related to taxes model, this can make the project's economic model unfeasible, as occurs with Uber in several locations. Jurisdictions where Uber is subject to regulations where there is a considerable increase in tax burdens often cause Uber to simply stop operating in these jurisdictions. In addition, regulation ends up creating a problem with labor ties that may force dapp's creator to bear the costs, which would imply a transfer of costs to users, compromising the supply and demand relationship and putting pressure on dapp's financial viability.. Without a sufficiently decentralized model, this type of project may not be feasible.\r\n\r\nI recommend detailing the proposal with the mentioned points and elaborating a new proposal based on the Catalyst documentation.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "You are doing great work here, but you need a great team to make this proposal succeed.
