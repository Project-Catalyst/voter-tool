The focus of the proposal is to develop a web based tax solution for on chain and staking reward activity. I personally see it as a well-worth integration for a blockchain system that aims to become the \"global financial operating system\" - as the taxation aspects need to be facilitated to end users. \r\nThe proposed tax compliance tool is a a US tax attorney licensed in the state of Florida, with an LL.M Masters in the laws of taxation, which indicates a good understanding of the matter at hand. \r\nGreater transparency and certainty about taxes for US (and other stakeholders) is certainly of value for the Cardano ecosystem. The three project phases seem to be well conceived in general terms and there is already a seemingly working backtobasics site providing a similar service for the Tezos blockchain. \r\nI like the fact that the proposer has thought of long-term sustainability of the project via the sale of access to a private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge to third party users. \r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "A very good solution to a problem we'll all grapple with in years to come. Despite the fact this is very US-centric (and I myself am outside of the jurisdiction), this first step may well open up later developments that can solve similar tax regulation challenges in many other countries. That the proposal mentions 'international' accommodation at a later phase paves the way for further development. Crypto taxes are becoming more sophisticated (Aust included) and where 3 years ago there were no mentions of stake taxes, now it's a recognised aspect of the reporting obligation. I can foresee my own headaches in manually calculating my crypto taxes for 2020-2021 and if this solution can ease the activity somewhat, then it's a very good solution indeed.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This would be useful, though why just focus on Americans?

Additional information specific to the developer requirements would make this proposal more complete.  The proposer also appears to have a development team performing similar work on the Tezos blockchain.  Looking at the proposed scope as written, the funding amount for a developer to perform the work could be reevaluated and/or address the features likely to be created in this proposal", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer does have first-hand knowledge of the tax system and is a US tax attorney licensed in the state of Florida, with a masters degree in taxation law. However, experience with taxation is key - although the software development side is also critical for the proposals success. \r\nI like that he developed a Tezos web-based tool - and it speaks favorably of his abilities. \r\nThe proposer states that this project will require hiring no more than 2 professional freelance software developers. At least 90% of any secured funds will go towards this portion of the project. What is not clear is has the proposer identified the exact competencies of the software developers that he needs and whether he will be able to oversee their work properly and ensure smooth delivery. \r\nAs the project is being proposed by a single proposer, without a developer team in place - or clearly identified (at least in terms of competencies), it remains to be seen whether the proposer can really deliver on the expected first stage results: \"a private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge that is suitable for traditional tax finance reporting purposes\". This is somewhat of a weakeness as the proposal would have benefited from listing the relevant skills and experience of other team members required to implement the proposal. \r\nAlthough the proposer gives a Q1 2022 deadline for finishing the project there is no detailed timetable for the specific stages that would allow an auditor to measure progress, which may be an important ommission. \r\nWhile the proposal states that at least 90% of the secured funds will go towards 2 professional freelance software developers, it is not clear how this calculation has been made and where will the remaining 10% of funds end up. \r\nThe three stages of the proposal ($15,000, $12,000 and $8,000) do not seem to have further cost breakdown so it is difficult to judge how well they are prepared and how realistic they are, especially as the software developers are not part of the team yet. So, are these estimates too high, are they too low, are they just right? How much coding services will be required, how many hours of work, how much will an hour of freelance coding cost? Further details may make this proposal very firm and very tight. In case it is not voted for in Fund 5, it would be good if the proposer were to resubmit it with the additional information - a clearer timetable and better identified team/tasks and costs would make it very very good. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "Academically and by background, the proposer has presented bona fides pertinent to the solution. Grappling with tax law is the hardest component of this project. The proposal indicates familiarity with what is required in able to produce a working solution. Translating these requirements to codeable elements is the main challenge. That said, there is enough background presented here to see the project through. What would be helpful is a breakdown of the milestones by resources and by cost in order to get a sense that the plan is executable and achievable in the timeframe mentioned. As mentioned in the Comments section, 35k is a significant amount to allocate to this very important solution, given the total funds for F5 is limited.

The three individual phases do not have deadlines for completion, which could mean that the proposer either forgot to include them or has not developed a clear timetable for each stage. The proposer did include metrics for measuring the end result (\"a report of the comprehensive tax picture for the user that includes the determination of income from staking ADA, any gain or loss from selling ADA, income from receiving payments in ADA for any other reason, and the potential tax liability form sales or exchanges of ADA that was received, but not purchased\"). There is a clear understandable description of the problem and a solution is offered, however the proposal could provide more information about the technical challenges. The proposer is currently acting solo - without a team/group of software developers. The experience of the software team members is key for developing a good private and stable price oracle and REST-API database bridge - but it is impossible to assess that developer experience currently in this proposal, as this will come later when the \"2 professional freelance software developers\" (no details about required skills and experience) come on board. Taking into account that is a technical, software proposal for a DApp/Integration, the  lack of verifiable experience of the to-be-identified developers is  a minus in terms of assessing its feasibility. We don't know anything about the two key people who will develop the software component of this project. This is the key first stage that is also the most expensive, so if it does not deliver, the project will be in jeopardy. \r\n", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 4, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal is presented well enough that it will effectively address the challenge.
