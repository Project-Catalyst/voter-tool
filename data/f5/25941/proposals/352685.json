Curation is definitely something the NFT space needs. I like how art organisations and the artist will get paid through smart contracts when pieces are sold on the secondary market. I wonder how we can bring more traditional artists to the NFT space. Very few of my favourite artists have released NFTs. I also like how you broaden the scope to paintings, music and photography. Could universities art departments be included? And what about private art owners? Could they make NFTs of the original artworks that they own?", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "NFT marketplace with the features listed in the proposal is the need of the day.
