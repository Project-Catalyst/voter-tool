Encouraging delegators to commit to small pools is definitely an issue that will benefit the Cardano community. It is evident that This proposal may require further revision as it is certainly a difficult problem to resolve. I'm not entirely sure I fully understood the penalty aspect of the delegator changing their mind...blocked from further use of the Dapp? Also I sense you may have supply and demand restraints on large ADA holders which appear to be necessary for the concept to work.

Users would then get notified to redelegate their respective ADA to the pool and start the epoch. So users get pulled out of existing underperforming pools to a combined pool in the SPRD framework. Said pools could then band together in SPRD to have a higher chance of minting a block and dividing the rewards. The idea is good and could help small stake pools to have a more steady income, which in turn could power projects.
