In this way, an idea can benefit both Africa and our community, as it will reach potential new members, and in addition, these people may generate wealth for both themselves and the community.

But that will depend on the budget grant or not. After a test call out we noticed there are almost any imaginable language present in the Cardano community. We also noticed a lot are eager to help their community but cant invest even 150 usd for a tripod, some have no good camera, etc... Now we have already more than 19 languages covered and our group has already contacted personal networks that's why we keep growing steadily to 28 members in total now. But if we get funded, we get exposure to the whole cardano community and then it will be a question who to reject when our loan fund is used up completely. Off course we would look at the candidates with the languages spoken by most people to form the 12 selected Catalyst funded langbassadors. If we don't get sponsored we ll grow much slower and the overall effect of the prevention we will be able to perform will be lower.

What pool are you recruiting from and how are you planning to reach them? \r\nI'd like to add that the proposed project is massive and might be more feasible to achieve if executed in smaller steps. As the African continent holds a large number of different languages, consider focussing on a few major languages (e.g. French) to start with instead of going after all of them simultaneously. Then apply and expand that structure to other languages. That would ensure an early income and create a more robust system. \r\nIn the attached documents, the proposer includes an incubator program. I am unsure how this fits in a news agency and it seems like this could serve as a second side project after the first one has successfully launched. \r\nFinally there is the requested budget which could be set much lower if the project starts out on a smaller scale to then scale up. \r\n", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 4, "reply": "The Langbassadors are still being recruted and we started on april 10 th after a try-call out on REDDIT/Cardano with over 75 responses leading to over 50 applicants. Not all have stayed because we weren't yet organised and ready, but a core group did and since then we grow steadily. The whole collective is now over 28 people strong, of which we have 19 languages covered. languages are ( not all included ) : spanish, portuguese, french, dutch, danish, swedish, norwegian,czech, hindi, urdu, arabic, ewe, swahili, tagalog, russian, german, ucrain, south-african, Tamazigh and Darija ( Arabic dialects spoken by >75 million people ). So we know a lot of potential African langbassadors host in our ever growing Cardano community, once we present our format the candidats will apply in greater numbers since the test try out was only seen by a fraction of the people. The problem most langbassadors out of developing countries have is they have no money to invest , just time, so that's why we ask for a loan fund so we ll be able to fund an army of eager langbassadors paying their loans back so the next batch can get started. So 24000 USD is to give us a fund with which we can let way more langbassadors start doing prevention and spreading the word about catalyst, not only in Africa but all throughout the world. The remaining 18000 USD is to let 12 people start informing & teaching the people in Africa about to be massively brought onto blockchain via atala prism for 3 months. The other projects within Safety in Numbers can all be considered as seperate projects which we off course will gradually implement, which  seems to be clear to every other CA except this one. We understand it takes a bit of time to read all documentation, but those who done that seem to grasp that clearly. The number of hours been put in project management alone well surpasses the 2000 hours already, and we ask 0 USD for all the work our mostly non-devs perform. I feel that just as it was with WADA there is a very large undervaluation of manhours performed by people doing groundwork & organisational work without producing a dapp and calling a budget of 42000 USD large for what we want to give in return is fundamentally unfair. If a developer puts in 2000 programming hours and asks for 42000 USD to make his product very successfull in the whole of africa no community advisor will call that expensive but dirt cheap .

As mentioned in the text, the translators will spend 3 months working and from their performance they will have the contract renewed or not, so we can at least know that the quality of the work will be evaluated. Unlike other projects, there is no way to be sure of the team's competence at this point of the idea.

The langbassadors program consists of 1 news broadcast a week by a professional video editor, so afterwards its just adding narrated translations or a tape of the langbassador in front of a green screen into that same news broadcast. So the format produces the same quality whether we do it with 1 or 300 langbassadors. In the collective we all do what we are good at : the stake pool administrator creates & manages all stake pools, de (specialist ) content writer writes weekly the content, and a professional video editor makes the video's and adds in the tapes of each langbassador. The langbassadors themselves just translate and present in their native language. If you read the SIN-DOT comparison it should be clear that each module stands on itself and is easily scalable since we are with many and we all do what we are good at. We do agree that it is better to have brought out more concrete info about each team member and candidate langbassador but due to the serious timeloss of (mostly ) crypto and catalyst newbies and unavailability we have been working on our campaign website, but due to the fact that our kenyan webdeveloper suffered power outages for over a week we will only be able to bring out that info hopefully in the week to come.
