Addressing this need will help the Cardano community address the two objectives listed in the campaign brief: \r\n(1) Cardano is considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa; and \r\n(2) Cardano projects in Africa are not isolated but networked and growing.  \r\nCardano cannot be considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa if it lacks a critical mass of SPOs based in Africa; and supporting a critical mass of SPOs in Africa will provide an important network to support and grow Cardano projects throughout Africa.\r\n\r\nThe proposal's solutions offer a sound, general roadmap for addressing the problem identified. It would bring together a steering group of relevant, knowledgeable stakeholders; it would strive to understand and quantify current diversity; it would develop a new SPO evaluation, ranking system, and prototype tool to enable stake delegation that benefits representational and decentralization goals; and it would collaborate with staking information services. These are all excellent elements to include.\r\n\r\nBut my main concern is the proposal's description of what success looks like.  The proposal currently lists three descriptions:\r\n1) Continuous measurement and reporting on Global and African level societal decentralisation,\r\n2) Transparent, principled, objective based SPO recommendations, and\r\n3) Increase African and Societal level decentralisation through adoption by staking information services (has dependencies).\r\nAs written right now, these descriptions of success are laudable, but also lack measureable criteria that can be used to measure the project's progress and success.  For example, what is the anticipated time necessary to execute the different solutions?  Is there a specific, measurable outcome that is desired as part of the SPO recommendations? A transparent, principled, and objective process is essential to any recommendation, but what is the desired outcome? (e.g. x number of people informed? y number of SPO's evaluated, etc). What is a reasonable increase in decentralisation, and in what timeframe? Additional SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, & Time-related), could go a long way in offering concrete ways to evaluate the project's success.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "Proposers appear to have the requisite experience.

I may not have the same technical background as many in the Cardano community, but I do have legal training in the United States, and have had experience helping draft the articles of incorporation for a charity, obtaining a 501(c)(3) tax exemption from the IRS, and participating on the board of a charity for multiple years.  There are significant legal issues associated with charities that can sink a charity if they are not properly navigated.  Simply requesting $3,000 for the charity without further explanation of how those funds will be used or how the charity will be organized and run does not provide sufficient information to agree that the charity is a feasible component of the project.
