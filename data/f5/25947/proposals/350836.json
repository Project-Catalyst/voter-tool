Similar products already exist. According to the author of the proposal, this idea would help to spread ADA in Africa, which is related to the objectives of the challenge. The author also says that part of the transaction carried out there would remain as a fee for the store, but it is not known who owns it: an African in fact, or it could be a multinational franchise, for example. \"The customer would go into the store and have heard about ADA somewhere,\" which is a problem, given that it is known that this subject still has little scope on the continent. The ideal would be to ensure that stores that have a possible local machine, and that there is, at the same time, a process of disseminating information on the subject. As I understand it, the only African explicitly in the project would be the shopkeeper himself, which the project specifies as someone who understands the technology of cryptocurrencies. And this would need training, which would be another benefit for the community, after all one of its members encompassing the universe of finance and technologies. However, proposals must seek to be plural, to reach the maximum number of people possible. The beneficiaries here before, bulletin, the store that owns the machine, the shopkeeper and the team involved in the manufacture of the technology. It is necessary to expand this network.

The machine this proposer seeks to build will allow for Africans to access the ADA currency without having a computer or cell phone.
