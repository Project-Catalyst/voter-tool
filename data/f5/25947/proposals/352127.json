This is because it is intended to create a first SPO in Kenya, in addition to other activities such as promoting workshops, which will aim to educate young people about ADA. Also, promote donations that benefit the local community and promote education, for example. In this way, Africa will certainly gain a lot, and the Catalyst community will be taken, on several fronts, to a new location.\r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": true}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal has a noble aim; however bulk of the fund is being assigned for tasks seemingly unrelated.

In other words, he has experience with the activity intended here, an experience that can be viewed better through the link that was attached. It is a site that speaks the newest SPO in question, has a means of contact and so on. Despite this, a more definite notion about the other team members could have been included in the proposal as well, because I believe that the SPO is not fully taught by the author, individually.
