At a minimum more information such as number of jobs, whether fired before contract completion should be taken into account. Metadata about the type of job should also be recorded and taken into account. Also it suffers from a chicken and egg problem. Until many people have used it for a long time, it shows a very incomplete history of a worker. If it took off it would obviously drive usage of ADA in Africa.
