It is mentioned that with the 150k initial funding after 12 months of operation they will return 300k profit back into the fund. Why not just get started if this business is going to be so profitable? It's not hard to find people who want to double their money. The proposal mentions \"creation of blockchain assets: Khepera coin, smart contracts, product proof NFT system and integration with payment services to receive and fiat and turn local currency into crypto currency\" and doesn't do enough to breakdown the technical aspects. I think waiting for those details will make this proposal more realistic in Fund 6 or Fund 7 or once Alonzo is deployed and smart contracts are live. This is going to be huge for rural Africa and I hope Cardano does not miss out, but it seems waiting for details on smart contracts is necessary.
