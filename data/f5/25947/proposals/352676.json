However, the solution of tokenization of the usufruct, which would provide funding, does not seem to me to correspond to the problem of uncultivated arable land as I understood it in my reading. Overall, the percentage of landowners in Africa with formal certification of their land title, either individually or jointly, is very low. Completing the idea with a solution allowing progress in land identification and the formalization of land ownership in Africa would make it a proposal more in line with the problem.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is not clear how exactly this proposal it going to benefit cardano or the people in the african countrys.
