Still, the proposal's impact on Africa as presented could be important - not completely sure about its impact on Cardano - as it is not exactly clear to me how much traction would the Cardano blockchain have in this sense - as I do not see that the risks have been addressed sufficiently.\r\n", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is inline with the challenge's mission by offering ways to capitalize on waste while also cleaning up the waste.
