This would make implementation easier as all they'll have to do is little education about Cardano for these individuals.\r\nTo asses their plans, it is good that within the first 3 months of receiving funding, the project can be built, implemented and running already. That shows how serious this team is and foremost view of how committed they're gonna remain as long as the project operates.\r\nAlso, creation of treasury out of returns and rewards is a good idea. It depicts that the profits of this project isn't going to be squandered but instead would be used for much more profitable agendas like payment of electricity bills and seeding of local Cardano ventures as stated in their proposal.
