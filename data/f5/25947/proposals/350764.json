So it is important that an approved project continues to receive support until it is self-sustainable. \r\nIn a fund challenge that is specifically dedicated to seed and grow Cardano in Africa, the creating and sustaining of hubs to reach out to the local public is mission critical and can be used as a foundation for further operations in the future. \r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 2, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal meet Fund 5 Grow Africa, Grow Cardano Challenge.

However, if it's of the intent to tackle one region and making sure that it's yielding a better results before attending to other regions then the proposal is on coarse. \r\nI'm saying this because, West Africa has the most weird and hypocritical countries ever when we talk about Technological Advancement. And this is so because, leaders operating in various countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Togo and many others are just corrupt and continues to be corrupt with no remorse.  \r\nInstead, the citizens are much enthusiastic about Technological Advancement and Development but their barrier is that they're not getting the opportunity to meet corporate organizations who's got this passion and mission of training people to becoming developers! And the painful aspect is, these corrupt leaders turn deaf ears to their demands as citizens too. If this project attacks from the root \"citizens\" and provide strong education to the leaders in order for to understand, it will be wise as once they're enlightened, it will be easy for adoption, acceptance and adjustments.\r\nAlso, cost of infrastructure is one blow to the eye. Office spaces which are just for rent (unfurnished) could cost more than 10,000$ for just two years and and furnishing alone could cost sometimes more than 5,000$. Imagine if 10 countries/hubs are to be created simultaneously, each hub might consume not less than 30,000$. So 125,695$ wouldn't be enough right?\r\nThis proposal addressed the issue of legitimacy. I'll commend that approach but my only advice is, they should be extra vigilant in carrying out that exercise else they might end up spending more than supposed to. This is so because, once setting up of new agency is involved, whether profitable or non-profitable, several institutions will approach trying to you know get a cut of the cake. In Ghana for instance, the only institution to receive a legit certification and approval is the Office of the Attorney General. Further research must be done vigilantly to ensure smooth operation.\r\n\r\nThis proposal, I recommend that it be voted for!

There is also a separate document with a detailed and reasonable looking budget for the different costs related to the individual hubs, covering both the starting one-time costs like equipment and ongoing costs for a time period of 3 months, which does mean that the hubs will need new funding to continue their operation and roadmap, either with another Catalyst proposal or by other means, so some more details about this and about the future sustainability would have made it even better.
