There are high-value emails which might justify transaction cost. There is a need to audit the proposal with respect to the security protocol proposed. As discussed in the comments the alternatives like DKIM exists in which the cryptographic public key of the organization is added as a specially-formatted TXT record in the domain's overall DNS records. However, the is scope to explore the use of Cardano Wallet keys or such schemes to do away with DNS altogether.
