The uploaded presentation of the app is nice and show's the importance of efficient medical documentation. However it is not fully disclosed how the data is planned to be utilized in addition to that, i.e. what the purpose of transferring it to blockchain is. You should reflect on that ahead of your proposal to present a good solution there. Keep in mind that you are asking 50000 Dollars of funds, it would be good to know what the exact purpose and potential of this could be other than \"using it for further applications\".", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem and solution description is reasonable and directly related to the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes how it will use metadata to store data about patients, but the lack of metrics, goals or KPIs makes it difficult to measure the impact on the challenge.\r\n\r\nI recommend establishing these items so that we can assess the impact for Cardano's blockchain.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal's intention to store medical information on-chain coincides with the challenge's immutable recording of event data such as transaction metadata.

Considering you are asking the entire amount of funding for the challenge and other projects that are far more modest budget wise have much more concrete plans, this is not sufficient. By the way I would not call the budget you are asking for a \"minimal salary\". What you are asking for amounts to about the average salary in sweden, not a minimal salary. (I know it is a pretty low salary for your job segments, but just consider that the salaries in sweden and skandinavia in general are some of the highest in the world and yet it's possible to live on a lot less there).
