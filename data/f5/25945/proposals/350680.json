This would be done from an app, which, as explained in the proposal, would follow several steps to demonstrate the content, approaching it through different aspects. Cardano would benefit because it would be used as a means of transactions; in this way, both the community and a problem involving metadata would benefit.\r\n", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 3, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposers have the domain and technical experience to deliver this project and have detailed how they will do so.
