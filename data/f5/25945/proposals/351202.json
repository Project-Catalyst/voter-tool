In addition, there are many different vaccines and countries have different vaccine acceptance standards.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a covid-19 passport by governments can be a step towards a social credit score system, which is something that really threatens individual freedoms and goes against the ideal of public blockchains. Some jurisdictions, such as Florida, have banned the use of passports, as they are against individual freedoms and could actually be used in a harmful way in authoritarian countries.", "rating": 1, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The three-phase plan is not described in sufficient detail: in particular, \"technical system including front end\" needs to be elaborated into a development roadmap.
