The proposers are keen to ensure that there is some order introduced in the Cardano metadata universe and I applaud this effort. I also think it will be both short-term and long-term helpful if realized successfully. The open source component and the standardization of DApp data storage solutions would create new value in my opinion.

For instance, it is not clear whether the project will use the reification capabilities of RDF or (on the contrary) if it will be developing its own non-standard solution to the versioning problem.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "If successfully implemented this project would add incalculable value to Cardano as an NFT platform by storing extended metadata in a standardized, immutable, decentralized side chain.

There is a timetable that has been presented and the budget amounts to USD12,500. Although the budget is not broken down into identifiable items, the proposers have focused on a very detailed project roadmap with milestones - which makes it clear that the proposal has a very definite action plan. I do not take the lack of details on the budget as a minus in the case of this proposal as it is not an enormous chunk of the budget, the roadmap is very clear and  as they specify the team is \"dedicated to start building it out regardless of funding or not\". As such the budget is on the low side as the proposers state that requested funding will not be going towards engineering costs, but rather marketing and outreach, infrastructure and upkeep costs, and a bounty/reward system. So, there is a general overview of budgetary expenditure.

Notable strengths of the proposal are (1) its early engagement with use cases to drive requirements and development, (2) leveraging existing RDF standards and tools, and (3) gradually accelerating engagement with SPOs and the Dapp ecosystem over the course of the project. One weakness is that the proposal discusses implementing the security model in Phase 2, but it is not clear about the approach adopted for the security model or (alternatively) the Phase 1 activities involved in the design of the security model. Given the potentially complex and interacting uses cases for public/private and immutable/mutable sidechain data, the security model likely is one of the highest risk areas of the project.\r\nThe project has somewhat placed two other projects (\"Indigenous Art Authenticity\" and \"NFT-DAO Boxcar\") on its critical path, and the proposal acknowledges that public launch \"will largely depend on resources we will be able to attract\". Given the experience of the team and their awareness of these challenges, it is likely that the project can successfully handle these dependencies.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan is well organized and has a highly qualified team behind it.

The explanation and rationale seem sound and I could and can see value in the proposed solution that would facilitate the linkage and sharing of metadata across DApps  as the proposers suggest. I also view the problem statement as pretty well defined (Off-chain DApp data storage options build silos that limit data's use across the ecosystem) - and the proposed solution to me is fully in the spirit of the Cardano ecosystem of building side chains, following the vision of the founding entity IOHK, relying on open-source solutions and teaming up with other stakeholders to build solutions that will serve not only one project - but the entire community. \r\n\r\nThe roadmap is detailed enough for my taste to indicate that the project will be auditable and the fact that the projects under the MetaData challenge are permitted to liaise with IOHK developers and technical staff for a certain amount of time - will help to ensure success. The fact that the proposers are welcoming this interaction with the IOHK experts - speaks favourably about their intentions. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to see more information about the risks and challenges that could face a project of this ambition and caliber - and potential pitfalls and which elements could hinder adoption.  \r\n\r\nI welcome the fact that the proposers have already tentatively partnered up with two specific projects to explore initial use cases: NFT-DAO boxcar and Indigenous Art Authenticity that will host their own Fluree metadata ledgers.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "The statement of the project milestones and the time-windows for the three Phases is sufficiently detailed to measure progress and determine success.
