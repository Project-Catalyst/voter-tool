Whilst I am not an expert in the technical underpinnings. I can see the use of a tokenised authentication system as key in the cases provided here in terms of access to API's (which in turn lowers the bar to new developers as mentioned, could have a great impact on the system as a whole). Could this this idea have further use cases in the non-developer world, such as a patreon style subscription service to content etc and if so if could be worth mentioning that, as this increases the impact for a wider number of potential users.

The integration with Dandelion is promising as they have already had some success in facilitating blockchain projects.

However, the proposal does not include a plan to have the authentication protocol audited from a security perspective (or at least include an authentication expert on the team), which is particularly important because it appears to be an ad-hoc protocol and the proposal states that it would rely on a \"temporary (few minutes) secret\" to establish a secure channel. (The proposal's gitlab link leads to a 404, so I could not review the work in progress.) There is a large body of literature, best practices, standards, and implementations for initially securing channels, but the proposal does not demonstrate consideration of that. Without leveraging that, there is a significant risk that the proposal would nominally succeed in its approach, but have significant security vulnerabilities.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "A number of steps outlining how the proposal will be delivered are described and it is clear how it will address the proposal and benefit the Cardano ecosystem.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "There are no technical challenges that are yet to be overcome in the implementation of the proposal and the proposer has developed a reasonable roadmap.
