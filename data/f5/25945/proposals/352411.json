I can understand and see why COVID vaccinations is the first cab off the rank so to speak but if implemented, this system can be used for quite a number of different patient-reported medical reports that would be helpful for some future projects in gaining perspectives. The proposal can benefit greatly in terms of sustainability if it adds a business model for researchers to pay for future data and/or provide incentives other than Fauci to encourage self-reporting. Some progressive governments collect nation-wide sets of private health data but as mentioned these are not widely shared and come with caveats. This solution paves the way for better  statistical and experiential analysis.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a great idea, but would benefit from greater alignment with medical information interchange standards (e.g. FHIR v4) and ensures that the metadata collected would meet research data standards and needs.

The proposal would benefit from a listing of each technical component required, the resources and time it will take to build and deploy and also of the costing.
