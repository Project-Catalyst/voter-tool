Also the incentives for SPO's and dApp users would be key for encouraging adoption. As this proposal is looking at the idea of taking throughput off the main chain, a look at the Hydra scalability solution for certain aspects of the data transaction could be useful more for metric based elements (ie. likes/voting polls etc). The impact could be great as it potentially brings many people into the Cardano ecosystem.

However regarding traceability, the proposal does not imply giving the data subjects any transparency about how or at least by whom their data is used. Since the proposer has worked a lot in Big Data he should be well aware that this transparency is very important considering recent big data scandals (e.G. Cambridge Analytica, where big data was used to manipulate whole countries politically).
