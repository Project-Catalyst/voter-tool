There is a need for a top-down approach to this complex problem. What has been achieved in Ethiopia is the correct model. It is not a \"nonavailability of app\" problem. The proposed app is not likely to be used in a general sense in India since there is no clarity on the use of cryptocurrency-backed blockchain projects in India.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 3, "reply": "The Reviewer doesn't realize that the NAD requires the candidate to provide a set of private information to the verifier and also needs to be pre-registered for that service to work. On top of that the NAD is slow and time-taking. Regarding the lack of government clarity, according to current laws blockchain based projects are legal and in fact encouraged. Also our project does not require the end users to deal with the blockchain and they won't even realize they are using one.", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal hits on a trust problem that may be addressed by blockchain technology, and the paper included an analysis on how big the problem is.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the Challenge's goal of using metadata for tamper-resistant documentation. However, the proposal is silent on how users of the system would verify that the metadata was uploaded by an authorized university\u2014it appears that the process would involve trusting that the Deqree serivce has properly verified the credenials of the submitting official at the university, but that contradicts the \"no need for a central authority\" requirement in the project description..
