That said, the immutability of the metadata in Cardano could only be reliably trusted if there is a secure way of ensuring the cloud-stored (off-chain) file it's purportedly matched with, is itself immutable.

The approach blends the use of a centralized database for efficiency with the immutability of UTxO metadata. However, the approach only assures that the imagery, documents, and metadata weren't altered after their were registered on the blockchain: i.e., it doesn't prevent alteration of the drone data or metadata prior to ingestion in the paypixl system.

It's difficult to determine what is the role of each of the proposers and what is their experience, specially in the area of Blockchain development.
