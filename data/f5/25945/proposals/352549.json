IF the team has worked in the business of writing smart contracts, servicing electronic invoicing solution, then give a list of existing clients, or likewise. \r\nAlso, now having seen the ADAvoice 'pitch deck' of sorts, I feel that the team has good commication skills, and a sense of how to win over user/clients in this up and coming evolutionary new stage in the business of electronic invoicing!

I thought we could see this on the attached site, but from what I saw it has no content on it, I don't know if it was a team error or a bug on the site. However, with the attached video, and the slides that speak more deeply about the project, it is clear how the team involved knows what it does, has mastery of the idea and is able to clearly unravel it so that outsiders can understand it best. Therefore, I believe that the team is very qualified. The inclusion of some extra information could bring more proximity to those involved, but in terms of technical competence, it is safe that they have it.\r\n", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "A more detailed plan of what will be built and a timeline would enable feasibility to be better assessed.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 3, "note": "A detailed technical presentation and a demo of the prototype have been provided in the proposal.

However, at no time did I see a more direct action plan, a line that detailed how this was going to happen in stages; it is not clear how the money would be divided, and a certain time estimate of how this project would develop. In other words, there was a lack of detail in relation to making it happen, in a more pragmatic way.
