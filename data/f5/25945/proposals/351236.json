Although, I would like to have more information about the details of the process because it was not completely clear to me, based on this text only, about how this process would completely eliminate the need for a attorney, because there are some nuances to patenting that might not be easy to know about is you are no experienced (I've struggled with this in my day job a couple of times already).
