For those people however, such astronomically high anual rates are a very hard to cope with expense which have the potential do drive them even more into poverty, so qualifying this into doing something good as it is done in the proposal is difficult. As the rates in this business model are set, it is rather a model to earn ADA holders a higher APY than they would get by regular staking and additionally provide profit to the operators of the crowdlending platform at the cost of high rates for the people renting the homes. In order for the proposal to make a worthy addition to the DeFi-ecosystem of Cardano, the thoughts behind it's financial setup need to be made more transparent in order for it to be justified. On first thought, the proposal would be better if it introduced a system where the staking rewards would be used to discount the loan rates instead of making them more expensive.", "rating": 3, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 0, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal meets the general requirements of the challenge.

Could this affect the success of the overall project, why/why not?\r\nIn the attached deck there is also mention of using the profits to purchase housing but it is less clear how each of the components work together and what happens if people don't live up to their end of the smart contracts.
