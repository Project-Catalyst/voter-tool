There is no forecast for the launch of dapp described in the timeline.

However, if realized, the project has potential to onboard many users from all walks of life due to incentives for both lending and borrowing parties.

The proposal is seeking to address a challenging issue at the boundary between centralized and decentralized loan systems. Central systems have clear KYC protocols that enable them to offer uncollateralized loans. On the other hand, current DeFi systems are purely trustless but require +100% collateral for insurance of funds. Kitty Party is seeking to establish KYC and trust within small community groups but in a manner that can be implemented in a global decentralized manner.", "rating": 4, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer already acknowledged that there are some pretty big challenges regarding trust with the proposed solution. In the comments is also mentioned, that several other companies outside of blockchain technologies tried it and failed. Smart contracts should help with this, but a little doubt remains. But I don't use this aspect for feasibility, as this might happen after the implementation. The stated experience is good and the linkedin info provides additional trust. I am confident, that the propser can pull it off.", "rating": 5, "c_fb": 0, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no information on how many people will be needed to develop the proposal, the proposer has experience as a full stack software engineer and is participating in the Plutus pioneer program, but there is no information about the proposer's experience with the development of smart contracts and blockchain tech of the blockchain, there is also no information about his level of experience in Haskell / Plutus. Considering that this proposal has a high degree of technical complexity, it is important that we can understand the team's expertise required to develop smart contracts, as the development of smart contracts for loans requires a high degree of reliability. It will be necessary to hire more people to develop the proposal and this raises doubts about the feasibility of the project and the budget.\r\n\r\nRequiring KYC in a DeFi dapp is counter intuitive, as one of the great pros of DeFi for unbanked people is that these people do not have documents to access credit lines, so getting KYC excludes these people from the protocol, in addition KYC brings problems for privacy and compromise censorshipo resistance, ultimately for a DeFi dapp to be able to deploy a credit score system and enable undercolateralized loan in a decentralized way it is necessary to implement DIDs and there is no mention of this in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe idea of \u200b\u200busing KYC without DIDs makes the application centralized because it has a dependence on trust, this removes several benefits for using blockchain, which goes against the goal of DeFi. Creating a centralized protocol and sekk decentralize over time has proved to be a failure in the DeFi environment, as DeFi is naturally less user friendly and incentives end up causing the vast majority of DeFi projects to abandon the search for decentralization or to prolong decentralization. . My recommendation is that the proposer look for an option to implement DIDs in the dapp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no details to explain the technical difficulties for the development of dapp, considering that this proposal requires the development of smart contracts for mission critical applications (finance) it is important to clarify whether dapp will be developed in Haskell, margin call mechanisms, what will be the dapp financial model , the need for a token or not, etc ...\r\n\r\nThere is a budget breakdown, but considering that the development of smart contracts is defined in the budget, it is important to specify the technical capacity of the proposer to develop smart contracts.", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal is for a prototype, and its presentation is very professional.
