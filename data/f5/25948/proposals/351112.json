I recommend that the proposer clarify the purpose of the proposal and what the relation of the plan described in the attachment file with a DEX and this challenge.\r\n\r\nThere is a large difference between a Dex and a crosschain DEX aggregator. A Dex by itself is a DAPP that has a relatively large complexity, a  Cross Chain  DEX aggregator is a much more complex project.\r\n\r\nOne of the few projects that develops a  Cross Chain DEX, Thorchain took more than 2 years to launch their mainnet and even after launch still has few pairs, the point is that getting a bridge cross chain efficiently was only possible through recently with the AMM model, because atomic swaps do not allow relevant liquidity.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that if the team intends to develop a project of such complexity, it should submit a proposal with sufficient plan and details. The community can help with feedback and if it is necessary help the team can look for people or developers interested in the Discord channel.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 2, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "No plan is provided.
