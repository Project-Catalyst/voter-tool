Would like to see an estimate on how much transactional friction exists, and what the biggest struggle for current utility billing is. Late payments, complex fee structures, overdrafts, inaccurate measurements, misaddressed bills all come to mind.

The proposal mentions the complexity of the problems you are attempting to solve.

The remaining half will need alternative methods of funding, an ICO can be an alternative method. I believe that the budget is not reasonable, as there are fundamental aspects about the plan that are still unclear and this creates doubts about the definition of the budget. The fact that the requested amount fund only half of the development compromises the auditability the proposal.\r\n\r\nCompliance and regulation risks were not considered and this is a key aspect to assess the feasibility of the proposal. Integrating DeFi with government-related systems is a major challenge and projects could take years to establish a framework. IOG's own partnership with the government of Ethiopia demonstrated the great difficulty in inserting solutions created in public blockchains to the government. When observing the development of blockchain-related technologies by governments out there, the delay of governments in the development of CBDCs is notable and the bureaucracy involved in the process makes integration difficult. In addition, there is a great preference for governments to use private blockchains. These risks need to be taken into account as they bring risks to the proposal's success and there is still no plan that demonstrates how this type of risks will be faced.\r\n\r\nThe use of blockchain for bill payment brings additional risks to users' privacy, and there is still no private computing solution available at Cardano. The lack of privacy in these transactions can bring risks to users of this model, because when making payments the user exposes his balance.\r\n\r\nReceiving payments in ADA implies that the recipient will have to deal with volatility. There is still no decentralized option for converting ADA, as until July (until Alonzo HFC) there will be no DEXs and stable coins on Cardano, which creates friction in this model. This could be circumvented by using someone to take custody (centralized exchanges) but it would go against the purpose of DeFi and in the opposite direction to the basic concepts of DeFi, which deal with removing intermediaries, removing trust and bringing more costs.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2, "c_fb": 1, "no_vca": 1, "reply": "", "pc_fb": false}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no way to verify the experience of the proposer beyond the \"relevant experience\", no GH links, no demo app/website.
