As one of the goals is to create a utility token it is important to understand the team's experience and aptitude in developing a tokenomics model, as the feasibility of the proposal will depend on the utility of the token.\r\n\r\nIt is important to say that costs with audit of DeFi protocols are extremely high due to the need for staff with great technical knowledge, so that the DAO has people qualified to carry out the audits. The absence of a robust tokenomics model hinders the project's feasiblity. The dependence of revenue on a possibility of interest (in protocols that do not yet exist at Cardano) of a token that does not yet have a robust model of tokenomics brings a lot of uncertainty about the viability and sustainability of the project.\r\n\r\nThere are details on the budget allocation.\r\n\r\nSome risks are not being taken into account, such as:\r\n1- The dependence on protocols to generate yield (protocols and dapps that do not yet exist at Cardano)\r\n2- There is no guarantee that the SCAT token will be listed in dapps as an asset to generate yield.\r\n3- Auditors will receive competitive rewards for auditing smart contracts, but this is based on a tokenomics model that is not yet well structured and may not be enough.\r\n4 - The audit of projects by DAO does not remove the risks of fraud and collusion.
