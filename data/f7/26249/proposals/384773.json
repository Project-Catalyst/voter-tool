Catalyst has had a lot of small, piecemeal projects and solutions - but we also need some heavy-duty long-term solutions for big issues that are looming on the horizon. The issue of scalability is on eof the key blockchain challenge and the dcSpark team has been spreading the message consistently and clearly about the challenges that are coming around the corner for Cardano blockchain in terms of the number of transcations that the blockchain can process. We are approaching current limits (of course, parameter tweaks can improve this temporarily) - however, nation-wide adoption means that there is no possibility to put entire nations on \"hold\" until we find solutions that will address a much higher number of transactions. I see this proposal as fully aligned with the challenge Nation-building Dapps as Dapp solutions cannot function without a network that can support them. A network that can scale to a much higher number of trnasactions will automatically allow for the smooth and unimpeded development of multiple Dapps that will lead to an increase in the number of Dapp users, registry accounts, transaction volumes. Someone might look at the Challenge and question whether this proposal fits. I don't - as we have to see the forest for the trees. There is no world in which we can develop 100 new Dapps for nations, but the underlying blockchain is not able to process smotthly those transactions. As the proposers state: For nations to adopt blockchain, we need to achieve scalability at a nation scale. This is what this proposal want to deliver through the proposed scalability solution called \"naive rollups\" or sometimes called \"lazy rollups\". Hydra is some time away still and will not be able to singlehandedly deal with the entire issue of scaleability. Furthermore, a new scaleability solution will help with the decentralization of fundamental research needed for the Cardano ecosystem. I see this proposal as a win-win-win for the system. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I think that the dcSpark team could benefit from following more closely the precise instructions for submitting proposals in Ideascale. It might be a pain in the neck, but attention to detail is the hallmark of good work. The challenges require a definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months, and I do not see it in this proposal. Maybe the team could have included as deliverables a monthly update (blog post, video update, etc... ) on how the research is going. The idea is great and I like that the deliverables have been defined (1. Writeup of a more rigorous analysis of naive rollups and 2. Feasibility of rollups on UTXO-based chains (Cardano) and accounting-style chains (such as the sidechain of Cardano called Milkomeda)). However, it seems to me that some more effort could have been put into making commitments to keep the community updated about the research and the findings - as the research progresses. I think that the entire community is excited about scalability breakthroughs and dcSpark - if necessary - could even increase the budget to include a marketing person for planned regular videos about the findings ... as the research goes forward. As it stands now, the budget is not outlined clearly and not broken down into identifiable items (those are Catalyst rules for CAs). Anyhow, the inclusion of the Youtube video in the Ideascale proposal is amazing and the dcSpark team's credentials are stellar and their contributions to Cardano - during their Emurgo days and post-Emurgo days have been clear and singificant. I think that the feasibility of the research is unquestionable thanks to the credentials of the team. The team stated \"We believe rollups can also be part of Cardano's scaling strategy\". I would prefer statements that use the word \"believe\" - to be better substantiated with more analysis of \"why?\". My question is - what if the findings show that they cannot be used - will we have an alternative strategy? Anyhow, on the balance of everything, especially the competency of the team, I assess that the proposal is indeed extremely likely to be successfully implemented. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As this is a research-based proposal, its deliverables are clearly a completely different product from building a website. The precise deliverables are always less visible before the work starts and the team has carefully stated that it believes the two deliverables will be a . writeup of a more rigorous analysis of naive rollups and the feasibility of rollups on UTXO-based chains (Cardano) and accounting-style chains (such as the sidechain of Cardano called Milkomeda).. These are great contributions and not many teams are involved in this type of in-depth research with practical consequences for Cardano. The team - in the attached video - and other videos that can be seen on Youtube from the dcSpark team - shows that their understanding of these issues is really in-depth. Hence, I think that it would be easier for dcSpark to considering including in its work something along the line of the Cardano Roadmap updates - for all of its proposals [https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/] If dcSpark is already working on important contributions, then the milestones that will help auditability could take the form of regular (monthly updates) on what is going on in each branch of the work. Without this, the auditability of a proposal can suffer and outsiders are unable to gain any meaningful insight on what is going on until one day (six months later?) dcSpark suddenly reappears and tells us what happened. The proposer states that \"We believe we can have this deliverables available in the first half of 2022.\" For Catalyst, this is the bare minimum - so try to incorporate more mandatory along-the-way updates/reports that will help the scores of all your proposals (if they merit it, of course). dcSpark Roadmap monthly updates anyone? I've seen proposals from other leading teams that also top-notch contributors to the ecosystem, but they do include detailed steps, monthly timelines, a breakdown of budgetary requirements including elements such as: \"Min estimated number of person-days\" \"Max estimated number of person-days\", as well as dayrates and variables that influence the budget and the distribution of the workload - and hence the ability to audit the work. Auditing progress as it stands will be relatively difficult - although this is a different type of project.  Still, one can be creative even in this type of scenario with regular updates. Please include more information about milestones in your work in the future, to make it easier to monitor.

One key property that differentiates rollup from Hydra is that rollup does not require trust on the parties that runs it, while Hydra does. This is due to the fact that rollup will write data sufficient to verify computations happened in rollup back to L1, while Hydra does not. This trustless property of rollup brings more possibilities for large scale use cases. For the case of nation-wide applications, any third party can run L2 rollup without acquiring any trust from the nations. The trustlessness and scalability of rollup is going to be a strong reason for nations to adopt blockchain technology.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DcSpark has demonstrated its experience and ability to deliver high quality product.
