The proposal taps into the tourism sector, which many of the small nations depend completely on for their survival, and also where most of the loopholes lie that governments find hard to tackle. The impact the proposal could have is huge. However, the portion I find hard wrapping my head around is the success of the proposal provided it's not the first of its kind and how effectively this could fill in the void the previous ones have left in the system. Hence, I rate the impact of the project with a score of 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The experience the team members bring to the community is huge. The team members have been working alongside the sectors that play an enormous part in the proposed project, namely small businesses, tourism, blockchain, and many more.
