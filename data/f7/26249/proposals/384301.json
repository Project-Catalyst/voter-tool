The proposed solution of developing a decentralized platform for anonymous flagging on corruption is one of a kind. Also, the team proposes to involve a lot of local entities and volunteers through campaigns and events which will certainly make the Cardano popular amongst the crowd and also increase the resilience of the ecosystem. However, the manifesto makes no mention of the demographics it plans to target or how the team proposes to mitigate the corruption on successful flagging by the users. Since the plan includes the fact to make the application independent of government authorities, the credibility of the application increases amongst the people. Thus, I would score the impact 4 out of 5 as some finer details of how effective the application can be and how the team plans to leverage the Cardano chain are missing. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has already done a fair amount of work in the direction of the proposed solution and also provides the community with their detailed budget breakdown and also their definition of success. However, the proposal lacks information in other sections. The proposal fails to provide the flavour of the team which would work on this and the experience they would bring along. In spite of mentioning that the application will be developed, the proposal includes no technical details about the same. The milestones even though looks practical in nature, the proposer has failed to mention the challenges that lie in their path and how they plan to mitigate them.\r\nApart from the quarterly success definition, there is no other step-by-step detailed game plan available for the readers. With all these facts, I believe a moderate amount of detailing is required to gain the trust of the community to fund their venture.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe that there is not enough information available for the auditors to make conclusive derivations regarding the success of the proposal. The proposer initially plans to develop the application without leveraging the Cardano chain and has plans of moving to the ecosystem only after 6 months. The missing target audience details and metrics make the proposal even more incomplete in nature. The proposer even though has extensive expertise in the idea he proposes, the missing team details make the proposal less credible. No distinct KPI is available for the auditors to track how many users register on the Dapp and transaction volumes and how effectively the application is received and utilized which is one of the primary criteria of the campaign. Even though it's quite understandable that the idea is still in its preliminary stages, a little more specifications about the proposed application and the figures to track its usage and success will help the audit easily and also help the community to track its effectiveness.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal seeks to solve the problem of discovering corruption in organizations and governments by an application facilitating anonymous crowd-source organized campaigns which partially aligns with the challenge goal but is not a foundational registry solution listed in the challenge.\r\nThe proposal does a good job of articulating the value to Cardano and articulating how the solution scales to address future challenges.\r\nThe proposal could be improved by providing key metrics and goals that more closely align with the challenge and either selecting another challenge (Miscellaneous) or more closely aligning with this challenge's goals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal articulates the feasibility aspects of experience (linkedin profile in the comments section), team composition, budget is broken down and reasonable, additional funding plan, realistic timetable and plan, resources required, \r\nThe proposal's feasibility could be improved by a more detailed technical explanation of the solution and including a challenges and risks section.

It is also clearly observed how this proposal would add value to the Cardano ecosystem, since it is an instrument in all aspects of the proposal.

In this regard, I consider that the proponent did not provide sufficient evidence of his abilities to implement the proposal, apart from being a very relevant academic project at a prestigious university. Iguylamente is not clear the team that will develop the proposal, because there are some external payments that are not clear in its development. Although there are identifiable elements in the budget, this aspect could be improved. The budget is reasonable to complete the work, however it would be good to have the best-developed profiles that allow them to be supported. The timetable is a bit optimistic, however it is achievable if properly incorporated into the university's programs. By the way, it is not clear what role university students will play. I think the proponent could have shown more about the project and maybe reserved.
