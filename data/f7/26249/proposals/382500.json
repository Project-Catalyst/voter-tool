The challenge seeks to accelerate the development of dApps that \"cover foundational Registry solutions,\" with an emphasis on the storage/retrieval of vital records on the blockchain. The proposed open-source application is not a decentralized application per se, but it is designed to extract legal and regulatory data from a blockchain (i.e., \"legislation as code\") and determine regulatory compliance or user eligibility. As a development economist, I agree that there is a very real need globally for such systems, as they would speed-up access to critical services and attenuate the impact of corruption (especially in developing nations). Such systems can also be used to leverage the value of property registries because zoning/building regulations could be applied against specific land parcels stored on a blockchain. My primary concern is the size of the proposal's budget relative to the total allotment of funds for this challenge ($90,000 of the available $600,000). That said, breaking the project into two distinct phases (development of MVP and subsequent testing) may not be feasible. Overall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is quite large and the members possess extensive experience in the fields of law, regulations, open government standards, and software development. The plan provided by the team is very detailed and clear, and given my experience working with various startups, the budget (although large) seems reasonable given the time and other resources required to successfully complete this project. It would have been nice if the team had provided an estimate of the total hours required to complete the two phases of the project (along with the implicit hourly pay rate), but given the scope of the work involved, that would be understandably difficult to accurately estimate. Overall, it is highly likely that this team will successfully develop the proposed project deliverables.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposed deliverables are very clear as are the KPIs provided by the team. The team does not address potential downside risk, but given the prior construction of the New Zealand legal database and the team's experience working with said data and the BetterRules project, failure to deliver a working product is unlikely. That said, there is greater uncertainty regarding the achievement of the KPIs, for which the downside risks are not addressed.
