It is a brilliant idea put forward in a simple yet elaborate manner. The proposed solution makes a clear mentioning of the targetted registry, the \"Customs and border control\" which is one of the requisite in the campaign brief. The target user base is Kenya and Ghana which are still developing country need such solutions for foreseeable and sustained prosperity. The proposer also mentions that the solution already has an implementation running over the Ethereum chain but wants to transfer the same onto the Cardano chain. Hence, on successful implementation, the proposal would not only have a global influence in driving new players but also invoke a lot of existing players to move to Cardano, in order to overcome the vulnerabilities they might be facing in their respective current chains. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers Tim and Jonathan are known faces to the community and there lies no doubt in their expertise. And the amount of effort that has gone into the detailing of the plan certainly needs to be appreciated. The proposer provides the community and the readers with an elucidated roadmap that includes crystal clear phase-wise goals, resource requirements, risks involved, and measurable metrics. The team provides a very brief flavour of the team and the experience they might bring to the ecosystem. However, the requested funds form up to 25% of the allotted fund for the challenge. Even though the amount appears to be doing justice to the considerable workload the team proposes, it would be doing injustice to the other ideas in the challenge. I would recommend the team propose a portion of the fund during the subsequent funding rounds by showing some amount of progress from the fund7 allotment. Having given my opinion I believe a score of 4 out of 5 for feasibility would do a great justice to the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team, however, makes no reservations while providing the metrics for the audit process. The proposer mentions their desired outcomes for each milestone and respective success metrics. The proposal includes all the required metrics one should look forward to having gone through the campaign brief be it the increase in the number of Dapp use cases and transactions, partnership with the international organizations, impact on financial inclusion, and the global outreach which are all the key metrics of the challenge at hand. Moreover, the team's plan to make the application available as open-source and provide app demo over catalyst channels makes the proposal more viable and trustable. With all the above facts in hand, it is very clear that the proposal comes with good enough KPIs to monitor its progress and its eventual success.

It's clear that paper based trading systems can be daunting, heavy and not optimized. The proposer has brought a solution that will use the cardano network to verify documents and enable rapide trading execution between parties. From the video published in the proposal, the proposer explained that the product was running on the ethereum network but the gas fees made them switch to cardano. Altogether, this proposal fits really well into the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the project is already up and running, with a working website on mainet, I think that it's feasibility is a matter of continuing. Furthermore, the proposer has added all the information and details needed to achieve a positive note on a successful implementation of the project. Linkedin profile links have been added as well as team members and resources needed to complete the project. The budget has been broken and seems reasonable based on my intuition.
