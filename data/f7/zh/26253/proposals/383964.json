They can help project managers to create schedules (gantt charts, creating WBS, store and share key documents with the teams, comply with stage-gate, create dashboards, build risk analysis matrixes, manage and allocate resources, create scenarios, manage budget, and etc - all the knowledge areas in the PMBOK in project could be benefited from a PM tool) so I'd consider to broad the scope of this proposal to have a dedicated tool for all project management activities (not only for the audits). This would be ambious but great if fully implemented. And, of course, the right custmizable tools has to be chosen - the main challenge here would be cost, the licences for these tools are usually expesive! Some of examples of the tools/platform that are going to be analyzed could be mentioned in the proposal so voters can have a hint on its cost/benefit (given that the most known ones are indeed expensive) and how these licences were going to be paid after implemented (considering theres probably no free tool good enough)\r\nIf the idea is really just use this tool for audit purposes, then simpler solutions developed internally could be built (as in other proposals in F7) with probably a much lower cost. But, of course, a cost/time/benefit analysis need to be done here to validate this premisse. \r\n\r\nI liked it is propsing to start with a pilot, before moving to a large scale implementation.\r\nI also liked the idea of having supportive PMOs in the process. This helps to standarize processes, tools, createlear guidelines, suggest and improve governance, and offer project management consultancy/guidance, to funded proposers, if necessary. Going further, this PMO could offer consolidated views on the whole catalyst projects pipeline (evaluating portfolio metrics involving the milestones achivements, funded value, ROI, etc)  in catalyst meetings/townhalls and act as scrum master in Agile funded projcets. But again, it would be a larger scope.\r\n\r\nAll in one, the proposal is much better when considered a scope increase, both in the PM tool usage and in the PMO implementation - maybe it could be in other challenge (miscelaneous).  This scope increase could be done in stages, of courses. The way it is written, I see a cost benefit analysis comparing to a in-house solution as essential to really evualute the impact of this iniative.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The experience of the team is vague. It says is has over 10 years of summed experience in project management - which is essential, especially if PMO actitivities are going to be carried out - but more details should be available, as more description on their experience and how many people are involved. Theres a PMP (certificate) number but I couldnt find the person register in the internet - links to linkedin or CVs would help here! \r\nTheres a good plan but there are no dates or time-frames to the activities/milestones listed.\r\nThe budget proposes id fair for a pilot, but could be mentioned how he got these values for the licences (was there any initial benchmark done?). A last comment would go to the economical feasibility of this proposal. I dont see major challenges fo the technical feasibility of this proposal (implementation of a tool itself) but more for the economical feasibility. An insight on the cost benefit compared to an in-house solution could be bought on the proposal as it conflitates with others (even funded proposals from last fund).
