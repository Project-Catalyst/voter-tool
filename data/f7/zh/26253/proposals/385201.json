I also like the idea of the fundings being released by work packages as it evolves, according to its schedule, completition and depencencies and have a system manage this \"stage-gate\" would be awesome.

It would be good check with whomever \"owns\" this information if you could have access to it before starting. Else, the rest of the project wont be feasible\r\n\r\nFor the second part, this proposal could have more details on the development of this tool and how it would be implemented. Firts, it should be clearer if the desired solution is going to be developed internally or if it would be an arealdy exiting commercial solution - or if both would be evaluated. It seems to me that the idea is to keep this management in idea scale but that brings the question of this place is really the best for this kind management and if the solutions proposed would be available from ideascale.
