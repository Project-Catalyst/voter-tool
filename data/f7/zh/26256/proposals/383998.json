The business model is conceptual and only provides anecdotal evidence for why it is a needed idea.  \r\n\r\nIn order to turn this from a strong proposal in the future, the project team should aim to submit their idea to relevant challenges as well providing more details around roadmaps and how it realistically aims to become the 'Uber for Africa.'
