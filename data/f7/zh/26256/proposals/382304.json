The solution proposed by the proposer is in align with integration with atleast one large ecommerce providers and team here is targeting shopify.\r\n\r\nThe building of scalable, easy to use plugin is the most important requirement for this  plugin development. The team also mentions that they want to make use of Cardano based stable coins e.g. Djed for payments via this plugin.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is quite an interesting way and important because one of the biggest concerns that non crypto user/business owners will have is of the volatility on prices.

In my opinion, I feel that the Development efforts for such a plugin (if require 282 hours, then this should be supported by more detailed description with what challenges they think exist in order to support this development ??). The team is quite well experienced, and if coti API is gonna take all the load and deal with scalability issues, then what is left is precisely the business logic and UI implementation. The budget asked for is like 35% of the total challenge allocation, and the number of integrations possible is only 1 platform, which is shopify.
