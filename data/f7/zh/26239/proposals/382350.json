The solution perfectly fits the challenge because it will deliver a reliable way to establish if information about Cardano is true or not even for newcomers. This way transparency will be enhanced and the risk of having trust in the environment eroded is mitigated. The fact that there is currently no fact check website turned to the Cardano context adds even more potential to the project. Another important aspect to be mentioned is that the proposal meticulously articulates how it will add value to the Cardano environment by having this central place to resort to in case some controversial information arises. Also, the metrics discussed like number of facts verified, user activity on the website, requests for fact checking and number of community members registered are strongly aligned with the outlined challenge settings. Regarding the scalability of the project the proposers did not spend a lot of time on the topic, but the team claimed other funds could be used in case it was necessary.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is highly likely to succeed. There is abundant evidence the team has the necessary skills and experience to accomplish the task being proposed. All the team members presented possess strong backgrounds and have been involved with Cardano related activities for some time. They clearly break down all the types of work that will be necessary during the project and the number of team members required is adequate. Moreover, the budget is reasonable to accomplish the targeted idea. The timetable designed is realistic and the milestones aimed during the implementation are sensible and identifiable. The proposers explain not only what will be done but also how when they break down each part of the proposal into smaller tasks, which is quite positive. However, relevant risks and challenges that might pop up during execution could have been more thoroughly discussed. In case additional funding is necessary to develop new features the team has considered new catalyst funding rounds or crowdfunding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient to audit the progress of the project.

The roadmap built is well structured and possess a reasonable time horizon. Also, a lengthy description of the problem was given, and the team has demonstrated they truly understand it and is confident their solution will address the problem.

No one else challenged their claims because it may had been a feel-good sentiment. But we are Cardano, built on rigour and facts, not popular opinions. So reading this this proposal gives me hope that such incidents do not occur again or that more of our community members fact-check and challenge undue claims for the sake of clout & social algorithm. This proposal whilst asking for a low amount can bring tremendous value to our community and to other crypto participants who are not so in-tune with all things Cardano. If successfully funded and built, it would be an asset and due to this I whole-heartedly agree that it falls within the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members are credentialed contributors to Cardano and often perform voluntarily. Their background outside of crypto seems to hold value and provides confidence this proposal is well within their remit and capabilities. As a CA I've personally utilised some of the tools Victor assisted in producing so I have first-hand experience in the quality of the work. Add to this the openness of the entire win win team and their bona fides and we have the recipe for a success. In terms of the plan, the 4-month road map is sound and actually aligns perfectly with the Cardano growth we expect to come following the release of the PAB and Atala PRISM, and this may well be the time when such a fact-checking site comes in handy. The success metrics and KPIs presented seem very achievable and I would not be surprised if surpassed. As a former assessor of university tenders and contracts, the necessary background of the people and the plan are presented to provide a high degree of confidence that success is achievable. Good luck.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has enough information to make it auditable and where I would suggest an improvement is in the explanation of how the achievements of the 3, 6 month targets. It would be good to know if the results of requirements gathering and other aspects such as the 'roles' in the system and the KPIs will be shared with the community. Given the relative closeness of some team members to Project Catalyst, I have confidence that asking questions or updates will be easy. But preferentially, it would have been good to have these mentioned on the proposal. Notwithstanding, this is a team embedded in all things Cardano, from Catalyst to Plutus and to Atala Prism.
