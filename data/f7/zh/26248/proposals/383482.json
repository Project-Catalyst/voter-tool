Being in the code audit phase indicates that the protocol is almost finished, so its development and impact is not under discussion. (you can infer the quality of it too). While the Budget seems a lot at first glance, it is reasonable, audits for crypto projects are really expensive (and even if you have the money it's difficult to contract this service because of the demand and particularity of each project.).
