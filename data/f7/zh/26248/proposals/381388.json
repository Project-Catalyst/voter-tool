The reason is that there are too much scam, bad projects and investors themselves lack basic knowledge about blockchain to be able to distinguish whether a project should or should not invest. Proposal has outlined a solution to help investors avoid losing money through a project self-assessment website. Currently, there are also many websites or social channels that give project reviews, but they are very general. I was completely impressed with how the proposer rated the project when I checked out the clips they posted on the proposer's youtube channel. They evaluate a project in great detail such as team members, financial games, marketing activities, especially about the project's technology solutions (they perform technology evaluations based on document analysis and peer-review). knowledgeable people). If this model is applied to the website of the proposal, it will be a huge impact on the community. Through the website, the community can view quality, transparent and decentralized reviews because the assessment will be done by the community itself.
