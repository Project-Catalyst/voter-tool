However, without the team of respective experts of the crypto space itself, feasability to come up with a \"coordinated strategy\" that fits all of crypto is unlikely. The proposal does mention, that it might include insiders, but they do not elaborate further on it. I would find it more feasable, if the team gave one specific area of crypto-scam/crime/attacks whatsoever, that they would like to contribute insights to with their knowledge and why they would be the best to be paid to do so. Basically, the proposers would like to receive funding to come together and go through possible strategies, that would be interesting for a crypto community to try out, adapt or align to their protocols to enhance security, which is great. But in general, this proposal does not provide examples, proof of prior work or any technical issue that they identified as a start of their efforts. As is, I find it interesting, but too broad and without the relevant skillset. I think, tho, it would be great if the team came up with a proposal where they offer mentoring to crypto protocols about their expertise in crime and fraud. This way the crypto experts would be able to make use of the crime experts and they could ask specific questions and this would enhance the discussion between crime and crypto experts and would be relevant.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is given through a preliminary report, that the community will receive after the team has completed the workshop.
