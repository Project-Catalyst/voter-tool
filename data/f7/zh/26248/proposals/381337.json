Start educating them young would be the plan that should be generally used. In this proposal's case they intend to equip teachers with online courses on programming that would have a duration of 3 (three) months, which culminates in those teachers creating a Cardano club that teaches Haskell. This is too ambitious of a program. 3 (three) months would probably cover just the basics of any functional program. There would not be enough time to master it in such a way that it can be meaningfully applied or taught to. Then there's Haskell, renown amongst developers as a language that is extremely difficult. Reckon what would be best for this proposer is to scale down and target less. Take things slow in Africa would be key and the gist of this proposal is actually something currently being proposed by other communities from Africa.
