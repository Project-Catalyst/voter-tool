However, there is a need for an auditable KPI and codified task list to stand scrutiny in the future.

The proposal identifies an important problem - the opportunity cost of voluntary work - and adresses it. We can clearly see the value the Swarm adds to the ecosystem and it would be a shame if their engagement got lowered because they'd have less time for financial reasons. It is clear that this proposal needs to be supported in order to support the current work of the Swarm and ist scalability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst swarm are a really active and vital part of the Catalyst community. It can be seen all the time how much they do for the ecosystem and how they are basically ist backbone. While they are probably investing a lot more time than what is represented in the budget, it is still appreciate that they leave this space to other proposals and are modest in their demands. The feasibility of the swarm's work cannot seriously be doubted as it is so very present all over catalyst, which is the best proof that they deliver on their promises.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As of it's nature, this Proposal requires no metrics.
