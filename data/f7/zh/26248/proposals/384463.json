Indeed, people strange to each other working together might generate conflicts but it would be nice to bring solid examples or carry out surveys with previous funded proposers to really assess the size of this issue, and, consequently, the impact of this proposal (specially as it is within miscellaneous challenge).\n\nOther point of concern here would be to add an extra beurocracy to proposers (besides running the project and reporting) and to what extent this document would have legal value considering all regions of the globe, as proposers are all spread out. If no legal value is intended then a template ellaborated by an attorney might be too much, maybe an standard written agreement with responsabilities, rights and liabilities created by proposers (or following a methodology, as RACI Matrix + team charters) could be enough, if the team thinks it would help.\n\nAs a last suggestion, it would be imporant to see here how these templates would be built with the community (i.e. interaction bewtween attorney, the team and community/stakeholders). I see the a very iterative process where regular feedback from users is imporant. Potential to apply an agile method.\n\nAll in all, having the rights, responsabilities and liabilities clearly defined in the begining of a project is key, but it is still not clear the value of hiring an attorney to develop this compared to existing methodologies available everywhere.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the team, theres a good description of both member experience and capabilities, which seems enough and there are linkedin links to verify this. However an external attourney would still have to be hired (although there is a mitigation strategy for this risk).\n\nTheres no clear plan on how the templates would be developed. I'd include a timeline separated in weeks including acitivites like scouting and hiring the attourney, developing the template, validating the template with key users (pilot), expanding it to catalyst as a whole. It would help to make sure all the proper steps are followed.\n\nLast, theres a good budget breakdown but the project seems a bit expensive in relation to its final deliverable.\n\n \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As there's no clear plan, theres no milestone defined.

And as the proposer clearly articulated in plain-speak, such an agreement establishes clear boundaries for responsibilities and rewards for different people working towards the same goal. This will deliver a good positive impact to Catalyst and could further promote the sharing of workloads and expertise, and could potentially lead to higher quality proposals and funded projects.

It is a relief that the chunk of the requested fund is reserved for the lawyers to ensure the templates are developed within the legal framework. Casting a legal eye is a must-have requirement in order for such an agreement to be useable. The two proposers have presented their LinkedIN profiles as well as descriptions of real-life experiences which would be valuable in crafting the templates. That they themselves will be the pilot of the 'teaming' agreement should this proposal gets funded reflects the viability of the claimed timelines. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the claims of using this proposal as the pilot for the teaming document makes it highly auditable and effectively, immediate. The team could make their agreement public as soon as project Catalyst announces the winners in Fund 8. Notwithstanding, I assume the presentation of the short and long form templates will involve Project Catalyst and its channels should the IOG arm decide to certify the document for use. My only suggestion is with regards to the team's claim that the template would be open for review by the community, which is another audit point; they failed to mention where this 'report' may be published or sourced. In any case, Len is quite an active participant in IOG Catalyst Telegrams and could be contacted via those channels if clarity or updates are required.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u521b\u5efa\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u3002", "experience": "30\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a0e\u6536\u7ba1\u8f96\u533a\u4ece\u4e8b\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5438\u53d6\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6559\u8bad\u3002\u4e66\u9762\u534f\u8bae\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}
