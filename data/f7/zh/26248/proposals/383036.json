The proposer or proposing team failed to explain how this website would replace existing websites that connect neighbors or that are targeted to connect people in need. There is \"nextdoor\", the horrible facebook that also allows for give/take/support connections between members, there is craigslist, ebay..... basically I think this is a good cause and very interesting idea, but the proposing team should provide an objective why this specific proposal might fill a gap. There is for instance no mention of what area this proposal is targeting - maybe adding this information might make it clear, that there is no alternative at the moment. Generally, the idea is interesting, the roadmap, the budget and the provided information about the geographic area, the proposing team and the KPIs are not enough to assess feasability and general relevance of the project. The proposer should address the risks of a platform that is connecting strangers to share personal information like their address and to maybe add the option of paying in crypto - which makes any phishing or social engeneering scam very possible. How will the website prevent fraud/ scams?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer did not provide proof of prior work, references or a clear roadmap with actionable steps. No example about how people might connect on this platform is given, it is not clear how this website would be marketed or onboard new members, it is not clear which country or neighborhood this website is for.

Creating a website to connect the poor and those who are in need of material and spiritual resources with those who want to do charity activities is a great idea.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is generally great, I haven't seen the proposer mention target numbers like: How many people will the website help? What is the material and spiritual value that the website can bring? Website can connect with how many people are doing charity?\r\n\r\nTherefore, the proposer should set specific goals for the proposal so that we can see the impact of the proposal on society.\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"The proposer has 7 years of professional experience in full-stack web development.

How can I confirm if the person in need of help has a real problem or is a scam?\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to achieve the results of the proposal the team needs to have more people with experience in volunteering and community management to market and carry out various activities on the website.
