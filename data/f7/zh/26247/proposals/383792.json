Having a more efficient communication system would drive productivity to new heights and catalyse development on many levels. The Enhanced Liquid Reputation Assessment is interesting and could serve its use as Project Catalyst has been looking for a reputation system.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal's team is highly experienced and holds SingularityNet's CEO and VP of product. So there is no doubt that they'll be able to develop this. One concern is that the variables of the scoring mechanism should be very well defined for it to work properly, which might prove to be more difficult than it initially seems. For example: the length of text in a message can be too short or too lengthy for it to retain a certain level of quality. To define the ideal length that holds maximum efficiency would take a lot of effort. \r\nFurthermore, the notion of decreasing the number of AI-services and thus also decreasing complexity in case of higher cost is a lesser option in my opinion. There might be applied for a second fund in that case, upholding application quality as intended and reassuring community confidence.

This one is very specific one and the name of the Challenge \"F7: A.I. & SingularityNet a $5T market\" might be a bit misleading. The principal question in the challenge \"How can we create a mutually beneficial partnership with SingularityNet and other A.I. developers and researchers?\" is what I think that proposers should focus mostly on - and this proposal does it. It is hard to jump to super-ambitious projects without taking things a step at a time and this proposing team does it. Creating a a \"semi-open, AI curated communication and collaboration platform that connects project teams, external ambassadors and the wider community\" is a project of extreme relevance fo Cardano and Project Catalyst specifically, especially as full implementation of decentralized governance is round the corner. The idea to utilize a \"scoring mechanism supported by AI algorithms\" to identify outside constructive users that can enter the 'public closed' area to collaborate with the internal crew - is amazing and could be super beneficial for any community that needs to ensure that it does not operate in a bubble. The Cardano community also utilizes Slack and Telegram, which are the initial focus of the proposal - meaning that any developed tools could be transposed. Spot on. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe team behind this proposal includes the VP of product at SingularityNET, while the co-proposers is a leading authority on AI and Cardano partner Ben Goertzel. If there is a team that is qualified to pull it off, this is it. The attached plan includes monthly steps & an associated timeline - with a budget that is broken down into person days and includes day rates. I don't know too much about AI, but I know when I see a team that can prepare a good plan, a good budget and is experienced with the matter at hand. This proposal is both realistic in the way it sets out a timetable and in terms of the plan that will be implemented. Highest marks from me. I especially commend the team for going into detail about the Dayrate and variables that could influence the cost. The transparency and readiness to be open about the cost is commendable. I quote: [\"The dayrate depends heavily on the team that we will be able to form This ranges from rockstar AI dev freelance rates, to regular 'western world based' employee rates, to low salary countries or enthusiastic community members. for this proposal I will estimate the daily rates on 350 dollar a day, which is somewhat of an average but not overly optimistic.] The team also is planning ahead in case the dayrates are not too high: \"Should we be able to collect a team with lower dayrates, then we can expand the scope\" - very very good. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The attached document with the plan, timetable and milestones is excellent. It makes the proposal easily auditable and I think that the proposal is a very good example of how to create a valuable contribution inside Project Catalyst.

The idea of the proposal is to use AI to build a platform within a large community/company so that ideas from one project team to another get attention. Today large companies are usually structured in smaller groups and the ideas that burst within these groups tend to fade away after the supervisor. By using this AI platform all group communication could be linked if the idea has promise.

As VP of SingularityNet, this leaves no doubt about the relevant experience to develop this idea. My concern is the rating system, as it is stated in the attached file it looks more like a whos more popular rating rather than who has the most valuable ideas. Since the rating system is based on the frequency of posts, reactions, comments, and length of the post. This would in my eyes not be enough to produce a solid rating system of valuable ideas.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The PDF that comes with the proposal gives a professional feel.
