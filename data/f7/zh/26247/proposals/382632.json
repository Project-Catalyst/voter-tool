A major advantage is that both are able to combine, creating a more human-like manner of thinking. It's almost like introducing the concept of religion to machines. Doing so theorethically would create more complex thought processes that enable more activity on both ecosystems. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Very competent team to bring this into reality.

As such, I agree that it effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n\r\nI do not strongly agree that it effectively addresses the challenge, because (as a founder of an AI start-up with broad knowledge of AI methods) I am skeptical that theoretical work on abductive logic offers a near-term good path forward for AI agents to generate novel hypotheses. Deterministic / mathematical methods to explore a solution space, such as probabilistic methods and dynamic programming, are much more easily computable. It is important to pursue new research directions, and this one seems worth taking, but there are probably more promising approaches to this problem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As the proposal states, it suggests a simple and clear goal of evaluating research in a specific area of abductive logic through of a lens of usefulness for AI, and disseminating it to the SingularityNet community.
