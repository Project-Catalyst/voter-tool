As we cannot possibly document all skills and work experience of every team member, we hoped that assessors would either take our word for it, or research themselves.

We agree with your remarks on Impact and Feasibility. DeFi on Cardano is quite new and instead of promising high yielding features or building a huge team before the first initial successful pilots, we had to paint the roadmap in relatively broad strokes. We are strongly committed to making the project a success and will commit whatever personal sacrifices necessary.

We have worked under Kyoto Protocol Clean Development Mechanism, which was a United Nations framework that linked global projects with Emissions Trading Schemes (we worked with parties in Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan, Canada and the European Union). Today, most Voluntary Offset Schemes including those certified by Verified Carbon Standard (ex-Verra) are global and often criticised for their flaws and \"greenwashing\". Instead of national legislation, there is a strong case for auditability outside national or corporate interests to be made, something that has begun promisingly by some universities. We can make this a success with support from people like you.\nThank you from the BlockCarbon Team"}], "solution": "BlockCarbon - \u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5e93\uff0c\u5229\u7528Plutus\u4f7f\u78b3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u5e01\u548c\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "experience": "\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u548cDeFi\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0ePlutus\u5148\u950b\u548c\u80fd\u6e90CEO\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u4eac\u90fd/\u5df4\u9ece\u78b3\u5408\u540c\u548c\u884d\u751f\u54c1\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002"}
