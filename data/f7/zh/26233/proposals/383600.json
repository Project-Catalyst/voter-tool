The proponents are attempting to explore and make an important contribution to situations that have been dealt with since the 1980s. 40 years of increasingly efficient markets (imagine markets as living organisms that learn from themselves and their environment, that absorb information and make themselves better and better) have not been able to shake off phenomena such as slipage, wide bid-ask spreads that offer opportunities to buy or sell at the worst possible price, and high fees that are the lifeline of an increasingly mediocre and incompetent money management industry when it comes to obtaining the longed-for alpha (Warren Buffet included).   Since the mid 80's it has been more and more clearly understood that: a) these phenomena do not disappear, they are natural to market activity, b) although they do not disappear, they can be controlled, c) the most effective control measure for these phenomena is Liquidity. And liquidity is nothing more than the volume of business, of activity, that a security (a stock, a bond, a barrel of crude oil, a pair of shoes, a box of cereal, a toothbrush, etc. etc. etc.) can generate.  Therefore, illiquid markets will be plagued by the influence of these phenomena.   \n\nBeyond the bad publicity, markets are themselves an art form: they are the pure expression that in the end nobody knows anything, so understanding them is a real mental pressure.  \n\nAs time goes by, things change.   Systems that insist on their survival tend to assimilate the changes dictated by the environment, to purify themselves and to adapt.  Markets are such systems.  They accept and will continue to accept change in whatever form it takes. And that includes technological changes like blockchain.  \n\n\nThe proposal is clearly a work of exploring better ways of making markets.  And that will always be fine.  That will always be a critical piece in building healthier markets that are a liberating influence and a force for good for human society.  It is therefore my opinion that the proposal has the potential to have a positive impact on our ecosystem.

A reasonable figure.\n\nThe first milestone is set for 3 months after funding, with the following activities: \"The Stableshift protocol launched in the Cardano testnet. Browser wallet integration released. Security audit passed.\"  In my opinion, 3 months is an adequate lead time to evaluate the seriousness with which the proponents are taking their commitments.
