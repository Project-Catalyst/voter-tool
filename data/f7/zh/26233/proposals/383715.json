You need to get a Plutus developer on this team as they are essential to have onboard from the start. They provide a website with a demo of what the UX would be like. The budget isn't broken down or explained. The community needs to know how you plan to spend these funds. If you  provide a clear budget breakdown it also shows your approach to solving this and could boost voter confidence in your abilities. The product with all its features will be finished in 12 months, which is reasonable for what needs to be built. They explain in detail what the different use cases are for the tokens and NFTs. No technical details have been provided on how they will build this. yes they already have a demo to show user experience, but the community needs to know how the backend will function. Providing these technical details will boost trust in your abilities. They haven't considered any risk/challenges. Not being aware or prepared of future risks will slow you down.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "They provided a roadmap with milestones, making it easy to track the progress of this project.

In order for the community to track the performance of your project you need to ad KPIs. User KPIs are very good at tracking performance. Like How many users join your platform. How many tokens gets minted. etc. They recognize the problem of bringing clean energy financial markets to the Defi space and they intend to solve this by creating a Defi protocol that encourages clean energy.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_140", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 9, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Impressed.
