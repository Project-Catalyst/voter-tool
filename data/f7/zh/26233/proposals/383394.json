non-party related political (grassroots) groups I know how important decentralisation can be for economic empowerment. However, it is important that DeFi projects have good accessability and also enable to bank the unbanked instead of just beeing an elitist project. I have done some personal research on both DeFi and microlending especially with a focus on Global and social justice and hope to bring in a valuable perspective on accessability for poorer people with my reviews in this challenge. The proposal identifies a problem in just this area and presents an excellent solution to this: tackling sometimes fradulent tendencies in microfinance and presenting a good, transparent solution to it that everyone dependent on microfinance will benefit off and that will greatly boost the DeFi capablities of the Cardano ecosystem. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.
