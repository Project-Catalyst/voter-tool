At the moment, Charli3 is on the Ethereum network waiting for the  PAB and a functional bridge to join the Cardano network. They have decided to request funds, in order to give free data to projects building on the cardano ecosystem. Many are the startups that don't have access to much funds during the early phase of development. Paying for data feeds which are provided by oracle such as Charli3 can be expensive. The free data feed provided by Charli3 with the fund request will mostly benefit these project building on the cardano network. Needless to say that this action has a great value for the community. Furthermore, this project will be able to scale future challenges if additional funds are needed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is very feasible based on the amount of information provided by the proposer. Charli3 has already built a product waiting to deploy on the Cardano network. There is enough evidence on the skills and experience of the team.

The cost of development is handled by Charli3. If additional funding is needed, the Charli3 team has a plan laid out for that.

This proposal itself I believe has a very high probability of being implemented successfully, given the teams prior work and ongoing projects.\r\n\r\nThe only red flag I have is regards to how this price feed will be sustained, we understand that Charlie3 is meeting project catalyst funds contribution 50/50 which is awesome, but it appears to be clear that they will request more funds in the future which obviously creates a small bit of risk that the next funding round is not approved and I'm curious to whether or not that means Charlie3 will discontinue the price feeds. \r\n\r\nOther than that I do believe this proposal itself will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is detailed and milestones are made very clear, however I would actually like to see more specific details KPIs for the 3, 6, and 12 month milestones. \r\n\r\nAgain I really feel like this team will deliver but the roadmap should not have any vague references and should be a little more specific!", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_577", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Charli3 Great project.
