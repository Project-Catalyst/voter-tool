Hence, can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research, and numerical programming capabilities back at my university, not professional experience in the field of software, hence this part of my assesments in this category will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done and my general programming knowledge in mind. The proposal identifies the general problem of the comprehensibility of NFTs for people from outside the crypto space and tries to approach it by printing physical representations of NFTs. The proposal does not explicitly articulate how this will benefit the Cardano ecosystem. The key metrics and goals only slightly align with the outlined challenge settings. Generally, i find it hard to grasp how the idea of someone having  a monopoly on something, as the proposers say for their proposal, should benefit Cardano and match ist mission, as Cardano focuses very much on decentralisation and democratisation. The proposal has the potential to be scalable, if it is implemented correctly, however the implementation is not described well enough in order to determine this. Feedback: Generally try to make your proposal descriptions more detailed. I can see you have a substantial idea in your head, but you should try putting it into your proposal in a more detailed and enaging manner, otherwise it will come across rather as a pitch than a proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "If the proposers are indeed experienced engineers, it seems reasonable that they have the capacity to realize the 3D printing part of the proposal. How sure they are to fulfill the blockchain/Cardano related specs is unclear, as they state in the proposal they still need to do some acquirement.\r\nThe budget seems reasonable and some parts of it are rationable, while other parts, like the hardware costs could be explained in more detail. No plan is presented for the case that additional funds will be required.\r\nThe proposer offers a timetable with milestones for the first 3 months, that could however be more detailed in order to indicate thath in-depth planning has already been done. Feedback: Put a bit more thought into the details of what you want to do and present it to us in a more clear and step-by step manner. In general, technical details are not explained, which is a clear requirement for proposals in catalyst. Feedback: Try going more into the technical parts of the proposal in order to demonstrate that you are up to the task and to make your proposal accessible to more users.\r\nIn its current form the proposal does not provide a sophisticated implementation plan.\r\nChallenges, resources required and all the deeper details are not considered in the proposal. General feedback: Try starting with 1 or 2 proposals next time and make them really sophisticated instead of starting up with seven proposals that are not properly planned. If you are unsure what I mean, take  look at some of the past funded proposal, and how they have a very dedicated and detailed plan, where every factor and every requirement is explained in detail. A big plus however is that this project is backed by Adosia, which makes it al lot more likely to suceed, which is why I increased my rating in this category from what I originally intended. I however still advise you to be more explicit in future proposals.", "q1r": 4, "q2": " Only a brief roadmap and three very short milestones are presented. The  Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal could be more clear, as they are, ust as the milestones, very open-ended and would theoretically also allow a low-quality execution to pass auditing steps\r\nThe targeted problem is described and a solution along with some success criteria is presented. Here again, it allows for some auditing, however the criteria should be more dedicated in order to better allow auditing for quality.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_52", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal does not exceed the budget ask and provides products to users to help break down the mental barrier of NFTs.

They will be reaching out to teams, but there is no guarantee they have that figured out at the moment or have funds to make that happen.

To understand how the system work, we can check their whitepaper on the website. \r\nIn the scope of this proposal, seem like the plan is simple to do. Hence the given info is close enough to prove that the team can make it. \r\nLast but not least, there are still a lot of risks and difficulties in this type of project that I think the team should figure out and make some plans for them.
