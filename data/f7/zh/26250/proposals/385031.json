I have been in the crypto space for 1 year now and I had to google what wallet bombing is. Try to avoid using obscure phrases (especially of technical nature) in the problem statement and in the solution in the future, or at least explain what they mean.\r\nThe solution again confuses me with terms such as \"vanity URL's\" and \"powerful regex search plus \"and\" logic\". Not everyone is a developer unfortunately and most of us struggle with this language. You want your proposal to reach the average ADA holder, not just programmers.\r\nThe idea of a Pinterest for CNFT's does sound interesting, but you should also outline how this would work and how it would be valuable to Cardano. Practical use cases are great for this purpose.\r\nDue to the problems outlined above and the lack of any type of KPI or concrete goal, even though this proposal sounds like it fits in the Dapps & Integrations challenge, I have to strongly disagree that it addresses it effectively.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer claims to be a Plutus student and the notes on the provided github do reflect this, but there does not seem to be much other activity there, especially in the fast few months.

Lastly, 14 years of experience of web analytics and managing large technical projects are mentioned, but no references are provided to verify this. It's a good idea to try to add at least a Linkedin page to back you up. \r\nI strongly disagree that this proposal can be implemented successfully, due to the lack of information on the team who would work on this, no details on how the budget would be used, no risk analysis and no plan outlining the technical approach and the usage of resources concretely.

Conceptually, I think this idea has a certain fit for the challenge [if completed].
