In general we already observed in many cases that a user-friendly way to present data can be more effective that have more data to present: I think that this is one of the things that the proposal will obtain by developing his project, simplifying access to data and guaranteeing delegators a more informed choice.\r\nAnd this can be realized providing to SPOs a set of open-source tools that can help them to maintain the pools: it seems to me a classic Win-Win situation.\r\nThe reason why I'm not giving the full 5/5 is because i see a great potential for this proposal to become a real business opportunity for the proposer but it's not presented in this way: it would have been good, for example, to present the set of tools also as a service that can be offered to other SPOs and obtain a better alignment to the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have no doubt about the feasibility of the project: Lauris is a well-known community member and his dedication to the community his huge, give his involvement in the Catalyst Circle and the SPOCRA initiatives.\r\nThe steps for development are well defined and described in detail and also the budget breakdown is detailed in the right way and provide a clear picture on how the costs are divided for the various parts.\r\nIt would be great to add some technical details about the implementation of the dashboard: which languages / technologies will be used, what is the architecture to present the data (the monitoring tools will need a dedicated hardware or can be run on the node itself? There will be a centralized server to aggregate and present data?) but the overall evaluation about feasibility is extremely positive.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As for the feasibility criteria, there is a great level of details about the roadmap and the steps that will be used to develop the project and these information could be used by the community to track the success of the project in an easy way.

This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge.
