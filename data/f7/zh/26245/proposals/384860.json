However, there's a relatively high cost to become a stake pool operator in developing country, and this proposal starts with helping the aspiring SPOs and developer in Uganda. This proposal can articulate how their solution will add value to the Cardano ecosystem, which is to train more aspiring SPOs to join the Cardano network. By creating this training and workshop, it also create a new SPOs business model and add value to the SPO ecosystem.

The budgets are laid out clearly and in detail, from the rent cost (since this is a computer lab in Uganda), ISP cost, the furniture and computer, salary for the staff, etc. This shows their seriousness for this project, and proven their capability to identify what resource needed to make this project a success. This proposal also provides a sensible and conductible plan, and explained in details how to realize that plan.
