This could be a good thing to accelerate proposals with potential and provide them with the necessary mentorship. In the end this will have a positive impact on the Cardano eco system.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Proposer has made available links to two team members who will be the project leads. Then makes mention of Qualified, recognized, and respected leaders in SSI from India, Europe, Africa, Central/South America, Asia, and North America. It would have been beneficial to the proposal if these Qualified professionals were identified already with links to their experience and skills. This would make the project more feasible. Breaking down the budget a little more could also help community members and voters see that proper research has been done around the possible cost aspects. The timeline seems realistic. Resources and risks are not mentioned. This would add to the likeliness of the proposal being voted for.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal will be measured by the results which is stated in the definition of success, with a 3, 6 and 12 months timeline and what they expect to achieve. This will also give an idea of the success of the project. A space should be provided where the community can keep track and follow the results of the project. This could really be a good project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_795", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u7531Tony Rose\u4e3b\u6301\u76845\u4f4d\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5c06\u5ba1\u67e5\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u6839\u636e\u8981\u6c42\u63d0\u4f9b60\u5206\u949f\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002", "experience": "\u7efc\u5408\u4e8680\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u521b\u4e1a\u3001\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u7403\u516c\u8ba4\u7684SSI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3002"}
