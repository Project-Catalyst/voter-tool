We do not get the information which of the information is in the current team and which is missing. The roadmap is very high level (3 months, 6 months) and could benefit from additional information what happens within the timeframe. The budget outlined to achieve the defined target is reasonable and broken down, but we do not see the information what is already existing and what is out of scope. From my experience building apps and apps in the last 15 years I consider $15k for a damp pretty wage, but it depends on the leverage and reuse of existing modules.
