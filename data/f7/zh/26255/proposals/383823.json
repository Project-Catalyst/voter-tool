The biggest question mark is the estimated cost ($200,000 USD). Trying to raise all that from Project Catalyst is a long shot. Makes me wonder why the partners (Flat6labs Tunis, OST pre-incubator, Fondation Tunisie pour le D\u00e9veloppement, Centre de recherche num\u00e9rique du technopole de Sfax, IEEE, Orange Tunisie and Betacube) have not offered to foot at least part of the bill. Another question mark is the timing. According to the timeline the first phase (sourcing) is supposed to start already 1 January, 2022. However, the Catalyst funding would only be available soonest in late February. Therefore, creating interest, spreading the word and engaging the community would have to happen completely without funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Problems statement \"Without communities, blockchain ecosystems and decentralization could not take hold.\" is matched with a solution: \"A decentralised governance experience through an avant-gardiste incubation program in Tunisia that aim to educate and build an eco-system.\" The slides talk about a DAO but it's not opened up when/how/where/why is that DAO formed. The KPIs show that the projet aims to reach 100,000 people via social media and 6 teams are supposed to go through the program, resulting in a proof of concept, a business plan (white paper), team, community and readiness for Incorporation.
