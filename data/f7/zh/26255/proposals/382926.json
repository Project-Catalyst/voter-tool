Alex and Philip have proven themselves in Project Catalyst and we can expect great results from them.\r\n\r\nAs for the payment for the mentor, it's great if the mentor's efforts can be baked in to the proposal budget and if this can be shown with a \"seal of mentorship\" badge or any standard approach that makes it visible that this particular proposal is being guided by an experienced community mentor.
