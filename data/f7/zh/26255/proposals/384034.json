It would have been nice to have the Incubator directly involved in the proposal. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers and his firm have experience in advising in this space. However the proposal relies on Bermuda's InnoFund Incubator coming on board. Given they are not directly part of the proposal this is not guaranteed. The proposer has asked for $115k, but no details are given on what this money is for. Is this just for the proposers time in negotiating to bring InnoFund onboard? Or is some of that going to the companies themselves? A break down in the budget with it tied to milestones would be desirable.
