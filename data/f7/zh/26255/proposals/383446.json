This proposal will bring previously funded proposals into a competition with huge exposure and the chance to win significant funding for expansion. This is what acceleration is all about, leveraging a small amount of Catalyst money to crowd in external funding into promising start-ups and bring wide exposure to the community and Cardano as a whole.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is a well established Accelerator with a clear plan to integrate prior funded proposals into a competition with exposure from both themselves and the Financial Times. Every expectation they would be able to deliver.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is well set out with deliverables that will be easily measurable.

The proposer is able to scale to address future challenges. This proposal could provide many Catalyst funded projects a fast track to get access to a hue network (250k stakeholders in 95+ countries) and scale their individual ventures.

The most impressive KPIs: 1700 teams, 4800 mentors, NPS of 79%, 2/3 increase revenues and benefit in staffing. The roadmap is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. The cost plan is available on high level and could benefit from additional information who is receiving the funds, and e.g. where the campaign, marketing & pr activities are planned. The channels are mentioned and a mapping from resource to channel to budget would bring it on an even higher level. The requested amount is below the value package.
