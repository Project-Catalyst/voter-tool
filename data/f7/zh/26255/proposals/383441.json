My only concern is how the tool would really work.\r\nwould there be any integration with ideascale? how would the info be update as projects evolve or change?\r\nhaving this tool working well and easy is essential for this project. It should be easily updated and not only as new funds are done but also as projects develop., are concluded and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n Its also good to see there'll be strategy recomendation on each \"category\".

Essentially the team behind the Strategy Framework - AIM are seeking to improve the outcomes and access to mentors for Catalyst funded projects through implementing a database form that filters projects funded by their type, size, region, experience level and so on. In terms of how this project relates to the challenge it is specifically targeting a potential missing link throughout Catalyst Funded projects and the wide network of professionals in the Cardano community already, in such a way that it would be quite a ueful tool.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The success of this project will like many aspects of any decentralised platform - depend on the users interfacing with the tool and adoption of this tool by Catalyst itself to ensure consistent use across projects.
