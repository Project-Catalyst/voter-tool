What makes a proposal like this interesting is that it's a question of strategy. I think it's fair to say that a migration of this sort is something that could easily take place without a targeted challenge like this ever being posed. Competing with blockchains, and especially Ethereum, which have flaws that Cardano does not share, is critical. But is targeting Ethereum and its flaws for competition specifically through our project funding mechanism critical? I think this is debatable! And it's a good question for the community to weigh in on.

One could even think of it as a test of our existing structures and community.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's something of a gap here in the proposal as-written. OK, we want a head count of people who migrate? Sure. But not all development projects are equal. We want successful projects, not just any old project, right? How do we measure quality here? Here's another fun angle to consider as a measure of success: What if through targeted efforts like this, we gave ole Ethereum a kick in the pants and motivated them to make key approvements to their own blockchain? Then their success would also be our success, wouldn't it? What I'm saying is, there's a lot of room for setting targets here, and it couldn't hurt to be broadminded about it.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_853", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 3, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "\u8bb8\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u88ab\u56f0\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eEVM\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u5982Ethereum\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\u3002Cardano\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "success": "\u90a3\u4e9b\u8ba1\u5212\u6216\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eEVM\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e0a\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5728Cardano\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002"}
