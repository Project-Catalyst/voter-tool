Moreover, as evidenced by proposals in Fund 7 there are practical solutions that can improve the situation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal can be made stronger by:\r\n1) presenting historical cases where the inability to quickly \"move rapidly from volunteers to paid professionals\" has created notieceable damage to the community.\r\n2) providing an analysis of the expected ROI on quick funding.\r\n3) providing an example of the size of the issue: what is the relative number of projects that cannot be funded through Catalyst?\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of the problem.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The catalyst community is well positioned to make improvements with regards to the speed of funding.

So, the proposal would be much stronger if it provded an anylsis of the demand and a commitment from providers of funding (Catalyst, IOHK, etc.) to financially support the new mechanisms if they are deemed of sufficient quality.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about a sustainable source of funding for rapid funding process.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents some measures to evaluate the suggested mechanisms (scalability, transparency, accountability, impact, etc.) which are reasonable evaluation criteria for potential projects.\r\n\r\nHowever, out my experience as a product manager, the challenge would be stronger if it considered its own impact on the Cardano ecosystem:\r\n1) the % of projects funded through Rapid Funding Mechanisms.\r\n2) the % of funds distributed through Rapid Funding Mechanisms.\r\n3) the community satisfaction with the reapid Mechanisms in comparison with the satisfaction with Catalyst process.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 30, "ne": 6, "ng": 18, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I believe that speeding up the financing process so that projects can begin sooner aligns with Cardano's overall mission.
