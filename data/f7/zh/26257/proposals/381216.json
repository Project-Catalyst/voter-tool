goals of growing the number of contributors and growing the dev and app ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal defines the objectives as \"Indian focused\" projects, which could limit the potential global impact of developed solutions.\r\n\r\nI believe that considering the following points could make the proposal stronger:\r\n1) reformulate the proposal from requesting Indian-focused projects to projects that target use cases needed in India but potentially helping other regions too!\r\n2) Provide an analysis of use cases that could be a great growth points in India based on technological readiness, regulatory readiness, and the local demand.\r\n3) Provide several examples of a successful adoption of blockchain in India to provide insights into potential impact and the complexity of projects.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discusion about the ability to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1":
