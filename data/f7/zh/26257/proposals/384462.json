However, the very unspecific way in which the challenge is defined does not explicitly address the strategic goals of Fund8 (grow & develop contributors, make Cardano into an open-source project, grow the dev and app ecosystem).\r\n\r\nTo make this proposal stronger, I'd suggest to consider the following ideas:\r\n1) provide an overview of specific trust-related problems that recently created major damages or lost opportunities for the community.\r\n2) provide a list of use cases, where lack of trust framework block adoption, onboarding of contributors or development of apps.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of the problem, use cases, and their impact.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In general the catalyst community consists of people passionate about decentralized systems, so should have the necessary skills to address the challenge.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, because this proposal is vary loosely defined, it is hard to judge which types of skills and resources are necessary to make progress.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of clear problem definition and use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal defines the number of standards that can be audited as the sole progress metric.\r\n\r\nWhile it can be used to track some activity in the community, it is completely insufficient to track the progress in solving the underlying problems (not use-case specific) in the community. The proposal could be made stronger if considered some of the following ideas/metrics:\r\n1) define a specific list of target use cases, and for them develop use-case specific metrics (eCommerce, decentralized exchanges, etc.)\r\n2) find metrics tracking the impact on the Fund 8 objective (contributors, apps, developers, etc.)\r\n3) compare the solutions with other solutions of competitors in the market (user satisfaction, adoption, etc.)\r\n4) track the impact of the solutions on the growth of the Cardano community (the number of users, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for only one and ambiguos metric to track activity.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 2.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge only tangentially aligns with 1 of the 3 strategic goals of Fund 8 which are defined as Cardano's mission.
