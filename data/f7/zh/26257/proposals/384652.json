This can support one of the strategic objectives for Fund8 - growing the contributors to Cardano ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this proposal would be stronger if it provided a discussion why focusing on subset of use cases (hardware) could provide a higher ROI  to the community. Especially because the hardware is considered as harder to do well than software.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for addressing only one out of three strategic objectives of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for not providing an explanation how focusing on this niche could lead to higher ROI than broader challenges.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of example success stories, helping to judge the impact of individual initiatives.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The cardano community can definitely provide funding and support development of software components.
