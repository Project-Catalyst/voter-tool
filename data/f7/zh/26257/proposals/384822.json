It's what makes thing possible in the first place. The richer with solutions this ecosystem is the more projects and opportunities will exist in Cardano.\r\nThis challenge is therefore essential to our community. As a developer myself with more than 20 years of experience I can attest that the developer ecosystem of any language or technology is what will make the difference when choosing a framework or language over another to build something.\r\nThis challenge (previously also including open source and closed source solutions) has been there since the very first Catalyst fund and has been the most successful with many funded projects and also many projects being voted but not funded due to the sheer number of proposals being submitted within the challenge each fund. The more tooling we have the more likely things will get done in our Cardano ecosystem instead of somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThis is the non-open source version of the challenge. Although it may seem that the open source version would be preferable over the closed source one, and that one should vote for it and not the other, this is a mistake in my opinion: many of the previously funded proposals in the previous funds were closed source and yet allowed many projects to be built upon them. A good example would be the BlockFrost APIs which, while being partially closed source, allowed others to use them freely for their own projects, open source or not. So we actually need both to be successful!\r\nIn my opinion both this challenge and its open source version are the most important challenges of every funds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As demonstrated in the 6 previous funds, there is no doubt that our community has the resources to address this challenge given the hundreds or projects already funded in previous funds and all the projects that missed being funded due to exhaustion of funds...", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this closed source version, we won't be able to check the quality of the source code being created but we will still be able to see easily if other projects are using the provided solutions or not as a direct indicator of usefulness and quality.
