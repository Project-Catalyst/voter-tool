Without such examples, it is hard to judge how critical is the funding of the community events.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point because this initiaitve supports only one of three strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discusion about the relative size of the use cases and their importance for Cardano ecosystem.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Catalyst community is definitely capable of organizing more community events and improving their quality.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, out of my product management experience, the lack of analysis and clarity on the types of events that were historically the most impactful, creates a risk of a limited impact on the funds.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of defined high-ROI use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Some proposed metrics (the number of events, etc.) allow only activities related to the initiative while the others (the number of proposals, the number of votes) do not help to evaluate the incremental impact of the events - what would be the same number (proposals, wallets, etc.) if this initiative is not funded.\r\n\r\nIn addition, providing metrics to measure the impact on the Cardano ecosystem would make the proposal stornger.
