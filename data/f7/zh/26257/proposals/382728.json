So, to make this proposal stronger, I'd suggest to include a deeper analysis of expected ROI in comparison with alternative approaches.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it can be worth considering to creating proposals within broader acquistion initiatives.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point because this initiaitve supports only one of three strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of alternative approaches.\r\nMy rating is 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Given the size and the diverse skill set of the Catalyst community, it's definitely possible to concieve and excecute additional marketing activities.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal would be stronger if it analyzed recent successful cases on brining new people into catalyst and discussed the sufficiency of funds to reach a noticeable impact.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 4.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed metrics evaluate the growth of the community overall, but do not provide insights on the incremental contribution of the marketing activities in this initiative.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to make the proposal stronger, I'd suggest considering metrics that can evaluate the deep engagement of the newly aquired audience and the cost of acquisition, such as:\r\n1) the number of apps per developer created by devs onboarded through theactivities.\r\n2) the number of proposals per Catalyst participant for participants acquired through the activities.\r\n3) cost per app created.\r\n4) cost per proposal created.\r\n5) comparison of the above metrics with alternative acquisition channels.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of evaluation of the incremental contribution.\r\n- 1 point for the metrics to analyze cost efficiency.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics to analyze the engagement of the onboarded audience.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 3, "ng": 12, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Personally, I believe that this challenge should remain in the Catalyst cycle, even though we have come a long way and have exceeded our expectations in terms of participation, I believe that there is still a large part of society that needs to be included.
