It says that 'has already been hosting regular events' but it not gives us any link, any information (how many attendances, how is it growing\u2026), therefore it is hard to verify if it has traction. Other aspect is, although the YT channel is fresh, there is little views.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Cardano has a huge project with Ethiopian gov., therefore it may be a turning point regarding the acceptance of crypto all-around Africa. That said, there has a good capillarity having these studies in other languages, which makes this proposal and the challenge sort of aligned.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "One point that caught my attention is when the proposal states that wants to 'permanently retain our French translator'. I wonder what is the plan to monetize this project without the fund, since you are thinking to retain them permanently, there must be an idea to make some money.\r\n\r\nOther aspect that I'm missing is some validation. Since this proposal claims to be promoting meetings in some countries, it would enrich if it was given some confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would gain if the timeline and the budget could be more explored, giving more information about the meeting likewise frequency, costs, attendance, and more, giving more possibility to judge if it's feasible or not what you are proposing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Speaking of auditability, it says that all the content will be accessible, however there is no information of where it will be provided. A good metric to follow would be the attendance in the French nucleus, which will show that this proposal has traction and it's giving results.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasability: one point here is that we seek to \"more permanently\" retain our french translators. It is true that we could have been more specific with how we seek to finance this long term, but our goal is to start with a 6 month chunk to get a boost. Also in the \"budget\" and \"risk  management\" section we explain how the translation budget will be used based on demand for different languages (addressing the frequency and cost concerns of the assesor)"}, {"q0": "The proposal identifies the problem that most of the initial information available about Cardano is in English. Its solution is the organization of regular DLT educational events with French translation. This proposal is in line with the challenge of increasing the engagement of non-English speakers and has the potential to impact the Cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer presents references of their experiences necessary to implement the proposal. Team members were identified with their respective relevant skills. The budget was detailed and appears to be adequate to achieve the established goals. The deadline set for completing the work appears to be consistent. The proposer considered the risks and challenges pertinent to the project. The proposal presented a detailed plan of what will be done and how.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal made clear what the target problem is and its solution.

Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. \r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the frequency of community events for French Speakers if they so choose.  \r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among Native French speakers for DLT and Cardano in particular.\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 5 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos of the educational programmes, and put links to some of the videos on the proposal itself  Sometimes , doing that might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to complete the project. They have already submitted and executed many projects under Ideascale. They have also provided evience of hubs in various parts of Africa. The Core leadership has also been given in detail. These links are sufficient. I have visted links. They are highly competent, having done live translation prior to this project and already having conducted multiple live events. The project is ongoing and successful so the number of people has been previously successfully identified.\r\nHe has rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown and is already successfully implementing the project.\r\n The budget has been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items which are Live event translation and Marketing/content translation. The budget is very reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required, but since this project has already done several live events, there is no reason to suggest that additional funding would be needed for this round. The timetable is realstic to continue the live events.\r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation in terms of the events to be translated  as well as translated content. Resources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.\r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects but covers aspects such as live translation.\r\nThe proposer has identified risks in bringing on board new languages without assessing the actual target audience. In order to mitigate risk they plan to launch a study to find out demand for translation services. But this is not of concern since this is a long running successful localization project, and the funds required are to continue for a six months period\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. These include how many monthly live events and how many languages are being increased, how many posters and social media content is being produced. \r\nThere are clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal namely number of live events, how much of other translated content. There is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem as well as a clear understandable solution to solve it.Possible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer but since this is a successful project , going over several funding cycles with success, it is unlikely to imagine that unforeseen problems will arise.  \r\n\r\n \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": " Relation to personal qualifications: I am a passionate polyglot and am very fond of languages and projects that try to foster communication across languages so I feel confident in assessing projects of this category. Being some time in the catalyst community I know about important resources that might benefit from translation at least in this part of the community. The proposal identifies a valid problem within the challenge: language barriers for potential developers that come from a different linguistic background and maybe struggle to learn english. As someone that has learned several languages himself, I can totally relate to learning english being difficult for people that grew up with a very different maternal language. Since this translation proposal tries to also integrate such people into the Cardano ecosystem, this seems like a really beneficial approach, as it would be a complete waste if many skilled people would be kept out of the Cardano ecosystem due to language barriers. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and has several french-speaking members, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.
