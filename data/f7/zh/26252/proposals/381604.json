This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable Indonesians to learn about Cardano and cryptos in general. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include rise in numbers of Cardano Indonesia Youtube, Instagram followers, workshop participants and bi-weekly participants of the Eastern Town Hall, and rise in proposals submission for Project Catalyst.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Indonesians who know about and are comfortable with Cardano. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. Simple infographics and videos will reach kids as well as adults and inculcate in kids the desire to use crypto more than fiat currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and infographics , and put links to some of the videos/infographics on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. For graphics you can use imgur or photobucket or send them to your instagram page itself. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has  not provided evidence  of the team whose relevant skills and experience are needed to complete the project.

Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as project management , marketing and other costs.   \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Their output is only one video or Instagram post a month.  The price of a video is exorbitantly high. THe price of an Instagra m infographic is also far too high considering their development is happening in Indonesia. Being from a country which also has lower income levels than Indonesia, I can confidently say that these prices are too high to be reasonable. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to create one video or one Instagram post per month.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal  does not provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very high level broad plan but there is no detailed breakdown in the plan. Also as stated above the costs are in my opinion too high. Even creation of intro, logo and banner is given as 200 USD which is high. \r\n\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are not well described. It is a broad level plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects  \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal  \r\n \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should also seek to include the teams FB profiles or Linkedin Profiles with links to their CV or work experience. If a company, then link to the corporate web page or Linkedin Profile . \r\n\r\nTeam members profiles should be included in as much detail as possible. You should also reconsider your budget and if it costs this much to produce, seek to get production done from lower priced providers in other countries. You can get the same quality job for far lower cost and thereby maximise your saving. Also seek to increase your offering from one Video or IG post per month to about 1-2 per week. Otherwise you would probably lose the audience who want daily or weekly content.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a no clear roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.  \r\n\r\nThere are clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal namely the creation of the one video and one instagram post.  \r\nThere is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem but in my opinion creating one video a month or one instagram post would not be sufficient to create the awareness and trust that the proposers intend to have. One video a week or two a week would be more realistic.\r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer. \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer. Try to create more content. Content is key.  Develop metrics that help you to track.   Make as many metrics which you can track easily.
