Another issue is that the meetings are held at a very inconvenient time of 1am (Vietnam Time). It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Vietnamese content for the people in Vietnam regarding Town Hall content.This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Vietnamese to understand everything about Cardano and the Town Hall content.

THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community.

The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 1500 USD to develop a website of this nature is too high. Text to speech convertors may not cost this much. The cost per video has been taken as 360-400 USD which is high for a video of this nature. Typically videos like this are not costed per word but per audio minute. As such a video like this may cost around 200 USD each.Labor cost has been taken as 60 USD per hour which is far too high even by Western standards, leave alone Vietnamese rates.  A Labor cost of 20 USD is more reasonable. \r\nThey have a massive reserve of 1700 USD which I feel is too high.
