It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Amharic audio content for the people in Ethiopia, explaining Cardano blockchain. \r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Ethiopians to understand everything about Cardano and the opportunities it presents. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community. \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of engagementss, and abovementioned key metrics. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Ethiopians to listen to and participate in the podcast thereby increasing knowledge on Cardano.\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject.
