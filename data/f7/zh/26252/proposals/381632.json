Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  measuring increased awareness of the web portal, how much of contribution was happening from the community, how many articles, guides and newsletters are published each week, how many meetups took place. \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of publications, and guides that are created and meetups which are held. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Indonesians regarding Information they receive on Cardano. I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. \r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject.
