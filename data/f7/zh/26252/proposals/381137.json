Amount of content originally created in Polish\r\n\r\n2. Amount of content translated into Polish\r\n\r\n3. Number of users that have joined local Cardano groups\r\n\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\n\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the out\r\nput of information on the website and social media pages. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system. \r\nI have given this proposal a 5 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to write articles and put links to some of the articles if published on social media or mass media, on the proposal itself . Sometimes   reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the article and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading, creation of local language programming with English and local language content.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe proposer has provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to complete the project. They have shown their experience on various media outlets, experience on educational series, various websites that they have founded, SPO experience, and creation of a community on social media channels.  These links are sufficient, but it would have been better to include the social media channels at all in order to verify the size and existence of the community.  I have visted links. The proposers appear competent, having experience in media publishing and content creation.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposer has identified the core team but has not quantified how many team members are needed to accomplish the content creation on various media.\r\n He has rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown in terms of the core leadership. \r\n The budget has been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items which includes server and domain costs, theme creation costs and is a flat rate per word to cover costs of translation,and release of press releases to various sites, mass and social media. This also includes costs of creating podcasts and merchandise. Also carrying out quizzes, kahoots and livestreams on various channels.They have also identified marketing and awareness building costs with ad costs, consultations and other promotional costs. The budget is very reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\n \r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation in terms of the materials to be translated as well as how output would be generated. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described. \r\nThe proposal clearly explains  technical aspects such as translation, website creation, theme creation,creation of podcasts,  editing, publishing which are steps needed in a localization project. The proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation . \r\n\r\n  \r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. These include Weekly, monthly and six monthly output of articles, both translated content and original content, creation of podcasts bi-weekly, and publishing these on online channels, creation of different merchandise and interactions with new members and prospects.\r\nThere are clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal namely volume of words translated , number of translated articles and original articles, Number of podcasts created and published, merchandise created and revenue generated on sales, number of social media ads created, number of google search ads, consultations etc. \r\nThere is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem as well as a clear understandable solution to solve it.\r\n \r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer  .\r\n\r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposer/s have given facts and examples to support their idea of making a Cardano Center where information can be communicated about Cardano in Polish.

Both of them are described understandable clearly not only about what is being done but also how to do.\r\n- The budget is outlined and split into identifiable items very detailed .
