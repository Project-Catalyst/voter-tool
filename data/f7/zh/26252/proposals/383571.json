Nevertheless, the proposal falls short because, as it can be verified in the section \"Use cases and costumers\", in essence, the goal of the proposal is to: \"Translate all the GameChanger wallet interface and components\". That is, the goal of the proposal is simply to translate ONE wallet.\r\nThe value of the proposal for the Cardano Community can be increased by making the translations available to other wallets, preferably in a standard digital format which can be easily ported to other projects.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Yes, the proponents provide evidence that they have completed a project of software development (the wallet).

Having it in multiple languages will allow people to adopt it, and increase users and lovers.\r\nBeyond the LATAM countries, I see other countries in Africa where Spanish or Portuguese is spoken in which people would benefit from that language implementation. In some or most of those countries too, the infrastructures don't allow easy access to technology or to phones with big data capacity.\r\nThe team of proposers is formed by people with experience in the Hosting & Cloud industry; in systems integration and DevOps and who have already developed this tool. It's not a project starting from scratch, but an addition to what was already released.
