For ex: number of SPOs that deploy their solution... ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team gives us the timeline of bi-week working and all their progress will happen in 8 weeks, and the budget breakdown is reasonable for this timeline. \r\nThey have a detailed implementation plan but don't tell more detail about the tech in this proposal, but people can check their job at GitHub. \r\nI wish that I can see some risk-relevant to their plan, It will help me know how they will face potential risks when doing it. By the way, they also have 1 week backup incase disruption, so I think this proposal is feasible.

Due to its interesting content and self-sustainability, this idea has a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. If completed this idea could add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

Very interesting idea!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is completely transparent. He posted a link via Github where we can see all the necessary information about who is behind this idea. It is clear that the proposer has the necessary knowledge and skills to realize this idea.

Proposer states a clear plan with realistic timetable to complete the work and resources needed to realize the idea.
