I understand that the idea is to transfer stake to the chosen pools when the gain sustainability, but I worry that there will be little incentive to gain the necessary delegation in the boost pool to have a meaningful impact, with a large number of pools just sitting around wasting energy and collecting a few ada per epoch while providing no service to the network other than serving as a relay.
