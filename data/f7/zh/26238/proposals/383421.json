This makes it very likely, that the team will be able to set up a summit and connect it with Cardano and blockchain. However, the information provided in the proposal is lacking clarity and content. The word \"cool\" is used too often and should be substituted with examples to demonstrate that the team has a wide knowledge-base of the Cardano ecosystem and the blockchain technology. The team gives a broad overview that it intends to focus on merchandise, NFTs, but also about blockchain technology, developers and futurism. While this might be a good starting point, the team did not provide relevant information on the content of the summit at this moment. The roadmap is a good example, as the first sentence reads \"complete planning, preparation and launch within 3 months\" but it does not give any indication on what content they are planning on doing.
