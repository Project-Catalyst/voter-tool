The budget is reasonable and broken down into identifiable items with rates per hour. 6 Months to complete this project is reasonable. They explain in great detail all the extra features they will ad to protect players and they've attached 2 IOHK papers covering some of the game mechanics they would have to ad. They don't however go into the technical details of what they will use to develop the frontend and backend. Providing the reader with these details will reveal a lot about your skills and will boost voter confidence.

By ridding the platform of any central entity they ensure that this platform is government resistant and will allow a global audience to utilise the Cardano blockchain for online poker. \r\n\r\nWhat's unique about this proposal is they aim to incentivize curbing addiction and it will be very interesting to see what the team's solution to this is. \r\n\r\nIf the incentive structure is set up properly to reward those who gamble responsibly then this could really be an absolute game changer, and go a long way to legalisation in localities where it us currently banned, as the argument against online gambling would fade away as good behaviour is incentivized and thus harm is reduced or atleast curbed in some way.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has not only a Plutus developer, but a former catalyst CA, Emurgo students and even a PhD.

Moreover, I think this project also has some risks and legal obstacles, hope that you guys can figure out some and get some plan to get rid of them. \r\nBy the way, the team also provide some info about the team and referral files of their next steps.

This is because if proposed solution is successfully implemented it provides a useful solution to the targeted problem.
