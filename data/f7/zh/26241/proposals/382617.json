Instead of boring gameplay, the team makes it in a new type that is trendy in the traditional team industry now. This project is huge and must be developed in a long way, but I think with 4-5 years as the team mention in the proposal, it will succeed and make a big impact on the development of the NFT game.

Very detailed problem and solution as well detailed scope of proposal. A lot of resources and links are provided as well. I evaluated many assessments in Fund 6 and 7 and this is definitely one of the most detailed ones. The key challenge I have, is if this proposal fits the Catalyst incubation phase or maybe should be part of the acceleration phase. The amount request is very significant and over 60% of the challenge overall budget which I believe is not inline with the challenge objectives. I would recommend to either have lower budget/milestones or aim to raise money in different ways.

The amount of information provided makes it very time consuming to evaluate in details the proposal (especially in the flash review process) - overall, I would suggest to have a ppt deck presenting the key information and have available more resources as readers wish to expend. I have some good experience mentoring startups and presenting all your project in a more synthesis way will add value in my opinion. One key issue I have is the budget size in relevant to the challenge, and providing revenue projections or other & fund resources plan would have been important to see the longterm viability.
