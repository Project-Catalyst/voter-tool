The team has developed a detailed implementable plan and details of actionable tasks and order of execution are clearly presented with real time within the work will be completed.

The roadmap is well estimated in my opinion, the terms seem concrete, the team is well trained and multidisciplinary in the gaming area.

The need is clear, implementation is already promising. There's enough information about the team and metrics which would help the effective tracking of their progress by the Project Catalyst community.
