Especially, the old one that this team develops is in Cardano ecosystem, so I think both of them will make a strong effect on Cardano community.\r\nBut I'm not sure about how much this new one will impact the Cardano community, and even it merges or not to the old one, I think the team should clear their goals or key metric on developing this new idea.

So better is that they should be clear about the budget and their timeline of work. \r\nMoreover, their referral info and attach clip can help us a lot to visualize what they did and can trust them.
