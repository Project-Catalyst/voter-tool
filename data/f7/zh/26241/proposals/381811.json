The team is transparent which is a great thing. The budget is clearly defined but I personally don't prefere a proponent of large sums. In my opinion, it would be better if the requested amount of $ 80,000 was halved and half of the funds were requested in this Catalyst F7 and half in the Catalyst F8.

Any project that has a time frame of a year is quite risky in my opinion because we never know what can happen. So I advocate shorter time frames. The proposal states a time frame of as much as 18 months, which sounds quite unrealistic for a project like this in terms of the speed of project implementation.
