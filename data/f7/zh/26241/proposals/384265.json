At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date. This is a simple fix for the proposer, they need to due the due diligence on feasibility and i would suggest they reach out to a project manager/mentor to help with future proposals or presentations to a VC.\nA number of people are named in the proposal but it is not clear if these are actually going to be part of the delivery team. In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month. These are sensible assuming the named resource are simply taking this as their permanent salary and they do not need to engage contract resource which could cost significantly more.\nOn the basis of what i have seen from the ideafest video only have confidence to give this 3 stars.\nThere is a note about recruiting marketing and sales people.

It has classical chess mode and a battle royale that includes the champion NFTs. I think it's an amazing idea and a proposal to match. I really like the idea of it, as a chess player myself I would try this game out for sure. There's a clear way to add value to the cardano ecosystem through leveraging NFTs and the blockchain integration into the game. I love that this project has well through out KPIs and metrics. That's something I'm missing in some of the other proposals. The team has thought about possible future challenges and how to overcome them and is listening to what the community has to say. To be honest, I don't see anything missing from this proposal. I think it's a great idea with a great team behind it to back it up.  As a developer, I don't see any issues with the team credentials. Overall should be a great game given the described work is put in the next year. Good luck!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I was able to verify the credentials and skills of the listed people in the proposal. I have no doubt these people will be able to deliver on the game as described in the proposal.

The budget is clear enough and is broken down into understandable parts that are easy to follow. As a developer myself, the roadmap and time frame seem reasonable for the work that needs to be done which shows that the team members have no problem estimating the tasks ahead.  All resources linked in the proposal are relevant and further explain details like how the future process and charity work will be done. The idea is to have royalties from the NFT sales got to charity which is noble. I love the proposers have shown the economic incentives for the players to go on their platform and are not just hoping but have a plan in mind to build a community. Risks and challenges are mentioned in the proposal and have well explained plan of action.  Overall I think the game is feasible and I'd play it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Should have no problem with tracability and auditability.

It is quite complete, both in terms of content and design. We have a lot of information about the project, and we can get to know it in an attractive way. Now talking about the idea itself: this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities. As a bonus, we could still meet one of Cardano's general objectives, which is to promote sustainability, through the donations made (the authors attach a link that is specifically about this, through which we can better understand this part of the donations). I congratulate the team and hope they are funded.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "80 years of experience? In this case, the bidders probably added up the years of experience of each one individually to arrive at this number. This did not make me understand the real experience of the group, that is, how old each one is, and in which areas, etc. It is positive, however, that they already have their developers in Plutus, because from what I've noticed many proposals need these professionals but will still hire them. The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training. The linkedin profiles were also linked, in the end of the proposal. It is also positive how they leave open the possibility of hiring freelancers for design and storytelling areas. That is, in relation to the team, I believe that everything is in order (I was just confused by this story of 80 years of experience). The money asked for funding is also explained very adequately; we know what each small fraction would correspond to for the execution of the project, even though it is a high value (60k) it is quite understandable for the many people who would work here and also the various activities that would take place. It is a large and complex project. The roadmap is attached on a website (https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap), I loved the graphic way they organized the steps, really creative and gives us a good understanding of what would be done and in what order. In addition, from what I understand, the idea is to gradually complete the %, that is, in phase 1, they would update: 20% done, 50%... This would even be a way of auditing the proposal, as I will comment on the next topic .", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Through the attached website, we have a well-organized script with a very attractive design. As I was commenting above, with the passage of time they would update how many % of each step had been done, and with that we could monitor the process. However, unfortunately this is the part that is least addressed by the team, because they do not establish KPIs. They don't tell us exactly some goals to be achieved, they don't predict possible challenges to be faced along the way, etc. We weren't helpless, given the great level of detail about what this game is and how it would all work, but I wish the team had paid more attention to how they audited the proposal.
