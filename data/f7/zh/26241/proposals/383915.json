And after a quick scoop this gives me strong confidence in their success, I think the team is capable of executing their drafted plan. \r\nThe proposal also has a very well structured and succinct description of their goals and timeframes as well as their explanation of their required funds. It also seems as if they have their mission of going through with this vision regardless of the support of project catalyst, which in my point of view is a strong point.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In account of auditability, again I remark that they were succinct and provided a well paced roadmap which in my non-technical point of view seems achievable.

The roadmap is well estimated in my opinion, the terms seem concrete, the team is well trained and multidisciplinary in the gaming area.
