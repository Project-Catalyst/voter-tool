They will ad value to the Cardano ecosystem by making sure the Dapps that gets created on their language doesn't deploy with faulty smart contracts, which in turn will make for a better user experience. There isn't much metrics to compare to the challenge, but they are building an open source product so it is aligned with the challenge. It would have been beneficial to ad more metrics to the proposal. The project is able to scale well as it will be open source.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They provided relevant skills and team via Github page. They already have a working product, they just need funding to ad the feature of verifying smart contracts. The budget is for paying salaries for 3 months to 3 software engineers. The time to complete is 3 months which is reasonable. They go into great detail explaining what features will be added to their Glow language. Even how it will address issues when the programmer makes a mistake. They haven't really considered any risks for their project. Not being aware or prepared for future risks can slow you down.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They haven't provided  a roadmap with milestones for what is being built in the 3 months. Making it hard to track the progress of this project. They also didn't ad any KPIs.

Maybe it could have been better articulated because some of the terminology used sure is impressive, but it's not very explanatory. Perhaps a more simple language would go a long way for the next proposals.  The proposer has already been funded and delivered in a previous fund 5, and has managed to scale and grow the project continiously over time, which is kind bility to run a project. One thing I'm missing currently from this proposal is simple explanations. Voters would have a much easier time understanding simple language in the proposal, and tyou can just link a witepaper or other links for the people more interested in the details. This project sure is unique, and it's something Charles Hoskinson has mentioned several times: \"WE NEED TOOLS FOR VERIFICATION!\". This brings a lot to the table and to the entire cardano developer community.

KPI's weren't mentioned in the proposal and a metric like Usability / downloads per month / linked projects using their infrastructure would have been nice. My recommendation would be to focus on the KPIs as much as they have on the technical part of the proposal, because it's equaly important IMHO. The roadmap is quite clear and the time they've chosen will work out based on what they have already achieved with funding from the previous funds. There is a clear solution to the problem, which is important when you take on such a big challenge.  One suggestion I want to make is for the proposer to put themselves in the shoes of a non-tech-savvy person and read through their proposal, because it's quite hard to read and understand by an every-day-joe.
