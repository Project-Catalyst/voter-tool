There could have been a more clear articulation of why is this important and how will it benefit the cardano ecosystem. I feel like the author should have explained in more detail the idea behind doing this so he can get people behind the idea before starting explanation on the technical part. The key metrics are relevant for the challenge. Nothing was mentioned about scaling and considering the words decentralization and minting were mentioned, I think it would be a good idea to include a \"how will we scale?\" section in the proposal.  This proposal would add to the ecosystem, but I'm no sure how valuable would that something be, because no impact was mentioned or how will this affect the cardano community.
