However this may not have a great impact on the feasibility of the proposal as their plan is to hire an external developer part-time to write the Cardano specific smart contract templates, in fact this is where most of their requested budget is allocated towards (40 out of 45K).\nTheir goals are realistic, the proposal is written in a very down to earth manner and the requested budget seems feasible.

However if a future submission of the proposal will be required I would recommend including these elements.\nI would like to mention that in the case of this proposal specifically the community would need to audit the quality of the technical output as well as the overall completion of the project. We certainly want to be vigilant about wasting community treasury funds, but perhaps in this case it would be even more important to assess the quality of the smart contract templates generated by the project.
