Perhaps in the future the plan could include some details on contingency in case of a drop-out along the way and how funds are distributed (e.g. as montly salary or upon completion)\r\n\r\nThe budget will be used to provide a fair income for the 2 developers adn facilitation. The majority of the funds are destined for other people then the proposers. However the total funds are ~1/3 of the total budget in the challenge.
