Considering the code presented in the git hub repo I believe that the proposer will be able to complete the backlog as projected. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The deliverables as per the proposal are about 8. The deliverables could have been presented in an explicit manner.

This is necessary tooling that is currently missing in the cardano development environment. Making sure new development is properly tested is key for future growth of the ecosystem. Keeps in line with the challenge setting. There is an implicit benefit for the cardano developer ecosystem, because even though code is law, tests confirm that the \"law\" makes sense.  I'm not sure if the proposer has though for the future of the library and what happens if the usage for it grows? It's food for thought. I didn't find any research being done to look for collaborations, which is necessary when the basic infrastructure is missing. Compared to other proposals, I would say this has one of the biggest impacts, but not as well technically defined.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because there was a lack of links and information relating to the developer or organization credentials, I couldn't verify the skillset or capabilities of the proposer. There weren't any mention of team members, and as a developer I know that's a lot of work to be done by one person for the stated time. On that point, the budget seems a bit lite to me, are you sure you wouldn't need more to finish? It's really hard for me to believe the timetable for this and other proposals from the same author will be done in the span of 6 months. I hope the strategy is to get one of the 3 proposals operational and work only on one of them, because I don't imagine one person doing on that work for 6 months for 3 proposals in paralel. The technical milestones, could be better defined, because there's just a mention of an abstract, but not concrete tooling that's going to be used. It would have been nice to say what's the plan for the tooling, besides Bazel, because it covers only a part of the CI/CD(continious integration / continious delivery). There was no mention architecture or any design documents, so I hope it's all written down somewhere, and will be upcomming. There is some mention of future risks like the unstable development environment, and kudos for realizing the road ahead will probably be bumpy. More people should have that mindset. A little research on what other cardano developers are doing, might be a great helper for projects such as these, so community members join forces.  Despite these slight drawbacks I belive this is a good project. Good luck!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's a github project, which for the non-tech people is a repository with code constantly evolving like a pokemon. I din't find any KPIs mentioned in the proposal, which was a shame because a process that is not monitored can not be improved. I'd suggest using weakly package downloads to start with. There was a mention of short term (3-6 months) but I was hoping for a longterm strategy for funding and support of the project. But let's hope we see one next funding round. The description was understandable, so that's always an attribute I'm searching for in any proposal.
