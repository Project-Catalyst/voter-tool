The budget is clearly provided with a simple structure of items and explanations of the calculation base. However, KPIs and Risk (and mitigation) were not provided. Therefore, based on the given information, I am neutral with this proposal's feasibility, I can rate it with a score of 3", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a lack of information: (1) Chain-lib member's profile and external links for verification [how can community know chain-lib members and their ability easier ?]; (2) KPIs, (3) Risk (and mitigation). The current definition of success [the plugin system will be completely rewritten with the two base plugins working; multiple plugins not written by chain-lib are created]  is quite qualitative, not quantitative/measurable enough.
