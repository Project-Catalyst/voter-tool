Almost everywhere we see right now google/FB etc based oauth mechanisms in place. These companies just provide their implementation of these standards and perhaps control also all the data in many ways.\r\n\r\nAn open source solution like this could open up a new paradigm to web3 or even at web2 and people can finally start seeing diverse use case for NFTs.\r\n\r\nFull points from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From experience perspective i fully trust the team, the team has really good experience with Cardano eco system and also have contributed to developer eco system quite extensively.\r\n\r\nThe team details are public and as can be seen have good professional work experience in software engineering.
