Other than that, this project is a great idea to spread the crypto opportunities environment in the Vietnam market. Keeping in mind the price to impact, this project is a no brainer for me and needs to be voted in and implemented. The impact would affect only one market, but it's important to be inclusive in that respect. The proposal identifies a simple to solve problem and has all the necessary skilsl and team to work on it for 3 months. There is a clear added value for the cardano ecosystem, welcoming the viatnamese crypto nerds.  If the need arises the team can work on partial translations as the yoroi project grows.  The proposal add something missing to the ecosystem: the translations for a specific language. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers of the project have the necessary experience and projects worked on and done so there's no doubt they will be able to deliver on the proposed solution. Futher than that, the have linked their profiles, which brings credability and reliability to the projects success. There's a great deffinition of success specifing the plan for the 2 months of work that need to be done and the 1 year support for getting the kinks out. The proposers have shown a clear the type and number or team members necessary to bring the project to it's fruition. There is an outlined budget, I'm only wandering if they aren't asking for too little. But other than that, the budget's great! There's a realistic timetable to finish the translations. A sensible plan is presented that is concrete enough for the purpose of translations. All the resources necessary to implement the proposal are listed.  The proposers have considered risks in this proposal like supporting the translation effort for about a year. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There wasn't any mention of how would a community member be able to track the progress of the translations, which is a bummer, but I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker. In this particular project, there's no big need for KPIs since it's a one time thing. There's not as big a need for KPIs in this specific project, but maybe it would be cool to know how many people use the Viatnamese translations on Yoroi. A prety straightforward roadmap concerning the translations that should be more than enough for this proposal.    Kudos for takingg up the very important task of bringing the Yoroi and the cardano ecosystem to people that don't understand english. I feel this makes cardano a very inclusive environment, and I'm happy to be a part of it. Good Luck!
