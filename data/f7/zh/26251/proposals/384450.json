If the team is able to build a set of tools to parse logs from the FAB making them queriable then they are creating value to the Cardano environment because it is a common goal to lots of projects in the Cardano community. Later if they were used for a relevant number of projects, it would mean the Cardano environment is more resilient because its new Dapps will be less dependent on private SaaS solutions. One point the team could have further explored is the question of scalability their tools will be able to provide. This is extremely important because the robustness of the proposed solution is proportional to its scalability.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The authors seem to have more than enough skills and experience to conduct the proposal successfully from what is outlined in the Relevant experience section, but they could have linked their Linkedin profiles or at least described their past project experiences in the proposal. Also, they haven't described how many team members or which positions will be required to perform the tasks of the project. As per the budget, the total amount is pretty reasonable, but it was not broken down into identifiable items other than the cluster costs.
