How? By establishing a physical presence at the University of Malta's DTL center. The proposal makes a strong business case, explaining that this is just a part of their overall strategy; this poposal includes a defined value proposition, channels, and revenue structure. Although there is a clear connection between the team's approach and the challenge aim, the measurements do not always give clear targets, making the evaluation subjective.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A brief but effective description of the team members is given and the necessary references for verification are provided. The budget section breaks down the final amount requested into 4 items, however, in some cases I think they could have provided more details for a more accurate analysis. You describe partners such as the Catalyst community, University of Malta and relevant companies, here too I think you should have provided more data. What do you mean by Catalyst community?
