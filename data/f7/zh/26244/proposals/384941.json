I think that the creation of a device that helps communities get connected is a must, but they failed to mention how this can encourage mass adoption and bring value to the cardano ecosystem. Nevertheless, I think that, with some creativity, the proposers can include cardano into the device in order to add value to the ecosystem. My suggestion for the proposer is to write a better proposal with the cardano ecosystem in mind.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have provided relevant skills and experiences with links to their github. They also managed to build a functional product that, according to the proposer, is being used in Congo. The team needed to a successful conclusion is also outlined in the proposal. The roadmap is broken down into understandable items. Based only on my intuition, I think that the prices and the budgets are reasonable. A detailed plan of what  they intend to build and how they plan to achieve it is also disclosed in this proposal. Nevertheless, I would suggest to the proposers, to add the challenges and risks they consider upon successful implementation. Apart from that, I believe that the project can be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has provided a roadmap and reasonable milestones to reach their goals.

And that phenomenon only happens in the most intimate and legitimate way possible if what the community pursues means being a little less in the hands of obscurity.\r\n\r\nIf Cardano wants to be in people's lives, it must contribute to changing their lives in ways that actually have flesh and blood flowing through their veins.
