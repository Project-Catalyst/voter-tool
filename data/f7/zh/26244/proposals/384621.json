The role of sport as an instrument to strengthen the spirit of young people in any society is indisputable.  However, the only thing I can visualize are parents sneaking out of the meeting room where Cardano is being discussed to go watch their children play.  \r\n\r\nI think Cardano as an organization could financially sponsor sports activities in the communities as a form of social contribution.  However, producing NLF players and engaging local communities in the Cardano ecosystem are two different businesses, each with their own numbers and characteristics. \r\n\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "For the reasons describe above, I don't think the proposal is based on the objectives of the campaign.

Does he hold? Does he participate in any pool). Unfortunately when the team identity is sketchy.
