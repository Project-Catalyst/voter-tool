Proposers are a crucial Catalyst stakeholder, and this proposal attempts to address a concern mentioned in Catalyst Circle. It is designed to address this demand by establishing a \"Community Hub\" on Gitbook where users may leave feedback and report issues. However, I must admit that I am having difficulty finding a direct link between this proposal and the goal of this challenge. There is a partial alignment for me because because it attempts to strengthen Catalyst's relationship with this vital community. The metrics appear to be relevant to what the author is looking for and Cardano's mission\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Stephen, who is well-known in the community and always a person who offers a lot of value from his expertise, also includes a portion where his experience is detailed, so this aspect of skills and experience looks to be satisfied to me.

In terms of growing and scaling up community hubs, this is very much about providing a plenery style platform for the funded projects of each round to collaborate and support eachother - so in the sense that this group could value-add to eachothers' work it does align with this challenge. \r\n\r\nThe impact is very much focused on the catalyst community, it will grow over time as newly funded projects expand the group. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project was suggested and recommended by the community itself.
