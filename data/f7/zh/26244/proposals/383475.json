The proposal presents a very real problem that a lot of people are interested in Cardano but do not have the time to learn, making it difficult to grasp the increasing number of proposals, affecting the development of Cardano.

The proposed team consists of 3 members with experience in the Blockchain field and also accompanies Catalyst projects from Fund 4. At the same time, Duc Tiger is also the founder of Tiger View team, one of the core groups of the company. . Vietnam in the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, the team has also been funded in Fund 6, so I have full confidence that they can complete this proposal.\r\nWithout a doubt, the team of proponents has the right skill set, is highly motivated and is strongly committed to the Cardano ecosystem. With the experience of the CA and VCA teams, they easily realize the difficulty when voters have to absorb too many petitions while not having much time to evaluate them all. Take this suggestion as a matter of course. It saves voters a lot of time filtering out unworkable proposals. I believe that with the experience and planning presented here, it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented\r\nInterestingly, the proposal's authors explain the idea by presenting the obstacles they will face next.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the properties of this proposal, no timeline is broken down. As stated, the proposed team will start work from the start of the Fund 8 and Fund 9 proposal. It takes about 2 months for them to complete 250 videos in Fund 8 and 2 months to complete 250 videos in Fund 9. .\r\nThe proposal is feasible because it has very specific goals, has key indicators, KPIs and timelines, and is easy to track and evaluate.

Even as a CA, I find it impossible to stay up-to-date with most of the proposals in Project Catalyst. Having 2 minute videos, if properly done, would be of great benefit to the Cardano voters and community. Yet, at this iteration, I feel like the proposal could be very detrimental to the Catalyst experiment, due to the fact that it will make a selection of 250 proposals to be reviewed. That in itself is an influence on the voters and could become problematic for the entire eco-system. The only way to solve this would be to have either all proposals reviewed, or none.

I think it is a good proposal, for many people the information written in Catalyst proposals is difficult to digest. Especially when voting, when a large amount of proposals should be evaluated. Having summaries in video form would be helpful. \n\nI believe this should be done with all proposals though, and not only 25% of them, as this will introduce a selection bias from the video creators.
