It is proposed to address this problem by offering a program to educate 300 young people aged 18 to 29. It is stated that the project will be carried out with the assistance of three partner organizations. I must admit that, while this suggestion aims a noble goal, I am unable to identify a direct link between it and what is required in this challenge. Although there is no section outlining the metrics of success, it is known that the important milestone and metric here is that the 300 young people successfully complete the training program; nevertheless, there is no indication of the community-building activities that will be done.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "A brief description of the proponent's skills and experience is presented, but no references are provided for verification. In this case, both the content and experience of those who will deliver the training program's courses are relevant, and it is proposed that they will count with three organizations as partners, iHub, @iLabAfrica, and vls; however, no reference to the contact persons representing these organizations is provided. The budget is divided into three distinct items; however, in order to conduct a thorough examination, much more information is required. I've included a list of questions that I recommend you answer for future Catalyst cycles. How many training hours are planned? What are the teachers' hourly rates? How much does the rental site cost each day? Are there any refreshments necessary? How many people will be participating in the program's support? What would their role be?\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It is not possible to complete a comprehensive evaluation of this area due to the lack of data. So, here are some suggestions for the proponent to consider for future Catalyst cycles. (1) A roadmap that identifies key milestones and schedule information is essential. (2) Success measures are extremely important in this situation, such as \"XX young graduates.\"\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 7, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The issue being Youth in Kenya not having enough education and required skills which reduces chances of getting hired.

The proposer should also add a roadmap, a timetable and clearly explain the project in detail as well as a broken down budget.
