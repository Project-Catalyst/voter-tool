How? By starting a YouTube channel, he can share his knowledge and establish a community. It appears to me that the problem is oversimplified, that the lack of widespread adoption of these measures is multi-factorial, and that, while I understand your mission and find a partial alignment with what this challenge seeks. It also appears to me that the solution is still \"raw\"; perhaps if you told us about the demographic profile of your target audience and your strategy to capture it, I would be in favor of resource allocation; however, at this time, I recommend the author take as references other similar proposals in the community and material in the community portals so that in future Catalyst cycles, I can come back with a more robust proposal. \r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "From the perspective of feasibility, it is not a difficult proposal to implement; however, it would have been interesting if the proponent presented at least a syllabus of the topics to be addressed, as well as a brief description of how you intend to present decentralized payment solutions to the general public who is interested in permaculture (this is not explained, but by the profile that I understand would be your target audience, at least initially). While the proposal does not provide the proposal leader's name, I was able to identify his qualifications and experience through the link tree. The requested budget is for the purchase of recording equipment as well as the hiring of video editing professionals. I'd just like to point out that having high-quality videos and material isn't enough to guarantee community building; currently, YouTube is a fiercely competitive environment in which you must discover ways to stand out.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Finally, the author provides a 12-week weekly roadmap with a brief discussion of what will occur over the implementation time; nevertheless, there are no obvious milestones in the description. For example, \"audience demographics defined\" should be used instead of \"Finetune demographic promotion.\" Another example: instead of saying \"Build relationships with the community,\" say \" an average of XX number of views was reached.\" Similarly, success metrics must be defined; this is the only way for the community to assess success or failure during the implementation time. I'm going to give it a 3 because, despite the fact that no necessary information was provided, auditing the project is not difficult due to its characteristics.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 8, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The idea in this proposal is not bad but I notice there is a lack of precision of what the proposer wants to build. It's not clear if the youtube channel that the proposer wants to create will be about permaculture or about blockchain technology. I would suggest to the proposer to proposer to resolve that as it's crucial for the evaluation of this proposal. Also, I didn't find anything about the value that this project will add to the ecosystem. I think that this is an important point that can be improved in this proposal. Furthermore, If the youtube channel will be created in english, I will not see a high value for the local community as it'll compete with other bigger and already established channels. All in all I think that there is enough room for improvement of this proposal.(Rating 3)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has not specified his knowledge on blockchain technology. Since the proposer wants to create a youtube channel, I think that a minimum of blockchain know-how is required. There is also not enough informations about the team needed to carry out this project successfully. However, the budget is broken down into identifiable items which is positive for the proposal. Now, I think that 4000 $ to buy starting equipment for the youtube channel is too much. I'd rather allocate more funds to the video production instead, which will add more value to the project. In addition to that, there is only a milestone of 3 months which, to me, is a window too narrow to measure success. Based on all these details, I don't have a positive vote on the feasibility of this project. However, the proposer can turn this around by implementing the advice made above.
