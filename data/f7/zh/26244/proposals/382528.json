But , if it is well addressed, I believe there is a lot of potential to be unlocked. Even though I am not part of the target market for this proposal, I understand that people who are traditionally collectors and art lovers may find blockchain and NTFs to be somewhat abstract. Additionally, I believe that the proposed solution is aligned with the objective of this challenge. During the next six months, the team expects to sell 100 CNFTs and introduce 60 artists to the Cardano ecosystem and CNFT space. To be honest, selling 100 pieces in six months is quite conservative considering that, at the time of this evaluation, approximately 5,000 CNFT had been sold in 24 hours. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team was able to assemble a suitable combination of skills and experiences. Despite the links provided for checking their LinkedIn profile and considering the type of proposal, I would find it interesting if they could provide additional evidence of their areas of expertise in each case. This proposal contains a detailed breakdown of the budget and a description of the possible sources of revenue for the project, both of which I found to be positive. However, I cannot assess the reasonableness of the costs presented, since they are specific to the context in which the gallery will be located, this will not affect my evaluation criteria. I appreciate the team identifying what could go wrong. I notice, however, that you propose a countermeasure in which your website would include a virtual 3D model of your gallery and you don't include the related development and maintenance costs in the budget.  \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Here, I would like to congratulate the team for presenting all the auditability information in such a simple and effective manner. The team describe four major milestones that will lead to a final objective, which includes the sale of 1000 CNFTs, the onboarding of over 1000 users, and the holding of NFT and private events. From an auditability perspective, this is useful in understanding what happens at what time. Additionally, it provides success metrics that are fully aligned with the problem to be solved and what this challenge seeks.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 9, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The success criteria are related to the challenge question. The point of the proposal is that artists, art collectors, and art lovers are connected to the NFTS space. The solution was to create a space to educate artists about NFT and Blockchain technology.

Everything is well planned and presented. \r\nThe only thing make is concern is the sustainability of the gallery since its monthly rent is expensive (3000-5000 GBP/ month).
