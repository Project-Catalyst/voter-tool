It is stated that $2600 will be allocated, but I am not sure what the role of the person will be. Is the person responsible for training the girls directly? If so, how much does each hour of training cost? Another aspect that I have missed here is the description of the risks that may threaten the successful implementation of this proposal.

It worries me if this idea, despite being wonderful in theory, in practice is viable for the current situation in which these women find themselves. It is indisputable how we need to invest in their education, but I don't know if that would be the way at the moment.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, we have almost no information on this research topic. Starting with the team, we don't know who they are, what they do, what their relationship is with the Cardano ecosystem, a small curriculum of what they did before, because they would be qualified to execute this project, in particular. It would be important to present them individually, to say their names, maybe their social media profiles and all that information I mentioned. Nor is anything said about how the financing money would be used. Why 30k? It would be necessary to understand what kind of expenses this would cover: teachers' salaries, their qualifications? Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this. We have a very superficial notion of what would happen based on the expected results: the organization of classes, teacher training, contact with students and so on. But without the exhibition of activities, there is no way to visualize the development of all this.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "This is without a doubt the most complete part of the proposal. Many KPIs are enumerated so we have plenty of information to understand what is being expected and details of possible outcomes. This makes the proposal easily auditable because there is content to be monitored. It would be even better if there were a detailed roadmap here (that way we could analyze the process, not just the end) and also a budget breakdown so that we could monitor whether the money was being used as promised. I believe it would be essential for the team to partially present the results to the community. I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once. Here we do not have a temporal notion of how long this project would take to develop as a whole, but we could think, for example, of a monthly follow-up from the community to the project, together with the team. It would also be interesting if, for example, the results of these teachings in the lives of young women were evaluated. Did they get opportunities from the project? How was the impact? This information could be organized and reported to the rest of the community, through Town Hall, for example. If successful, this project would be achieving many of the Cardano ecosystem's objectives: it would bring people together around the subject (forming a hub), bring new members to the community (which relates to the challenge of f6 \"value on boarding\") and also would benefit Africa (meeting the challenge of f5 and f6 \"grow Africa, grow Cardano).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This seems to be a meaningful idea to the world community in general, and the blockchain community in particular.

You have not specified who the number of group members includes?. What is the route you need to take? I suggest that the budget should be broken down into sections to make it easier to audit.
