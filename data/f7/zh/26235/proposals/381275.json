With this we're really funding specialists who can help to create a friendlier environment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of making California a Safe Harbor independent from SEC is great.

I've understood that USS 35K represents 10% of the total amount needed, however is the whole funding, therefore if this proposal does not finish in first place it would not be funded. Maybe reducing a little the amount solicitated would help.\r\n\r\nOther financial aspect of the proposal is that it says that to get this going it is fundamental to have more partnerships and receive more funds. And since you don't know exactly if you will receive this amount, I understand that this project will not start. Another point is that we do not control whether you'll receive the total fund (350K)  in time to get this going before the political cycle (if there is such a thing \u2013 the point is that the timeline could be altered).

Furthermore their interests are not entirely clear. As they are already pursuing the bill, who financed them so far? How much of the initial 350k is already financed?
