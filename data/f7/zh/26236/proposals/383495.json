A spreadsheet has been provided to show all the different items and hours. The time to prepare proposers for a fund seems reasonable. The have provided a Miro board that has a nice layout of the whole process from start to finish. They explain in detail every step of the process and how they will go about executing it. The only risk I can see that they have considered is the scaling one. Being transparent about the whole process and listening to the community will make them resilient to any future risks and challenges.

For this reason it might not be in the right category.; \r\n\r\nThe impact is global in the sense that it is delivered online, however it is not directly addressing global in terms of cultural diversity and need requirements in terms of language and addressing barriers such as that in the onboarding process.
