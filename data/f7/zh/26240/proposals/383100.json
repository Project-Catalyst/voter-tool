It would be good having this info.\nAbout the budget, I\u2019ve not understood it quite well. I\u2019m missing a more broken down information. Since you\u2019re using the money just for marketing and sales, it should be added where are you intending to advertise, for example, for how long and which methods are going to be used to do it and check its reach.\nThe timetable seems fair to develop what you\u2019re proposing.\nOne point that I\u2019m missing is the logistic strategy. I\u2019m wondering here if you\u2019re going to be only a platform which connects the seller and buyer or you\u2019re planning to have some logistics solutions. I\u2019ve seen this site here (https://www.liv-ex.com) which looks like your proposal, however they have some warehouses to implement logistics. Here in Brazil we have some fidelity clubs which send different wines every month to the subscribers, but they too have their own logistic net (or they provide this service, not having the actual places). Therefore, you might find that providing this service to the seller is a way to increase their participation.\nWould be great to have a risk map, considering marketing effectiveness, logistics (is it going to sell all around the world?), seller stock, etc.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It should be added some more KPIs like volume of transactions, number of countries supplied, etc. It would help to track the development of the platform.\nMoreover, since it was not defined the advertising methods, it\u2019s quite hard to verify its effectiveness and audit it, needing more information (method, platform, tracking, etc).

First, its not clear how this application would leverage blockchain and smart contract technolgies in relation to regular market place or plataform for wine selling. More details on this could be given.\nSecond, its also not mentioned the potential market for this business, which makes it difficult to assess its full impact. for instance, it says, waiting list are hard to get into, but it could also say how many people are trying to get on these lists and how many there are in the lists. However, I particularly like that the business development part will happen in paralell from the technical development. It would be nice also to see the business model that is being thought for this DApp or how it intend to get revenue from. It could be from a monthly subscribe fee, transaction fee, etc.\nI'd also provide more information on communication strategy to target audience. How will they be reached and what kinds of advertising would be made?\n\nImpotant to say that proposal is aligned with challenge as it will likely increase \"Number/growth of application output\", \"Number/growth of application transactions\", Total \"volume of Ada involved in application transactions\" and other challenge KPIs.\n\nIn general, the idea is good but proposal could better explore the advatnages of smart contract (specially for those not very familiar with it) and the total impact, considering number of potential users.\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are very few information about the team. It only mentions that 3 people are committed and their general experience, with some vague terms (as wine world connections). To make this part better strucutured, it would be imporant to see their individual capabilities and experience, have linkk to verify the information and bring more concrete example. For istance, when it is mentiones \"wine world connection\", it could say with whom is this connection and what level of connection is this, if any toher project was already developed with them, etc.\n\n\nThe plan is sound as it is time-framed and contain acitivites and deliverables.

It would be imporant though, to see some targets spread out in time, to check its evolution and see if its going accordin to plan.\nOther possible metric to add is someway to measure the number of reccurrent purchases from same costumer.
