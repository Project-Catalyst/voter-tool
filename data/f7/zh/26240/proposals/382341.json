Moreover, this does not just increase adoption but give opportunities to unsung creators that want to share their work and skills on the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer have even set milestones that they want to achieve and gave detailed overview on how creators can benefit using the dApp.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The front-end interface for Bluetook looks alot like Facebook, and I believe it will easily adopt users to use it. Given the team members that have experiences in various fields, I think the dApp can be developed successfully. In addition, the whitepaper have clearly planned for its ICO tokenomics.  The main concern are risks management that the proposer have not mentioned. (Such as, when both party of creators agree via smart contract to create something, what are the risks involve in doing so? What happens if once they have agreed on the smart contract and the \"get together\" does not actually happen? How do creators avoid from being scammed through this?). These are essential for bringing confidence to the users/voters.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The funding required are well allocated in terms of business, development and marketing. On the whitepaper, the proposer have mentioned all phases to achieve their goal on gaining users. And based on the proposal above, I do believe that the proposer wants to kickstart on the MVP stage within the 3 months as the budget has stated. Roadmap are detailed, with integrations on Artano (marketplace) and galleries, have shown that the proposer's vision of the project.

The proposers didn't outline how this would add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

The project offers a fair overview of what they want to achieve in the 18-month timeframe, but the budget doesn't match what they are setting out to achieve. What's being asked is less than what is used in their budget breakdown. I didn't see any relevant challenges risks that the team will face as to whether or not it will hinder the project's success.
