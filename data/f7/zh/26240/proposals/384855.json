They don't have any metrics for this proposal as it is just an audit. Perhaps adding the initial proposal's metrics would help give the voter an idea of what this project's intentions is.

The budget is an estimate of how much the audit will cost. They will carry the extra cost and if it is less they will use it to pay for interns. The time frame allocated for this audit seems reasonable as they still plan to launch in Q1 2022. They explain a little about the project and how it will be built, but anyone new to this project will have to go back and look at the first proposal to see what it all really is about. Maybe copying the first proposal and pasting it and only changing the budget allocation would have been a better approach to writing this proposal. With a few changes here and there. Just to keep new comers informed of all the mechanics of the proposal. No risks were considered in this proposal. Don't know about the initial proposal, but letting the reader know you are aware and prepared for risks will boost confidence in the execution of your project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with milestones have been provided, but no KPIs because the proposal is for an audit. It would still be beneficial to ad KPIs from the initial proposal as it give any new voters the info they need to make a proper judgment. They want to know how they can track your projects success. They identify the problem of having unaudited smart contracts which causes trust concerns and they solve this by getting a 3rd party to audit their smart contracts.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_140", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 9, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a project that had been fully supported by the community to create a robust and fair competition in Dapps ecosystem in Cardano. It is an awesome idea and if an audit is required to make the project more acceptable by the community then it is worthwhile for the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the information provided, the team has more than enough qualification and experience to ensure that this proposal is fully implemented. \nAlso considering the well articulated milestones as a guide and the contigency plan that was put in place over the suitability of funds requested or otherwise,am convinced that this proposal are in good hands.\nHowever, I would expect that the team should have done its homework and given us a definite budget for this proposal and not some tentative amount.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree that considering the nature of the proposal being contracting a third party auditing firm, the only realistic and reasonable success metric has been considered which is enough to monitor the progress of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_9", "no_vca": 30, "ne": 3, "ng": 18, "nfo": 9, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a dispute resolution platform that would be decentralized. Since the proposers are building a platform we could say it's in the right challenge setting, although there is an argument to be mt this is just a sub task of the whole idea - auditing and therefore it could be judged as just the auditing sub task of the whole proposal. After watching the video I was able to find meaning for the Cardano ecosystem, because there's a need for a public court to resolve disputes so kudos for running with this idea. If I was to judge the underlying proposal for the whole platform, I'd say it aligns with the challenge setting, but if I just have to focus on the auditing part, I'm not so sure it matches the setting. I don't believe there will be need for scaling, because auditing is usually done not so often, but it still would have been nice to have some more details on what people or firms were contacted to check where this budget is coming from. I'd say the proposal could have been a bit more detailed, because it left me with lot's of questions like: Who did you contact to do the audit? This proposal sure brings value and adds a missing piece of the puzzle and you could say it fills a void. As a developer myself, I can't speak with authority on what's necessary to do an audit, but a bit more details that explain this process and needs would have been helpfull. Overall I like the proposal, but this is just the audit part of it and because I have to judge the proposal and not the idea, I would deduct a point for lack of details. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "No question, there's enough evidence like references, links to linkedin profiles and these are real and known members of the community like Viktor, so I'd have no worries about the skills of the team to implement the proposal. There's a team gathered already, which brings confidence and credability. I do have a problem with the budget, because it's just stated and not actually broken down. What the authors could have done is say: we've contacted these people and this firms because ... and they've given us such and such feedback and offers. As it stands now I don't have a point of reference, because I just see a number 30k and I'm not sure what value will these funds incur. The timetable seems a bit strange to me because they're asking for the funds now, so they can use them in 3 months time and if there are some hurdles along the way of the development of the platform, these funds would just stay and wait for the finished project and loose value all the way there. Keeping in mind the current inflation is 8% on average, I'd wait for the next funding round and ask for the funding for auditability after there's something to audit, but that's just my opinion. TBH I don't know how could I verify that this audit has been done, once it has. I expected to be presented with the audit document once it's been done, but there was no mention of that which was unfortunate.  What bugs me is in the Detailed plan section of the proposal was left blank. Just leaves a bad impression that not as much effort was put into the audit proposal as the rest of the idea and platform.   Overall I think the team is great and they would be able to find an auditing firm to finish the job, but the funds could be better explained.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I didn't see any way of tracking if the audit has been done or not and the authors didn't mention anything in the proposal about sharing the audit report so tracability would be a challenge for me.  In this proposal I wouldn't judge the metrics and KPIs so much because the auditing process would be done by someone else. There's a clear problem stated and a solution is clear. There's just a lack of clarity on the details IMO.   For the above mentioned reasons I don't think this proposal is tracable and a regular community member would be able to follow along.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 13, "ng": 13, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u6765\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53cc\u8d62\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5408\u7ea6\u3002", "experience": "Loxe Inc.\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u5728\u9ed1\u5ba2\u9a6c\u62c9\u677e\u4e2d\u83b7\u80dc\u7684Plutus\u548cAtalaPRISM\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\uff0cGimbalabs PPBL\u8001\u5175\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002"}
