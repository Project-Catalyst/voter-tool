The proposal effectively addresses the challenge. This is a game changer and has the potential of bringing new and experienced users from Ethereum unto the cardano blockchain once we begin to see several integrations of this sort.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer and team have the desired knowledge and skill to execute the task. The proposer has provided relevant links that is enough to help assessors make an informed decision. The budget is on point but not detailed enough.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has in a place the key metrics, roadmap and a projection of how success will look like after the project is executed.

However, it might be good to provide elaboration for the rationale behind integrating with checkNFT.io in terms of why it would be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem, how large of a benefit will it be, and why. There is definitely potential for this to scale so everything looks good except for the elaboration part (coming from someone who's not that familiar with the space as of yet)! As such, I would give this 4 star for impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There seem to be few technical components involved that might make it difficult for the idea to be actualized and even if there are, the proposal appears to be self-sustaining afterward with minimal input needed. The LinkedIn profiles attached do give people the sense that this project is in good hands, not to mention the connection with the co-founders of the platform. However, it's worth noting that one of the link to the LinkedIn profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dulub) is broken and it might be good for it to be fixed. Overall, the proposal is absolutely feasible and I can see it be implemented without much of a hiccup.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The budget estimate seems appropriate and is tagged to specific actions and objectives to be achieved. KPIs are available to measure the success of the proposal along each milestone, and a clear roadmap has been provided.
