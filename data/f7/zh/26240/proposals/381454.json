There were success definition and somekind of a roadmap, but I didn't see any metrics, which was a bit of a letdown. Not sure if the project will be able to scale as well, because I didn't see a possible challenges section even though there were such accepted comments. The proposal is lacking key metrics like user adoption, growth rate and so on. It's a unique proposal to be sure. I haven't seen anything of the sort. As a developer, I'm not too sure on the technical part, because no details were specified. Overall I like the idea, but the proposal could have been more detailed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I didn't find any references or links to any kind of credentials. There was a presentation linked, and there were some team members there, but I couldn't match them with the names of the proposers so I weren't able to verify the members that plan to work on this proposal. Unfortunately that brings the credibility of the project down. I see there's some idea of the type of team members, but they haven't approached them yet or at least that was my impression after reading the proposal again. The budgets is clear enoiugh, although it's a bit strange for the developer experts and marketing, business & customer operations to have the same low salary, but kudos if they manage to find these people. I'd say the timetable is realistic only if they already have found the people to work on the project. The proposal might have done a better job at explaining the technical implementation of the sharing market, but I won't hold that agains them since I don't thing they haven't found the devs yet.   One thing that IMO is lacking is the consideration of challenges and risks. What would happen if a gadget is broken once its lended. Are there any safety mechanisms in place like locking some token in or any kind of value before borrowing a gadget? How would legal disputes be managed? Does the smart contract hold weight in court? These are all important questions that weren't mentioned.  Overall I like the proposal, but I don't think it's feasible in it's current state.

There are no metrics to speak of, but there was a small definition of success table, which is a start. The roadmap is a bit coarse and could be a lot more detailed. The problem and solution statements are clear enough.  I'd suggest to the proposers to put themselves in the shoes of the voter and take a look at their proposal.
