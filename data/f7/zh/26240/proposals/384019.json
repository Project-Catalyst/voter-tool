This proposal is worth to be further assessment because it helps address the challenge, is a great concept for a DApp, and is a good way to put Cardano to use. Overall the requested 15K and details and breakdown of the costs seems still very much high-level but already gives good indications. A more deep overview of the costs and budget allocation might be beneficial.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A proposal without a way to track progress becomes very vague, with still little information with limitations in confidence levels of the execution phase.

However, in my opinion the write up could have been better. The detailed plan for example could have been a scenarios based examples e.g. 1. User sets triggers to buy ada at every 4 hour candle finish, if price is reduced by 4% and if it is increased by 10% then sell 25% of the ada. \r\n2. Put a new buy order (or do not have any sell orders) on certain days if market volatility is high, i.e you will need some sort of Oracle connection to your dapp to keep track of prices in real time.\r\n\r\nTherefore i can not give it full stars, i would suggest to the proposer to give as best impression as he could about his idea to the community to really have big chances in getting approved in funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The experience of the developer is in Python and Data science and as a senior developer myself I think there would be a learning curve for the developer for development on Cardano.\r\n\r\nThe proposer is proposing either to hire one OR become himself by joining a course. In my opinion there have been plenty of courses already out there, especially plutus pioneer program is all available on youtube, with discord channels to help out with technical details. So i see no reason why he should wait for joining a course :) as if he is really serious about this project, imo he should be already doing it by now and could have mentioned this in the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe plan is well split into the months 0-4, first months he mentions is all about hiring a cardano SC dev or becoming himself one, so i am fine with it. However, second month and 3rd month are already an MVP and advanced  version of this dapp. I have a feeling given the experience of the proposer, i am not so confident in these timelines. \r\n\r\nFrom the launch dates perspective i can see that there is definition of success given, but what is missing is some initial ideas on how those X users will onboard to start using this dapp ? Additionally, budget is well split and i think it also covers the training of the individual, but i dont understand again why he should wait for such a training when trainings are already available, especially for an experienced developer like the proposer.\r\n\r\nAN overall, i am not in agreement neither in disagreement because i think there are just too many open points for which community does not have sure sort answer.

For instance for the start itself it is two options -- Hire a cardano dev OR become one himself. This must be elaborated further, e.g. If proposer is waiting for the funding to go through, so that he could spend time learning plutus then he should mention the reasons on why he can not start learning now and wait for the first month ? \r\n\r\nAlthough the proposer is very transparent with the KPIs details that he is not experienced with them, however, it is no reason to not have digged a little deeper and provided simple bullet points on how progress can be tracked on a week by week basis. e.g. You are willing to  learn Jira tool, and use Agile practices to help keep community on track with the progress of this dapp\r\n\r\nFor me personally, it is all about showing a clear intent, motivation and passion when you are presenting your idea and asking for fund to the community. The community can only audit what you represent here in written, not how good individual you are personally. Therefore, my suggestion to the proposer is to have look onto successful funded ideas from previous rounds to have a better understanding on how to represent yourself and your idea in best possible manner.

The proposal fits the challenge settings since there's a dapp being built that helps the ecosystem. This implies a clear value to the community and to help with some finantial education and habbits. The KPIs seem relevant to the challenge as well, since they're about adoption. The scaling up part for this project might be hard considering the proposer states that he's a beginner in the field and has no experience with writing smart contracts which is ok, but might bring the speed a bit down when trying to scale up if necessary. As a developer, I feel his pain and curiosity of learning and doing something new in practice. I believe this will be a nice addition to some already existing dapp, and the proposer might want to make his SC as extensible as possible and try to team up with someone else. I don't have any other concerns for this proposal. Overall I like the impact it's going to have over the community. It's going to be a positive one.

The proposer has an idea of the potential teama members he needs to get the proposal to it's finish line, but right now plans to do the work himself, which is a good idea to run with in the begginging. The budget is outlined clearly and is broken down enough to be simple and sensible. THe plan is realistinc and the timetable seem so as well. There is not a lot of detail provided on how the proposal will be implemented, but that's normal considering the proposer plans to build those skills along the way, which is admirable.   The author might want to thing about future challenges for the implementation of the proposal. My suggestion for the authors would be to take a look at other proposals and ask if they don't need this feature in their applications and asks to join. I think the community is prety good in onboarding and developing people that have the desire to build something.

Proposer doesn't explain how it works. I've been trying DCA bot attached on crypto CEX, but this bot need a custodial (a place for our money).

On Binance it can go as low as 0.075% fee per transaction, while Cardano have a fixed minimum of 0.17ADA per transaction, with additional fees (measured per bytes).

The proposer intend to hire a professional Cardano Developer, but it will be difficult to hire the right person if the proposer doesn't have prior knowledge in Cardano smart-contract.

The roadmap also didn't manage to explain much, as in how to achieve those goals in a detailed and technical way. As I'm a Plutus Pioneer myself, I can fairly say that the proposer still have lack the knowledge on how smart-contract work in Cardano, and it is unlike what we conventionally use in account based model like Ethereum.
