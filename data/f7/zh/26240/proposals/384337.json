The initial claim seems plausible:  the onboarding of a unique decentralized token holder (in this scenario an ICO called \"mite\" and a native token called \"LOL\") who needs a wallet capable of staking and transacting in these tokens.  However the their whitepaper indicates an issue:  they intend to do this on their own \"Ubuntu blockchain\" and that they will only temporarily use Cardano while they develop this \"more decentralized blockchain\".  There is no explanation given as to why they require a move away from Cardano, or why existing dApps and wallets within the Cardano ecosystem do not meet their need for a wallet.  From this, it is not clear exactly what their problem statement is trying to synthesize:  do they need a Cardano wallet, or something else, and what is wrong with existing Cardano wallets and native tokens?  The proposal does not appear to provide any long term impact on Cardano.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The existing team proposes to hire the development team (smart contract developers, dApp developer) after being funded, and they indicate they have teams lined up, but they do not provide any evidence of these teams skills.  A good question to answer would be whether they plan on tapping a Plutus or Marlowe programmer for these jobs. The funds requested seem odd:  even at high rates, the funds requested for the wallet developer amount to almost 300hrs of development time, while the rates for the smart contract developers amount to over 500hrs of development!  The proposal would be much more likely to be funded if this contract were shopped around a bit more.  The implementable plan is a bit sparse -barely two items: develop wallet, launch wallet.  It would be helpful to see a much more granular breakdown of milestones, actionable items and certain indicators of a deliverable project, such as development schedules or deliverables, and then to parse those out in accordance with the budget.  That would lead to a better understanding of the scope of the task.  Finally, a dApp rollout faces certain obstacles, such as testing and errors, and there is no mention here of how such risk could be mitigated or absorbed.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The 3-month time horizon for completion simply lacks enough detail to assess where audits could take place or be effective.  Without metrics or KPIs there is not a lot to go on for suggesting improvements here.  One possibility would be to consider target numbers for users onboarded to the wallet, or tx volume on Cardano for the tokens.  For this project in particular, with its planned migration to its own blockchain, another metric to consider would be something that shows a potential benefit to Cardano, such as volume of ADA transacted over time, or use of Ada plugins for commerce, or some such.  There does not appear to be a lot of crossover between this project and the Catalyst community at large, so it may be beneficial for the proposers to suggest means of transparency for the community to follow project progress, perhaps with dedicated videos or posts on the OST site.  Outside of these clarifications, I do not think there exist very good avenues for transparency and accountability to the community for this project.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "OST\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5c06\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u94b1\u5305\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u50a8\u5b58\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7231\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u4ee3\u5e01\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u94b1\u5305\u5c06\u6253\u5f00\u4ed6\u4eec\u514d\u8d39\u83b7\u5f97\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "experience": "\u7814\u7a76\u5458-\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6-\u4f5c\u5bb6-\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6-\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u3002\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d22\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5e08\u3002\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u6559\u7ec3\u3002\u5546\u4e1a\u89c4\u5212\u5e08\u3002"}
