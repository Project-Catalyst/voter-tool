This proposal align with the solution of the challenge, that is to attract more developer to build on Cardano. Looking the documentation on GitHub proves that it will able to scale in the future since it is an open source and everyone can contribute. That being said, it would be better if this proposal could articulates the benefit of how porting @chain-lib library into WordPress plugin would would be -not only beneficial, but also- necessary. For example: explaining the demand of how many WordPress developer are looking for crypto payment gateway \u2013especially with Cardano\u2013, hence by creating this plugin it will increase more adoption and integration for Cardano ecosystem. That way, we could see and understand the demand behind this, and not just as a \"nice to have\" WordPress plugin.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Relevant experience is proved by giving GitHub repo that already have their work in it, being an SPO, Alonzo Purple tester, and Plutus Pioneer 1. However, it's hard to verify those things, since the proposer doesn't disclose their full name and we couldn't find any track record other than their Github repo. It would be better if this proposer include their Linkedin account. The proposer will be working on this alone, so it will be a one person project. Seeing the timetable span across 6 months, it seems too long seeing that the proposer will only work for 37 + 80 = 117 hours in total.
