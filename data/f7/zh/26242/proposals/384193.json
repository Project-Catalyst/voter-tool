It is a fact that access to Real Estate projects is limited to a few people who have historically invested in these types of projects. The entry barrier is often prohibitive. If this proposal were to be implemented successfully in the region, it would provide significant opportunities. This is because it will open up the possibility of investment in this type of project to a new class of investors. Unfortunately, the proposal fails to provide any details regarding expected results. I believe it is essential to understand what segment of the real estate market they are planning to target: Residential or Commercial? Commercial? Tourism? In which country? Which country would serve as a pilot project? Moreover, it is necessary to know what percentage of the market they expect to reach. However, no information is given regarding this matter.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I believe that the team needs to collect profiles containing skills and experience in order to successfully implement this proposal. Blockchain, experts in setting up and running DAOs, Real Estate, Legal / Regulatory, Marketing, etc. Sadly, no links or documents were provided to verify the experience described in the proposal. It is impossible to assess the reasonableness of the budget without a description and breakdown of it. The proposal fails to present risks and challenges sections, especially since this type of project is rife with risk, particularly regulatory risks that should have been described and counterproposals presented to mitigate those risks.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal author identifies three milestones over the next three, six, and twelve months. These are, however, implementation milestones rather than success metrics. Additionally, the last milestone indicates \"communicate the project to the community\", which is quite confusing. Exactly what will be communicated? What results can be expected? For future catalyst cycles, I recommend the team ask themselves these questions, among many others. I would like to congratulate the team for coming up with such an interesting idea. It is just a matter of emphasizing a better description of what it is.
