It does not only help grow the Cardano ecosystem in Latin America but even helps relieve human suffering. Every individual that doesn't have to go to greedy loan sharks is a success story. Perhaps the next step is to turn the loan sharks in to ADAentrepreneurs. :)\r\n\r\nAlready Grameen Bank proved that unbanked and underbanked communities are trustworthy and now this type of modern \"Collaborative Credit Scoring\" mechanisms help popularize that fact.\r\n\r\nI like the team's ready-for-collaboration thinking: \"We can even facilitate our credit scoring to other Cardano dApps who can benefit from our credit scores.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A solid team with 10 members publicly listed in LinkedIn, a reasonable expansion roadmap and already existing product. What more can you ask? Well, you can ask partnerships. They have even those. A word or two from Ken Olling (MELD) would have helped legitimize the said partnership but I guess we'll just take your word for it. \r\n\r\nThe only open question remaining is this: What can the ISO/ISPO participants do with the native tokens? In the comments section the answer is \"Our token will be used by our users to get endorsed to get the loans in stablecoins / fiat\" but what will I do with the token if I'm nowhere near in Latam region? If you can answer that convincingly, I might just become one of those ISO/ISPO participants.\r\n\r\nLater the plan is to move the off-chain microloans on-chain but the team needs to come up with a sidechain or state channel solution to make sure the fees are kept to the minimum. They reveal in the comments an interesting detail: \"we are lending even bus tickets\".\r\n\r\nRegardless of these possible caveats, I am confident in the team to implement this initial plan and to find answers in the open questions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Although there's not much detail about the deliverables and KPIs, it's a fairly straightforward plan: employ one developer to set up the stakepools and another one to take care of the native token minting and distribution.
