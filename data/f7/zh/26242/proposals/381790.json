Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation.
