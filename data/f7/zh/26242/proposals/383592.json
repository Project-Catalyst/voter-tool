This solution is very well suited to the demands of the challenge, in that it proposes to develop the adoption of the LATAM region and contribute to the Dandelion network, developing new business opportunities and circles within the LATAM SPOs community.

The fact that they have already successfully deployed and sized their own Dandelion node is an indication of confidence.
