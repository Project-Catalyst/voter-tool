The proposal straddles two campaigns, the Grow LATAM and the Atala Prism challenge and as such the proposers have an additional proposal more focused on the project technicals in the Atala Prism challenge. \r\nThe project has a clear path to adding value to both the Cardano ecosystem and the LATAM community, initially focused in Brazil. Onboarding users into Cardano through something as fundamental as recruitment is a good way to attract people and maintain them as users. The initial target of finance, banking and insurance targets a user base likely to recognise the opportunity provided to them and also likely to delve deeper into the Cardano ecosystem.
