In this proposal case, in a very detailed step-by-step process. From their extensive and meticulous approach in formulating the initial teams, in breaking down the development of this platform into multiple phases, in breaking down the budget and team needed and into managing the expectations of each phases, these proposers clearly had this idea in their bag for a while. It seems all they needed, all they searched for was that final element, the funding. A source of funds that suits their vision where teachers are the one who decides the curriculum, where teachers are given their proper intellectual and financial appreciation. Although this is speculation but a proposal this extensive is not formulated in a matter of weeks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A general overview of their background is given, then add to that a more detailed look into their experiences are stated clearly in the proposal, to top it off links to all their team members LinkedIn are given. A detailed budget is also given, broken down into their according post and each are given their specific actions. Having things broken down like this make gauging their budget far easier. With that said their budget is very much reasonable for the amount of work and the quality of individuals behind them. This also is transferred to their implementation plan that is conscious to not bite too much than the team can handle. Unfortunately though, they have not taken account the risk and challenge they could face. This is an important factor when creating a proposal for it takes out the 'this is my baby' factor. One needs to be objective in creating a start-up like this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Roadmap is clear, the development process of the product is clear, the milestones are clear, where each and everyone of them are accordingly detailed. Where one needs to know what the end product will contain is explained. Where one needs to know the milestones which as progress indicators are also available. KPI's are detailed and large majority of them can be measured for the are accompanied with clear numbers. Problem statement and solution are solid and provides a great bedrock to flesh out the proposal. Almost stellar job!

I strongly agree with the problem statement in the proposal. Teachers' education is key to students' success, but most teachers and students don't know about blockchain and Cardano. The proposal aims to create a platform where high-quality educational content (about blockchain and Cardano) is produced by teachers (and researchers,  educational practitioners, and students in Brazil) and they are also the users and validators. The proposal is also able to scale to address future challenge by widen it for the entire Latin America.

The proposal focuses on phase 1 (the short term): to build digital educational resources for school and curriculum innovation. The budget is very clearly split into identifiable items and reasonable to achieve the set goals. Because of the continual proposal in long term (phase 2), the plan is provided very verifiable in this regard.\r\nIn addition, the proposal describes the resources necessary to implement in detail (the link of resources content is included).\r\nBesides, reference for data, contents which is mentioned in the proposal, is included fulfilling in the last section of the proposal (just right above the line 'requested fund).\r\nDue to strong points above, I strongly agree the proposal is fully feasible.\r\nHowever, I would recommend the team should consider challenges and risks relevant to the successful implementation.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides information which is very sufficient to audit the progress and its success: Roadmap with milestone and time horizon, Metrics/KPIs, clear understandable description of the targeted problem as well as solution that addresses the problem.
