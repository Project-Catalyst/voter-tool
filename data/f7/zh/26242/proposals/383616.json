In these current days people that cannot access a smartphone will not be interested in Cardano (in general), as they will be more worried about the most basic necessities of life, so the impact is bound to be low. But this is likely to attract other economic classes like lower middle classes, which i believe should be the target market. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team presented is highly skilled and experienced, this is verifiable not only from their CV's but also from the projects they have developed in the past e.g. the GameChanger wallet which i have used.  A succinct plan is presented showing what will be done and when and the timings seem realistic. A clear budget breakdown is also presented showing estimated man hour costs and material costs.

Starting with the experimentation in Argentina and in a will to extend it globally.Their positive impact seems to be a conscious one, not least through their sustainable development in their aim to reduce poverty.
