Unfortunately, it is unclear what impact this proposal aims to achieve; they only mention that they will conduct marketing and travel to countries to meet the artists. It is unclear to me, from what I can understand, how the idea of creating \"the first Real State DAO\" is related to the problem and the solution they propose. For future catalyst cycles, I recommend that the team focus on studying, estimating, and specifying in their proposals the impact they aim to achieve.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "To successfully implement this type of proposal, I believe that these skills and experiences are required; expertise in haskell or plutus, experience in creating DAOs, legal and regulatory expertise, as well as marketing and artistic background. Unfortunately, there were no links or documents provided to verify the experience described in the proposal. This budget lacks a description and breakdown, which makes it difficult to assess whether it is reasonable. There is also no description of the potential risks that may arise during implementation. In future Catalyst rounds, I recommend that a detailed description of the team's skills and experience be provided, as well as links to verify the skills described in the proposal. Likewise, it is important to provide a detailed and itemized description of the budget.

Due to the lack of clarity regarding the impact they would like to achieve, it is difficult to determine whether such a first milestone would be reasonable. In my opinion, the three milestones are more like milestones than success metrics, so they are not very auditable.
