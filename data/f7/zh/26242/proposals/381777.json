We can conclude that the course will be led by the person behind this whole project but the question is whether it will be feasible individually or a team is needed? In the detailed CV we can't find the necessary experience, skills and knowledge that the lecturer should have. The budget is clearly presented but it would be much better if it was divided differently. Maybe to require half the budget in this Catalys F7 and half in the Catalsy F8. Holding a lecture for 6 months is a challenging job and is not a safe investment. But if they had a 3-month lecture, it would be easier to follow the development of the project and influence the improvements. There is a detailed implementable plan and it is very well developed as well as details of actionable tasks and order of execution are presented. The proposal offered a timetable to complete the work but in my opinion it is not realistically presented. As I already said there could be a much better brake down budget but also a time frame from 6 months to 3 months of lectures. We can find in the proposal a clear explanation of technical aspects and technologies for implementation but there is a lack of insight into possible risks and they could be especially in online workshops. What if the students don't come? It would be good to address the possible risks.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not have a clearly defined roadmap in terms of date or for exmaple (Q1, Q2, Q3) when the course will take place.

Boosting the Cardano ecosystem would be achieved by associating the blockchain with high-quality scientific content in a country that values academic achievement and looks up to its teachers and researchers. By moving cryptocurrencies in general and Cardano in particular out of the realm of a tool for speculation and into the curriculum for higher learning, the continent's view of Cardano will indeed grow.
