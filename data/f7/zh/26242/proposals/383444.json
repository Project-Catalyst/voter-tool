Proposal to reduce socio-language barriers by translating Milkomeda documents from English into other languages\r\nThis proposal is more of an idea than a concrete proposal.

The more people know about the mind behind the project, the easier it is to trust. Potential team members will also want to know more about you and your abilities.

No success objectives or KPIs were provided. The proposal is fairly simple to understand but it would have been good to know more on the success metrics side where the cut off is for translations. For instance this proposal could fund three months of keeping translations up to date and we expect to request further funding after that. Or perhaps instead we don't expect the documentation to change much and this will be the only proposal we need so this proposal covers 12 months and that information can help form some of the success measures or KPIs.
