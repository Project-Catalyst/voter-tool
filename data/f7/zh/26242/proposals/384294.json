I believe this is relevant for the community because diversity in any organization promotes factors such as creativity, better decision making, flexibility, respect, and improved brand image. From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates. Will they become part of the educational staff in the future? Mentoring could also be provided for the development of future proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal does a great job describing the characteristics of the two leaders of the project. Daniel and Maria manage to combine skills and experiences that combined with a partner like LABORATORIA, make a very strong team. For this project it is essential to have a deep knowledge of Haskell or Plutus, which from what I understand will be the mentors they are planning to hire. So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate. As a result, it would have been beneficial if the team had included in the proposal actions to reduce or counteract this risk.  \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With regard to auditability, the team has provided a successful description. There is a roadmap in 5 phases, which I consider to be well explained, and enables the community to understand what will happen at each stage of the implementation process.
