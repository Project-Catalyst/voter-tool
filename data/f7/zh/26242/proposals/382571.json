Monetising computing power is something that is a solution to compensate a commodity that is in high demand in this day and age. The idea has high impact potential and could propel the world towards a better state through scientific advances. While reading the proposal I couldn't help but noticing the similarities with NuNet, part of SingularityNet. If forces could be joined,the reach of this could extend much further than Argentina or the entirity of LATAM. As a BOINC-computing power provider myself, this could revolutionise the way scientific research is being calculated today. BOINC has its flaws(computation and transmission errors as it runs through virtual boxes)  and with a financial incentive involved, it would also generate an incentive to improve the system. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As BOINC is currently not incentivised and the commodity that is offered by computing power providers is in high demand, a way of compensation will stir the market for sure. There are a ton of academic institutions, to just name one sector of them, that do this already out of altruism. If all the common households come in to mind the capacity increases exponentially, as it also does for scientific advancement. The protocol has a means to support itsself in the future by reserving a portion for hire in prospect of private usage. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has been submitted in Fund 6 as well, where is contained a lot of auditable variables but did not make the vote. They have improved the auditability by adding a funding breakdown and additional information on the tokenomics in the attachments, improving this proposal by a large factor. But there is still no explanation of who would want to buy the tokens of the provider in order to make a profit. If this were to be solved, the outcome would be a near perfect proposal.

As an Argentine citizen, I understand the frustration the scientific community goes through due to a lack of resources, and the fact that they are making the most of this project is impressive. To solve this problem, the team proposed developing a protocol that encourages users to lend their CPU power in exchange for native tokens. Although I agree that there is a clear alignment with the challenge. It is difficult to estimate the impact of the proposal as a result of a confusing definition of the metrics. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team managed to assemble a comprehensive set of skills and experience and provided the necessary references to verify such qualifications. However, the development and implementation of the NOETH protocol are the most critical aspects of the project and it seems that this will entirely depend on the hiring of qualified personnel. It would be great if they already had a member in the team with the necessary background to have a successful implementation. I must congratulate the team for the excellent Tokenomics description of their project. On Catalyst, there are many proposals aimed at creating native tokens, but they make no effort to explain their logic to the community. The team is requesting funds to build a beta version of the protocol, the majority of which is to be spent on hiring developers. With respect to the values allocated, they seem appropriate to me.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author does a great job describing the implementation milestones, which are organized into three phases. The author provides a brief yet effective summary of the actions that need to be taken at each milestone. However, with regard to the success metrics, the team could have done a better job. In 3 months it is stated that \"LATAM scientific centers will be contacted to present the project and establish a collaborative relationship\". This is more of a milestone than a success metric. In such a case, a suitable metric would be, \"XX agreements are reached with the scientific centers.\" At the 6th month, the success metrics are defined correctly, with 3 scientific projects expected to use the network's computing power. Unfortunately, I would have expected a similar description of success in the 12-month milestone, but only the milestone of completing the first phase of the project is described.\u00a0\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem statement being majority PC users only spend average 20% of their CPUs processing power.
