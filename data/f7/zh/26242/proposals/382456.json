catalyst process. Problem statement and solution are clear. I liked that all the content they intend to create are already stated.\r\nA few point I'd add to the proposal.\r\n1) The great majority of the catalyst content is english. Videos explaining the processes can help the entrance but non-english speakers would still face barries when really getting in contact with proposals or submitting them. Does this project have in its scope any goal to help overcome these further barries? If not I would consider  the true impact of this proposal not very high as a lot of content to cover catalyst process already exist in eglish (-1 start/score)\r\n2) What would be the communication plan within Brazilian (and portuguese native speakers as a whole)? Brazil is a very diverse country and it would be nice to see here what is its target audience, at least at first, and how to increase as it evolve. For instance, the project communication can start in universities of the main cities and evolves to high school students and employees in given sectors. Important to mention that not only the target audience is important but also the channels need to be considered. (-0,5 star/score)\r\n 3) Ive seen a lot of proposals in last fund related to create educational videos in other languages to expand the reach to non-english speakers, very alike this one. It would be great to assess if some synergies could be made with these funded proposals and how to leverage theirs lessons learned (especially in relation to item 1 and 2). In the same sense, a further phase of this project could guide/help other proposers who want to do similar initiative with their language (elaborate a document or video with guidelines, provide some sort of consultancy, so on).\r\n4) Id open some space for interacting with the enviroment created. Have Q&A, maybe in extra videos or in the podcasts, have space to audience propose topics for the videos, receive feedback, and so on. This is easly adjustable with the current proposal, it would just need to add some extra flexibility.\r\n5) Last, regarding the content itself, maybe it will be important, before even speaking about Cardano/catalyst, explain the concept of cripto currencies and blockchain. Understanding this is the foundation of the whole process and one step behind the first episode proposed.

In this sense, I'd assume it would be necessary at least two extra people to edit the video and make sure they reach a their educational purpose (and also to add extra hands on scripting, translating, etc) (-1 star/score)\r\nAs for a plan, theres no clear schedule on when it is intended to launch each of the 10 videos (frequency) and how much time each of the steps in content creating it would take. (-1 star/score)\r\nLast, regarding the budget, it is clear and breakdown seems fair.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Good kpis already established. It would be nice to have some targets on them, it could be even targets evolving with time (for instacnce, increase viewers by 10% each month until month X, etc).

(-1 star/score)\r\nAlso, some milestones could be added but for this it would be necessary a more detailed schedule, which the proposal doesn't have. (-0,5 star/score)\r\nNo risk assessment was done.

There are a growing number of sources to learn of Cardano but non cater to the Portuguese speaking individual. This further adds weight to the alignment of this proposal is to the Challenge. General make-up of the total Portuguese speaking population are also given, which are in the figures of hundreds of millions.

Budget is clearly broken down, though some posts are unclear. There is mentioning of a post for text and subtitle. Without further explanation, one could ask; 'What is the point of having text and subtitle, are they not basically the same thing?' Besides this issue, the budget is quite reasonable. The implementation plan though is not available, the proposer also has not taken into consideration risk and challenge they might face.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Roadmap unfortunately is almost non-existent, this includes the milestones.
