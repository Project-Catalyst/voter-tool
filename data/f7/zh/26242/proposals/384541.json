Also information about how the participant plan to find additional people for the team. \r\nEspecially since, unless I'm mistaken, the budget requested represents about 30% of the total budget of the challenge, which is well detailed in technical terms and details of the procedure, but really lacks information. Because even if an idea is well elaborated, it seems difficult to attest the success of a project without having confidence in the team that will carry it out. In the same way that the risks are mentioned, but the precision of the team's solutions to deal with them are not mentioned.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal is clear and the solution provided is quite transparent, in terms of the budget, the technical process and its development over time, the KPIs seem coherent and quantitative. Although it is stated in phase 3 that there will be documentation and reports, it would have been important to provide more informations on how the project plans to communicate with the community on its progress. There are no links, or a given site, that would allow for feedback or follow-up, exept that :\"All material produced (documentation and source codes from GitHub) is open source under the Creative Commons \"BY\" license\", which is a good point. But by developing more its auditability for the community, this project could become more integrated into the community and find partners or mentors to support and provide additional elements to prove its potential of success.

Because the more we make Cardano be used in real transaction, the more Cardano currency is valuable (intrinsic value). If this project is success, it can impact not only Latin America but also all other parts of the world because currently many place don't have this type of app to actually use crypto currency in daily transaction.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution, though, seems still quite complicated since it needs the p2p trader, the merchants have to confirm within the time or time limit is reached, and if it's not, there will have process veryfing to decide whether or not to release the tokens. It seems complicated and I afraid that local merchants might not adopt this method because they used to the simple traditional transaction. It will be better if the proposal includes \"the selling point\" of this app. What make it attractive with local merchants?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal includes roadmap to track the progress of the project and the KPIs which is very transparent and useful to measure the success of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_809", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal is planning to launch a product to allow merchants and customers to complete trades using digital currencies, versus fiat.

Not only that, and possibly more important, is the proposer's level of engagement. One can see this in their replies to comments.

The proposal now has requested funds, thorough breakdowns of that, and other improvements from great suggestions provided.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned above, the proposers took to a great level of engagement, and action, on the feedback given this far.

The solution given is among the lines of this problem given that with already existent decentralized exchanges, that work with stablecoins, like COTI, the code is not open-source for commercial reasons probably. Also other applications like Adapay do not allow conversion to stablecoins or fiat currency, a feature that cardway finance has. For those reasons, i think that this idea would have great impact to the Cardano ecosystem and will add great value to it, giving the chance of mass adoption.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has experience on developing applications and also has experience with various languages, including smart contract languages. However, the proposer does not give any links to verify that or a github account. What could be confusing for a voter, is the fact that there is one team member at this time and all other team members are to be hired. The proposer gives a 2 month time for the team to be built and the prototype to be implemented, which is marginally feasible. Maybe consider extending the project horizon. The budget, however, is outlined clearly and seems to be reasonable to achieve the goals set. The timetable is stated clearly, the only thing to be added would be the public launch.
