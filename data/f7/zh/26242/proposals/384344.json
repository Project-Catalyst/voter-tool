This proposal is very well thought out, very well presented, and clearly argued for its appropriateness in this challenging context. A clear and understandable solution was provided in the proposal to clearly describe the problem targeted.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent clearly has the knowledge and commitment required to execute the project. The proposal was made by the DLT360 team which includes active contributors to the Cardano community. The group also divides the work according to the capacity of each person to implement the proposal. It's great that the team provides the full LinkedIn profile of each individual participating in the proposal.\r\nThis is part of a large approved project. Now they want more money to continue their project. According to all that has been presented, I believe this proposal will be successfully implemented", "q1r": 4, "q2": "All products are provided specifically, the stages of providing a clear date for help the community can monitor the process and the results of the proposal.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience of each member is clearly explained and supported by links, but also kept up to date on their website, which is also very informative. The qualifications of each participant seem to fit well with the needs of this project. I would like to point out that I am not very familiar with the industry field, but the budget requested seems reasonable, clearly stated and detailed in a concise execution plan and combine with a realistic timetable. \r\nThe technical aspects are discussed several times and more detailed explanations are offered in their Miro environment. Which still requires an authorization to access, but which can be understood. It would have been nice to have an explanation of how to access it. \r\nEven if the risks are not clearly stated, this proposal shows in many ways its sustainability. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is also very clear, it breaks down into progressive execution times with milestone and quantitative success values. The KPIs provided make sense. With the fact that this team has already been founded in the background during the F6 and that their project has been successfully completed, this project appear in continuity,  which is a considerable indication of trust.
