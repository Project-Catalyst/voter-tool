The proposal involves tokenizing land in order to enable regrowth of land using proven ecological methods. This will address the issue of farmers not being able to ensure a healthy regeneration of land between harvest seasons. This proposal is very relevant to LATAM as food exports to developed countries represent one of many countries' main sources of income. In addition, I understand how this proposal can encourage new users to join the community. However, I must say that it was not possible to evaluate the alignment of the metrics since they were not included.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team describes in detail the skills and experiences in their web page that was provided as a reference. They have also described achievements with their \"land-management and forest regeneration\" method in previous years, although references would have been helpful to verify these results. An action plan is presented; however, I find it to be very general, which makes it difficult to evaluate its feasibility. Another aspect that could be improved in the proposal is the description of the associated tokenomics. Although there is a brief description of the token utility, it is crucial to provide a detailed description of the logic behind the generation of these tokens for a proposal like this one, which is based on the generation of this economy to contribute to the purchase and regeneration of land. Regarding the budget, I believe it is also imperative that for future Catalyst cycles, the team concentrates its efforts on improving this section. Although it is very positive that the topic has been broken down into identifiable areas, some of them need to be better explained. An example is the line item for \"Developers to launch the token\" which is estimated at $60,000 but does not explain the cost per hour, the number of developers needed, or for how long the developers are needed. Another example could be, the item for \"Promotion campaign\" would be estimated at $50,000, in which case you would have to provide answers to questions such as: How many professionals are you planning to hire? Which methods will be used for promotion? What is the expected result of this promotion? Unfortunately, no answers to these questions are provided. Lastly, I would like to mention another issue with the budget that I find is that actions are described to ensure auditability, but it is not clear whether or not these actions are considered as line items within the budget. Especially periodic audits by external agencies tend to be very costly. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally, we arrive at the section regarding auditability, which has its highs and lows.

Furthermore, the community will be able to access all the costs associated with the project, including contracts on chain, external audits, and images of what is happening in the farms. There is another aspect of this proposal that can be improved: the description of the success metrics.

This is a highly specialized project, and if the model can be demonstrated, will enable other countries and communities to use it as a blueprint.

The need to audit the farmland itself (by the certifying bodies listed in the proposal) is a key element here, as the transparency and trustworthiness of what is happening on the ground will play a large role in maintaining trustworthiness of the project overall and the infusion of blockchain technology learning in Latin America through this work. As this challenge aims to bring more Latin American community members into the Cardano fold, it would be strong to see this proposal include methods for engaging the participants in the farming/agricultural roles AND the growth of the organization into new areas as a whole. Perhaps workshops on cryptocurrency could also be held at the location in addition to the agricultural workshops? What about partnerships between token holders and those who teach/care for the land? Involving qualified community members on the boards/ committees/governance groups? It would also be strong to understand how the team plans to chronicle and share their experience and findings with other groups so that their work could be replicated easily and do more good.
