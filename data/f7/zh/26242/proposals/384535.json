They say they will translate 50 videos that are on the youtube channel, however, when I went to the provided link and went to the videos part (https://www.youtube.com/c/LovelaceAcademy/videos), I saw that the channel only had 9 videos posted. I accessed the platform on 12/11/21, during the access period, and if there were still videos to be posted, it is time for the channel to be updated so that we can evaluate the proposal. As it is, unfortunately, there is no way to achieve the promised goals. If the channel really had that number of videos and they were translated into Portuguese and Spanish (in the proposal, they only mention Portuguese, but in the part of the success metrics they talk about the number of new subscribers coming from Spanish-speaking countries... therefore it is confused), yes, the proposal would suit very well what we are looking for in the challenge; it would be taking to Latin America various contents of the Cardano ecosystem, in order to educate people and make them likely participants in the community, also benefiting our blockchain. However, due to the dissonance in what is said and what happens, this objective would be little contemplated.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "We have very little detail about the trio. We know their names, we know that Maria Carmo 369 has 3 channels related to Cardano (which ones?), and we don't know anything about the other two members of the team. We would need more information, such as: your roles in the project, a little history of what you have been working on so far, what is your relationship with the Cardano ecosystem, and so on. Without such information, unfortunately, no confidence in the team's ability to successfully carry out the project is conveyed. There is also no well-defined script, we are only told that they intend to translate the content of the videos into Portuguese. It is doubtful whether the same would be done for Spanish. We don't know how long these translations will be done, how often translated videos would be posted, who would translate into which language, how the target audience would be reached (how would they know about such translations?). It would be essential that they elaborate phases to be followed in a linear way and related to the passage of time. Only then could we have a good view of the process. And finally, regarding the financing, all the money is based on the work of translating. They estimate 5 hours of translation per video at a price of $30 an hour; I find this expensive, not knowing exactly who would be translating, if that person has complete command of both languages. And there's also the fact that you'd have to sync the subtitles as well as create them. Would that part already be included in the $150 per video? I believe that, unfortunately, this whole topic has flaws, and could be reformulated for a better understanding of the items analyzed here.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The team only provides us with two KPIs, which would be the number of registrations from users coming from Spanish-speaking countries and the number of registrations of Portuguese speakers in the IOG programming courses. I believe they are good ways to measure the project's success, because once Portuguese speakers watch the videos and learn about Cardano, they would be interested in learning our blockchain's programming language; the other data is more direct, speaking directly of subscribers to the channel. However, I felt that this information is insufficient to measure the project's success. Other data that could be analyzed: number of subscribers from Portuguese-speaking countries / amount of interaction (likes and comments) in the channel's videos / length of stay in the videos, etc. It would also be important to monitor the process itself: are the translations being delivered as promised? I think auditability could happen here in two ways, either the trio gathering the data cited in reports and presenting it to the community or Portuguese/Spanish speakers who were already part of the community monitoring the quality and frequency of the subtitles. I think we have a principle of auditability here, but it needs to be really deepened.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 8, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The solution given is very obvious but not enough to completely solve the problem of the project.\r\n  Break the language barrier by translating 50 episodes from Lovelace Academy Channel into Portuguese.
