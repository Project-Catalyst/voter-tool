They ad value to the Cardano ecosystem by facilitating DAO creation, making it easy and attractive to new users.  The key metrics of the project are in line with the  Challenge setting's in the sense of user and DAO onboarding. They mention building a DAO around their infrastructure that allows token holders to submit and vote on proposals. Not sure if it involves protocol changes, but in order to scale well I think voting on protocol changes should be implemented.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They provided links to LinkedIn via website and the team doesn't include a Plutus developer. The Github link they shared isn't very active. You need to let the community know who your Plutus dev is in order to gain their trust.  The budget is broken down into 2 items. Audit smart contracts and pay team to develop smart contracts. What about frontend and backend development? You want to pay a team $30 000 to create smart contracts, but the community doesn't know who this Plutus dev team is. Version 1 will be launched Q3/4 2022 which is very reasonable for what is being built. They explain some parts of the project they will build. Mainly focused on the smart contracts. They don't go into any technical detail on how they are building these tools. Providing the technical details will show the reader your approach to the problem and could boost confidence in your skills. They haven't considered any risks or challenges. You need to show the reader that you are aware and prepared for future challenges and risks. Not being prepared could slow you down.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "They have a 2 roadmaps, one with detailed paragraphs and one with items as milestones. Some milestones are measurable KPIs.
