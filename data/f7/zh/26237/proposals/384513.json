They will provide value to the Cardano ecosystem by easing the creation of DAOs that in turn will bring more DAOs to the Cardano. The key metrics of the proposal is directly in line with the Challenge setting as it will bring more DAOs to Cardano and provide toolsets to DAOs. The Project is able to scale well as it will be open source. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They claim to have Plutus pioneers on the team, but then later they list the team members and it doesn't show who the plutus pioneer is or anyone with Plutus experience. There is also no proof of their experience. It would help a lot to ad links to LinkedIn or Github pages. Providing proof of your skills will boost voter confidence. Budget seems reasonable and is broken down into identifiable items.  The timetable to complete this is reasonable and achievable if they have a plutus pioneer. If they still need to find one, that might slow them down. They go into detail explaining the different functions their product will have, but they don't explain the technical side of building these different parts. Explaining how you will build this will reveal alot about how you approach this problem and can boost voter confidence in your abilities. They haven't considered any risks or challenges. Not being aware or prepared for future challenges or risks will slow you down and in some cases might even end your project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "They provided a roadmap with 3 detailed milestones about completing parts of the project. They haven't provided any measurable KPIs apart from finishing parts of the project. Adding more user/transaction based KPIs makes it easy to track the performance of your project. Even how many DAOs use your system at some point in time will be a great KPI. They address the problem of toolsets needed for DAO creation and they solve this by creating open source tools to help a variety of different type of DAOs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_140", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 9, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal aims to develop an open-source toolkit for organization that need or are based on decentralized governance. The proposal is well written. For me there could be more explanation on how this infrastructure will be used and how it will be 'accepted' and used by the market. The idea is interesting tough and since it will help DAOs to govern themselves it lays within the challenge setting. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to be capable of creating this solution. However we don't find a proof of live in the proposal. Also creating such a platform is one thing but running it successfully and getting a lot of traction on it, is a different story. The go-to-market strategy is not clear. Also the technical aspects of the platform are not described. The budget is broken down in details and seems to be reasonable for me. The time horizon seems to be realistic.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team presented a roadmap and a timeline, but the deliverables are overall vague.
