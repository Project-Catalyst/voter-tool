The idea is to greatly enhance the available functionality for NFT holders, allowing improved liquidity, using NFTs as collateral for loans, etc.  While it is not explicitly stated, I assume that the the project will be made available in open source, allowing others to use it to launch their own NFT-FT pools.  If this is the case, I think it clearly fits the challenge goal of developing tools for managing DAOs, as well as creating points of distinction from the \"same old, same old\" in other NFT ecosystems.  Another possible interpretation is that the proposers intend to run a *service* using their development, enabling others to launch their own NFT-FT pools on this service.  This would arguably also meet the challenge's goals (one could consider this service to be a \"tool\" others could use).  I'd give this top rating if it were more clearly stated that the plan is to open source the tools and allow others to use it.  I find the linked Fungify gitbook a little confusing on this.  In particular, the paragraph talking about fees (no fee for adding an NFT, 5% when retrieving, where this fee goes, etc.) seems more consistent with a service under the proposers' control than if the tools are open source, which would allow users to experiment with different policies, fee structures, etc., which seems more consistent with the \"experimentation\" vibe of the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": " The team appears to be strong technically, with Haskell/Plutus/CS backgrounds, with funds set aside in the Budget also for a front-end developer.  Beyond mentioning this, there is no specific detail in the proposal in support of these claims.  I could find linkedIn pages for both proposers, which would have been nice to include.  I am happy to take the linkedIn profiles at face value, and they do indicate educational and work experience backgrounds roughly consistent with the claimed skills.  Also, my understanding is that the Plutus Pioneer Program's official participants received class NFTs.  If a Catalyst proposal isn't the place to flaunt those, what is?! :-) The proposal indicates that the project is well under way, currently doing \"intensive internal testing and final touches\".  I do not see links to github repos or anything like that, but if we again take the claims at face value, they indicate good progress that increases confidence regarding feasibility.  My main concern is that there are many non-technical aspects required for success.  In particular, recruiting and onboarding projects to experiments with the platform is literally the only requirement to achieve \"success after 6 months\" as defined in the proposal.  As a fellow geek (PhD, Computer Science), I certainly understand the focus on the technical aspects, but I also know that it's easy to underprioritize other important aspects of a project by being overly focused on the technical core.  I would suggest slightly growing and diversifying the team, even if it means taking some of the funding originally budgeted for the core developers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers describe success after 6 months as \"5+ projects experimenting with novel governance models enabled by the Fungify V1 protocol\".  I think that's a reasonable measure.  For shorter-term accountability, the proposers note that progress can be tracked towards that.  I think that's a less compelling mechanism for accountability in the shorter term.  First, there is no mention of how this information would be discovered and disseminated.  I can only think that it would be via status updates and periodic progress reports from the team, but this is not specified or offered/promised in the proposal.  Furthermore, even if the project is wildly successful, it will likely take time before progress towards success is reflected in term of the proposed measure (projects experimenting with Fungify).
