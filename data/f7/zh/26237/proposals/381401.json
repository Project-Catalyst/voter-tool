The authors managed to convinse me in the value they will be bringing to the cardano ecosystem. I know Dwayne Collard is an active member of the community and is a voice of reason in the telegram channels.  The key metrics are really well thought through and are pointing in the right direction to measure adoption. Currently I don't see anythig missing in this proposal.

I can appreciate the transparency that brings. IMHO this brings credability to the peorject in the eyes of the voters (me included).  The budget is outlined clearly and is broken down well enough to be understandable by everyone reading the proposal. The execution plan seems very reasonable, although it depends on whether or not they will be able to find those mentioned team members. As a developer I believe the timetable is realistic to do the mentioned work. The fact that it's open source adds to the credability of the project and helps it to scale if necessary. I also love how there's a plan for self funding down the line. Not many proposal think in that direction and this is what separates the long lasting project apart from the short term ones in my oppinion. The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal along with a very detailed list of possible future challenges along with an even longer list of mitigations for those challenges.
