DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. Having that importat actor in the catalyst network form a DAO network can surely only be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem, so this proposal fits very well into the challenge setting.
