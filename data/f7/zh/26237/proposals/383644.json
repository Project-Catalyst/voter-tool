claims there would be a positive impact on the ecosystem if these animals were to be (partially) brought back. It has to be acknowledged that this is a theory that is not necessarily true. So before going ahead with engineering back an extinct hybrid, there is some ethical and scientific discussion to be held on the use of CRISPR to create hybrid species in order to change climatological circumstances. That said, it's not impossible to achieve and if it could all be launched by the funding of a Cardano staking pool, imagine the publicity that would generate around the world. This has the potential to really put this blockchain on the map big time and the effort merits an attempt at it, regardless of potential environmental impact as the herd could also be kept small if it turns out that the species does not benefit the climatological circumstances.

You will need an SPO, NFT-designer, webdesigner, plutus engineer and actual CRISPR-engineers and a facility to incubate the embryos.
