Since the Hyperledger Indy network, based on the Sovrin Ledger, is already a trusted leader, a proposal to develop one wallet providing access to both networks would be extremely valuable.  Providing a gateway or link between DIDs issued on Cardano and verifiers on Sovrin, or vice-versa would encourage adoption and be extremely valuable to the Cardano community. The proposal emphasizes many times that the wallet would be freely available for users to download, which would aid with scalability. On the other hand, the repeated mentions of making the wallet free made me wonder about the long-term business model. Who will pay for the ongoing maintenance and development of a free wallet? This would be a question applicable to anyone with a wallet development proposal, but the frequent reminder that this particular wallet would be free prompted me to ask the question. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides nice links to the profiles of the Team, who clearly have significant experience in the SSI industry, and have deep connections to the Cardano community. Chris Raczkowski provided a compelling fireside chat during the Atala PRISM pioneers program.  The budget is very moderate, particularly given the enormous benefit that such a wallet would provide. Since Chris was involved with the Pioneers program, he must be aware that the SDK is not yet public. However, there is no mention of this risk in the proposal, or how they would mitigate it in order to provide an open-source wallet. This gap is the only factor keeping me from rating this section with five stars. The clear links between the proposal team and IOG, and Chris's role in the PRISM pioneer program, are what is keeping me from giving an even lower rating, due to the importance of the SDK.

The problem being solved is the lack of interopability between established ID solutions and Atala Prism. The outcome of this project is a free, open source wallet built ontop of the DIT wallet that supports VC's anchored on Hyperledger Indy and Cardano Blockchains. This brings awareness and acceptence from the wider community. The project aligns nicely with this challenge to increase growth of the Cardano network. In terms of scalability the interopability and accpetance of this wallet will help it to scale beyond the reach of the average Cardano user.
