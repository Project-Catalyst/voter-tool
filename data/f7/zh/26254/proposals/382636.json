For such a big project, the team should have also taken the time to think about possible risks that might incur during the process, and how they will be mitigating them.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The budget has been divided in accordance to the timeline which helps visualise the process for the entire project, but there should have been an additional distinction for what each sum will be used for.
