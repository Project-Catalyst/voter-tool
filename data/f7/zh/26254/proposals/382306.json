Using PRISM technology to prove compliance with sustainability regulations for a circular economy is a good response to the challenge brief. I think the proposal plans to focus on electric vehicle batteries for their first use case. It would be helpful when assessing the impact if the business use case were explained a bit more clearly a bit earlier in the proposal. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the proposal is really in the weeds with the technical specifications, without having a deep technical understanding of all of the concepts referenced, it is difficult to tell how meaningful the information is. It would strengthen the proposal if the proposers had included a bit more background information about themselves, to substantiate their ability to deliver the proposed solution. From searching for Arthur Greef on LinkedIn, I believe I found his profile, which does indeed suggest he has the software engineering skills required to deliver on this proposal. As a participant in the PRISM pioneer program myself, I know that \"fastframk\" was active member of the cohort. It is also clear that the proposers have thought about not only the technical side of the project but also the governance framework. I do agree with one of the comments that the proposal might be better off focusing on DIDs and the circular economy and not trying to manage it as a DAO at the same time, as that could perhaps add complexity to an already very complex project. I appreciate the reference to the CLI wallet, as the team is aware of the current lack of functional wallet in the ecosystem.
