both a treasurer of a political organisation and a financial auditor (someone that checks the books of an organisation to verify that all the funds proceedings are in order). Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a valid problem regarding DID: the fact that ist underlying architecture needs both a more solid foundation and understanding among developers. I think this is a very valid critique that needs to be adressed, which is done so with this proposal in a competent and beneficial manner.
