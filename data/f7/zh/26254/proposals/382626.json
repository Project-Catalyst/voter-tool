Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies an interesting approach of verifying Social Media accounts via DID. The solution seems like a good new usecase for DID, thus it will be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem. It is explained comprehensibly and matches the challenge well. Scalability should be provided assuming correct implementation", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are transparent about themselves and seem up to the task.
