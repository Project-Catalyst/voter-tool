However, it is unclear to me how the proposal intends to address that problem. Furthermore, after reading the team's referenced proposal that was funded in Fund6 in combination with the current proposal, it is not clear to me that the proposers understand Atala PRISM. Their first proposal references using the Yoroi to pay for university expenses in ADA. While that is a valuable activity for the Cardano ecosystem, it is has nothing to do with Atala PRISM. Similarly, the idea of issuing NFTs to participating Alumni (referenced in both the previous proposal and this current proposal) has nothing to do with Atala PRISM. The proposal seems to be confusing the concept of a \"digital ID,\" which would be a simple digital representation of a traditional ID, with a DID creating using the Atala PRISM software. I am forced to give this proposal a one-star rating in spite of some of the potential of their ideas due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the challenge. Furthermore, their incorrect use of the Atala PRISM terms seriously undermines their credibility.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There are numerous references to ISDR/GL, but that term is not clearly explained. It took me some googling and clicking through of the various links provided in order to understand that ISDR/GL is an educational institution. The proposal does not clearly explain the links between any of the proposers and that educational institution, so it is difficult to assess how successfully the proposers will be able to influence the school to use any Cardano technology.  The proposal requests $1,000 to host a meetup and brainstorm on applications of DID. Given the team's apparent lack of understanding of DIDs, I am skeptical regarding their ability to facilitate a meetup on the topic. But furthermore, I am not confident that a broad-based meetup open to any students and faculty is a productive way to generate DID-use cases. Most importantly, it isn't clear why $1,000 would be needed for a meetup.  I have similar concerns about all the budget line items. It is not clear why $2,000 is needed to host a blockchain conference. It is not clear why the team is confident that Heads of Institutions would attend.  A QR code is referenced for the first time in this budget line item but is not clear what this means or where it is coming from. It is not clear how $1,500 would be spent on an instructor surveying students about ID-based obstacles, how this line item relates to the other line items, or what this might have to do specifically with Atala PRISM, and the stated problem of promoting DID standards and interoperability.  The proposal highlights a risk that the public institution of ISDR/GL may be prevented from participating in a blockchain based solution. If the purpose of the proposal is to deploy a blockchain-based solution to this particular institution, it seems that the very first step should be to determine the feasibility, before requesting any funding. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the proposal states that a management committee will receive the funds to implement the project. This statement raises more questions than it answers. Who is the management committee? What do they manage? Which project will be implemented? I can't imagine how anyone could make a serious attempt to audit the proposal based on that statement. Similarly the statement that \"video and other digital products will be produced\" is hopelessly vague. The only bio provided is that of the Chairman, Frederic Samvura, whose LinkedIn headline states \"Now I am too busy with a growing family to face any new challenge,\" which does not provide a lot of confidence in his ability to take on this proposal.
