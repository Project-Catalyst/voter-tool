of Project Catalyst requires support to be sustainable as otherwise documentation wont get done.\r\n \r\nIt is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing resources to do the documentation & tracking of Project Catalyst and thereafter ommunicate the content of the Catalyst 2022 GitBook to the community.\r\n \r\nThis proposal shows how it adds value to the Cardano system by creating such a document. \r\n  Key metrics  would be  number of downloads,  number of page views, number of users of the book   \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge \r\nProposal can be scaled up to address future challenges by adding more content to the document. Maybe variations for different use cases and regions. Maybe localizing into local languages\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the collaboration between community members to build this book, and localize it into different languages.\r\n\r\nI can say that this proposal adequately addresses the challenge  hence i have given it a 5 star rating.\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.

Simple example; if an event that has been ongoing for 3 months can not provide data of their participants growth, the chance of that event's capability to find further funding would be very challenging. This documentation system that is currently being developed will help community event organizers throughout the Cardano community to have  a universal database input system that can be easily tracked and is 100% transparent.
