Since I am also Participating in catalyst since several funds I am competent to determine what kind of community events could be beneficial. The proposal identifies an important point within the challenge which by adressing it, will bring an immense benefit to the Catalyst community and the Cardano ecosystem; by connecting people from all over the world that are united by the same idea and providing them a space to discuss the current topics of the townhalls and Catalyst in general.

It is interesting how the authors explain the functioning of After Town Hall, both for guest and presenter. This makes us understand the activity developed more completely. The question would be, then improve something that already exists, according to the points raised - timestamp, implement reward systems, promote marketing and so on. In my honest opinion, the 25k requests could be used to create new projects, After Town Hall has been in existence for a few months now and works well in the current way, I believe the goal of promoting debate and connections between engaged members of the community is already being achieved without such improvements, so I don't think this proposal would have that much impact. The Catalyst Swarm group has already had a lot of impact on the objectives of the challenge of promoting a meeting and reflection on the projects/technologies of the ecosystem in the current model, and the funding could give other projects a chance to be born.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Catalyst Swarm is already a well-known/consolidated group in our community. Because they already have a working history and have already started After Town Hall before, a lot of confidence in the group's ability to carry out this project is conveyed. However, it would be interesting for the team to provide a short description of each member, so that we can know their names, functions and a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of what they have done so far (inside and outside the Cardano community). About the script, it is very simple, the authors indicate what would be done in general next year and specifically in February and March. But would the project focus on two months? Who would do what, in what period of time, in weeks, to achieve the proposed objectives? I don't know if the rest of the script has yet to be completed or that's it, but it gives the impression of being very dry, so there is not enough detail or length of time for us to fully understand what will be done, how, by whom and and When. About the budget division, I believe it would also need more detail. For example, when asking 6k to research and experiment with the rewards system, what is the justification for this amount? How would this research be worked out, what would be researched, who would research it? How much reward would each person receive, individually? Overall, I believe that both the team presentation, script and funding are explained quite superficially, lacking more detail for a satisfactory understanding of the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I think this is the most complete part of the proposal. The authors provide us with several topics that would serve as content to be followed for auditability, such as holding 5 rooms after Town Hall, 80% retention (this portion is very high and optimistic) of the general meeting participants for the After Town Hall and etc. All of this could be directly monitored by the meeting participants themselves, we could select some members who were not members of the group but who had a commitment to regularly participate in the Town Halls, to, according to their interests, enter the rooms. The Catalyst Swarm Group itself could provide feedback through infographics to be presented during the Town Hall's own progress.
