This follow up from the specialist seems to be covered in the proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, pre-read and study materials will help a lot too during the meetings, so some efforts will need to be done in this sense, to make these materials available. Bringing study cases, proposals already funded that addressed these issues and real world examples to solve will also help a lot.\r\n\r\nIf projects is successful, in the future, it will be interesting to see it expanded to other languages (and regions) to get closer to LATAM, Africa, places that Cardano is trying to expand (and these issues are more latent), working with local members and passing on lessons learned. Having this in multiple languages, in the future, will be awesome - but that would be for another proposal and challenge.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One committed person with experience seems enough.

Which is 'Existential Risk', which are risk that permanently disrupts and degrades human development. That could be irreversible global warming, untreatable virus etc. The proposer chooses to create a series of meetings that focuses on educating and informing on existential risk in collaboration with think tanks that specializes in this topic. The deliverables and how the proposer intends to manifest them does addresses various problems that needs to be solved, such as; using events to build new teams, increase meaningful participation etc.. The proposer together with their collaborator will bring a wealth of knowledge to Project Catalyst. This proposal is shy of a 5-star rating in this category due to the current priorities of Cardano, which are education and adoption of Cardano itself.

This is manifested into the budget requested and how it will be utilized. Although there is nothing wrong with requesting funds to have meetings, it is not the common practice in Project Catalyst. A topic or perhaps a formulation of a new specific Challenge is usually initiated by the organic congregation of various individuals in and/or out of the Cardano community. As the people discussing it grows, so does the intangible social verifier signals that this topic is of importance. As this assessment is being written, there is actually already an existing community within Cardano that speaks of to a certain degree 'Existential Risk' called 'Cardano4Climate'. With that said, recommend the proposer to reach out to this community and also the Catalyst Swarm, for this issue has been circulating within the community for a while. Other than that, this proposer has done a great job in fleshing out a clear timeline and also taking account potential risk that they may face. Kudos to the proposer for this, for not many even consider calculating the risk one might face.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a general roadmap with adjoining action plans and also some milestones.
