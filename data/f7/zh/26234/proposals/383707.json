The proposer would then rely on those ambassadors to organize future events and support it.\r\nEven if the proposer doesn't plan to pay a fee for presenter, I would suggest to prepare a least allowance for those presenters and some others community members who'll be involved in the planning committee.

In one section of the proposal, he cites that the country has a lot of cryptography enthusiasts and that \"crypto companies that keep growing in Poland very fast, the main exchanges where the ADA is listed\"; I would like to understand which companies they are, see some surveys that justify this point or other ways of realizing what he says in reality, because, for people who are not from the country, this reality is totally unknown. It would be good if we had some data supporting their lines. Another point is that the author does not seem to have clearly defined who would be the speakers at these meetings; during the proposal he says that there are certainly experienced people prepared to talk about Cardano and blockchain. However, I follow the same thought as the point previously analyzed: it would be important to know who these people are, to have names, to understand what each one does, in which city they would appear, which subjects are covered by each... In other words, a more notion solid knowledge of who these people are, in order to convey more confidence in the team involved. Although the idea fits well with what we are looking for in the challenge, that is, promoting events that increase the reach of the Cardano ecosystem, both in terms of engaging current participants and attracting new ones, I believe that the construction of the proposal left some very abstract points, so as not to transfer as much confidence in the project's success and validity.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author doesn't give much detail about himself. It is known that he is in the healthcare area, and he claims to have explored the cryptographic world since 2017, having a relationship with Cardano since 2018. But how, exactly, does he relate to our ecosystem? I don't understand if he has already launched proposals before, or if he makes use of blockchain technologies without necessarily participating in Catalyst... This bridge was very undefined, unfortunately. I would also like to know how his previous work in medicine has contributed to the current understanding, how he manages to merge the two areas in order to generate positive impacts. As for the rest of the team, as I said in the previous topic, names are not given, so we cannot understand exactly who will do what and why. It was necessary that we could get to know each person involved, not only the speakers, but also the marketing production team, logistical organization of the events, and so on. Know their names, functions and a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of what they have done before, which would justify their participation in this project. About the script, it is very short, it needs more detail in its parts; it would be more interesting if an author determined larger phases and divided them into smaller activities. For example: in phase 1, it would be pre-production, in which he would research the community about which cities would be better for such events (this is a little confusing, higher up he already lists some cities that would hold the meetings and then talks that this will still be decided with the community...?), would contact the speakers and etc. A phase 2 could talk about the events themselves: where they would happen, when, estimated audience, content covered. And finally, a post-event analysis could be done, in phase 3, to understand how this project impacted the local community (I'll talk more about this in the topic below). In other words, it lacked to understand specifically the small details of this project. And so it is with the financial division: the author talks about how the money would be used in a qualitative way, for example, it would be necessary to spend on marketing, food, rent of spaces... but it is not defined at any time how much each part of these would cost. And this is essential for a complete understanding of this part of the project. He also says that the speakers would not be paid, which I don't agree with, they would be wasting their lifetime to promote such events, I think it's unfair that they don't get paid, even low, for such a thing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author provides us with some KPIs to analyze to perform auditability. It's a start, but again I say it needs more detail. The analyzes proposed by the author go a long way towards understanding the success of events, for example 1 event per month, media material generated, etc. I think more data could be analyzed here, such as: number of people at each event, impact of the event on local news, level of engagement of participants during lectures, etc. However, something of extreme importance that I would like to comment is that, for this type of project, the follow-up of those involved is almost as important as the holding of the events themselves, because the objective here is to promote debate and enthusiasm about the ecosystem Cardano, right? So we need to know if this really happened! It would be important to maintain some kind of contact with the event participants, understand if they decided to get involved in any activity or adopt some Cardano technology, for example, acquire ADA, NFT, etc. The author could promote this follow-up and gather the data in reports to be shown to the community, which could be done in a Town Hall, for example. And even another member of the community could attend the events and check that everything is being done as promised. I believe that there is an auditability principle here, but it needs to be really deepened for a satisfactory monitoring of the project.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I agree I could have described some things more precisely and in a more detailed matter.

Among all the key metrics this proposal only fits the following; number of community events. Having Cardano Roadshows like this are great, but making sure what is presented, who is presenting, how is it presented, how to get word of this presentation out are items to be elaborated on. If not detailed well enough, it only becomes a social meet-up. For that, reckon in future iteration, to creating a build-up to this event.

There are too many factors that could go wrong, that is why it is common practice to always prepare contingency budget. Which this proposal also does not have.

It would be pretty hard to find a suitable venue for less than $1k in Warsaw, while in Katowice (big city but on the south) it can be easily booked for $500. Therefore I mentioned that in current proposed budget even twice the number of events may be doable. \nRegarding my experience - I agree that I haven't included links (my bad), but I included link and description of my second, complementary proposal \"Cardano Center Poland web & socials\" where all the links and experience (linkedin) are included - the reviewer might have clicked that so he knows I am who I claim to be.\n\nRegarding KPIs and auditability, metrics like attendance, social media activity seems enough in my opinion, and recordings of the events are the best proof of what and how played out."}, {"q0": "This a great and interesting idea by the proposer.
