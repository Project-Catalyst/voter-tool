For I see this as an embryo towards the creation of Cardano art community, which is very important, the reason being will come later. General public might dismiss art due to the over-saturation of NFT projects which by it's nature to some extent is being exploited by individuals or entities, whether that be giving value to NFT through hype or market manipulation. Both practices has occurred in major NFT marketplaces and NFT issued by brands or influencers. Art's value is slowly being redefined by this practice and by the misconception of associating the current NFT with art. When there is a strong community of artists, curators, collectors, historians and educators talking to each other from around the world discussing blockchain and it's interaction with art in one forum, only then can NFT have value that is rooted in history, in art education, in techniques, in differentiation and not in hype. NFT is here to stay but NFT will evolve. Although this proposal articulates well it's intent, it's effectiveness in growing Cardano through the metrics of the Challenge setting, is a visionary sell.
