hard educate students in Northern Ghana about Cardano Ecosystem and its benefits\r\n. \r\nIt is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by Organizing community events to educate about 2,000 tertiary and high school students in northern Ghana about cardano and its benefits\r\n \r\nThis proposal shows how it adds value to the Cardano system by organizing community events  \r\n  Key metrics  have  been stated clearly. They include Number of attendees, Percentage who become CAs, Percentage who become referrers, Number of brilliant proposals to solve local problems, Percentage who become proposers, Number of students who create native cardano wallets, no of new voters, local Haskell Developers \r\n\r\nThe key metrics and goals   fall within the scope of the challenge\r\n   \r\nProposal can possibly scale up by bringing in new schools and universities\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by enabling ease of seeing events going on as well as listing yhour own event\r\n\r\nI can say that this proposal  adequately addresses the challenge   hence i have given it a 5 star rating.\r\n \r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.
