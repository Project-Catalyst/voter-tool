This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs.
