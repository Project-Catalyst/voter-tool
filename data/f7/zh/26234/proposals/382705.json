This proposal sets out to organize two events around the election of the 2022 Catalyst CircleV3.  The Catalyst Circle is a representative governing board bringing together the communities around Catalyst, from tool builders to proposers to community mentors and advisors.  They are elected to 3 month terms roughly coinciding with Catalyst Funds, and sharing information back and forth between these communities and their representatives is key to Catalyst reaching a self-governing state.  The events proposed by the Bridge Builders consist of a \"pre-election\" meeting -no decisions are made- where information is exchanged and all community interests can be brought up to date by the public.  The second event is built around the election day itself and called Governance Day, where the actual voting takes place after all candidates present themselves.
