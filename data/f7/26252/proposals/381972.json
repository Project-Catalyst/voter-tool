Considering the user base in these countries are among the fastest growing ones, it would make a lot of sense to focus on that demographic. The problem statement and the follow up solution is stated clearly in its simplicity, create more translations in Ukranian and Russian related to Cardano and the Plutus Pioneer program. It will attract more users to the community, and is a long term investment in inclusivity towards these groups of people. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer states that there is a lot of experience in both translating material, experience with Cardano and Catalyst (Since Fund1) and explaining blockchain technology. However, it would have been very nice to see this experience verified on an external platform (for example, LinkedIn) or some kind of mentions on how the team has been involved in Catalyst during this timeframe. It would further increase the credibility of the team if the proposal presented what experience and skills the other team members will bring to the table. In this way we can know how many team members that will work on the informational websites mentioned in the proposals (Developers? Translators?), and how many that will work with pure translations.  \r\nThe proposal asks for around 5% of the total funds for the challenge, which is not a large amount considering it aims to translate a wide range of updates and information regarding Cardano and Catalyst. (200-300 materials over the next 6 months, as stated in the proposal) I'm not sure how much the team will be able to manage depending  on the scale of the materials mentioned, a bit more details on the scope of the materials would be helpful to have included in the proposal. What the team aims to achieve is listed in a clear way, but it would be helpful to have a more detailed focus on what is to be achieved after the initial 6 months have ended. Because of the reasons listed above, I neither agree or disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a roadmap and a vague timeframe presented in the proposal, which helps the community understand parts of the development process. What I'm missing are some milestones connected to an estimated timeframe, which would increase the transparency of the proposal immensely. If the proposal had included some measurements of success on top of this that the community could follow and monitor, it would have strengthened the proposal even further. For example: In 3 months, we aim to have launched one of the two informational websites, along with 150 translated materials, etc. \r\nThe team does invite the community to have opinions on what materials that are to be translated, and it would have been beneficial to see how the team would let the community be part of the decision making process. Would it be via social channels, or through another platform? At the moment, the only way the community would be able to monitor the development and progress is through the finished product, and that is without knowing milestones and timeframes. To further increase the credibility of the team, the proposal could feature a small text on possible risks and challenges. If for example would describe with a few sentences a critical discussion on how they will prioritize what language to focus the most on initially. For example: Hypothetically Russian, because it is spoken by more people. Or Ukranian because they have more active users percentage-wise in Ukraine. Just having that critical discussion shows a deep understanding of what is needed and why the team choose to make the priorities that they have made. Overall, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
