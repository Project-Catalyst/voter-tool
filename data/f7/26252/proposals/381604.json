I think this because her goal is to bring information about the Cardano ecosystem to the population of Indonesia, in a simplified way, through video classes on youtube. This way, there will be much more chances of interaction and participation of the local Indonesian community with the ecosystem's projects and activities. I can assure you, from experience, that all this (everything involving the ecosystem) is very complex and those who are arriving tend to get lost; a simple, well-constructed guide is the best way to bring new members into the ecosystem and keep them. I find it interesting as the objective here is to take the content to the media already used by the target audience (youtube and instagram) and not spare efforts so that people who have no contact with the ecosystem start using new platforms and then learn about the subject matter. It makes more sense to get content to people than to get people to present content; the biggest effort has to be ours (current community members) to engage new participants who will then organically get involved more and more. In addition to all these positive aspects, an argument is made as to why Indonesia is especially interesting for such investments, which adds even more value to the project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It can be seen that the author of the proposal has a well-defined idea of \u200b\u200bhow to achieve his goals, which would be to gather information from various communication channels about Cardano in Indonesia and add that to information about the City Hall meetings. It spells out in detail what steps would be necessary for the success of this idea, dividing them into larger blocks of months, which would also be divided into smaller portions. In this way, it is possible to have a precise idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will be done and in which order, which demonstrates total mastery of the practical part of the project. The monetary division is satisfactory, although it could have been more detailed. For example, in the marketing part, it would be interesting to know how the campaign would be carried out, what strategies would be adopted and their costs. In the part of video production where most of the money would be used, it would be beneficial to know how the money would be subdivided. Would it be a responsible team? With how many involved? How could we track this part of the project (which directly relates to auditability)? Regarding the preparation of the team for the development of the project, I think that everything is very well demonstrated, since there is a brief description of each team member and also their profiles on different platforms (linkedin, instragram, youtube), from so that we can get to know them more intimately. Not to mention the fact that the project has several partnerships, and this network is super important, because it allows not only to spread the idea (disseminate it) but also to improve it with people who have similar work in Indonesia, adding value by joining experiences . So the only part that I think could have been further explored would be the currency split, but otherwise everything is fine.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is possible to track whether the project is being developed properly through the information provided in the \"deliverables\" part and also in \"key metrics to measure\". In this space, the author makes it very clear what the intention of video uploads is, their duration and the platform where they would be released, making it very simple for the Cardano community (outside the country of destination) to monitor the actions. Also, how could we measure success through the numbers of people reached? However, some ideas could still be added that would raise the level of auditability. For example, we know the team has connections with other Indonesian content creators. Why not promote some meetings, with exchange of experiences, where other members of the community could also participate, if they wanted to, to evaluate the development of the project and give support/suggestions? In terms of integrating content from city hall meetings, it would be important to draw a bridge between this portion of the project and the members of the ecosystem, not all, but we could choose some who were more used to dealing with issues of this type (governmental) to establish this connection ; this would be useful even to understand how we can bring Cardano to such instances, in other locations. So, I believe that yes, it is possible to track the progress of the project based on the deliverables, but we could further track the progress of things through different initiatives.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem is presented more as an observation than a problem \"Indonesians prefer simple visual infographics through YouTube and IG to learn about Cardano.\" \r\nThis preference is only a problem if NO content exists in such platforms like IG or Youtube.

This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable Indonesians to learn about Cardano and cryptos in general. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include rise in numbers of Cardano Indonesia Youtube, Instagram followers, workshop participants and bi-weekly participants of the Eastern Town Hall, and rise in proposals submission for Project Catalyst.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Indonesians who know about and are comfortable with Cardano. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. Simple infographics and videos will reach kids as well as adults and inculcate in kids the desire to use crypto more than fiat currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and infographics , and put links to some of the videos/infographics on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. For graphics you can use imgur or photobucket or send them to your instagram page itself. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has  not provided evidence  of the team whose relevant skills and experience are needed to complete the project. It would have been better if they put the linkedin profiles of team members along with their experience right here.These links are not sufficient. Linkedin or FB profiles would have added value. No profiles are provided.\r\nThere is no way to assess their competence as no personal profile links are given.  The proposal doesn't give details of team members. There is no team structure and breakdown given.\r\n\r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as project management , marketing and other costs.   \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Their output is only one video or Instagram post a month.  The price of a video is exorbitantly high. THe price of an Instagra m infographic is also far too high considering their development is happening in Indonesia. Being from a country which also has lower income levels than Indonesia, I can confidently say that these prices are too high to be reasonable. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to create one video or one Instagram post per month.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal  does not provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very high level broad plan but there is no detailed breakdown in the plan. Also as stated above the costs are in my opinion too high. Even creation of intro, logo and banner is given as 200 USD which is high. \r\n\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are not well described. It is a broad level plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects  \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal  \r\n \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should also seek to include the teams FB profiles or Linkedin Profiles with links to their CV or work experience. If a company, then link to the corporate web page or Linkedin Profile . \r\n\r\nTeam members profiles should be included in as much detail as possible. You should also reconsider your budget and if it costs this much to produce, seek to get production done from lower priced providers in other countries. You can get the same quality job for far lower cost and thereby maximise your saving. Also seek to increase your offering from one Video or IG post per month to about 1-2 per week. Otherwise you would probably lose the audience who want daily or weekly content.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a no clear roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.  \r\n\r\nThere are clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal namely the creation of the one video and one instagram post.  \r\nThere is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem but in my opinion creating one video a month or one instagram post would not be sufficient to create the awareness and trust that the proposers intend to have. One video a week or two a week would be more realistic.\r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer. \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer. Try to create more content. Content is key.  Develop metrics that help you to track.   Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information provided is not sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence i have given a 3 star rating. \r\n ", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposer/s have a great plan, they have explained what the money is used for, they have a clear timeline and they have facts to support their reasons.
