It is very positive that the team involved here already has successful funding at f6, and the project is also in the area of \u200b\u200btranslation, which demonstrates that they already have experience and are competent to deal with this area. I also found it very good that this proposal intends to work with several languages, which are not so simple to translate, in a satisfactory way, using the automatic mechanisms that are already available today on the internet. I would have liked the authors to have explained the heart of the project in a more accessible way; I understood what they're going to do in general, but I was still a little confused in the details. The Dapp they intend to create (a parenthesis: this project also dialogues the challenge of Dapps, which is great as we could address two challenges in a single proposal) will work with \"cross translation\" from a \"fixed set of lexemes\" . I would like the authors to better conceptualize what exactly these concepts are, which are not so common and known, at least for those who do not work directly with translation. I also liked that they defined which languages \u200b\u200bwould be covered in the project, giving us a more solid sense of what is to come. In general, I believe the proposal will have a high impact, what I would ask is just to clarify some specific terms so that the general public can understand this idea more deeply.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I believe that the credibility of this team is very high, due to the following facts. First, that they already have a funded project in the area of \u200b\u200btranslation (it would be very interesting if they had made the final product available here, so that we could get to know it more closely and understand the characteristics of their work). Second, because they have attached a website where there is a space dedicated to the presentation of the team, containing a short description of each, as well as links that direct us to their individual pages, where we can get to know them better. And finally, due to the technical content of this proposal, so technical that I confess that I didn't understand 100% of the creations that would be made here, which demonstrates a lot of mastery over what is being worked on. Regarding the roadmap, we have here a breakdown of actions guided by the passage of time in quarters. It's a good summary of what will be done, however, I think we could have more details about each part. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, they plan to expand the database... But how will this be done, at what scale? We don't know exactly which languages \u200b\u200bwill be explored first and which ones would be part of the expansion, for example. I would also like to know more about the visual identity of the project (we have designers on the team, it would be important to understand how the interface is being designed, ie, how the end user would interact with Dapp), as I think it would be important to know more about the marketing of this project. The authors do not explain how they would spread the idea, make it reach the target audience, which is always important regardless of the proposal. Regarding the financial division, I believe that the details provided are satisfactory, the requested amount is well in line with the project, that is, it is not exaggerated and covers the costs of what will be worked well. So I think the only part I would like to know more about is the project progress, the steps, and details that don't exactly relate to the translation, like the construction of the UI/UX design and also the marketing plan.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, this was the part of the proposal that left the most to be desired; we have some KPIs that aren't quite detailed. I wish the authors had been more concerned with outlining ways in which the community could follow the progress of things, exercise auditability. The first 2 KPIs (number of lexemes supported / number of sentences) could have been explained further, what would be lexemes? (again), what would these sentences look like? Only the third KPI is more accessible, fully understandable for everyone, which is the number of platform users. I think for this project it would be necessary for the team to join the rest of the community to think of different ways to monitor the progress of the project. I suggest that they prepare reports periodically and present them to the rest of the community through some communication channel, some Discord server or even participation in a Town Hall. It would also be interesting if a speaker of each language that will be explored here could test Dapp and give feedback to the rest of the community, for example. In general, I believe that the auditability of this project needs to be revised to achieve more positive results.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The concept has a lot of potential and can drive the project in the right direction.\r\n\r\nBased on the information provided it seems that the proposal fits well in the challenge objectives.
