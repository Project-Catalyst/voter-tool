This would very well achieve what the challenge calls for, it would help in the dissemination of our technologies to non-English speakers. However, I think the proposal was explained a little superficially. Not exactly what the translated content is. We know it would be about Plutus and Cardano, but that's just the surface. What, within these matters, would be said? What topics, in what order, and why? Several fronts are promised: translation into Swahili on important sites for Cardano; creation of a news portal; of a podcast... There are many places, but not one of them is properly explained. For example: how often are the contents of pre-existing sites in school? What content would be covered in the podcast, and why? How often would the new news portal be fed, would it be local or global news? Unfortunately, it is not possible to have a good understanding of the practical part of the proposal. The issue is real and relevant, although I remember that there are no proposals with the aim of generating translations in Swahili, but there is certainly always more to be done: the question here would be to measure how this would be done, often, how would it go reach the target audience and so on. Without such data, it is difficult to define the impact both for the country and for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team does not establish a pre-defined script to comply with pre-defined actions. We know very well what would be done, in this case, the various things. But this is different from drawing up an action plan. A timetable could be established, in which authors clarify how such translations/content creation would be done. For example, in the same week, would pre-existing content be translated and 1 new subject created in podcast and in the news portal? How would this frequency be? What subjects would be covered, in order? Who would do what to make things happen? I believe that a script should be established, not even in phases, but with the exact schedule of what would be done when and by whom. Regarding the team, this part is excellent. We know who those involved are, what their backgrounds are and what they would do in the project, and it's very positive that we have here people who are knowledgeable about the Cardano blockchain. A lot of confidence is passed on to the team in carrying out this project, and it's especially valid when they claim these translations would be done from native to native - which makes the degree of comprehension high. And about the financial division, there are details, but it could be more in-depth. The total amount is divided into topics, which gives a good understanding of how the requested money would be spent. But when I say it could be more detailed, for example: \"marketing - $2200\". We don't know how this money would be used in detail. It is not defined at any time how the marketing campaign would be, which would be necessary to understand the use of this money. So on for the other topics: some are quite simple and don't need as much detail, while others do. I would like to make an observation: although the funding is high, I found the translators and publisher's pay to be low, I think they deserved more for their efforts. Who knows, the requested amount could be distributed again, in order to make a fairer payment?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe this proposal is very auditable. I think this is because the authors list several goals they want to achieve - so we have a lot of content to monitor. Although success metrics and exact KPIs have not been established, it is possible to verify whether the information passed in the detailed plan session was achieved or not. I think the follow-up could be done in two ways: from the inside out or from the outside to the inside. From the inside out: the members of the team themselves could prepare reports summarizing the progress of activities, how the translations were being carried out, how the podcast was being recorded, the construction of the news page... Check data such as: audience reach , mention on social networks, audience interaction, content released per week and so on. And an outside-in analysis could also be done: how would this project be impacting the Swahili community? A survey could be carried out directly with the public, in order to understand if the objectives were achieved in practice, that is, if they think that the availability and quality of content in their local language has really been increased. It would be interesting if the inhabitants of the country itself could make a direct return to the Cardano community. But in general, I think so, this topic is well covered, it's just not perfect because KPIs and success indicators are still missing here, in a straightforward way.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 11, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal identifies a problem that Swahili speakers in the East Africa region have no available resources to access and education to provide awareness.\r\nThe proposal would build a strong foundation and connection of the Projects with the native individuals, establish local representatives, provide easily understood contents and assist to attract users and experts in the Cardano native community in this region. That will help to add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\r\nRaising awareness for Cardano Community in Tanzania is a good goal aligned with the outlined challenge settings but the proposer need to make clear the key metrics such as: the decreased number or ratio of people scammed or quantity of users and experts attracted in the Cardano community in the East Africa Region after 12 months,...", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer provides reference links to relevant skills and experience of each member of the team but I found that no person has translation experience needed to implement the proposal but they are almost content creators with background on Financial & Forex Market and Blockchain Technology, not on Cardano in particular.
