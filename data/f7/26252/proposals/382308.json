The team claims they already have a youtube channel where they post videos with this proposal of simplifying, that is, making videos in animation and in a more accessible language, to avoid them becoming \"boring and difficult\", as they themselves claim that most of the content on the subject is. However, if we're going to notice, this channel was created now, at the time I write this review the first video was posted just 4 days ago. In this way, I don't think it can be said that the team has experience with the activity it intends to develop. I'm also worried about the fact that the animation videos would be generated by software, VideoScribe, and not by animators themselves; I don't know the quality and subtlety of videos made by a software would be the same as by someone who works with it. I believe there are already several videos on youtube about Cardano, Blockchain, etc. in English; so I think maybe it would be more useful to focus on content for the Vietnam audience, especially given what this challenge seeks, and maybe insert English subtitles in such videos as well. In summary, the proposal can bring the results we hope to the bottom, but it needs to be thought carefully about how each video will be constructed, if it is really necessary to do half English/half Vietnamese (my opinion: focus on the content in Vietnamese), as well as a way to publicize this work to the Vietnam community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This part of the proposal is very well detailed. The team is concerned with giving a brief description of each team member, and also what each time prior to this project, in which area they worked and how, as well as the telegram contacts of all ears. They also give us what the subjects covered in the videos would be, although in my opinion 104 videos is too high a quantity to start the project. They could have a slightly smaller goal, after all, they gave us subjects for only 15 videos, if it was one in English and one in Vietnamese, it would be 30. What would the other 74 be about? I believe it would be more appropriate to ask for the money to fund fewer videos, and renew the order on f8 if the proposal succeeds as planned. It is very positive how they give us the frequency at which they intend to release the videos (2 per week) and what would be the task of each team member to make this project a reality, which gives us a sense of the script to be followed. About the marketing plan, I think this part left something to be desired. What we are told is that \"Mrs. Hannah will share these videos with the community\", which would lead those 1500 telegram people to know about the project, but outside of that group, how do the authors intend to reach the Vietnamese audience? It would be necessary for them to set aside a portion of the funding to take care of advertising, hire someone to do a strong publicity campaign that would exactly reach the target audience they intend to reach. They themselves say how difficult it is to find blockchain content online, because most of the stuff that involves the cryptographic world is of the \"get very rich\" nature, because it wants to attract new investors with the possibility of high profits, which can, in fact, happen, but Cardano ecosystem technologies go beyond that promise. How can people in Vietnam who have no contact with the community know about the existence of this channel? About the division of the financing money, I found that everything is ok, they divide who would do what, for how many hours, what is the cost of the hour of work, resulting in a total of 345$ spent per week. In this part, I believe that everything is as it should be. It is only necessary to recover 1) the amount of videos (very ambitious, in my opinion) 2) how the marketing of this campaign would be, beyond the group on the telegram.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team is concerned about giving us content to monitor during auditability, but it is not very extensive. What I would suggest is that some member of the community from the country in question can work to monitor whether the videos are actually being posted, whether the content in Vietnamese is accessible and bring that information to the rest of the community. It would also be interesting if the team itself gave us feedback on how the videos are reaching the target audience, how many submissions are there, and whether these people are intending to actively participate in the ecosystem, either through Catalyst or working elsewhere. The auditability is a bit shallow, especially if we compare it with the item previously analyzed, which had a lot of detail. I believe the team needs to revisit these details so that we, the rest of the community, especially non-Vietnamese speakers, can understand if the project is meeting the desired expectations and that this information comes to us through data and numbers.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 11, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "What saddens me about this proposal is the problem statement. It is not true that there are few contents about blockchain technology. Nowadays have thousands of sources, channels, courses, etc. If the problem statement AND the solution focused only in the Vietnamese content I would not complain.\r\n\r\nThat said, in order to address better this challenge, I would rather focus only in the Vietnamese speaker, making videos only to them and reducing the overall budget. The challenge addresses the entry barriers based on language, therefore you should take it into account.\r\n\r\nOther point that should be pointed out is that the metrics and goals are not well defined.  How many people are you expecting to reach with these videos e.g.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "All the videos and the translations are quite simple to do. I don't see any major barrier that demands great efforts to surpass. That said, I think that creating the content only in Vietnamese would be more useful and would allow the team to have more content in this language \u2013 not necessarily reducing the budget, but reallocating it.\r\n\r\nIn order to scale, how is the plan to monetize and keeping creating content or even increase the releasing rate, or enhance the quality of these videos?\r\n\r\nMaybe investing some of the budget in marketing in order to reach more people would help it grow faster and will allow you to monetize.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since the videos will be published on YT it's quite easy to verify if the proposal is being done.

There are plenty of content about blockchain and cardano in english already produced, even by other past funds. Furthermore, \"boring\" and \"hard to understand\" seem a little subjective, specially considering the varienty of material existing.\r\n\r\nMaybe here, the best option is to focus on vietanemese language, both to make the project run quicker and cheaper. Only if videos are succesful in Vietnam, I'd consider providing them in eglish as well, but with subtitles in order not to have record audio again.\r\n\r\nAnother point that could've been highlighted here is how many people in vietnam use cardano and how many they intend to reach and engage, to give a more insightful perspective on the total potential impact. A communication startegy would also be welcomed as this content would compete with others.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be nice to have a dedicated place (could be like an online portal) for Q&A and discussions.\r\n\r\nAs good points in the proposal, I liked the content is already defined and seems to cover good topics.

With hand-drawn images on videoscribe software, it is possible to create very interesting content with images and attract viewers.\r\nIf content about in-depth knowledge about blockchain can also create attraction and excitement like content about dump and pump of blockchain projects in the crypto market, then Proposal can completely help everyone in the market.

It would not increase adoption and community engagement of Vietnamese speakers because the proposal does not set viewers as the target of the proposal.\r\nAs my reading, the only target of the proposal is the videos (It states through the proposal: in the problem statement, plan, solution, KPIs and budget).

The plan is also very clear about what is being done and how to do.\r\nHowever, it's all about the videos (number of videos, videos contents, how much cost for making videos,etc). I highly recommend the team re-set the target, and add information about viewers as expected, set the active viewers and their feedback in the success metric/KPIs.
