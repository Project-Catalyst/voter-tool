It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by creating localized presentation- and training material. \r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would create a modular DLT/Blockchain presentation & training framework German industrialists and workers. This presentation kit can be used at all levels of industry. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include the building of the  presentation kit ie Consulting Artifact.The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is comprehensive and well laid out.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further developing and fine tuning the Presentation kit as well as building industry specific presentations. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among German Industry and global industry thereafter.\r\nI feel that this project adequately addresses the challenge hence i have given it a 4 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

The proposal   has given details of other team members. He has provided the team structure of members and their capabilities and other partners who he would work with such as experts, developers etc. The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. Clear costs have been given for the various hosting fees on platforms and marketing campaign costs as well as podcast apps.   The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 100 USD per hour for domain experts and seems somewhat high to be reasonable. \r\n\r\nLabor cost for project management has been taken as 50 USD per hour which is high even by Western standards. A Labor cost of 30 USD is more reasonable.  \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal  provides  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.

Given experience and plan presented it is likely this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 4 star rating.\r\n \r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.
