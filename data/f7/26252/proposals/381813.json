The author gives us a brief account of a project that he is already putting into practice, as I understand it, they are face-to-face meetings in a place called a clubhouse, whose main agenda is to discuss Cardano and Blockchain. This is very interesting, because it shows the author's involvement with the cause, even before receiving funding. However, I have some observations to make. First, the author says right from the beginning of the proposal that \"one of the most influential projects in the world, in fact, one of Cardano's emblematic projects will be carried out in partnership with Ethiopia\". Okay, but what project is this? It would be very important for the author to clarify this issue so that people from outside, who have no contact with this project or who are local participants in the country, who have a better chance of getting to know it, can understand what is being said here. Another thing I noticed was in the part where he says the Ethiopian population is more likely to access audio content than written content on websites, that he did some studies and research and came to this conclusion. I would like him to argue that, what his researches were, what data he collected, how he arrived at this conclusion, etc. Apart from such questions, I believe that yes, the proposal is of high value and will have a positive impact on the issue of bringing knowledge about Cardano to speakers of other languages.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Here we have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwho would do what through the \"roles and tasks\" topic. I found the way the team organizes this information is very direct and satisfactory, as we can clearly visualize which professional would be responsible for which part of the project. However, an extremely important thing was not done here, which would be the presentation of the team. We don't know their names, which area of \u200b\u200bactivity they each have, a brief history of their work so far and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. Having this information would be essential to transmit greater certainty that the team is capable of developing this project. I think that some information about the process itself was also missing, for example: what average duration of recordings? What subjects, specifically, would be covered, and in what order? Who would these professionals be who would be invited? I would like him to have detailed more about the content itself, beyond the need for its creation and how it would impact the Ethiopian community. Regarding expenses, this part of the proposal was very detailed, we know how the amount of USD 3500 (a modest amount compared to what most proposals ask for funding) will be used. The division is very fair and realistic, but I missed the payment of the people involved. For example, who would present the podcast, the special guest, wouldn't these people get paid? For these reasons, I believe that the proposal lacks more detail, in order to understand more about the podcast creation process, to get to know the authors of the proposal better and more details about the generated content.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author sets KPIs by which we can monitor whether goals are being met. It would be interesting if he prepared a monthly report evidencing the data cited in these KPIs and sent it to the community, exhibited during a Town Hall the consequences of his project, that is, let the rest of the community know what is happening in the locality and feedback that your podcast is receiving. I consider this a simple auditability proposal, what needs to be done is really to keep in touch with the author, maybe someone who speaks Amharic and is already part of the Cardano community can listen to the podcast and establish a bridge with the author, to give suggestions and also to be able to guarantee to us (non-Amharic speakers) that the content is being built as promised. It is also necessary to monitor the marketing campaign for this project, because in my view it is a key to success, since the main objective would be to involve the country's inhabitants with knowledge relevant to Cardano and make them more prepared and interested to adhere to the projects that will be developed there in the future. That's why it's essential to ensure that content will reach them, that each podcast will be widely publicized. So, I believe that the author provided us with content to be monitored, I suggest that there is this kind of feedback from him (I mentioned ideas such as a written report or participation in townhall), and also the monitoring of some community member who is a speaker of the language in question.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 11, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem of the Ethiopian community losing the opportunities that Cardano offers was described and as a solution, the creation of an Amharic audio content about Cardano was presented. This proposal has the potential to have a great impact on the community since, as explained by the proposer, few Ethiopians speak English and therefore do not have access to information about Cardano. This proposal is in line with the challenge as it intends to attract non-English speakers to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer does not present evidence of his experiences, which would be important to check the project's viability. The budget has been detailed and appears to be reasonable for the work to be carried out. The proposer does not identify who are the other members who will work on the project despite describing their functions and tasks. A roadmap with milestones is also not presented, which would be important for evaluating the feasibility of the proposal. The proposal does not appear to have greater risks for its implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal clearly presents the target problem and its solution. A roadmap with milestones is not provided, which would be important for monitoring and evaluating the progress of the work.

It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Amharic audio content for the people in Ethiopia, explaining Cardano blockchain. \r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Ethiopians to understand everything about Cardano and the opportunities it presents. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community. \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of engagementss, and abovementioned key metrics. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Ethiopians to listen to and participate in the podcast thereby increasing knowledge on Cardano.\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has   provided evidence  of himself  where he is a managing the local Cardano Community on telegram and having Clubhouse discussions  .

Clear costs have been given for the various hosting fees on platforms and marketing campaign costs as well as podcast apps.   \r\n\r\nThe budget is  very reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the site and related publications.\r\nThe proposal  does  provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.
