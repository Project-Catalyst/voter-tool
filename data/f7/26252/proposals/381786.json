The authors argue that knowledge absorption is better when dealing with their mother tongue, which makes a lot of sense, because the person would not be struggling twice as much to understand what is being taught as to understand a different language. Although the idea is in theory a good one, there was a detail that I thought is very harmful for success: the fact that only a sample of these videos would be made available for free, if the person wanted to see it in its entirety, they would have to pay a fee every day. , which would go to the creator. Well, I believe that there are many platforms on the internet with blockchain content, and through our effort here at Catalyst, more and more content about Cardano will be created and disseminated. These being free and easily accessible content, in different languages \u200b\u200b(how we seek to finance this challenge, for example, and also in challenges that focus on different territories such as Africa, Japan and Latin America). Why would a person want to pay for such apprenticeships if there are so many free alternatives? I don't think the best method of encouraging new people to enter the Cardano ecosystem is to make them pay an amount for it, however small. In my view it is more appropriate to provide free education and training for them to adopt our blockchain and our currency, acquire NFT, smart contracts and the various technologies in Cardano. Later, with people who are already users of our network, a series of paid actions can be promoted, but I do not believe that the time for this is at this gateway to Cardano. Another point I was wondering about was the issue of translations. The community would make these translated audios, how would they be synchronized with the image, who would edit that? Would these translations be paid for? Because it doesn't seem very logical to me to charge someone to watch the video for the money to be passed on to the content creator and there is no part for the translators either. Unfortunately, I found the idea to have several downsides and I don't think it would have an immediate and considerable impact on the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team is quite complete and seems highly qualified; the names, functions and linkedin of each of the members are provided. However, I missed marketing and design people to work on the project, which are extremely important areas for success, as this platform needs to be highly publicized and have an ergonomic and friendly interface to encourage its use. In the implementation phases UI/UX design is mentioned, but who would be responsible for that? The team proposes a script, but extremely short, talking about what would happen over time. For example, in the first 3 months, the platform would be created with basic tools (which ones?). The implementation phases could have been slotted into months, for example, in month 1 this and that activity would be done and so on, in order to form a more solid sense of the process as a whole. I think there was a lot of detail missing, I can't understand how this platform would be created, the implementation phases themselves are written in a very technical way, so people outside the area don't understand as well as developers what would be done. And finally, the financial division is also lacking in details, I believe it is the numbers next to the things mentioned in the implementation phases, but I would like the authors to have separated a topic just to talk about money and explain why this amount would be used for what and give more details about each small part. For example, as I understand $2000 would go to the UI/UX design, but what would that look like? What would be the hourly price of the person (designer?) who would be responsible, for how long would you develop this project? Overall, the only part of this topic that I felt completely safe was the team presentation, otherwise I would like more details.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The authors provide us with some KPIs that could serve as guides for monitoring the project, which are basically the reach to the audience of this platform and whether this is bringing as a consequence the entry of new participants (speakers of different languages) to the Cardano community . They also promise to publish reports with the results of these KPIs, which is quite positive, basically all bidders provide KPIs (when they do!) but leave it up to the community to monitor them or not. What I didn't understand was where these reports would be published and I also think there was a typo here, because they say that until the first six months they will publish the results monthly and after that period, monthly...? Anyway, I would like them to clarify where they would show us this data and clarify the issue of how often this would be done.
