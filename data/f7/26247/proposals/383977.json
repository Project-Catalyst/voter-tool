The challenge this proposal attempts to address is important and I wholeheartedly support. It clearly lays out different aspects of the challenges and corresponding solutions - decentralization to fight against manipulation and increase the credibility of the information source, large-scale language models to flag contents, frontend that not just provides a credibility score estimate but also explainability, proposed incentive program to increase usage of the tool. Therefore, I strongly agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems to be affiliated with a research institution and everyone on the team has NLP background. From a technical readiness perspective, some of the open-source language models are really powerful and fine-tuning those for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis are straightforward. However, the team does need an engineer with enough blockchain experience to develop the solution for the decentralized funding mechanism. The solution architecture seems reasonable as well. Plans of execution and relevant technology stacks are clearly specified. Therefore I strongly agree this proposal will be implemented successfully.

I would encourage the team to consider additional metrics to measure the stickiness of the solution instead of just the pure number of users. E.g., average number of news per user that the tool is applied on. It would also be useful for the team to post how they are planning on tracking and improving the performance of the fake-news evaluation ML models. Since the models will be posted on SingularityNET marketplace, and a front-end will be developed, the community can hold the team accountable and make sure they are on good progress.

The product uses AI to detect manipulation/fake news and will incentive users to interact with the system through it own token on Cardano.

You could test them by providing some labeled data or comparing to predictions and if they are providing malicious bad data you slash their stake?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have already built an MVP and have most of the roles required.

The proposers are willing to migrate to the Cardano blockchain along with SingularityNet. \r\nHowever, it is important to note that there needs to be a very clear definition of what is 'fake news'. It can't evolve into something that starts to label anything and everything against a certain agenda as hatespeech. It is good that there is an acknowledgement in the proposal that this project is not supposed to tell what the truth is, as these are all subjective in nature and pose a real danger to censorship. So the question that needs to be asked would be wether or not the world would be a better place by censoring articles that are (politically) incorrect? Because indirectly, even with a numerical indicator while the content would still be accessible, this proposal is threatening to the notion of freedom of speech and personal liberty. \r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team's relevant experience claimed in the proposal should suffice to transfer this already functioning prototype from Ethereum to Cardano, keeping in mind that the code it is written in on Ethereum (I presume Solidity?) should theorethically also be able to run on Cardano. The prospected budget is benchmarked to Czech Republic salaries and has been pegged to respective time-equivalents as it isn't full-time, which is a thought-through choice. There has been put some thought in making this project self-fundable by means of SPO-funding and revenue from ML-services on SingularityNet. \r\nOne possible loophole that could be identified is what would keep a user from intentionally searching from articles that are registered as malicious in your system in order to reap daily rewards. Is there a failsafe in place for this or not? ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers are trying to be as transparent as possible to make this project's funding proposal as auditable as possible. The funding mechanism has been communicated very openly and the budget breakdown is detailed. The public launch date has been presumably set within 10 months after the funding governance phase. The lack of a roadmap has been accounted for for reasons that the proposers do not wish to make guesses on uncertainties in the near future, but they have vowed to publish this as soon as possible, an openness which is appreciated. On the website there is limited information available on the team members, which could be elaborated a bit more in terms of auditability improvement.

IF this is correct it would certainly help provide activity on SN and Cardano networks. The problem I have is that how far does their plugin goes into telling something is \"fake news\" since the plugin doesn't actually tell you it's true/false to quote them \"Verifee does not determine what is and is not true. Instead, it infers the credibility of an article by analyzing its properties and parameters using artificial intelligence.\".", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Since the team already has work done and is planning on transferring their ML/AI to SingularityNet, I have no doubt they are capable of this proposal. For the detailed plan itself, we have a rudimental roadmap and well-explained budget breakdown, where they state that they are in need of a blockchain engineer. What is also a surplus is that the team thought of a way to self-fund this proposal after the funding is done. By creating an SPO you make this a self-sustaining plugin that needs little funding. One thing that should've been stated in the proposal and that I couldn't find is the reward system, will there be a cap on the reward system?
