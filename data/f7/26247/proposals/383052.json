The ability to detect fraud on block chain transactions would obviously be very useful. Though given the inability to cancel transactions, in a deployment it would need to be built into the block chain itself and flagged transaction not be committed until verified and real. It is a research project, so success is obviously not guaranteed, but that doesn't mean its not worth funding the effort. Its a relatively small funding request so I would be inclined to support it. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a nice idea and the proposers have some good experience in the area. My biggest worry with the plan is lack of details on the data. Do they have access to merchant data, or just querying the blockchain for transactions itself. The point being you cannot learn the characteristics of fraudulent transactions without labeled examples of fraudulent transactions. Do they have access to a large dataset of labeled fraudulent transactions (which merchants may posses? The proposers are associated with Volibra, but its not clear it if it has transaction or is a system under development. Its the sort of thing banks and payments providers like Visa have for normal transactions) If so, you can do supervised learning and probably come up with some powerful results. If not you can only do unsupervised. You will be able to cluster into different groups, but there is no way to force any of these clusters to be a fraudulent cluster. You just don't have the data.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a roadmap against which delivery of models and systems can be audited.

When referencingthe Ethereum blockchain, these types of fraud have been prevalent both in the past and the present. Currently there are multiple payment systems under development on the Cardano blockchain, which makes one wonder if there is a need for such a variety. In this case, the technology that is intended to develop could serve a bigger purpose if multiple systems could adopt it.

From my experience developing novel machine learning models, it will require substantial experimentation to tune the system for effectiveness, but that's the point of the proposal!\r\n\r\nThere is also a good connection to SingularityNet through the proposal to provide the application developed through their marketplace.
