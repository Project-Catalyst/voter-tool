From going through these videos there are clear explanations given on the topic areas of machine learning, Haskell and smart contracts.

The proposer may need to request more funds or choose to complete the proposal without further funding - this is a noteworthy risk to the feasibility of the proposal. The budget focusses on the hardware requirements and doesn't detail the proposers time.\r\n\r\nIn future proposals it would be great to have information on why the proposer hasn't included a budget for their time and what implications that may have to their ability to execute the proposal. With that information added a community advisor can easily give them a maximum rating in the future. It would also be great to see a LinkedIn profile or slightly more information about the proposers background (the YouTube videos were at least a great source to verify the proposers knowledge to a certain degree)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of clarity the proposal is of high quality where references are given to other work and information is detailed about the market showing the proposer has a good grasp of the market and the problem area.

The intern will join in Feb-2022\n\nRegarding the Auditablity, please note that we are using NonInteractive Zero Knowledge proofs using the sigma protocols. So every party who is involved in the training will provide proof of their computation, a third party can then audit this. I am creating a detailed white paper and I love your idea of adding an infographic. I will incorporate that. Also please watch my YouTube video on security challenges.
