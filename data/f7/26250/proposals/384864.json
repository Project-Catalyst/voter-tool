It's a very good one because it meets both the company's and the customer's wishes. The company in the sense of promoting the consumption of its products and/or services through reward strategies (we see that this is already happening today, for example, in food delivery apps there are certain promotions such as \"order 4 times and the Thursday will be free\"). And for the customer, in general, it's always good to get a bonus for something they already consume. For the Cardano ecosystem, this would be interesting in the sense of generating new tokens to be registered in the blockchain, which could even bring new users to the ecosystem. Therefore, I believe it is an idea that appeals to many fronts. It is also very positive how the authors determine, in three topics (feasibility, schedule and budget) because this proposal fits well with the challenge. I agree. It will create a platform for strategic use, within the pre-established budget limits in the fund and with that, bring benefits to the entire Cardano ecosystem and affiliated businesses.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is very simple, we are told what would be done in the months from February to April. I believe that there could be more details in relation to these activities, such as: in which weeks of the month each would be developed, who would be the professionals involved in each stage, and so on. In this way, our vision would be more solid in relation to the process. As for the budget and team presentation, both are very well detailed and explained. Starting with the team presentation, an extensive description of each team member is made, so that we can know who they are, what their roles in the project are, what are the things they have worked on before and so on. The team seems to be very well prepared, having the necessary technical capacity to successfully carry out the proposal. And about the budget, similarly, it's pretty well broken down. It is basically about the salaries of professionals and also hosting fees, so we know who would earn how much and by how much it would be multiplied in terms of time. I believe that the only thing I would improve would be the detailing of the process (script).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability can be easily measured through the three points that the authors explored. It is, in short, the adoption of the platform: number of loyalty programs created, companies that have adopted the tokens and which market areas the companies operate. I think it's pretty simple to keep track of whether the project is being successful. This can be done either by the team (in this case, they can prepare this feedback and present it to the community through one of our various communication channels); both by the members of the Cardano ecosystem themselves (although I find it easier for those inside the project to gather such data). Something I thought here that could further improve this auditability would be for companies themselves to provide feedback (it doesn't have to be anything long or complex, maybe a form could be created in the short docs with a few questions) so that we can understand if sales increased with the adoption of NFT, if the customers in fact became loyal and so on. It is a very auditable proposal, it is enough that such monitoring is put into practice.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 10, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Loyalty tokens for businesses is a great idea.
