Transparency would be a big step forward to gain users trust. Thinking for a solution to secure the users funds in the bot's wallet would be a better approach for a successful product.\r\n\r\nThe proposer has taken into consideration the risk regarding the Telegram API performance but is not aware about the legal constrains (how regulated is, in Ethiopia, the payment system using cryptocurrencies?).\r\n\r\nThe budget is outlined and broken down into identifiable items. However, is unclear how many developers will split the $5k amount and what Marketing consists of, thus making difficult to estimate if is reasonable or not, to achieve the proposed goals.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It is unclear if this projects needs additional funding taking into consideration that it has an extended time frame of operability for 12 months (at least) as the statement about self sustainability, based on staking rewards and loan APY (APR), is just an assumption (a financial analysis is required to make those products attractive both for users and the lenders).\r\nBased on the provided and gathered info there are drawbacks that can lead to an unsuccessful product medium/long term", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_309", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "My initial reaction to this was \"why telegram\", but that answer was quickly given by the proposer and it makes sense. Telegram is the single most widely used application in Ethiopia and Cardano should be everywhere it's potential users are. Given the success of WeChat's in app payment, I think it's only natural that we have a Telegram compatible payment system of our own which could potentially onboard tens of thousands of users to Cardano using this real-world use case.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think the proposal itself is rather humble and reasonable.
