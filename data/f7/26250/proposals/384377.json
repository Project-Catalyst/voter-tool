Where this proposal garnered my high agreement in terms of its Impact/Alignment is in the novelty of the idea and the benefits it brings particularly to the cNFT community. Cardano has seen a tremendous growth of cNFTs since the Alonzo HF. There are a number of very successful projects released, raising an active community, with price floors rising which, in the end help sustain other aspects of the ecosystem to thrive, e.g. cNFT market places, artists, SCs, etc. The idea of establishing a liquidity protocol for NFT-FT has been long-awaited. That the principles had been established & proven to work in ETH moves this idea past theoretical and is executable. That this can be done in Cardano, with its low fees & the impending release of a number of DeFi applications could all add to potential success. The proposers identified themselves as Plutus Pioneers & this bodes well given the uniqueness in developmental approach required for eUTXO & the timelines presented fits well with the requirements of the challenge. Good luck.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a very good likelihood this proposal can be executed to completion. Firstly, the two proposers are Plutus graduates. It's a good thing they have named themselves because despite the lack of links to profiles within their proposal, they're searchable in Linkedin for confirmation of their bona fides, which matches the required skillset for this undertaking. The background info provided shows an understanding of the requirements and their clear explanation would bode well for voters who may not be familiar with how liquidity and such protocols work. They also have indicated they aren't starting from scratch with a V1 currently undergoing testing with an impending release in January 2022, prior to the completion of the F8 vote. This gives the impression that even if they do not gain funding from Catalyst, their own growing community and supporters in Discord could be rallied to provide the seed funding needed. The 0-3 month roadmap is very basic but can be forgiven seeing they have essentially built V1 and would be ready for an audit following testing. This is more than 50% of the roadmap. There is no breakdown of costs nor an explanation of how the $9999 will be spent. As a former assessor of tenders for a university, this can be overlooked given the qualifications of the proposers and the very start-up feel & approach this proposal has, which would agree with how mini/low-budget developments often deploy. The team seems to be well-prepared with the identification of potential risks to the project. The questions they are asking however may only be answered once the protocol is live and being used by ADA-cNFT holders. The fact there is an awareness indicate potential issues had been discussed and hopefully, mitigations considered. Overall, I agree this would be feasible whether or not funded by Catalyst, but where this proposal may further benefit voter knowledge is with a more in-depth explanation of which five (5) NFT projects are on their radar, or at east being considered. They could also potentially explain the min requirements for NFT projects to be considered as the starting five for their V1 protocol. Perhaps in the future, the 'CNFT Alliance' Charles called for in his twitter space could be consulted when it's eventually established.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I'm strongly agreeing to its auditability on the basis of the Discord channel where the proposers can be reached and the availability of their gitbook page, which I hope would be enhanced with each development stage, at least contextually. They are also intending to release V1 sometime in Jan 2022, prior to the end of Fund 8 and this could support auditability despite the lack of a GitHub page. There is no mention if the proposers intend to open-source the protocols code or not but Github would only be for the auditability of the code in any case. There is an expectation that the outcome of the code audit, as mentioned int he roadmap, to be made public since this is a marketable and verifiable aspect of the liquidity protocol, which could only raise its status given Cardano's up-coming DApp rating system. And if all that fails, that they are Plutus Pioneers means they are known to Lars Brunjes. We can always send him in to check in on them :) \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 13, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal speaks directly to the main objectives of the challenge, by creating proper initial seeding of NFT liquidity pools to enable the use of NFTs in Cardano DeFi to solve problem with ineffective NFT liquidity pools due to low liquidity. Should this project is successfully delivered, it can have big impact in cardano DeFi and NFT metaverse. The project could drive massive adoption and has huge potential to be a game changer in Cardano ecosystem. The team also addresses the potential risk in the proposal:\r\n1.\tIs 10 NFTs enough to maintain the expected behavior of liquidity pools?\r\n2.\tWill impermanent loss be offset enough by yield farming/airdrops?\r\n3.\tHow do we prevent incentive models from failing in the event of sudden drops in liquidity?\r\nThis project is sure experimenting with the idea but should it works, the reward will be great for Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team does mention relevant experience in the proposal but it lacks the evidences to back up the claim.
