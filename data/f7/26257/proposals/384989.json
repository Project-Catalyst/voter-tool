Less about the number of content and research and more about the actual end goal of Open-ended Research being adopted and added to road map. It seems impossible to measure success if you don't specify at what point you have succeeded. I believe this would be a never ending research project to improve cardano, so I don't think the amount of content is important because it should be unlimited amount of content/research, the most important part is that open-ended research is widely adopted and there is an entire project or catalyst section dedicated to open-ended research, that is success to me.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1020", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 3, "ng": 17, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Decentralization is the master key for any blockchain.
