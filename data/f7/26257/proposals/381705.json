Siloing projects, code, communities has the potential to lead to stagnation and maximalism as pointed out by the proposers. This is an opportunity to put aside differences, combine knowledge-bases, and create for benefit of not one but multiple communities. Communities that embrace these techniques and opportunities will be more capable, malleable, progressive and prepared when faced with the inevitable challenges. Maintaining the challenge as open and ongoing is just as significant and impactful allowing for continuous development in this area.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Involved communities and teams will need to move beyond their maximalist, fan-boy and influencer personas in order to work together. Professionalism, trust and respect will be required and expected, all attainable, for adoption amongst the involved blockchain communities. The desire to integrate should be explained along with the intent in a transparent and communicative manner. Although the team has vast experience I believe the budget set-forth is minimal and addressed accordingly. This has the potential to lead to many small, insignificant cross-chain collaborative efforts, that may/may-not provide value. The team also does not have the foresight to recommend future budget adjustments and should not be faulted for this, however the community should continue to provide input related to budget increases or decreases as proposed prior to each fund.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Adoption will be a relatively easy metric to view throughout Fund 8 by the respective number of proposals.
