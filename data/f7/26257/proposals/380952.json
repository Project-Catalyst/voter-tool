That is clearly the first success which can show the idea is truly great for Cardano community's development in the region as well as in the entire world. We will have many quality proposals which get funded among these 84 proposals. Besides, many of them will not have chance to be funded this time. So, it makes sense completely when the team keep proposing the idea for Fund8 challenge setting to raise the success and to give the second chance for talented and passionate proposers.\r\nIn my opinion, $500K requested fund (3.9% of the total available for Fund8) is suituable due to the challenge's diversity and the large number of participating projects ( in Fund7 \u2013 and that number will be increasing if this challenge is successful).

Having said that, Latin America has the characteristics of a high inequality region, with many informal workers and approximately half of the population going unbanked.
