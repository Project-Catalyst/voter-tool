Central to achieving this goal is taking on Climate Change. Using the issues around energy consumption, and Cardano's 'low energy profile' as a Proof of Stake blockchain, and building in projects that help align to the goals of professionalism, transparency, honesty and integrity, should be central to Cardano's mission, and I think they are. This will help to insure Climate issues are part of those goals.  The Challenge Setting will also attract both a lot of creative builders, and voters into the ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As an active community member, I am confident in my saying that the community, for sure, has the capacity to address the challenge.  There are already so many proposals that align with the goals of the proposed challenge setting, and for sure the success of the challenge would attract many new and innovative ideas.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is my humble opinion that the success criteria and suggested metrics are set to measure in addressing the challenge. I am in no way an expert in the field of Climate Change science, but, I feel the PSMs (Proposal Success Metrics) are, although a bit broad, sufficient in setting a frame or set of expectations for measurable KPIs. I might like to see, however, some hints or suggestions to quantify things like 'How big is the awareness that will be created'.  But I guess it is more for the proposers who have problems to solve and submit to the Climate Change Challenge, to come up with those details, right?! (based on specifics in their projects!).

We have seen during  past funds many Climate Change related proposals scattered through different challenges and in my view some very good ideas didn't obtain enough attention to develop and be fruitful.  We can ascertain community willingness in putting forward creative proposals addressing  human activity and climate.  Furthermore, community interest in proposing Climate themed solutions will enable a diverse evolution of developer and open source app ecosystem with global impact. We have seen already in past funds an array of proposals  related to waste management, circular economies, sustainable housing, animal conservation, farming and so on. Climate Change affects everyone and everything on the planet.  In conclusion I shall pose the question : How is this challenge not critical to achieve Cardano's mission?  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A strong and active community was born around this Challenge named Climate4Change  present regularly in Catalyst events. This is the second time the Challenge proposal seeks voters approval. The Challenge Setting proposal didn't  pass F6 voting round, nonetheless a big Challenge team of motivated people is ready to rock. Many Climate Change related proposals have been submitted scattered through out different challenges in  past funding rounds, testifying the community capabilities. \r\nA budget rationale of 500K is given and seems quite sensible and proportionate to the overall F8 Challenge Setting budget allocation of 3-4%.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I believe Key Metrics could have been more developed and detailed such as: organizations engagement, local communities involvement,  partnerships, population numbers, waste management volumes, carbon credits, geographical areas coverage, and so on.

As a result of this challenge, we may be able to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and campaigns to combat climate change and bring tremendous value and good publicity to the cause. Having an understanding of how climate change impacts Cardano and its users would be helpful to guide proposers.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst community already has the skillsets required to design decentralized applications, protocols, and incentives to regenerate local and regional ecosystems and economies.
