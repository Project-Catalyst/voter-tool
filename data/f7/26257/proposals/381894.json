The instructions for this section is labelled \"Alignment\" (not Impact) and establishes a very high bar. Asking assessors to agree or disagree that the challenge is \"critical to achieve Cardano's mission.\" As an experiment it is interesting. But without requiring 'mission critical objectives\" as a basis for award, the challenge brief does not meet this criterion. If we do consider Impact, (leaving alignment aside), the general mechanism (funding full time employment for 6 months in the Catalyst/Cardano space, whilst attractive, the likely impact of 16 persons on the community pursuing very generally defined objectives may not be significant. There are other conflicting aspects but these are enough for me to describe to justify the highest rating i can award, 3 stars - cant agree or disagree.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Again, the challenge brief seems conflicted. The criteria for selection (voting by the community to approve an application for funding is a bridge too far. The commitments are unclear. The expectation of someone or some group \"assigning tasks\" on a short term basis suggests (as do other aspects of this Challenge Brief) some authority who can direct an funded person to change what they are doing to work on some previously unknown problem. Whether the funded person has the correct skills to attack and attempt to solve that problem or not. Whoo decides? Would it be the Challenge Team? And from what well spring does that committee of 5 or so persons derive their authority to redirect a funded person to a new task. All in all this Challenge tries to include too much all at once. Biting off too big of a bite. I can see if approved, as presented, the challenge very quickly  getting paralysed in the implementation. While 16 persons collect $50k. Or is their funding cut off if they don't do as directed? (from the brief: 'Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Once more, the challenge brief is conflicted. Weekly reporting on progress can be meaningless  even as a funded person is doing something helpful. Many of the metrics seem to describe funded persons as simply being  helpful,. Look closely  the brief in the section labelled  \"What is expected from successful candidates?\r\n\r\nSupport the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. [Who decides what those problems are?]\r\nSupport the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it's needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\r\n\r\nHigh collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlap and duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it is a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHigh participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\r\n\r\nFlexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\" \r\n\r\nThe most famous similar program is the MacArthur Foundation grants (with no strings) of $250 for 12 months. Not a great deal larger than $50/6 months. They require ZERO reporting. But they select exceptionally talented  people. And no one can apply. From their site.\r\n\r\n\"Awarding unrestricted fellowships to talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE PROGRAM\r\nThe MacArthur Fellowship is a $625,000, no-strings-attached award to extraordinarily talented and creative individuals as an investment in their potential. \r\n\r\nThere are three criteria for selection of Fellows:\r\nExceptional creativity\r\nPromise for important future advances based on a track record of significant accomplishments\r\nPotential for the Fellowship to facilitate subsequent creative work.\r\nThe MacArthur Fellows Program is intended to encourage people of outstanding talent to pursue their own creative, intellectual, and professional inclinations. In keeping with this purpose, the Foundation awards fellowships directly to individuals rather than through institutions. Recipients may be writers, scientists, artists, social scientists, humanists, teachers, entrepreneurs, or those in other fields, with or without institutional affiliations. They may use their fellowship to advance their expertise, engage in bold new work, or, if they wish, to change fields or alter the direction of their careers.\r\n\r\nAlthough nominees are reviewed for their achievements, the fellowship is not a lifetime achievement award, but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential. Indeed, the purpose of the MacArthur Fellows Program is to enable recipients to exercise their own creative instincts for the benefit of human society.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation does not require or expect specific products or reports from MacArthur Fellows and does not evaluate recipients' creativity during the term of the fellowship. The MacArthur Fellowship is a \"no strings attached\" award in support of people, not projects. Each fellowship comes with a stipend of $625,000 to the recipient, paid out in equal quarterly installments over five years.\" ", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_251", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Disclaimer: my view points are shaped by my multi-year experience in product management and software development.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem of incentivizing high-contributing members is important and supports one of Fund8 objectives - grow the number of contributors.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I believe that the specific solution of introducing full-time roles is not aligned with the strategic objectives of Fund 8 because spending a chunk of budget of full-time positions, minimizes the chance of part-time involvement of new contributers and new contributors provide a higher chances for spreading word of mouth (due to uniqueness of each individual's private networks).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the current project-based model is already flexible enough to fund individuals (they just need to propose problem areas they plan to work on + KPIs) for 6+ months. Furthermore, the project-based model makes it much easier to deliver the return-on-intention for the funds allocated (a clearer connection between funding and outcomes).\r\n\r\nTo make this proposal stronger, I would suggest a much more thorough analysis of how and in which-cacses full-time positions can bring more return on intention! The arguments about tax benefits, etc are not sufficient since solving the right problems orders of magnitude more impactful than saving 20-30% on taxes.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points for not directly supporting any of Fund 8 strategic goals.\r\n- 1 point for suggesting a solution instead of clearly articulating problem by providing relevant analysis and the eveidence of impact.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal is feasible and simple to implement, since all it requires is for contributors to submit proposals for funding, which is already a widespread practice in the community.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I have reasons to believe that proving full-time positions would solve all the community problems with regards to incentivizing more members for contributions since it is likley to affect only a small fraction of them due to the limited funding.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the limited influence on the behavior of all the contributors in the community.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While some of the metrics (the number of contributions, events, etc.) help track the activity, the proposed metrics don't provide insights into the efficiency of the full-time model as compared to the project based funding - which is the key assumption behind the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe proposal can be stronger if it considered comparative metrics as well: the number of contributions(commits, events,etc.) from from full-time community vs the project-based comminuty and the satisfaction of the community with the incentives scheme.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for not tracking the impact on the underlying objectives (more contributions from the community).\r\n- 1 point for not considering competitiveness and community satisfaction.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 6, "ng": 12, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This challenge pays a small group of contributors which at least partially aligns with Cardano's mission.
