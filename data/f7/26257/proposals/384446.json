If yes, then no number of short-term support activites will fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of discussion of the underlying causes of the issue, making it possible that the funds won't have a noticeable impact.\r\n- 1 point for the challenge team out ouf one member, reducing the ability to support and provide advice to participants.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposed metrics (geographical diversity, funds staked, unique hosting providers) do help to track progress of the initiative.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, they do not provide insights into the raised underlying problem (centralization, stability), so to make progress more verifiable, I'd suggest to consider the following metrics:\r\n1) Decentralization: The % of all staked resources that come from small (less than 1% of all resources) SPOs.\r\n2) Small SPOs viability: the ROI of SPOs depending on its scale (small, medium, large). This should help insure that incentives are set right.\r\n3) The satisfaction of the small SPO Cardano community vs that in alternative ecosystems.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluting the impact on Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluting user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge question is aligned with the general Cardano mission, as decentralization is the most important goal for sustainable network.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am familiar with few independant mission focused pools, SPO's who's principles are to be independent, running their own servers.
