We are provided with a budget breakdown so we know where the funding would be used, but this does not go into detail. How do you plan on providing ADA for distributors? Will you just be handling this out or would you help them with setting up their wallets and transferring the funds?

It seems that the proponent was very enthusiastic about this proposal, however, unfortunately it is up to the challenge so I can't vote it up.\r\nIf you go ahead with the fund, I recommend that you provide a full profile of the proposed participants later, so that the community has a basis to judge whether your proposal is viable.

The proposer mentioned that they seek to promote sales in their trading, and address the challenge of price fluctuation by the use of ADA in payment.\r\nThe proposal mentioned that the future value of ADA will be regarded as universal and the benefits of accepting ADA will be superior.
