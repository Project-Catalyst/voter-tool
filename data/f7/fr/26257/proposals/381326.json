Elles n'ont que deux options : essayer de faire entrer leur proposition dans une cat\u00e9gorie ou ne pas la soumettre. Ni l'une ni l'autre ne sont excellentes pour la communaut\u00e9, car cela r\u00e9duit son potentiel et son \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Certains projets sont destin\u00e9s \u00e0 durer un cycle de financement, la communaut\u00e9 peut d\u00e9cider si la poursuite du projet est b\u00e9n\u00e9fique en soumettant une proposition de suivi. Dans les deux cas ci-dessus, il est possible que les cat\u00e9gories de fonds ne correspondent pas aux propositions soumises.
