As such i believe this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission. The only criticism i have is that 200k seems a bit steep for such a challenge, given that the scope of the challenge is quite narrow. This fits within the 1st strategic goal of Fund8 - \"Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The community has already showed it's \"strength\" throughout Project Catalyst and on the development of tools such as the ones in cardanocatalyst.st, so it should be able to tackle this challenge of dealing with Auditability if the right incentives are in place.

In the charitable giving world, monitoring and evaluation are the single function included in almost every funded program and project. However, traditional mechanisms to accomplish M&E are costly and not often very helpful, or effective. Our community should be asked to come up with innovative mechanisms that reduce the cost of M&E while increasing effectiveness.
