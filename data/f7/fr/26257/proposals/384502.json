These businesses can be inspired by Cardano. This will certainly help Cardano achieve it's mission. It's not necessarily critical though and some businesses might have to change the way they do business to better fit in with the Cardano mission. Cardano will taint it's mission by onboarding businesses that are/become counter productive to the mission. Not something that is likely to happen, but still a possibility. This challenge setting is also not entirely aligned with the Fund 8 Challenge setting strategic goals. Like Making Cardano open source, evolving developer and app ecosystem and getting more people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Catalyst community come from all different paths of life and there is a lot of entrepreneurs in this space.

The two metrics that were provided are very measurable and it would've been nice to see a list of similar metrics. The success criteria involves getting all financial businesses that are exploring blockchain, into using Cardano.  What about the other businesses. Financial businesses makes sense, but you only mention financial businesses in the success criteria, but in the other sections you speak of any business.
