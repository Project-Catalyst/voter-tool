Pour atteindre cet objectif, il est essentiel de s'attaquer au changement climatique. L'utilisation des questions relatives \u00e0 la consommation d'\u00e9nergie, et le \" profil basse \u00e9nergie \" de Cardano en tant que blockchain Proof of Stake, et la mise en place de projets qui aident \u00e0 s'aligner sur les objectifs de professionnalisme, de transparence, d'honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et d'int\u00e9grit\u00e9, devraient \u00eatre au c\u0153ur de la mission de Cardano, et je pense qu'ils le sont. Cela permettra de s'assurer que les questions climatiques font partie de ces objectifs.

Je ne suis en aucun cas un expert dans le domaine de la science du changement climatique, mais je pense que les PSM (Proposal Success Metrics) sont, bien qu'un peu larges, suffisants pour d\u00e9finir un cadre ou un ensemble d'attentes pour des KPI mesurables. J'aimerais cependant voir quelques conseils ou suggestions pour quantifier des choses comme \"l'ampleur de la sensibilisation qui sera cr\u00e9\u00e9e\".

We have seen during  past funds many Climate Change related proposals scattered through different challenges and in my view some very good ideas didn't obtain enough attention to develop and be fruitful.  We can ascertain community willingness in putting forward creative proposals addressing  human activity and climate.  Furthermore, community interest in proposing Climate themed solutions will enable a diverse evolution of developer and open source app ecosystem with global impact. We have seen already in past funds an array of proposals  related to waste management, circular economies, sustainable housing, animal conservation, farming and so on.
