To make the proposal stronger, I'd suggest to consider some of the following metrics: 1) the % of walltes created from the region. 2) the % of voting wallets from the region. 3) the % of proposals coming from the region. 4) the % of apps built by developers from the region. 5) the % of cardano users using apps built by developers from the region.\r\n6) the satisfaction of users of apps built within the initiative vs that of competirors.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 9, "ng": 13, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Yes, this \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" challenge is critical to build foundation for Cardano to be accepted in East Asia Region.
