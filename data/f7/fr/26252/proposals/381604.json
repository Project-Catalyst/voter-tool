Je le pense car son objectif est d'apporter des informations sur l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano \u00e0 la population indon\u00e9sienne, de mani\u00e8re simplifi\u00e9e, par le biais de cours vid\u00e9o sur youtube. De cette fa\u00e7on, il y aura beaucoup plus de chances d'interaction et de participation de la communaut\u00e9 locale indon\u00e9sienne aux projets et activit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Je peux vous assurer, par exp\u00e9rience, que tout cela (tout ce qui concerne l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me) est tr\u00e8s complexe et que ceux qui arrivent ont tendance \u00e0 se perdre ; un guide simple et bien construit est le meilleur moyen d'amener de nouveaux membres dans l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me et de les garder. Je trouve cela int\u00e9ressant car l'objectif ici est d'amener le contenu vers les m\u00e9dias d\u00e9j\u00e0 utilis\u00e9s par le public cible (youtube et instagram) et de ne pas m\u00e9nager les efforts pour que les personnes qui n'ont aucun contact avec l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me commencent \u00e0 utiliser de nouvelles plateformes et se renseignent ensuite sur le sujet. Il est plus logique d'amener le contenu aux gens que d'amener les gens \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter le contenu ; le plus gros effort doit \u00eatre le n\u00f4tre (membres actuels de la communaut\u00e9) pour engager de nouveaux participants qui s'impliqueront ensuite organiquement de plus en plus. En plus de tous ces aspects positifs, un argument est avanc\u00e9 pour expliquer pourquoi l'Indon\u00e9sie est particuli\u00e8rement int\u00e9ressante pour de tels investissements, ce qui ajoute encore plus de valeur au projet.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "On peut constater que l'auteur de la proposition a une id\u00e9e bien d\u00e9finie de la mani\u00e8re d'atteindre ses objectifs, qui serait de recueillir des informations sur Cardano en Indon\u00e9sie \u00e0 partir de divers canaux de communication et de les ajouter aux informations sur les r\u00e9unions de la mairie. Il expose en d\u00e9tail les \u00e9tapes qui seraient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de cette id\u00e9e, en les divisant en blocs de mois plus importants, qui seraient \u00e9galement divis\u00e9s en portions plus petites. De cette mani\u00e8re, il est possible d'avoir une id\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise de ce qui sera fait et dans quel ordre, ce qui d\u00e9montre une ma\u00eetrise totale de la partie pratique du projet. Le d\u00e9coupage mon\u00e9taire est satisfaisant, bien qu'il aurait pu \u00eatre plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Par exemple, dans la partie marketing, il serait int\u00e9ressant de savoir comment la campagne sera men\u00e9e, quelles strat\u00e9gies seront adopt\u00e9es et leurs co\u00fbts. Dans la partie de la production vid\u00e9o o\u00f9 la plupart de l'argent serait utilis\u00e9, il serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique de savoir comment l'argent serait subdivis\u00e9.

Dans cet espace, l'auteur indique tr\u00e8s clairement quelle est l'intention des t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements de vid\u00e9os, leur dur\u00e9e et la plateforme o\u00f9 elles seraient diffus\u00e9es, ce qui rend tr\u00e8s simple le suivi des actions par la communaut\u00e9 Cardano (en dehors du pays de destination). De m\u00eame, comment pourrions-nous mesurer le succ\u00e8s en fonction du nombre de personnes touch\u00e9es ? Cependant, certaines id\u00e9es pourraient encore \u00eatre ajout\u00e9es pour augmenter le niveau d'auditabilit\u00e9. Par exemple, nous savons que l'\u00e9quipe a des contacts avec d'autres cr\u00e9ateurs de contenu indon\u00e9siens.

En ce qui concerne l'int\u00e9gration du contenu des r\u00e9unions de la mairie, il serait important d'\u00e9tablir un pont entre cette partie du projet et les membres de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me, pas tous, mais nous pourrions en choisir certains qui sont plus habitu\u00e9s \u00e0 traiter des questions de ce type (gouvernementales) pour \u00e9tablir cette connexion ; cela serait m\u00eame utile pour comprendre comment nous pouvons apporter Cardano \u00e0 de telles instances, dans d'autres endroits.

This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable Indonesians to learn about Cardano and cryptos in general. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include rise in numbers of Cardano Indonesia Youtube, Instagram followers, workshop participants and bi-weekly participants of the Eastern Town Hall, and rise in proposals submission for Project Catalyst.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Indonesians who know about and are comfortable with Cardano. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. Simple infographics and videos will reach kids as well as adults and inculcate in kids the desire to use crypto more than fiat currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and infographics , and put links to some of the videos/infographics on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. For graphics you can use imgur or photobucket or send them to your instagram page itself. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has  not provided evidence  of the team whose relevant skills and experience are needed to complete the project.

Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as project management , marketing and other costs.   \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Their output is only one video or Instagram post a month.  The price of a video is exorbitantly high. THe price of an Instagra m infographic is also far too high considering their development is happening in Indonesia. Being from a country which also has lower income levels than Indonesia, I can confidently say that these prices are too high to be reasonable. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to create one video or one Instagram post per month.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal  does not provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very high level broad plan but there is no detailed breakdown in the plan. Also as stated above the costs are in my opinion too high.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should also seek to include the teams FB profiles or Linkedin Profiles with links to their CV or work experience. If a company, then link to the corporate web page or Linkedin Profile . \r\n\r\nTeam members profiles should be included in as much detail as possible. You should also reconsider your budget and if it costs this much to produce, seek to get production done from lower priced providers in other countries. You can get the same quality job for far lower cost and thereby maximise your saving. Also seek to increase your offering from one Video or IG post per month to about 1-2 per week.

One video a week or two a week would be more realistic.\r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer. \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer. Try to create more content. Content is key.  Develop metrics that help you to track.   Make as many metrics which you can track easily.
