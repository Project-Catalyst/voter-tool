However, I do not think that this idea addresses the challenge.

That said, I do think that this idea could be more well implemented in some other challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "If I understood correctly, you already has the platform to get everything going, what is missing is the implementation of the blockchain and there is no mention of this cost in the budget attached.\r\n\r\nI am finding quite hard to understand some particularities. First, the equipment needed to create this virtual environment will be given to schools or are you selecting schools that already has at least the computers? Since internet cost was added, I'm imagining that the schools do not have the computer (where is this cost?). Second, what are the kids incentive? And the teachers (which are increase the amount of work done)? And school? \r\n\r\nI feel that it has potential but it needs more detail to allow me to understand if it could work or not (I do imagine that it works since you have a partnership with the gov and Microsoft, but I didn't understand how everything works, it was not clear for me). \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I really think that if you have the platform running would be easy to verify how many stories is being added throughout time.

Also they have no means to write their own stories in their own languages. It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief . \r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system. While it clearly increases literacy and identity strengthening of these kids, its  clear how  Cardano system is benefitted in the sense that the kids are gaining familiarity with Cardano and more importantly grow up with a sense of awareness and trust in Cardano which means later they will use Cardano over other cryptos, and over fiat currency.\r\n\r\nHave key metrics and goals of the proposal been stated clearly \r\n  Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic.The key metrics and goals of the proposal may fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the quantity of stories written and books published.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. \r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to create the books, and get some media exposure on various literacy related FB groups and pages, or creative writing related pages. Sometimes , doing that might motivate someone to view the media publication and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

This contains the team whose relevant skills and experience are needed to complete the project.

Linkedin or FB profiles would have added value.\r\nI have visted links. The ASB site is quite comprehensive but doesn;t contain details of core leadership or team members.\r\n .\r\nThere is no way to assess their competence as no personal profile links are given.  The website contains various books already done, but this doesnt give any indication of their competence to integrate with Cardano.

The budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required, but since this project has already done several live events, there is no reason to suggest that additional funding would be needed for this round.The timetable is realstic to continue the book creation.The proposal  does not provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very high level broad plan but there is no detailed breakdown in the plan. Resources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.The proposal does not have technical aspects but covers aspects such as developing the storybooks and training writers. Also covers developing monitoring tools. The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal but plans on developing monitoring tools and reporting, as well as support visits to the schools.  THere would also be training programmes for teachers. This too would reduce risk of non acceptance. But this is not of concern since this is a long running successful literacy building project, and the funds required are to add to existing donor base.
