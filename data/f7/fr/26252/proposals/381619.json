La diff\u00e9rence est que dans cette proposition, cela se ferait par le biais d'une interview, d'une dur\u00e9e standard de 3 \u00e0 5 minutes, ce qui est tr\u00e8s positif car il ne servirait \u00e0 rien de remplacer la lecture d'une proposition (qui prend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du temps) par une longue vid\u00e9o. Il est \u00e9galement int\u00e9ressant de constater que ce projet permettrait d'\"\u00e9galiser\" le niveau de communication entre les promoteurs et les lecteurs, car certaines propositions sont mieux \u00e9crites, plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9es et plus simples \u00e0 comprendre, tandis que d'autres sont un peu confuses ou trop techniques. Bien s\u00fbr, l'entretien serait diff\u00e9rent selon la personne interrog\u00e9e, mais au moins les questions seraient similaires, selon ce qui est propos\u00e9, apportant ainsi une certaine standardisation des vid\u00e9os. J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9. Je voudrais juste faire une remarque : l'auteur r\u00e9p\u00e8te quelques paragraphes dans la proposition, dans la partie introduction et dans la partie impact, il y a plusieurs choses similaires, je ne sais pas si c'\u00e9tait intentionnel ou n\u00e9gligent. Et pour ce qui est de relever le d\u00e9fi, cela se produit \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 les entretiens seraient traduits dans d'autres langues, en envisageant l'objectif de faire conna\u00eetre le contenu de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano aux non-anglophones. J'esp\u00e8re sinc\u00e8rement que cette proposition sera financ\u00e9e.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "L'auteur a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une vid\u00e9o faisant ce qui serait fait dans les autres propositions, j'ai pens\u00e9 qu'elle a un grand niveau de communication et a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 transmettre ce qui \u00e9tait promis dans la vid\u00e9o, c'est-\u00e0-dire des connaissances g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la proposition et aussi sur l'auteur (beaucoup de fois nous ne pouvons pas sentir que nous connaissons l'auteur seulement par le texte, avec une vid\u00e9o ce serait mieux !) Elle est \u00e9galement impliqu\u00e9e dans d'autres activit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano, principalement destin\u00e9es \u00e0 son pays d'origine, le Vietnam, o\u00f9 elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 de l'exp\u00e9rience en tant qu'interpr\u00e8te, par exemple. Mais ce serait encore mieux si elle nous parlait un peu de sa formation ant\u00e9rieure, est-elle journaliste, dans le domaine de la communication, ou dans la technologie ? Quel est son pass\u00e9 avant de rencontrer la blockchain, et comment l'a-t-elle rencontr\u00e9 ? L'auteur affirme, dans la derni\u00e8re partie de la proposition, qu'elle devra former une \u00e9quipe pour mener \u00e0 bien le projet de mani\u00e8re positive. Il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'elle ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelques personnes en t\u00eate, je pense \u00e0 un \u00e9diteur, des traducteurs pour les langues choisies, quelqu'un qui s'occuperait de la promotion de la cha\u00eene au moment du pr\u00e9-vote....

Par exemple : 1) contacter les promoteurs 2) r\u00e9aliser l'interview 3) montage vid\u00e9o 4) sous-titrage 5) diffusion. Le temps que prendrait chacun d'eux, il me manquait un calcul plus pr\u00e9cis du processus. Et \u00e0 propos de la division financi\u00e8re : elle existe et est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, mais certains points m'ont laiss\u00e9 perplexe. Que serait la signature de Doman ? Quelle est la diff\u00e9rence entre l'abonnement \u00e0 l'\u00e9diteur et l'\u00e9dition ? En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : Je pense que 1) l'auteur est bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9 2) ce serait mieux s'il y avait une \u00e9quipe d\u00e9j\u00e0 form\u00e9e ici 3) le projet est simple \u00e0 comprendre dans une partie du processus, mais un script est toujours le bienvenu 4) certains points de la division budg\u00e9taire pourraient \u00eatre mieux clarifi\u00e9s.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "L'auditabilit\u00e9 du projet est tr\u00e8s simple, il suffit de surveiller la port\u00e9e des entretiens, en suivant certains indicateurs cl\u00e9s de performance \u00e9tablis par l'auteur, tels que le nombre de visionnages de la vid\u00e9o, les commentaires/interactions, la participation accrue des locuteurs des langues s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es pour la traduction dans Catalyst, etc. Je pense que l'auteur elle-m\u00eame pourrait pr\u00e9parer une courte pr\u00e9sentation, lors d'une r\u00e9union publique, au cours de laquelle ces r\u00e9sultats pourraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.

This enables greater acceptance and browsability of Catalyst. This would also enable more educated voters \r\n  Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  the number of videos, and the number of languges each will be translated into.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of interviews that are done and videos that are created. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and  among voters regarding various projects and give a benefit to proposers by enabling them to easily and effectively reach a larger audience than those who would be reading proposals.\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and do interviews , and put links to some of the videos/interviews  on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. Get some interviews published in local media of your country, whether social media or mass media, and share the published article or video link. That also adds lot of credibility\r\n \r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has   provided evidence  of herself  where her relevant skills and experience is clear since she is a moderator and Town Hall organizer.

It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of steps needing to be completed for each finished video.\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.   \r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects . The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal beyond the short time frame between submission of proposals to voting time.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.

The risk is that only a few videos would be completed which could give an unfair advantage to those who were interviewed. \r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information provided is  somewhat sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence i have given a 4 star rating. \r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "GREAT IDEAS!

Having said all that however, there aren't any details regarding what are the team will consist of, other than telling us that the proposer 'will build a team after this'.
