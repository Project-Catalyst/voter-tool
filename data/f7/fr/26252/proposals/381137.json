Comment pouvons-nous permettre et encourager les citoyens polonais \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano ?", "funded": 2, "upvotes": 82863957, "downvotes": 2911041, "votes_result": 79952916, "votes_cast": 247, "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666667, "videos": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFLUfVgveBw&start=24113"], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "Il est int\u00e9ressant de voir comment l'auteur argumente pourquoi la Pologne est un endroit int\u00e9ressant pour investir dans Cardano, en nous pr\u00e9sentant quelques donn\u00e9es de recherche, afin que les personnes ext\u00e9rieures au pays et qui n'ont aucun contact avec lui puissent comprendre le contexte \u00e9voqu\u00e9 ici. De cette fa\u00e7on, une assurance de pourquoi choisir ce pays est pass\u00e9e. La proposition dialogue tr\u00e8s bien avec les objectifs du d\u00e9fi, car elle cherche \u00e0 diversifier la port\u00e9e du contenu li\u00e9 \u00e0 Cardano en cr\u00e9ant un centre d'information en polonais. J'ai \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 positif que l'auteur se pr\u00e9occupe de cr\u00e9er un contenu compatible avec des personnes ayant diff\u00e9rents niveaux de connaissances sur le monde de la cryptographie, de sorte qu'il ne profiterait pas uniquement aux personnes tr\u00e8s exp\u00e9riment\u00e9es ou \u00e0 celles qui n'en ont jamais entendu parler. En outre, un autre point positif est que l'auteur dispose d\u00e9j\u00e0 de certains canaux de communication avec la population polonaise au sujet de Cardano, de sorte qu'il ne partirait pas de z\u00e9ro, et d\u00e9montrant \u00e9galement un int\u00e9r\u00eat pr\u00e9alable pour l'action, ce qui est toujours quelque chose \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration. L'espace \u00e0 cr\u00e9er serait divis\u00e9 en plusieurs parties, comme des podcasts, une page web avec des articles d'actualit\u00e9 sur Cardano et des enseignements sur la blockchain, etc. La diversit\u00e9 des fronts \u00e0 cr\u00e9er/investir est un bon moyen de toucher diff\u00e9rentes personnes, car certaines utilisent certains moyens et pas d'autres. Ainsi, j'ai pens\u00e9 que ce projet r\u00e9pond tr\u00e8s bien \u00e0 ce que nous voulons dans le d\u00e9fi et a une bonne chance de produire un grand impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "L'\u00e9quipe impliqu\u00e9e dans le projet a inclus une br\u00e8ve description de chacun d'entre eux, contenant leurs noms, leurs r\u00f4les et certains projets qu'ils ont cr\u00e9\u00e9s auparavant (avec des liens dans certains cas) ; deux d'entre eux mettent \u00e9galement \u00e0 disposition leurs profils linkedin, afin que nous puissions les conna\u00eetre plus en d\u00e9tail. Il serait bon que Jakub fasse de m\u00eame, mais il n'a peut-\u00eatre pas ce r\u00e9seau social. Je pense qu'ils transmettent beaucoup de confiance dans leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter le projet avec succ\u00e8s, car ils ont beaucoup de connexion blockchain et ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 quelques projets \u00e0 compter comme exp\u00e9rience. Cependant, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'une personne responsable du marketing soit \u00e9galement incluse dans l'\u00e9quipe officielle, nous ne savons pas si l'un d'entre eux couvrirait m\u00eame cette fonction, mais il serait plus appropri\u00e9 d'engager un professionnel dans le domaine, car la diffusion est extr\u00eamement essentielle pour le succ\u00e8s du projet. Si l'id\u00e9e ici est d'atteindre la population polonaise avec des connaissances sur Cardano, deux choses sont n\u00e9cessaires : un bon contenu et une bonne publicit\u00e9. L'\u00e9quipe ne cr\u00e9e pas exactement un script \u00e0 suivre. Nous n'avons pas un regroupement d'activit\u00e9s, organis\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re lin\u00e9aire en fonction du temps qui passe, qui serait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l'ensemble. Nous savons qu'il y a plusieurs choses \u00e0 cr\u00e9er, certaines existent d\u00e9j\u00e0, mais seront am\u00e9lior\u00e9es. Comment se d\u00e9roulerait l'ensemble de ce processus ? Il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que l'\u00e9quipe ait organis\u00e9 ces activit\u00e9s sur plusieurs mois, afin que nous puissions comprendre ce qui est venu en premier, pourquoi, qui le fera, etc. Et \u00e0 propos de la r\u00e9partition financi\u00e8re, c'est id\u00e9al, nous savons comment l'argent sera divis\u00e9 et chaque versement a \u00e9galement une petite explication, par exemple, dans la partie pour les articles, nous savons combien co\u00fbterait la traduction par mot. Nous avons donc une compr\u00e9hension tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te de la mani\u00e8re dont les fonds seront utilis\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule chose qui doit \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9e \u00e0 mon avis est la d\u00e9finition exacte d'un script.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Les auteurs nous fournissent de nombreuses informations qui peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour l'auditabilit\u00e9.

Nous savons \u00e9galement quelle serait la d\u00e9finition du succ\u00e8s chaque trimestre et apr\u00e8s un an, de sorte que vous pouvez contr\u00f4ler exactement si ce que vous pensiez s'est produit. Par cons\u00e9quent, je pense qu'il nous suffit de s\u00e9lectionner un membre de la communaut\u00e9 qui parle polonais (de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence un natif du pays) pour suivre l'\u00e9volution du projet et les r\u00e9sultats, afin de pr\u00e9parer un retour d'information g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et de le transmettre au reste de la communaut\u00e9.

Amount of content originally created in Polish\r\n\r\n2. Amount of content translated into Polish\r\n\r\n3. Number of users that have joined local Cardano groups\r\n\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\n\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the out\r\nput of information on the website and social media pages. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system. \r\nI have given this proposal a 5 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to write articles and put links to some of the articles if published on social media or mass media, on the proposal itself . Sometimes   reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the article and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading, creation of local language programming with English and local language content.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe proposer has provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to complete the project. They have shown their experience on various media outlets, experience on educational series, various websites that they have founded, SPO experience, and creation of a community on social media channels.  These links are sufficient, but it would have been better to include the social media channels at all in order to verify the size and existence of the community.  I have visted links. The proposers appear competent, having experience in media publishing and content creation.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposer has identified the core team but has not quantified how many team members are needed to accomplish the content creation on various media.\r\n He has rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown in terms of the core leadership. \r\n The budget has been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items which includes server and domain costs, theme creation costs and is a flat rate per word to cover costs of translation,and release of press releases to various sites, mass and social media. This also includes costs of creating podcasts and merchandise. Also carrying out quizzes, kahoots and livestreams on various channels.They have also identified marketing and awareness building costs with ad costs, consultations and other promotional costs. The budget is very reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\n \r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation in terms of the materials to be translated as well as how output would be generated. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described. \r\nThe proposal clearly explains  technical aspects such as translation, website creation, theme creation,creation of podcasts,  editing, publishing which are steps needed in a localization project. The proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation . \r\n\r\n  \r\nA piece of advice...
