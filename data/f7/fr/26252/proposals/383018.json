Its impact is clearly stated and is intended to be global, integrating stakeholders into the community through human interest stories. Their added value to the community is clearly articulated, with their desire to facilitate the process of building and growing the Cardano community for native speakers of a multitude of languages and their intention to develop a sense of community and conversation between people.
