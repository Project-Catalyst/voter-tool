L'id\u00e9e est de cr\u00e9er une session de questions-r\u00e9ponses qui explique ce qu'est Cardano / Catalyst \u00e0 un public qui n'a jamais eu de contact avec notre blockchain, et de la traduire dans diff\u00e9rentes langues. En th\u00e9orie, je pense que c'est une initiative parfaite pour ce que nous recherchons avec ce d\u00e9fi. J'aimerais juste qu'il y ait plus de d\u00e9tails dans l'ensemble, par exemple : quelques exemples de questions qui peuvent \u00eatre pos\u00e9es, en plus des questions plus \u00e9videntes comme \" qu'est-ce que la blockchain \", \" que sont les crypto-monnaies \", etc. Quelles langues parlons-nous ici en termes de traduction ? Comment cette page web pourrait-elle s'int\u00e9grer au travail de l'\u00e9quipe de l'AIM, par exemple ? Il s'agirait d'une page web, mais l'AIM pourrait-elle d\u00e9velopper un outil ? Ces d\u00e9tails m\u00e9riteraient donc d'\u00eatre expliqu\u00e9s, afin que nous puissions avoir une notion plus solide du projet lui-m\u00eame, bien que l'id\u00e9e soit tr\u00e8s bonne. En raison du manque de d\u00e9tails, je pense que l'impact est r\u00e9el, mais il doit \u00eatre renforc\u00e9.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Les informations dont nous disposons sur l'auteur sont peu nombreuses. Nous savons qu'il \u00e9tudie le commerce dans une institution internationale en France. Mais il serait essentiel pour nous de conna\u00eetre des d\u00e9tails tels que : de quelle institution il s'agit ; quel m\u00e9tier il compte exercer, comment il pense que la blockchain se rapporte \u00e0 sa formation... D'accord, il a justifi\u00e9 que la blockchain est une technologie qui sera importante \u00e0 l'avenir et Cardano se distingue par son caract\u00e8re durable et son objectif d'am\u00e9liorer le monde, mais j'aimerais savoir, par rapport \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, comment il compte appliquer la technologie dans sa formation/son travail ? S'il a une exp\u00e9rience professionnelle ant\u00e9rieure ; quelle est la nationalit\u00e9 de ses camarades de classe, c'est-\u00e0-dire dans quelles langues le cours serait traduit. Le pas \u00e0 pas du projet est bien d\u00e9fini, je crois que c'est une proposition bien conduite dans cet aspect, et aussi qu'il n'est pas si complexe \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre dans le sens o\u00f9 un calendrier singulier peut bien guider ce qui devra \u00eatre fait afin d'obtenir le succ\u00e8s. Le niveau de d\u00e9tail pour chaque phase n'est pas si profond, mais il nous donne une bonne compr\u00e9hension du processus. Et enfin, en ce qui concerne le budget, j'ai \u00e9galement trouv\u00e9 qu'il n'est pas tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9, bien que l'argent demand\u00e9 soit peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 la plupart des autres propositions, l'auteur pourrait mieux expliquer chaque partie. Pourquoi la cr\u00e9ation de la section Q&R co\u00fbte-t-elle 2000 $ ? Comment ces 2000 seraient-ils d\u00e9compos\u00e9s en petites activit\u00e9s ? Je pense qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il y a eu un manque de d\u00e9tails tant dans la pr\u00e9sentation de l'\u00e9quipe que dans la division du budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Encore une fois, nous avons ici une r\u00e9partition moyenne des informations. Nous savons qu'il a l'intention de toucher une centaine de personnes, dont 20 deviendraient des membres actifs de la communaut\u00e9 Cardano, de traduire en 3 langues et ainsi de suite. Mais il serait essentiel pour nous de savoir quelles universit\u00e9s il a l'intention de contacter, quels pays, comment il prendrait contact avec ces personnes, afin que nous puissions suivre les activit\u00e9s. Il serait int\u00e9ressant, par exemple, que les personnes ayant particip\u00e9 au projet puissent donner leur avis : les \u00e9tudiants des universit\u00e9s cibl\u00e9es ont-ils rejoint Catalyst, commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la blockchain, adopt\u00e9 Cardano ? L'auteur pourrait nous donner de telles r\u00e9ponses comme une forme d'auditabilit\u00e9, je pense que le suivi dans cette proposition serait plus qualitatif que quantitatif. Je pense que c'est parce qu'il est plus important de savoir si les personnes auxquelles la section Q&R a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e9taient int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 entrer dans l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano que, n\u00e9cessairement, combien de personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9es.

Its much more straightfoward than courses and can impact much more languages with less effort.\r\nMy main considerations on the proposals are:\r\n\r\n1) How these students will contacted (using which filters and channels) and what does well informed mean? maybe it could include more details on what is going to be taught to them and how (will it follow a course model?) Also. how to guarantee these students will really be \"well informed\"? Maybe exams could be made, with different types of questions.\r\n2) will the students have a limited time to reply? I understand having fast reply is essential to guarantee a good user experience. At the same quality, it is necessary to ensure the quality/assertiveness of the information provided.\r\n3) Last, I'd highlight here in the proposal who the target audience is. Is the ovjective to mainly address new member already engaged questions or to attract still nont engaged people? This changes a lot the communication strategy.\r\n\r\nI like the idea to start small and see scale up aftewards and to have an open log with the Q&A, especially translating the most reputable one. Maybe some reward could be given to the best repliers. Also appreciated the idea of trying existing platforms and evaluating if creating a new one is better.

Is it to pay students or for other operational costs? are the students going to be paid by  number of replies of in a fixed way? All in all, its a cheap project with a good impact if scaled up.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Good and simple KPIs with target. They are sensible within project scope and seem to be aligned with expectations within project scope.

How to overcome them?\r\none note: it says  as challenge \"We can not cover all the languages in the world\". I'd say this is nearly impossible, so maybe it would be better if this specific challenge was narrowed down by the number of languages aimed/desired at the end of the project.

It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by creating a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages.\r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would create a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages where they could ask questions and get real time answers from people, not bots. They would get answers in their preferred local language. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include contacting of students, teaching the students about Cardano, Creating the Q and A Rubric, in the form of a web page or a content repository of all possible questions which would grow. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is comprehensive and well laid out. It is a simple enough plan, easy to execute.  As questions grow the repository would also grow. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding languages and students to answer questions. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among non English speaking newcomes to DLT and Cardano\r\n\r\nI cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge but I also say it would be useful hence i have given it a 3 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have  not provided evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in building these sort of projects. The Linkedin Profiles of Core leadership has not been provided. They are students at a business school in France. While the concept is simple,no proof has been given that they are able to execute this plan.  The links are not sufficient. \r\nI have visited the links.but its to the corporate site of the school, not anything of the proposers themselves. I cannot assess if the proposer is competent to build this content since no information has been given as to prior experience in this area. \r\nThe proposal   has stated that the students of the school from 10 countries will work together and reach out to other students.  There is no guarantee if other students will join, or if they would be competent in providing this service in an efficient and timely manner.He has not provided the team structure of members and their capabilities and has mentioned other partners who he would work with such as web developer.\r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. They have allocated themselves 1200 USD for learning.  This should not be a cost factor per se since learning is a voluntary process and should not need to be paid for. They can charge for answering questions but learning itself should not be charged for. 2000 USD to create a simple web page by which questions can be added and a repository created is far too high, speaking in my professional opinion as a web and solutions developer for over 20 years. The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 2000 USD for a simple web site seems somewhat high to be reasonable. \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal  does not give a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has no plan stated with no detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of development. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have not been addressed \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal . Given experience and plan presented it is hard to say this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 1 star rating. Also I have rated it like this because the budget is too high for such a project.  \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\nGiven experience and plan presented and the other issues mentioned above, it is highly unlikely this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given a 1 star rating.
