Malheureusement, je n'ai pas pu arriver \u00e0 une conclusion d\u00e9finitive, d'o\u00f9 le score de 3. Bien que je puisse voir comment la traduction des ressources ATALA Prism de l'anglais au japonais conduira indirectement \u00e0 une acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration du d\u00e9veloppement de DID, elle est un pas derri\u00e8re la directive du d\u00e9fi de d\u00e9velopper et de mettre en \u0153uvre des solutions avec ATALA Prism. Cela signifie une relation plus directe avec ATALA Prism lui-m\u00eame, et non l'\u00e9tape \u00e9ducative qui pourrait potentiellement conduire au d\u00e9veloppement et \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de solutions. Plus je lis la proposition, plus je suis convaincu qu'elle devrait \u00eatre soumise dans le cadre du d\u00e9fi des ressources multilingues.

Cependant, le montant de 50000 $ demand\u00e9 laisse un grand point d'interrogation quant \u00e0 l'optimisation des ressources. La distribution d'une partie de la somme sous forme de revenus mensuels de 5000 $ et 3000 $ pour 7 et 3 personnes, respectivement, n'est pas justifi\u00e9e. Je ne sais pas si la traduction de services en japonais attire un salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 au Japon, mais mon ignorance mise \u00e0 part, je m'interroge sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'avoir sept personnes avant la collecte des mat\u00e9riaux.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "La traduction de ressources d'une langue \u00e0 l'autre sera toujours un projet contr\u00f4lable puisque le travail et le r\u00e9sultat sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s, en particulier pour le mat\u00e9riel \u00e9ducatif.

In this way, new professionals would understand what, after all, the ecosystem is and what its decentralized identity system is, and with that, new members would certainly be added to the community. It's also very positive how proponents put current problems into context - so we're more focused on what they need to solve. This proposal solves the objectives of two challenges: the present challenge, by Atala Prism, since, as I said, new users would be joined, and it would also directly benefit Japan, disseminating our blockchain technologies there, as the specific challenge about Japan search. It is possible to understand 100% of what is intended to be done through the list of activities found in \"detailed plan\", and I assure you, this is one of the most positive proposals for the Cardano ecosystem that I have evaluated so far at f7: introducing the Japanese market Atala Prism , NFT and various technologies relevant to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the detailed plan, we have the main activities that have just been developed, such as commenting on impact. Proponents also provide a roadmap that temporally organizes the activities. However, this script should be more detailed, in my opinion. For example: \"5~6th month: Engagement expansion\". How would this expansion take place, what marketing strategies would be developed here? About the team, I think this part is perfect. We have the names, main roles and linkedin profiles of those involved. In this way, we get to know the team well and understand its specificities, and they are certainly capable of successfully executing the project, since the professional activities of those involved are well diversified and include specialists in Cardano (ambassadors and SPOs). Finally, the budget is also explained in a very satisfactory way, we know how the amount of 50k, which despite being high, makes sense for this proposal, will be used. How it will be divided and why each part corresponds to each percentage of the final amount. Ultimately, the only improvement I can identify here would be an increase in script details. Otherwise, it's all very good!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Through the detailed plan, current issues and KPIs we were able to audit this proposal very well. Current problems would serve as a guide for us to monitor whether the situations previously encountered have been remedied, if the project was able to meet the needs of the context. With the detailed plan, it is possible to monitor if the activities that were promised are actually being done by the team members, and how they are being done, that is, if everything that was planned became reality. The KPIs serve to analyze the reflection of this proposal in Japan - there are two, as the proponents point out: the amount of translated materials and the audience reached with the \"learn to win\" program. This last part is something that the team itself should analyze, collect data and present to the rest of the community. As it is a project aimed at the Japanese target audience, it would be very interesting for some member of the community from the country to accompany this proposal and establish continuous contact with the rest of the community. He could have a closer view of what was happening, and, knowing the specifics of the country, would better understand the results achieved than someone outside Japan.

This proposal perfectly fits the challenge and will lead to increaced decentralization and asymetrical growth. It will be a great value added for the cardano ecosystem to bring along more japanese people into the crypto space and cardano in particular. The KPIs and goals align with the challenge settings as mentioned. The team seams prepared to face any challenges and a couple of those challenges like obtaining the documents is being worked on already.  This proposal will add something missing in the ecosystem and that's localization in a native language. I think there should be more translations to bring the whole world along quicker. As a developer myself, I'm no expert in these matters but I don't see any logical roadblocks at this point. Overall a great proposal that's worth doing.

In my humble oppinion this brings credibility to the whole project because the voters can see the team is legit. The budget could have been broken down better, because it's nott clear exactly how the funds will be dispersed, but I can appreciate the effort put in. Having said that I'd like to see a better break down with rationale given behind the hourly rates, because that would make them comparible and verifiable. As I said I'm no expert in this field but even so the timetable seems reasonable for the work that will be done, given they manage to aquire the documentation that needs translation. There's a sensible plan for implementation and there are a lot of details on how every step will be taken and implemented. The resources necessary to implement the proposal are listed and valid.  Consideration of risk is one of the reason I believe the project will be implemented successfully because it shows foresight and consistency.  I think it's a feasible proposal that has a high chance of being implemented. Good luck to all the team members!
