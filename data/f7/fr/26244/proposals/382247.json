In fact, creating a hub in India and organizing hackathons, is a very clever way to bring developers into the cardano ecosystem. Needless to say that this can add massive value to the cardano community. I confirm that the goals of this proposal and the key metrics are aligned with the challenge. The only thing I would add in this proposal is the expectations in terms of numbers of participants. Other than that, the proposal will be able to scale in future challenges if needed. I have a positive note on the impact that this proposal will have in the cardano ecosystem.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have confidence, based on the information provided by the proposer, that this project should be feasible. The proposer has successfully provided evidence of relevance skills and experience of the team. This team has won several hackathons in the past, so they should be familiar with the process of organizing the same type of events. The number of the team needed to carry out this project is also outlined by the proposer. Furthermore, the budget has been broken down. Based on  my sole intuition, I would say that the prices disclosed are reasonable. The proposer has also provided a timetable to complete the work. This proposal contains also a good plan that shows all the steps that the team needs to do in order to complete the work. However I didn't see the mention of risk and challenges relevant to a successful implementation. I think that the proposer can improve this proposal by adding that.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has all the elements needed to be easily audited. The proposer has included a roadmap and milestone in the proposal. Metrics and KPIs are also present in this proposal. However I would suggest to the proposer to add expectations of the number of participants of the event. Apart from that, the proposal is well written with a clear description of the problem and the solution as well.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_439", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem the proposal tends to address is certainly genuine and needs urgent attention. The potential a country such as India could offer to the Cardano ecosystem is immense. However, not a lot of existing and upcoming developers are aware of the concept of blockchain and its capabilities. Therefore, a hub and resources for them all to coordinate could infuse a lot of contributions to the Cardano chain. The team mentions having a lucid action plan and a considerable amount of groundwork been already done in this direction. The only reason I feel this could not be as impactful as it seems is the regulations currently being laid for the cryptocurrencies in the country. However, looking at it in an optimistic approach, a solution of a similar sort is in immediate need to make sure that the suitable personnel is reached before a wrong notion is spread.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The milestones and the detailed plan provided in the submission look plausible and viable. A successful implementation would really be fruitful for the community as a whole. The team with the likes of Matthias and Victor no doubt is capable of pulling off a proposal such as this. In addition to that, the requested funds seem practical and the breakdown of the same adds more transparency to it. The deliverables are also in alignment with the challenge's expectations. Therefore, I strongly believe the proposer and his mates are completely capable of making this proposal triumphant.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal's outcomes are well outlined and measurable and are based on a properly defined roadmap. The number of active members, the percentage increase in the members quite add more credibility to the plan. The mix of quantitative and qualitative KPIs provides more insights into the progress and makes the audit a very easy process. Also, the metrics are in line with the campaign's essentials which is again a positive sign.
