Additionally, it provides a number of objectives that I consider appropriate and aligned with the objectives of this challenge. The impact of the campaign was evaluated through success metrics, where one of them is described as \"Create XX new Cardano users per event\" while I agree with this, it would have been interesting to learn what is meant by new users. This is because one of the items requested in the budget is airdrops, which would cause that metric to no longer have the desired success. \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proponent asserts that he has extensive experience organizing Blockchain events. However, no references are provided to support his claim. Regarding the budget, it is broken down into three subcategories. They are, however, insufficient for an accurate assessment of the requested amount. As an example, $10000 was requested for \"Salary for local event organizers and workshop presenters\", nevertheless, to assess this item accurately, it is necessary to determine how many persons will be hired to coordinate the event, and how many will be hired to conduct the workshops.An aspect of the budget that concerns me is the allocation of $10,000 for ADA airdrops. Considering that, on the one hand, it is likely to attract the attention of some people who perceive it as free money, on the other hand, I believe that the kind of people who are attracted by this kind of marketing strategy do not necessarily relate to Cardano or Catalyst. \u00a0\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "On the auditability aspect, the author of the proposal does a good job. A roadmap is presented for 3, 6 and 12 months each with a brief description of what is expected to happen at each point in time. As it is a simple proposal, I think it can be easy to audit.

I can say that the proposer has successfully identified the problem within the challenge. I think that this can add value to the cardano ecosystem.

The budget breakdown is also really vague and should be broken down even more. There is also no mention for additional funding in case they need it.

Also, there is no information about the resources needed to execute the tasks.\r\nThere are not any risks identified to assess possible failures like not reaching the goal of 26 events in 1 year or not attracting people to the community.\r\nBased on the above rationale I am neutral for a successful implementation.

The project will onboard new members and open up opportunities to develop and avoid the high rates of inflation in this region. \r\n\r\nThe project aligns with the challenge of scaling up Community Hubs through providing a localised option for onboarding community in Latin America. The project has potential to reach a global audience of spanish speakers using video platforms, however this particular idea is very much about localised in-person workshops.

There's a lot of empty links, videos that don't have content, calendars that have stopped events in 2020. It's hard to really say if this project is going to succeed. \r\n\r\nThere is an existing github provided for the Caracas project, however it has very few (3) members. Again, to indicate some demand and increase confidence in providing funding it would be good to see some evidence base or substantiation of the proposer's skills in growing audiences and communities around these ideas. \r\n\r\nThe budget is clear, however there is a questionable incentivisation of 10kUSD to the community, it's clear this would absolutely get people started with Cardano but without a captured group already in mind or a particular market this might not be the best way of encouraging participation in the Cardano community, rather it lends more to the investment model.
