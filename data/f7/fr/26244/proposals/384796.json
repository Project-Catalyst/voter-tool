There is a lack of awareness of blockchain technology. The proposer has identified the problem clearly and the solution proposed can have a positive impact on the cardano ecosystem, if executed properly. The cardano ecosystem has a lot to gain from the African countries (Ethiopia in this case), where the majority of the population is young and looking for opportunities. I would suggest to the proposer to be clear from the start about what they are trying to build. This can help improve the proposal. Furthermore, I would advise them to focus on one thing at the time as wanting to create a website plus a youtube channel at the same time can be a load of work too heavy if the team is not big enough. Apart from that, the key metrics and goal of this proposal align perfectly with the challenge. And if they manage to pull this off, I don't see any issue with scaling, as it is just a matter of adding more content to the website and youtube channel. (Rating 4)\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has provided links to their linkedin profiles. After a brief study, I can identify that they have all the tools needed to carry out the project successfully. Being in the digital marketing field myself for a decade, I've learnt to identify profiles in that space. From my understanding, the core team is formed by 2 people. The majority of the workload, meaning writing articles, editing videos and more are going to be outsourced. I think that this is a great model as there are many talents out there working as freelancers who can do the work. Also, it's a model that allows small teams with limited budgets to not have to hire workers for full time positions, which can end up being too expensive. The budget has been broken down, but I have to admit that it is not easy to understand. I will suggest to the proposer to make a better breakdown of the budget. For instance, instead of the hourly rate, I would go for a task completion rate instead. For example I would calculate the price of an article or video production, and go from there. The other missing piece that I've identified is that the proposer didn't mention any challenge or risks upon a successful implementation. Apart from that, the proposers have clearly stated what is being built and how they will achieve it. (Rating 5)", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have managed to provide a detailed roadmap with reasonable milestones. My concern is that most of these milestones are not measured in users' acquisition terms. For instance I would want to know how much traffic they expect to receive on the website and on the youtube channel. The only fact of publishing content doesn't guarantee traffic. However, I have noticed that the social media milestones are measured in the number of users they will acquire. That is a positive sign to me. Besides, I think that, from the informations provided by the proposers, the project is very auditable. The description of the problem is clear and the description of the solution is clear as well.

Mainly because there is no specific social problem that it is helping to solve (education through internet access, microfinance through feature phones, etc).  There is no community on center stage fighting a problem while right behind the scenes (not elsewhere) Cardano may be offering its firepower (technical, economic, human) in support of that community and its battle. \r\n\r\nThis proposal, being based on the simple dissemination of information, I consider that it does not present a solid strategy for engaging local communities.

The budget also clearly well explained and broken down into more details, from salary for each role, hours worked, target articles / content / media, etc.  They also have a realistic timetable and achievable set of goals for each months, such as the number of podcast episode, interviews, articles, etc. However, they didn't elaborate further on how to do these things in detail. For example: where will the podcast be uploaded? Youtube? Spotify? (Although it will likely on Youtube, but still it would be more helpful if they could specify and explain it). Since they have magazine, newsletter, and interviews, what are the platform used to share these? They have a website but as I'm writing this it is not yet available. For magazine, is it a form of hard-copy, or a digital one? (Because the technology adoption is still in progress, and not all Ethiopian have laptops or computer). All in all, this is a feasible and achievable proposal to be implemented successfully.
