Les auteurs justifient la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un tel projet par le fait qu'il y a beaucoup, beaucoup de propositions, que les gens n'ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas le temps de tout suivre et que le fait d'avoir de tels r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de contenu stimulerait la participation \u00e0 Catalyst, car les gens auraient un moyen plus pratique de les conna\u00eetre. , du moins une partie, de ce qui est fait ici. Je suis d'accord avec cette pens\u00e9e et je pense que cela peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fique en effet, et peut correspondre \u00e0 certains des objectifs du d\u00e9fi, comme amener de nouveaux participants \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 Cardano, de nouveaux d\u00e9veloppeurs, etc, former de nouveaux hubs, mais je ne pense pas que cela envisage l'objectif de d\u00e9mocratiser l'acc\u00e8s pour les non-anglophones. Je pense qu'ils d\u00e9mocratiseraient l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Cardano pour un public anglophone plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, des d\u00e9butants en blockchain aux plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, puisque ce contenu serait rendu accessible. Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois \u00e0 l'impact partiel de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9fi. Ce serait vraiment incroyable si cette m\u00eame id\u00e9e \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 d'autres langues, c'est-\u00e0-dire cr\u00e9er un court contenu audiovisuel qui r\u00e9sume/explique certaines propositions des fonds de financement, en portugais, espagnol, italien, japonais, vietnamien.... De cette fa\u00e7on, oui, je crois que cela ferait mouche avec ce que nous visons ici.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "L'\u00e9quipe impliqu\u00e9e dans le projet transmet beaucoup de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ; ils consacrent une bonne partie du projet \u00e0 expliquer qui ils sont, individuellement, leurs noms, leurs fonctions, un peu de ce qu'ils ont fait jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, et fournissent \u00e9galement des liens vers leurs pages personnelles, o\u00f9 nous pouvons apprendre \u00e0 les conna\u00eetre plus intimement. Je pense que la pr\u00e9sentation des membres \u00e9tait parfaite, pour moi c'est la meilleure fa\u00e7on d'expliquer qui sont les personnes concern\u00e9es. Le sc\u00e9nario a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re exemplaire, nous savons quelles sont les t\u00e2ches \u00e0 accomplir pour aboutir \u00e0 un tout (de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, ils incluent diverses donn\u00e9es num\u00e9riques qui facilitent la compr\u00e9hension des \u00e9tapes) et aussi quels sont les objectifs, en utilisant \u00e0 nouveau des chiffres pour pr\u00e9ciser sans marge d'erreur ce qu'ils comptent r\u00e9aliser. En plus de cela, l'\u00e9quipe s'est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e de tirer, en guise de conclusion, quel serait l'impact attendu et la faisabilit\u00e9 du projet. En ce qui concerne le budget, ils joignent un tableau d\u00e9taillant ce qui serait fait, en quelle quantit\u00e9 et aussi par quelle quantit\u00e9 serait fait, laissant l\u00e0 encore une compr\u00e9hension bien \u00e9tablie et les informations fournies de mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8te et pr\u00e9cise.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Comme l'expliquent les m\u00eames auteurs, le projet est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler parce qu'il a des objectifs tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis, le budget est extr\u00eamement d\u00e9taill\u00e9 dans le tableau ci-joint, le contenu peut \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9 sur YouTube et le travail commence d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans les prochains fonds. Je pense donc qu'il incombe maintenant \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 d'assurer cette contr\u00f4labilit\u00e9. Nous pourrions \u00e9lire quelques membres pour suivre l'avancement du projet et apporter un retour \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, \u00e0 travers l'un de nos diff\u00e9rents canaux de communication (Town Hall, discord, etc).

The proposal presents a very real problem that a lot of people are interested in Cardano but do not have the time to learn, making it difficult to grasp the increasing number of proposals, affecting the development of Cardano. Cardano community\r\nThe solution was to produce short-term videos and podcasts in English containing analyzed information for the proposed 25% in each Catalyst Fund. A clear and understandable solution was provided as per the proposal to clearly describe the problem targeted.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We can easily check the group information based on the links the recommendation has provided. The proposed team consists of 3 members with experience in the Blockchain field and also accompanies Catalyst projects from Fund 4. At the same time, Duc Tiger is also the founder of Tiger View team, one of the core groups of the company. . Vietnam in the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, the team has also been funded in Fund 6, so I have full confidence that they can complete this proposal.\r\nWithout a doubt, the team of proponents has the right skill set, is highly motivated and is strongly committed to the Cardano ecosystem. With the experience of the CA and VCA teams, they easily realize the difficulty when voters have to absorb too many petitions while not having much time to evaluate them all. Take this suggestion as a matter of course. It saves voters a lot of time filtering out unworkable proposals. I believe that with the experience and planning presented here, it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented\r\nInterestingly, the proposal's authors explain the idea by presenting the obstacles they will face next.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the properties of this proposal, no timeline is broken down. As stated, the proposed team will start work from the start of the Fund 8 and Fund 9 proposal. It takes about 2 months for them to complete 250 videos in Fund 8 and 2 months to complete 250 videos in Fund 9. .\r\nThe proposal is feasible because it has very specific goals, has key indicators, KPIs and timelines, and is easy to track and evaluate. The given budget of $12,000 is reasonable enough and it makes me completely agree that the team is competent enough to tackle the challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I think this proposal makes a lot of sense, but not in this exact shape. Even as a CA, I find it impossible to stay up-to-date with most of the proposals in Project Catalyst. Having 2 minute videos, if properly done, would be of great benefit to the Cardano voters and community. Yet, at this iteration, I feel like the proposal could be very detrimental to the Catalyst experiment, due to the fact that it will make a selection of 250 proposals to be reviewed. That in itself is an influence on the voters and could become problematic for the entire eco-system. The only way to solve this would be to have either all proposals reviewed, or none. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team\u2019s experience confirms their aptitude towards delivering such a great task, the video for their proposal has also demonstrated the quality that we are to expect from each video. Yet what I didn\u2019t find in their plan, is how will all those videos and articles be reviewed before publishing? Will there be a core team who will be reviewing them, will they review each other, and if so, how will they be able to verify and incentivise the quality of the videos?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is well divided and contains all the needed information for its proper evaluation.

I think it is a good proposal, for many people the information written in Catalyst proposals is difficult to digest. Especially when voting, when a large amount of proposals should be evaluated. Having summaries in video form would be helpful. \n\nI believe this should be done with all proposals though, and not only 25% of them, as this will introduce a selection bias from the video creators. Therefore, I would prefer if they requested a larger budget so they could do this with 100% of Catalyst proposals before the voting period starts. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The video example provided shows that they can create a simple and easy to understand video explaining a proposal in 2 minutes. \n\nThe budget requested per video created seems low to me, which could affect the quality of the videos. For example, 2 dollars for editing per video, I don't know how feasible that is in the long term without affecting the quality.\n\nIt is good that the proposers are experienced in Catalyst, and reviewing proposals. The proposers seem committed and capable of following through on their promise to the community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have stated quite clearly what they will do with the funds, and how many video reviews they will create per funding round. This part of the project should be easy to assess for the community.\n\nThey have included some KPIs for watch time per video, I wish they also included some KPIs for how many viewers they hope to attract. And also elaborated further how they will make the videos accessible to more people, and let people know about them. There is little point in creating these videos if they have very few viewers.\n\nI believe it will also be difficult for the community to assess the quality of the videos, and whether they actually solve the problem of explaining proposals in a way that is easier to understand than the original proposal text.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_73", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 18, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposition could increase knowledge about our ecosystem alongside the perspective of wider adoption and participation, as it would make the process more inclusive. For example, people suffering from blindness would be able to be part of the community and be more involved in the decision-making process. The only flaw is that you can't do it for the majority of the good quality proposals, only a few, because there are just too many of them. This is why I can't give the perfect score !", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is known among the Catalyst community, they've already been funded once, during fund 6, one of them is running a stake pool [TIGER Pool] and being a community advisor for Catalyst. All of their social media channels and a Linkdn profile are set for more transparency, inspiring me confidence in the team.\n\nThe team have already made available a youtube video, as an example of their work, down the comment section: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yagm40Wny8). The video is easy to understand and well made, but the robotic voice could be annoying for many people, including me. I kindly suggest recording them with real voices.\n\nThe budget is well detailed inside the google doc, alongside the plan. Everything looks reasonable.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is ok, pretty well explained, and spread over the duration of fund 8 and 9. Key metrics and KPIs are easy to track: Average view duration; New Subscribers...\nThey acknowledged some risks to the challenge, although there are not many of those.\n\nThe milestones could have been more detailed, accompanied by dates, but I'm not sure that it is essential for this kind of proposal, anyway.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_146", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 3, "ng": 20, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Produire de courtes vid\u00e9os et podcasts en anglais d'une dur\u00e9e de 2 minutes contenant des informations analys\u00e9es pour 25% des propositions de chaque Fonds catalytique", "experience": "L'\u00e9quipe de 2Min Review est compos\u00e9e de CA, vCA, de constructeurs de communaut\u00e9s, de chercheurs et de producteurs de vid\u00e9os."}
