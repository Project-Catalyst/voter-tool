The role of sport as an instrument to strengthen the spirit of young people in any society is indisputable.  However, the only thing I can visualize are parents sneaking out of the meeting room where Cardano is being discussed to go watch their children play.  \r\n\r\nI think Cardano as an organization could financially sponsor sports activities in the communities as a form of social contribution.

Does he hold? Does he participate in any pool). Unfortunately when the team identity is sketchy.
