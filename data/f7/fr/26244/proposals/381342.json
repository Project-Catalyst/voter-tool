Les objectifs et le produit final de ce projet ont un fondement humanitaire profond, visant \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des opportunit\u00e9s \u00e9gales pour les personnes dans le monde qui n'ont pas les m\u00eames privil\u00e8ges que beaucoup d'autres.

The team has attached the budget, and after evaluating the items included, I must admit that I believe most of them to be appropriate except perhaps for the Plutus programmer. It is stated that $2600 will be allocated, but I am not sure what the role of the person will be. Is the person responsible for training the girls directly? If so, how much does each hour of training cost? Another aspect that I have missed here is the description of the risks that may threaten the successful implementation of this proposal.

What worries me a little is that the theory is perfect, but I don't really understand how that would be done in practice. It is not detailed in the proposal things like: what content of these workshops; in which schools (or universities, but I believe schools - which would also be a problem, because this type of teaching is a little difficult and advanced for those in elementary and high school. who are already dependent on the world of technologies, at least ); who would give these classes, how would the training of professionals be carried out; how often these classes would take place; how success would be measured, that is, how common taught women get inserted into the Cardano ecosystem, so as to measure the proposed benefits for the blockchain... Too many details. I'm also a little worried because it's such an ambitious idea to introduce the blockchain into a community that, unfortunately, gives so few opportunities to study and work for women. Maybe it would be more important to guarantee primary education to then invest in something more specific, you know? It worries me if this idea, despite being wonderful in theory, in practice is viable for the current situation in which these women find themselves.

Starting with the team, we don't know who they are, what they do, what their relationship is with the Cardano ecosystem, a small curriculum of what they did before, because they would be qualified to execute this project, in particular. It would be important to present them individually, to say their names, maybe their social media profiles and all that information I mentioned. Nor is anything said about how the financing money would be used. Why 30k? It would be necessary to understand what kind of expenses this would cover: teachers' salaries, their qualifications? Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this.

It would be even better if there were a detailed roadmap here (that way we could analyze the process, not just the end) and also a budget breakdown so that we could monitor whether the money was being used as promised. I believe it would be essential for the team to partially present the results to the community. I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once. Here we do not have a temporal notion of how long this project would take to develop as a whole, but we could think, for example, of a monthly follow-up from the community to the project, together with the team. It would also be interesting if, for example, the results of these teachings in the lives of young women were evaluated. Did they get opportunities from the project? How was the impact? This information could be organized and reported to the rest of the community, through Town Hall, for example.
