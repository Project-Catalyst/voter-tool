They are extremely fun and I remember riding them as a kid. I think its a really cool idea that they are incorporating them into a youth outreach program. I also think its a very smart decision to start with the younger generation. I think that is a smart approach as if they can get people interested at a young age, that is how they will make this thing have staying power. Seeing as its a cool and unique way to scale up Cardano community, I definitely think it addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As already mentioned I LOVE go-peds. They are extremely fun and I remember riding them as a kid. I can definitely see this being enough of an incentive to get kids to want to keep coming back so that they can race and have fun.

It gives me confidence that this could be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think this team did a great job with the auditability. The main things that I check for in assessing that is if they included KPIs and the KPIs are reasonable and make sense, a detailed roadmap, and a detailed budget that shows how all of the money will be spent for the different categories. This team covered all three of those areas so they get full points in this category.

Kids love to play. So why not educate them why they are her? The proposer approach is to kill two birds with one stone - and it can work well.I think that the education of kids is one of the most important parts of any ecosystem. The cardano ecosystem will see huge value if kids are taught early about the cardono blockchain. This proposal has clearly identified a problem within the challenge. They have also provided the key metrics and goals that align with the challenge. My only concern is that the proposer didn't specify how this project will evolve. Will it be able to sustain itself, in which case some sort of monetisation has to take place, or will it just request funds from future challenges? These are areas that I think the proposer has to bring more information in.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal contains enough informations for me to have confidence in its success. To be fair, the proposer has not provided links to it's github or linkedin, but for his defense, I think that some of the skills required are not formal but experience based. The proposer stated that he can assemble the go-ped himself. I guess we have to take his words for it. On the other hand, they will have to hire professionals to build the website. Furthermore the proposer has specified the user acquisition technique they intend to use which adds a positive note on the feasibility of the project. The proposal also contains a detailed roadmap and reasonable milestones. The budget is broken down into identifiable items. I think that the website is a little bit expensive, but maybe the proposer can break it down further to show how he came up with that number. As a digital marketer myself, I know that building a simple website does not require all that money. Apart from that, I have confidence in the idea and the feasibility of this project's success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think that the proposal can be audited in the future, based on the details provided in this project. The proposer has managed to provide a roadmap that is pretty convincing. The milestones are also realistic in my opinion.

Therefore, I recommend providing as much information of this type as possible, since without it and just by reading the proposal, the voter is left to struggle between the fascination of the idea and the possibility that the proposal will end up funding the personal motives of the proponents. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal makes a point:  the younger generations are the future users of the ecosystem.   The use of entertainment as a gateway to the active minds of young people is a fact that supports his thesis.

Children is the future of everything in the world. However I afraid that the exposing can cause harm to them because there are still many scam and cheating in the environment so it might be not safe for children, vulnerable people to join.

The plan is well-thought, very detail and realistic. (He even can do the Go-Peds himselft and volunteer to do it with n\u01a1 charge). He also consider the allowance of parents, which liminate the risk that children can be harm. The proposal also shows his enthusiasm of his goal.

I agree that this proposal addresses the challenge at the point to launch a new hub, however the target community makes me concerned. The proposal should select and inform the ages of children to make sure they are old enough to understand the concept of blockchain or Cardano. Or at least, I think we should consider it's very likely that only those parents who understand/ get involve in blockchain will let their kids go for some lessons about it.
