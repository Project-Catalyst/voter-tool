This is a good example of how to create an idea that is beneficial for all parties involved. The proposal proposes a symbiosis by providing granular data for SingularityNet, transactions on the Cardano-blockchain and the creation of NFTs. It would also help support the ecological reputation of Cardano and fortify positive carbon emissions. Maybe there is a collaborative opportunity with Veritree, who are currently raising funds to plant a forest of 1 million trees as presented on the Cardano Summit. There could be a lot of data to be generated from planting such an amount of specimens. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has unconfirmed relevant experience in the forestry industry. There are claims of unknown industry connections. There is a clearly set temporary roadmap.

Planting trees is important to the environment and combating climate change, the concept is clear and appears novel, and the would provide something of which both Cardano and SingularityNet could be proud.\r\n\r\nHowever, the connection to AI is not well-developed in the proposal, and seems mostly about \"AI needs data\" (which is true). But what kinds of AI-related uses would be made with these data? One good example provided for use of the data involves map accuracy, but that is not about AI. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I agree but do not strongly agree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Bodhi and Michael apparently have many years of experience with tree-planting, which is encouraging.

What is lacking here is how it is incentivised and also audited so that the data is correct. Any data modelling exercise to train AI systems is only as valuable as the data collected. It would be good to understand how they ensure there are no malicious actors when an incentive system is introduced. \r\n\r\nAnother area that isn't explored in detail is any ongoing data and if or how that is collected. Saplings survival rate is not 100%, as such this should be mentioned on whether this is just accepted as an issue for now or whether it is an area of focus so that the data doesn't become more meaningless over time due to not understanding the current survival of the planted ecosystem.\r\n\r\nFinally the job itself of planting more tree's and collecting the initial data is definitely one of impact. However in the context of this challenge it is not perfectly clear exactly how this data will be used and what applications will benefit from it in the short and longer term concerning the data model and AI specifically. It would be great to more fully understand the application of the suggested data to AI more than what has been detailed. Currently the proposal reads more like a project trying to find a home where they can get funding rather than one truly focussed on creating impactful AI solutions.
