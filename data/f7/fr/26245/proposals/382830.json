Having a dedicated hardware piece to run a stake pool would be very useful for existing SPO's and also it might make it easy for the community to onboard new SPO's. Also, this would bring together the community to bring improvement to a dedicated piece of hardware, and build specific tools integrating to this hardware, thus creating much more business opportunities for SPO's. Would suggest to the proposer adding KPI's in the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposer presents himself as an SPO and hardware engineer, which is impressive and shows enough experience and skillsets in implementing the proposal. Would have been better to add some links to the proposal showing relevant experience. The proposal has mentioned in detail the research and development process while implementing the proposal. Some points about the challenges faced in the future are missing in the proposal such as how about handling the growing size of nodes in future, or what of node's requirements goes up, then what can be done to existing hardware, will it be flexible enough? Also, the budget breakdown should have been more clearer in the proposal, since the budget is $ 100k almost about \u02dc45% of the challenge fund, would have been good to know the fund breakdown strategy in the proposal and it would be easy to understand for the community, how spending such amount on building a prototype is gonna be.

This can see the solution as an alternative to current dominated Google, AWS or AZURE clouds.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are three significant obstacle risks that I believe the team should work on these risks. First, in your case in Japan, I believe the Internet connection to the Raspberry boxes is at high bandwidth. The second is the local power supply would be reliable enough. However, the team should consider that all the developing countries with the power infrastructure are not as reliable as Japan. This brings to the Internet infrastructure also not being reliable. Therefore, if the system is not connected to the blockchain network for too long, would this be brought to issue with each epoch block issue. And the final risk that is the total challenge allocation is $250,000, and the team request 40% of the total fund. 30 proposals are competing in this challenge alone. I suggest the team subdivided the total fund since the entire fund was asking for $100,000 and run for one year. The team may have asked for $25,000 for the first three months and detail of action in 3 months and can be applied for the race or even 50,000 for the next coming fund rounds, and I believe that would be more feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A very brief for the first three months and entirely one year of deliverable work breakdown structure provided.
