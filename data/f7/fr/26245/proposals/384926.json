This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal identifies a serious problem within the challenge which needs to be solved; the propblem that big stakepools have it much easier to obtain a lot of staking users while small pools are often abandoned due to their low saturation - a fact ultimately leading to the opposite of the decentralisation aspect vital to Cardanos mission. This makes it also very clear that this proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and Cardanos mission.\r\nHence, the goals of the proposal align very well with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nThe proposal is able to scale to address future challenges and further foster the decentralisation aspect of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are well-known in the Catalyst community and are competent and up to the task.

The timetable of the proposal seems reasonable and conductible. The resources required are defined and the proposal seems conductible. Technical details however are not gone into any deeper other than the infrastructure requirements.\r\nNo plan regarding the requirement for additional funding or analysis of potential risks and hurdles are done.

"}, {"q0": "- Cardano SPOs are the backbone of what Cardano runs on.  Decentralization is what separate us as blockchain from others. So this is very important.\r\n- Most small pools cannot produce blocks, so delegators wouldn't select them.  The current stake pool setup is favorable to operators who has massive financial resources to start with. Small pool operators are discouraged from participating in securing the network. This results in an increasingly centralized blockchain.\r\n- This proposal suggests \"random sort order pools as a default for our lists\".\r\n- Would love to know where delegator starts to interact with poolpeek. Would it be from existing wallet such as yoroi upon clicking \"Delegation\"? Is so, how would you plan about lobbying emurgo to change from adapools to poolpeek? Or would you plan to be the partner for the up coming light wallet from IOG?\r\n- Please explain the criterias which small stake pool will be listed before/above the bigger stake pools.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- Already has a working prototype, it is a matter of procuring new equipments as requested in the proposal.

Most delegators who understand staking would naturally look for the most ROA.

Please detail them. Would love to know more.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- The roadmap and metrics are measurable and sensible.\r\n- I would also add, after 6 months of implementation, the number of delegations in comparison of smaller pools to higher pools based through the link direction of your site. This can actually audit how much your site has helped decentralization.\r\n- For example. The total number of new ada delegations for epoch 350 is 10,000,000 Ada. Of which 50% (5,000,000 Ada) of them are delegated to saturated or near saturated pools. 50% (5,000,000 Ada) are delegated to pools with less than 12m ada.\r\nThat would be a massive sucess and actually encourage decentralization instead of the current big pools accumulating all the Ada.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_985", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 14, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "First thank you for your comments as you are the first real review that has seen the needs for such tools and the hard work the team have put into providing the community with a free to use tool.\nAlignment \u2013 Extract of points\n\u2022    To know where delegators start to interact with PoolPeek. *Response \u2013 We are on different social media platforms and try to catch the attention of new delegators before they choose their first pool. We also find that a lot of users are those that have been in the space for a few months having gained enough knowledge to start to understand the need to support small pools and decentralization.

This allows users to find the associated pools search and quickly find what ones are single or multi-pools or saturated with other metrics. We have also just completed something similar with the project HoskyToken. These projects bring a lot of user base to the site to follow their projects. We already have a few more ready to launch once the projects near their launches. We have many other ideas that we are quietly working on in the background. \n\nAuditability \u2013 Extract of points\n\n\u2022    Implementation of user delegation for comparison. *Response \u2013 We are working on providing a user login to monitor pool selection and metrics to determine the impact or benefits to pools as mentioned.
