Le plan semble \u00eatre aussi simple que la mise en place de mod\u00e8les, les entretiens avec les proposants, le t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement des vid\u00e9os.

La section budget est le seul endroit o\u00f9 ces activit\u00e9s sont mentionn\u00e9es.\n\nLe budget \u00e9tant relativement faible et l'exp\u00e9rience ayant montr\u00e9 que la mise en place d'une cha\u00eene YouTube n'est pas une t\u00e2che \u00e9norme, la note de 3 est attribu\u00e9e en fonction de la confiance et de la r\u00e9putation que wada s'est forg\u00e9e dans la communaut\u00e9.\n\nPour les propositions futures, les proposants devraient s'efforcer d'aligner le plan, le budget, les r\u00e9sultats attendus et les \u00e9tapes.

It would be helpful to include information about the parameters that you wish to report on and how this reporting will take place, for example the use of graphs to display projected sales against current sales.\nThe lack of key metrics and goals means I am unable to assess how well the proposal aligns with the outlined challenge settings as none of the key metrics are referred to.\nIn my opinion, proposal would be unable to successfully scale without sound fundamentals required to enable it to address future challenges.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer does not demonstrate sufficient knowledge of auditing or how they wish to measure the performance of the catalyst proposal, nor is there any evidence of any persons with such knowledge relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal on their team.\nThe budget is not outlined clearly, nor broken down into identifiable items.

Generally this is done by plain documentation and video would certainly bring a more \"human component\" to this process at the same time it allows funded proposers to proper explain all the development done, in words and images.\nHowever, the documentation part still would be essential as it is really proof of what was done. The proposer here understands this and offers, together with the video, a place to keep this documents. Having everything in a dedicated platform, and with a standard template, would defintely make things easier and help community.\nI also see this proposal very aligned with challenge as it would increase the \"Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts\".\n\nThe only reason I didnt give 5 start here is because it is still unclear how much work would have to be put on to make these videos. Usually, this kind of media demand much more effort (and specific knowledge of tools and design) to be ellaborated, even with a template, than a regular documentation (word documents, spreadsheets, powerpoints). My concern is that funded proposers might not want to make the videos (either because of time it takes or because they dont know how to do them) and this project ends up being not very broadly adopted. To overcome this, it could be included in the scope of the project some support/training on creating the videos, besides providing the template, a possible way to outsource the creation of these videos (even if with a small fee) or other ways to facilitate the creation of this content. It could also be mentioned how was the impact, in a quantitative manner, of their previous funded proposal (Wada Media Funnel for Proposers), that involved video creation as well. It would clarify how prone proposers are to create these medias.\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As this this team has already developed a similar project in past funds, initially I'd say this proposal is generally feasible but it lacks some key information, that I describe in the sequence, that makes me give only a 3 score/star. First, more information on the team experience, person by person (it is mentioned mostly their area of expertise), and links to verify the information, as linkedin links, would be necessary. \n\nSecond, budget breakdown could better explained. For instance, it says \"Travel and security logistics \" but it could explain somewhere why these trips are necessary. \"Team costs\" could also be better ellaborated (is it just to pay the team or involve other kind of costs? how much will be paid per hour or per peson?).\n\nLast, There's a simple roadmap but it is not time-framed and only some vague actitivites are described. This roadmap could be better organized in months/weeks, with more straightfoward tasks, deliverables and main milestones per period. \n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are good time-framed milestones but no KPIs. It would be imporant to measure and follow up with how many audit videos are being made by funded proposers, how much time they are spending on it, how many people are watching and assess if this is really a better way to audit projects. Maybe it would be hard to set target on all them initially but their experience with past funded proposals could be used to give some sense on these targets (even if within a range)\nThe first bullets in the auditability part seems more related to engagement between proposers and community than the proposal itself.\n\n\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 10, "ng": 14, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This follow-up proposal builds on work that has been started in Fund5.
