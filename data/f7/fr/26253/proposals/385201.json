L'id\u00e9e est de cr\u00e9er un portail o\u00f9 la communaut\u00e9 peut suivre l'avancement des projets ; dans ce portail, il y aurait \u00e9galement des \" work packages \", qui sont en fait des parties du projet \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser, une fois que l'\u00e9quipe a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats des parties respectives, le financement serait, petit \u00e0 petit, lib\u00e9r\u00e9, et ainsi les packages avanceraient et l'argent serait disponible. Ce que j'ai trouv\u00e9 g\u00e9nial ici, c'est que les choses \u00e9taient organis\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s syst\u00e9matique et pr\u00e9-normalis\u00e9e. Je crois que chaque projet a ses sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s, mais il est certainement possible de pr\u00e9voir un calendrier d'actions pour chacun d'entre eux et de les diviser en paquets. Je crois que la navigation n\u00e9cessaire ici est un point crucial pour le succ\u00e8s de l'id\u00e9e. Car il y aurait de nombreux projets cat\u00e9goris\u00e9s, divis\u00e9s et sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s. Le design UI/UX doit \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9 afin de cr\u00e9er la plateforme la plus simple possible. Une question que je me posais \u00e9tait de savoir pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment o\u00f9 serait ce portail. Une page web, une application ? Il serait int\u00e9ressant que l'auteur pr\u00e9cise o\u00f9 il serait h\u00e9berg\u00e9. A part cela, j'ai ador\u00e9 l'id\u00e9e en elle-m\u00eame, je pense que cela rendrait le suivi des projets beaucoup plus accessible (il est tr\u00e8s compliqu\u00e9 de suivre des centaines de projets financ\u00e9s, refl\u00e9t\u00e9s par les coins les plus divers de l'internet !)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "En ce qui concerne la capacit\u00e9 de l'auteur \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien le projet, j'aimerais avoir plus de d\u00e9tails sur qui il est. Il nous donne tr\u00e8s peu d'informations sur lui-m\u00eame, tout ce que nous savons c'est qu'il est ing\u00e9nieur, entrepreneur et qu'il a de l'exp\u00e9rience dans la distribution de financement. Mais il serait important d'avoir un curriculum plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9, des exemples de travaux ant\u00e9rieurs, comment est cette exp\u00e9rience avec la distribution de financement, \u00e0 quoi ressemble la m\u00e9thode traditionnelle ? Il serait tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fique qu'il joigne un profil linkedin ou une autre plateforme o\u00f9 nous pourrions apprendre \u00e0 le conna\u00eetre de plus pr\u00e8s. Il serait tr\u00e8s important pour ce projet d'avoir une exp\u00e9rience de designer UI/UX afin de construire une plateforme intuitive et facile pour tout membre de la communaut\u00e9 souhaitant exercer l'auditabilit\u00e9. Il n'est pas non plus clair si l'auteur lui-m\u00eame serait le programmeur, il ne dit pas s'il a l'intention d'engager une \u00e9quipe de marketing pour faire conna\u00eetre l'id\u00e9e, etc. Concernant le sc\u00e9nario, cette partie est tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, et elle s'ajoute \u00e0 la r\u00e9partition des d\u00e9penses. Si l'auteur indique ce qui serait fait, il pr\u00e9cise le montant des fonds qui seraient utilis\u00e9s pour une partie donn\u00e9e. Et les \u00e9tapes sont assez bien d\u00e9cortiqu\u00e9es, ce qui nous donne une bonne id\u00e9e de ce qui va se passer dans chaque partie. Par cons\u00e9quent, ce qui doit \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9 selon moi, c'est la pr\u00e9sentation de l'auteur lui-m\u00eame et l'explication de la formation d'une future \u00e9quipe, principalement parce qu'il n'est pas possible qu'un projet d'une telle complexit\u00e9 soit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par une seule personne. Et comme on nous pr\u00e9sente une \u00e9quipe et ce qui sera fait par chaque professionnel, nous aurions aussi plus de bases pour d\u00e9terminer si l'argent demand\u00e9 en financement est justifiable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "L'auteur se pr\u00e9occupe de dessiner des d\u00e9finitions du succ\u00e8s en fonction du passage du temps, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 exercer directement l'auditabilit\u00e9 ; je pense aussi que cela pourrait se faire en deux \u00e9tapes. D'abord, bien s\u00fbr, suivons la construction de la plate-forme elle-m\u00eame. Cela pourrait se faire par le biais de r\u00e9unions, dans lesquelles l'auteur montre les avanc\u00e9es, quelles parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es \u00e0 certaines p\u00e9riodes. Il est possible de savoir \u00e0 quoi s'en tenir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la division des phases qu'il \u00e9tablit, et comme elle est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e, nous savons exactement ce que nous devons attendre de chacune d'elles. Et apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 ce processus de cr\u00e9ation, il faudrait observer si la plateforme fonctionne correctement, si l'auditabilit\u00e9 des projets \"h\u00e9berg\u00e9s\" s'est r\u00e9ellement am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, si la communaut\u00e9 y a acc\u00e8s, ce qu'elle pense de la navigation sur le portail, les \u00e9ventuelles erreurs \u00e0 corriger. En d'autres termes, il est possible de suivre l'\u00e9volution du projet gr\u00e2ce aux informations fournies lors de la description de la proposition, en plus des indicateurs de r\u00e9ussite susmentionn\u00e9s. Il suffit que, dans un premier temps, l'auteur \u00e9tablisse ce pont entre le processus et la communaut\u00e9, puis que la communaut\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame utilise le portail et donne son avis sur l'exp\u00e9rience.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is a driving a meaningful impact towards improving catalyst transparency and growing auditability.
