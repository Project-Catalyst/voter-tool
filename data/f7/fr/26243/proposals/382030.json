This proposal fits into that setting in that they are new to Cardano/Catalyst (according to their profile being created in Nov. 2021) and that their dapp idea is DeFi related. I'm giving 4 stars instead 5 for 2 reasons. 1) In the challenge \"Potential Directions\" section microfinance (how I would categorize this project) is not mentioned. However, I believe it to still be within the scope of \"DeFi.\" 2) The challenge is measuring dapps on mainnet within 3, 6,and 12 months. This project's timeline lists mainnet at 12 months which is cutting it close. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Bitsoko services attached explainer video and presentation deck gives me a high degree of confidence in their ability to complete the project. They already have working infrastructure and at least one onboarded client. Based on that and their Github activity I believe they have the technical capability. They have a defined timeline that is reasonable. The largest problem with this proposal is the budget which in the proposal details is over the maxmum amount laid out in the proposal of $50,000USD. Upon review of the comments section it is stated that they scaled down the scope of the proposal and requested the amount of $50,000 but were unable to make that change in the proposal details. I feel I must give lower star rating because of that. Perhaps they missed the deadline to edit their proposal? I think this is a great proposal and would give a higher rating if the budget request was within the parameters of the challenge in the proposal details.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal has a clear roadmap with milestones that align with the challenge setting. They have identified a problem in their country/region that impacts the everyday life of a large population of people and have put forth a solution that addresses it.

(Over 90% of total)\r\n\r\nWhat this proposal does is:\r\n*The proposal identifies a problem that has the potential to impact the challenge: Onboarding merchants, investors, and users in Ghana to the Cardano blockchain is a \"bridges creation scenario, [where] projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\"\r\n\r\n*Only one of the key metrics and goals of the proposal aligns with the outlined challenge settings: DeFi dapps were launched on Cardano mainnet within 3, 6 and 12 months after funding.\r\n\r\nWhat this proposal does not do (yet): \r\n*The proposal has not articulated how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n*Due to lack of clarity & specific details of implementation, it is unclear how the proposal will be able to scale to address future challenges.\r\n\r\nFurther advice on improving quality and increasing the low rating of this proposal follows in the next 2 sections.\r\n(1) I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "This is a good first draft of a proposal for an interesting idea. By taking to heart the following critiques and buckling down to work, the next iteration of this proposal will see improved ratings.\r\n\r\n* The proposer does not provide evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.\r\n\r\nFrom the proposal, the only clear reference to experience is \"we've been developing bitcoin solutions for merchants since 2013 and with smart contracts since 2016 as a team of 3 devs and 2 research/comm\" which in itself is too vague and without evidence of actual accomplishments. From page 3 of the \"Community Advisor Assessment Guide - Fund7\" Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-iZhDlKhUBZkui1uv8NVNfJC4oVD3JtR-P6Fue7XPU/edit#, \"it is encouraged that proposers prepare their proposals at a level suitable for most voters.\" If the evidence of experience is to be found in the GitHub repository at https://git.bitsoko.org/bitsoko, the average voter will not be able to deduce experience or lack thereof. Adding specific details & tangible evidence of experience will improve ratings on the next iteration of this proposal.\r\n\r\n* The proposer has not identified the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. As a community, we have no idea who is behind \"BitsokoKenya.\"\r\n\r\n* The budget is not outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items.\r\n\r\n\"Grant Fund would be used to fund development of merchant pools and assets, merchant tokenization training, creating fundraising awareness within the community and greater public.  MSM Fund will be solely for already existing businesses who need to tokenize or expand their operations.\" This must be thoughtfully worked out & clearly indicated in future proposals.\r\n\r\n*The budget is much too high, requesting $185000 out of the F7: Seeding Cardano's Grassroots DeFi challenge budget of $200000 and fails the criteria: \"Each new team can request up to 25% of the total $200,000.\"\r\n\r\n*The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan for the additional funding required to implement the proposal: \"After 3 months we expect to have raised funding for...\" \"After 12 months, we will have launched publicly on cardano mainnet to enable merchants from around the country to raise capital and manage funding using smart contracts.\"\r\n\r\n*The proposal does not offer a realistic timetable to complete the work, as the work to be done is unclear what needs to be done when. The \"work\" is not defined clearly enough to verify what the milestones actually are. \r\n\r\n* The proposal does not provide a logical and conductible plan for implementation that shows what is being done and how it will be completed.\r\n\r\nMilestones are simply summaries of 3 month intervals. Specifying the details of activities during these 3 month periods, will increase confidence in the feasibility of this proposal.\r\n\r\n*The plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal. Connecting to the Catalyst community and becoming more familiar with Cardano in general, will help the proposer find the resources, collaborations, & guidance to turn this idea into a feasible, workable proposal.\r\n\r\n*The proposal does not explain technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies as these are crucial for implementation: Explanations are in generic terms: \"smart contracts deployed on cardano\" (Cardano), \"a liquidity pool, managed by an Automated Market Maker contract, which will hold investor funds on behalf of merchant. Contract will perform functions such as paying for supplies, rent, and more and will receive customer payments from completed orders. Investors will be rewarded per completed (customer order) transaction and will be able to withdraw or add funds on merchant pool at any time after a minimum lock period. Rewards will be proportional to the investors share of the pool.\" It is not clear to the general voter how this will take place, other than just sounding technical.\r\n\r\n*There is no indication that challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation have been considered other then a reference to \" We have already registered in Ghana and we are in the process of acquiring regulator approval in Nigeria as well and are ready to work with merchants there.\" Evidence of registration in Ghana would add legitimacy to this proposal.\r\n\r\nAddressing the missing elements, including links to relevant work done so far and taking the time to clearly express these will greatly improve the rating of this proposal in a future fund.\r\n\r\n(1) I strongly disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Building on the basis of this proposal, following proposal guidelines, connecting to the Project Catalyst community, and incorporating the following critiques will help improve this proposal for Fund 8.\r\n*This proposal has a \"summary\" roadmap. Clarifying and explicitly stating milestones and a time horizon for each achievement would greatly improve this proposal.\r\n*The metrics/KPIs for the success of the proposal are hidden. \"The Micro, Small and Medium Fund will enable upto 50 selected businesses to raise funding and enable investors earn rewards using smart contracts deployed on cardano\" is an intro. KPIs must be spelled out explicitly. \r\n\r\nBy scrolling through various proposals on ideascale, commenting on proposals, asking questions, & participating in workshops hosted by the Catalyst school, the proposer will become familiar with the expectations of a high quality proposal requesting funds from the Cardano community treasury.\r\n* This proposal does not have a clear understandable description of the targeted problem: The Problem statement : \"Small enterprises don't have required financial transparency/records to raise funds from mainstream banking for expansion or operations\" needs further development and an identifiable target market.\r\n*This proposal does not have a clear understandable solution to address the problem as indicated. The solution that should be fleshing out:  \"we enable businesses to manage finances using smart contracts deployed on cardano,\" is encrypted in buzz words and technical sounding jargon. \r\n\r\nA high quality proposal is possible with hard work, due diligence, and commitment to learning from the Project Catalyst Community.\r\n\r\n(1) I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
