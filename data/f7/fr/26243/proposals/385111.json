The proposal identifies an approach which fits perfectly into the challenge which by working on it, will provide training opportunities for many women thus act both on the actual topic of seeding Cardanos grassroots DeFi and gender equality. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

The concept is interesting and developer training is an objective that could impact the Cardano ecosystem in general, but the objectives and metrics presented are not directly related to the metrics and potential directions described in the Challenge Brief. Only a target related to the number of trained developers was established, but there are no indicators that can allow assessing the qualification of these developers and how they will impact the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nI would recommend submitting the proposal to a more appropriate challenge, one that is related to the developer ecosystem for example and also defining metrics that more clearly indicate the potential impact of the proposal on the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The WADA team is well known and has a good reputation in the Cardano community. There is some relevant information about the experience and qualification of the team, such as expertise in programming language, functional and the experience in teaching, which is something that WADA has been developing for several months, but it was not clear what the team's experience in Plutus is and considering that the purpose is to teach Plutus, it would be essential to demonstrate the team's level of knowledge in Plutus, if they participated in the Plutus Pioneers Program and if they are already developing some kind of dapp on Cardano.\n\nI would also recommend including links/sources to repositories and Linkedin so that the community has access to the work of team members and can check their qualifications.\n\nThe budget has been broken down into defined items. The intention to carry out marketing campaigns and hackathons was mentioned, but I would recommend including more details on how these events will be organized, how many people are wanted at the events (KPIs/metrics), what the prize division would be. There is no way to clearly judge the feasibility of the budget without understanding the complexity and details of the plan.\n\nThe proposal timeline is very vague as there are no milestones and dates in the roadmap. The challenge brief of this challenge establishes the successful implementation of dapps in 2022 and the goals presented in this proposal were established at 1, 2 and 3 years after the start of the proposal, which does not show the temporal feasibility and also deviates from the established objectives/goals in the Challenge Brief.\n\nThe proposal failed to mention the risk of dependence on another proposal not receiving funding \"Funnel women into Wada's Haskell and Plutus training program (See main proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Spread-Plutus-through-Africa /381332-48088)\"\n\nFrom what I could understand there is a dependency, as they are complementary proposals, so it would be important to indicate what would be the impact of one of the two not being funded.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no clarity on how the problem and solution presented is related to the DeFi ecosystem. Any proposal that aims to train developers has the potential to add to the DeFi ecosystem, but there is no solid argument in the proposal on how it will add to the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere is a roadmap with goals, but there is no mention of dates associated with milestones, which impairs auditability. There are no reasonable metrics for measuring success. The presented developer onboarding goals do not seem to me to be good indicators because they are only defined as numbers without context, it would be important to include metrics/KPIs that allow evaluating the quality of the onboarded devs and the contribution of these metrics to the challenge.\n\nThe budget defined was 12 months but the goals presented were up to 3 years. It is unclear what this means. Will the team continue the project after completing one year? Will there be a need for more funding? Without this clarification, the inclusion of metrics beyond one year becomes less relevant and more subjective.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 11, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Lancer une vaste campagne de sensibilisation ciblant les femmes en Afrique, les encourageant \u00e0 suivre la formation Plutus et les motivant par des incitations.", "experience": "Wada nework : experts en marketing qualifi\u00e9s et militants de Cardano\nFormateurs Haskell et Plutus"}
