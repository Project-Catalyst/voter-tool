The developer is clear that the game intends to show information and educate users about nature, survival, and the importance of clean water, which is great, but the real-world side of this implementation needs to be clarified, such as HOW this are of nature will be defended, what will be done to ensure the water quality, and other important aspects of defending natural resources.  Additionally, the website for the project lacks any information on the team members involved, and has very little information of use while relying heavily on vague statements and stock images.  Neither the website nor the writeup on the concept provide enough detail to show how the team intends to accomplish these goals.  In order to successfully implement a plan, there needs to be a clear representation of what exactly is being planned, and, while there is some information on what they intend to do game-wise, once again there is a lack of information as to how this will cross over to the proposed \"saving of untouched nature in different parts of the world.\"  The lack of clarity would make it hard to measure success.  Strongly suggest that proposer provide more information on how the real-world aspect will be handled, as well as more information on the developer team such as what they have worked on before and what they will be doing for this project.
