At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date.

In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month.

The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities.

The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training.
