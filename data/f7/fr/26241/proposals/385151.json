The proposer also knows the required manpower and resources to successfully implement the project. Furthermore, this proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.

Already, the project has a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Definitely when the community would start buying NFTs it would add value to the Cardano ecosystem but also to the project itself.
