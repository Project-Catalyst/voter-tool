L'utilisation des Smart Contracts et de la technologie Blockchain sur les places de march\u00e9 est d\u00e9finitivement un domaine relativement inexplor\u00e9 et sous-d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, et serait r\u00e9volutionnaire si le bon projet \u00e9tait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9.

Afin d'\u00e9valuer la faisabilit\u00e9 de cette proposition, il faut d\u00e9crire qui travaillera sur le projet et comment. Il est fait mention de l'embauche de d\u00e9veloppeurs chevronn\u00e9s et d'une date de lancement de la plateforme estim\u00e9e \u00e0 2024, mais il serait utile de savoir si ces d\u00e9veloppeurs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 embauch\u00e9s, combien d'heures par semaine ils travailleront et quelle part du budget leur sera allou\u00e9e.
