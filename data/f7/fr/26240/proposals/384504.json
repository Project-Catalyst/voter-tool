The theme and execution match Cardano's and Catalyst's principles of stewardship, openness, collaboration and \"Cascading disruption\". \r\n\r\nThis proposal aligns very well to the campaign by providing meaningful value to the person, the community and the planet.  The app user will enjoy playful communion with the nature world.  The Cardano community will gain new users, a new dapp, a new token,  and traffic on the mainnet.  The planet will be protected one tree at a time - and the growing awareness that we are all connected and have value.

I know exactly what will be created with these funds (as specific as individual blog posts) and what will be created later (a Treedano DAO after one year). \r\n\r\nThere will be challenges and risks to success, but this team and plan are capable of overcoming them.   Among other things, Reading the team's values help me make this assessment. This is a team I want to see thrive and these values spread.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I trust this team is capable of success.

The suggested proposal is a good combination of impact with the scale of transactions on Cardano. \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. The proposal is able to scale to address future challenges. The team has a great plan in place and is very passionate about the solution. \r\n\r\nAs an entrepreneur and mentor for startups for many years, this is a great sign of dedication and resistance that will lead to success.

It could have been helpful to break down the number of hours required for each task to give higher visibility.

This could be a way for hikers/nature lovers/geocachers to help gather data and document existing trees, especially previously undocumented ones.

The ability to scale depends on community adoption, the number of supported tree species and the community's will to provide these extensions.\r\nIt is not clear how the \"tree pinning\" process is going to work. Is there experience needed to pin a tree? What infos are saved in the NFT and who proves the veracity of that data?

But this invalidates the decision to take earning potential outside the ecosystem into the calculation, as these differ greatly between an experienced full stack lead dev and a teacher. Thus, I think the expected wage of $75 per hour is set too high.\r\nThe token-incentive mechanism relies solely on wealthy individuals and companies that want to carbon-offset.
