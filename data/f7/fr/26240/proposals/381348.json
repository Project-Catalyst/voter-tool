It is unclear if the developer has the knowledge about Haskell/Plutus needed for the dapp to interact with the on-chain smart contract (SC). Also it is unclear if the dapp will use an already functional SC API or a new SC will be created to make the dapp interacting with the blockchain.\r\n\r\nThere is a budget outlined and broken down into identifiable items but the plan which says what is to be done lacks in information about how the work is done. (development phases etc.)\r\n\r\nThe proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation. Generally, off-chain data is unstructured. A hash or signature for the off-chain item is generated and that is what is stored in the blockchain. The actual item (NFT) is either stored in the cloud or in near-cloud storage. Based on this it is necessary that the proposer should be aware of the premises for a valid calculation of off-chain storage (average document size, 24x7 364 days a year etc.)\r\n\r\nThe proposer doesn't provide information about the storage type, if is decentralized or centralized and what are the risks associated with the use of a centralized storage system.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are some key metrics defined to measure the success of the proposal implementation but they are presented in a vague manner as is unclear what is the size of \"small venues/areas\" as an estimated number of users.

In addition to this I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects.  In addition to this, I learned some programming during my university studies, so I can comprehend the basic ideas behind a lot of the technical details. The proposal identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved, however does not articulate the solution and ist value to the Cardano ecosystem clearly enough. The proposal partially aligns with the challenge metrics, however they are not directly adressed.\r\nThe proposal should be able to scale if executed correctly", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer is transparent about his background and seems competent and up to the task. He provides proof that he is up to technical tasks regarding stakepools, however it is unknown whether this also applies to developing Apps. The proposer defines the number of team members required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is only coarse-grained. Feedback: For future proposals, try to draft a more detailed plan on what each item of your proposal will cost and rationable calculations on how you justify those costs.\r\nThe proposer has not provided a plan for the case if they need additional funds. Feedback: Consider defining an MVP that might even be possible to be made with less funds or explainig where you would get additional funds if needed. The proposal only has a brief timetable that however seems reasonable to complete the work.\r\nThe proposal only provides a coarse-grained plan for implementation that does not exactly show how it will be implemented.\r\nThe proposal does not explain the technical aspects on the functioning of the apps, but only briefly explains what they are supposed to do.

Similar services already exist, and function perfectly fine without the need for a dedicated lite wallet, such as the Catalyst Fund5 funded authenticator NFT Key - https://nftkey.me/. \r\nI would suggest including a clearer explanation of their technical approach and why a lite wallet would be needed in a potential future iteration of the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers themselves point out that one of the key elements of the project is approaching business about the service, yet no examples of actual businesses their planning to approach are given, neither is a brief description of how they're planning to approach larger organisations.
