Mais c'est essentiellement le point le plus proche des objectifs du d\u00e9fi et en tant que tel, je ne suis ni d'accord ni en d\u00e9saccord avec l'alignement.

Il est fait mention de l'industrie 4.0 et de l'IdO, mais ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments n'\u00e9taient pas du tout li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'application num\u00e9rique qu'ils d\u00e9veloppent ni \u00e0 ses fonctionnalit\u00e9s imminentes.

Certes, deux des membres de l'\u00e9quipe sont nomm\u00e9s mais leurs profils LinkedIn n'offrent pas d'exp\u00e9rience directe dans le d\u00e9veloppement de DApp qui pourrait donner confiance. Intellics Engineering semble \u00eatre plus ax\u00e9 sur l'industrie automobile et il n'y a pas d'informations sur les d\u00e9ploiements actuels et pass\u00e9s de la blockchain, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 affirm\u00e9. Si les exp\u00e9riences dans l'industrie automobile doivent \u00eatre exploit\u00e9es pour am\u00e9liorer les rapports sur la qualit\u00e9 du vin, car elles sont li\u00e9es au transport du produit, cela aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre mieux expliqu\u00e9 afin de cr\u00e9er le lien entre leur expertise et le d\u00e9ploiement pr\u00e9vu.

This proposal aims to store in the Cardano blockchain some characteristics about the quality of wines, such as their location, temperature, etc. Unfortunately, I see several points to be problematized here. The situation is similar to another proposal that also deals with the world of wines, which I evaluated recently (Wine open market - Stappato, present at the following link: https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBq7U). We know what the idea is, but there are not enough explanations for us to understand well how all this would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. It is not specified how this bridge would be established, which technologies would be used, how Cardano would be integrated, in a detailed way, in this project. All we are told is that the blockchain would be used to store some information, which would be tamper-proof, traceable and all the other advantages that the blockchain provides. But little is said about it. The proposal is concerned with explaining the crux of the issue much more - guaranteeing final consumers control over the entire wine-finding process - than how all this would use and impact Cardano. Another point I would like to highlight is: as in the other proposal on wines, I find it difficult for the target audience here to actually purchase these services, use this platform (from the attached photo and from the understanding I had, it would be a Dapp). How to reach people who are commonly unaware of blockchain? How to persuade them to use this Dapp, in addition to wanting to have greater control over the wine they will purchase, how would they relate to Cardano? The target audience here would be consumers of refined wines, usually older people and those with good purchasing power. In general, this is the target audience for fancy wines, right? I am not generalizing and putting them in boxes, but more practically, it is not a part of the population that uses blockchain. I would like to understand more in depth how this adoption would take place. In other words, unfortunately I do not see this proposal as something that will guarantee a good return for Cardano, both because it is something extremely specific, a very unique niche, in which consumers need a good direction to use blockchain (if the author had better explained the user experience, maybe this issue would be clearer); both because I could not visualize, in practice, how Cardano would be used here.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Explanations about the company involved, Intellics Engineering, are confusing. To begin with, they say they have experience in many very different areas, such as \"space technology, hotel systems and market industry\". How would it work in such diverse fields? What do they do with blockchain specifically? Have you ever worked with Cardano, or was it another blockchain? What is \"Industry 4.0 and IoT\"? It would be very positive if they had made a clearer definition of what their activities are, conceptualizing these different definitions that I mentioned last, in this way the understanding of the CAs would be much more solid as to who they are and what they do. Individually, the situation is much better, since they make the linkedin profile of their members available. With that we can get to know them individually, but that doesn't make up for the lack of knowing who would do what in this project. It would be necessary for them to clarify who would work here, developing which role and carrying out which activities. About the roadmap, we know which phases would be done and their respective costs (the funding requested would only cover the first phase). In the first phase, for example, the construction of the Dapp would be carried out, this would take 4 months and cost USD 35k. Right. But who would work here? The smaller tasks are defined, in fact, in the topic \"this phase will contain several important milestones\". This allows us to understand what would be done and in what order, as well as how long each activity would take. However, each topic could be detailed better, there is no way to fully understand the development of the project without knowing who would be responsible for each part, for example. The budget is explained in a somewhat superficial way, it is said how the money would be distributed, but each topic should also be more detailed. For example, 6k for marketing. It is said that some promotional materials would be made, such as pamphlets, shirts and publicity on social media. But in what way? What social media? How to reach the target audience? As in the marketing example, the other expenses could be better broken down. In summary, I think it's a little difficult to understand the activities of this company, but it's possible to get to know each stakeholder well; the roadmap is present and satisfactory, although not very detailed in some ways, as is the budgetary justification. The topic is well covered, just needing some adjustments.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is admissible through the data provided in the KPIs part, I found it positive that these data are quite diverse and are not limited to just measuring the amount of products/transactions performed. But some parts could be better explained; for example, user satisfaction. How would that be done, would any research be carried out? And what research? Would the results be shared with the rest of the Cardano community, and if so, through which platform? In my view, however, there could be more KPIs directly focused on the benefits of the Cardano ecosystem. In other words, if new members were acquired for the community, if they are active, if they suddenly started other activities within the ecosystem beyond the use of this Dapp. In the \"Challenges/Risks\" section, some possible obstacles are outlined, and a good way of auditing the proposal would also be monitoring if such problems really happened and if they were resolved. All this data must be directly presented to the Cardano community, as it is a project that has several phases, an idea would be that there was a meeting at the end of each stage, to situate the community on how the development is going and the results already partially obtained.
