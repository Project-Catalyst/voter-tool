Nous pouvons voir dans cette proposition qu'elle va construire un nouveau cadre de pont blockchain sans confiance appel\u00e9 \"London Bridge\", et qu'elle sera construite en utilisant la technologie Intel SGX. Il serait utile qu'ils puissent expliquer bri\u00e8vement ce que fait Intel SGX, et aussi expliquer comment il sera mis en \u0153uvre en d\u00e9tail. Par exemple : expliquer comment l'utilisation d'Intel SGX peut contribuer \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dans quelle partie / aspect il sera utilis\u00e9 lors du d\u00e9veloppement du pont, et quels sont les d\u00e9fis lors de la mise en \u0153uvre de ce type de technologie.

Not much technical details are linked or explained so I don't know if the proposers can address future challenges.

I have no idea if the timetable offered for implementation is good or not, because no technical specs or architecture is provided. As a developer I would have been able to estimate at least if the timetable is sensible or not for the job stated to be done. No time is mentioned concerning the integration of the implemented bridge. The deffinition of success is good, but it mentiones what it should accomplish, but the proposal doesn't state how would it support it. No resources of any kind are mentioned as necessary to implement the proposal. Having looked at over 30 proposals by now, this is very odd to me. The technical aspects like architecture language or technologies that are goind to be used for the implemention are never mentioned. A high level overview is not enough for a proposal of this magnitude.  I would love for this project to become a reality because it's a great idea, but as it stands now, I'd suggest to the authors of this proposal to have a look at other technical proposals and have a look through the proposal templates and questions to be answered.
