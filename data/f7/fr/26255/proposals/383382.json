Whilst maybe slightly off topic on the challenge, this type of information is important for businesses starting out in this space and it can be very expensive to get even if you find people with the right experience. \r\nInternational experience is mentioned, however the Repository is only for UK Tax advice. What regions will the workshops cover?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have clear experience in this space and have set a out a simple plan of 5 workshops and the creation of a repository of knowledge.

Overall the team should have no problem delivering on this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Delivery of the workshops will be simple to audit. There are not too many details on what will go into the repository making delivery of this a little harder to audit. KPI's have been set out regarding number of viewers of the workshops and the resources. IT would be nice to set some goals here. How many attendees and document views would be considered a success?

The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. The budget breakdown could be a bit more specified. At the moment we do not get the information how many people are involved in which work package. The KPIs are very easy to measure.
