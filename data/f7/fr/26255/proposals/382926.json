Preparing solutions in stages/releases is smart. Alex and Philip have proven themselves in Project Catalyst and we can expect great results from them.\r\n\r\nAs for the payment for the mentor, it's great if the mentor's efforts can be baked in to the proposal budget and if this can be shown with a \"seal of mentorship\" badge or any standard approach that makes it visible that this particular proposal is being guided by an experienced community mentor. Another way to fund the mentors would be to expand the current \"referee reward\" to include also mentors.\r\n\r\nIn that model, all mentors and referees would share the bonus reward and this would mean no extra costs for the treasury.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones are clear.
