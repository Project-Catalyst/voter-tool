TechStars is a well recognised accelerator and the exposure for Cardano and Catalyst would also be large driving future entrepreneurs to the Cardano ecosystem. \r\nHowever the title \"Lets Woo Tech Stars\", implies the aim of the project is to bring them in. Apart for experience listed at knowing the key people at Techstars, there is not plan on milestones associated with bringing them onboard. Ideally this proposal would have TechStars involved as is the case in \"Accelerator in Emerging Markets\" where the proposer is SeedStars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer claims close links to TechStars and thus the ability to bring them in, however no evidence is given. \r\nIn its current form the proposal is a great idea, but there are no details on how the budget is to be used. Is the $400,000 to be $20k to each start-up? \r\nConfidence in this being successfully delivered relies upon TechStars being involved.\r\nMore details on the budget and proof of connections to TechStars (LinkedIn?), or ideally TechStars being part of the proposal would be required to have a high confidence of this being implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal as it stands only is requesting funding for the first stage, the Founders Catalyst Accelerator. All that has been put forward as success is that this is run. Funding for further steps at 6 and 12 months has not been requested so cannot really be considered as part of this proposal but more as a future project. \r\nWhilst delivery of this first stage is easy to audit, I would suggest there should be some intermediate steps. This should included confirmation that TechStars is onboard to run it, and selection of the teams. Success cannot just be that the program was run. It should be measured by the the impact the program has both on the teams themselves (how many came out with a minimum viable product, business plans, got further funding etc.) and also how much exposure the program brings to Catalyst and Cardano.

The $400K option is a lighter version one-time and is for 20 teams over 10-weeks.  The idea had to be presented this way because the challenge has a $500K budget because: \"This challenge seeks professional-grade Accelerator programmes and Business Incubators to step up, co-develop, and deliver venture building programmes with Catalyst.\"    Techstars siad they would be interested in working with Cardano and sent program details, but asked they not we posted 'as is' in a public forum, they would be interested in discussions with the right folks at Cardano. Therefore, it is simply understood the community doesn't have the budget authority to release $9MM as Filecoin and Launchpool have funded theirs.
