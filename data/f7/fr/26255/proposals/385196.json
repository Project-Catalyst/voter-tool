The team is unforuntately not as passionate about following the Catalyst proposal submission rules, which may hamper the scores of their proposals. Good news is that their proposals are usually great ideas (this one too!). The impact of this proposal is potentially enormous with the M1 sidechain launching as the premier EVM-based sidechain in the Cardano ecosystem powered by the Milkomeda protocol. Hence, the Milkomeda Accelerator program will come in useful to foster projects that want to capitlize on this new piece of infrastructure. I agree the impact would be amazing and  an accelerator program for projects interested in building with Milkomeda is something that would  amplify and commercialize projects of benefit for the ecosystem. The challenge specifies that Catalyst wants organizations and groups who have a track record of business incubation and acceleration to apply. dcSpark is one of them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": " dcSpark was founded by three former EMURGO members who have been deeply involved in the Cardano ecosystem for years. This time has the theoretical and practical knowledge to pull it off. What I don't understand is why does dcSpark (repeatedly?) fails to include a budget breakdown and often there are no detailed milestones. The total budget for this proposal is $50,000. That's it. Voters get no more budget-related information. The dcSpark team member who wrote this Catalyst proposal checked the \"Broken down my budget requirements\" checkbox - and then did not break down the budget requirements. The dcSpark team member in charge of submitting this proposal checked the \"Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months\" check box to indicate that this has been included - and then the proposal does not have even an explanation why this has not been included. OK, there might be different reasons for these omissions: the team does not know yet, or the team does not think it is relevant at this moment, or a more detailed plan will be published later... but still, Catalyst has a modus operandi and these proposals (not the first one) omit this information. One possible way of doing it would be to say \"\"We plan to provide funding for up to 5 teams, meaning that the desired ceiling per project would be $10,000\"... There could also be some added information on how teams will be selected - what will be the factors that you will use to sort among the apiring projects?  Or something else. I mention this because the dcSpark team can clearly up their game in terms of writing Catalyst proposals (when it comes to the Feasibility and the Auditability segments). You guys work with algorithms all the time, just follow the Catalyst algorithm and don't skip the stuff we need: \"The budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items.\" \"The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\" \"The proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.\" etc... Community advisors are being expected to go out on a limb here and trust ... trust... trust... that everything will play out well. However, our job as CAs it to trust but also verify. I would advise the team to read the nitty gritty details of the Community Advisor Assessment Guide and what we look for in a proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-iZhDlKhUBZkui1uv8NVNfJC4oVD3JtR-P6Fue7XPU/edit#", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This team has been very transparent and very vocal about its contributions to the Cardano ecosystem. They are very well known players and agents of change. I think their forte is the technical knowledge, experience, deep understanding of the matter at hand and ability to explain and foresee challenges. I am confident that they will be successful in what they intend - accelerating the Milkomeda projects. It might be somewhat difficult for someone trying to periodically follow the progress of this proposal if there are no clear milestones that the team envisages or regular updates. I presume there will be some, but the proposal does not let us know. Still this criteria is called not just Auditability - but Clarity/Auditability and the fact that the team has such a clear vision speaks favourably in their name that they will approach the project - I expect (!) with the same clarity that they put into practical projects. I would advise them to be proactive and to set a regular pace of updates to the community on how implementation of proposals is progressing. If this is something that they can take on board, then they can also include such a \"reporting mechanism\" in all of their Catalyst proposals in the future. Looking at the dcSpark website I see it lacks a news section - that's what you guys may need - regular technical updates. One of the commenters below the proposal (Richard Goerwitz) left some very good advice to the proposing team on Ideascale. I will repeat it here, as I think it is very pertinent (hopefully dcSpark is reading this): \"I'd personally like to see more detail on what you intend to do.  Will you be producing video lessons?  A textbook of some kind?  An interactive tutorial, with a credential at the end (extra credit: credential offered via Prism)?  Will you offer in-person classes?  Online classes?  Will you produce lesson plans?  How will you evaluate students? How do we know Milkomeda is going anywhere, too?  Why should developers care? What is your timeline?  How will you, and we, know if you have achieved what you set out to do?\r\nIt's possible to read this proposal as:  \"Trust us, we're good,\" and I think most readers won't be as impressed by your credentials and track record as much as by a great outline of what you intend to do.  Don't get me wrong.  The credentials are useful, too.  You just have to put them in later, as a way of convincing us you can execute.\" \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 10, "ng": 7, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I have read many proposals of this team.
