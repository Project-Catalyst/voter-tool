I understand that in 3 month you are able to present a v0 version and then you have to update it especially for the UI. The challenge specifically say that after 3 months it is the final version. So after 3 months you should have a version that is nearly finish and fewer modifications. Also if the UI is not finish it will be hard to promote the Dapp after 3 months\r\nThe budget seems sufficient and well describe.
