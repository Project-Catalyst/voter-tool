Hiring a person with the necessary skills to build a blockchain related webapp from the scratch is the best choice for the future of this project.\r\n\r\nThe proposal itself reads very poorly. It needs more editing so that it can be assessed properly given its direction. Perhaps reworking it and submitting it at the later stages will work.\r\n\r\nThe plan doesn't describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal (human resources, stationary, devices etc.).\r\n\r\nIf the project timeline overlaps between different Fund Campaigns the budget should be split accordingly.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer should take into consideration the possible challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation of the project.
