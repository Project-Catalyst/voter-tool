Hence, can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research and university education in programming but not personal professional experience in the field of IT, hence this part of my assesments in this categeory will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done in mind. The proposal identifies an interesting approach to the challenge in ist problem statement and manages to articulate a solution that not just adds value to the Cardano ecosystem but also beyond.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align well with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nScalability should not be an issue in this type of proposal.

Idea is to be easy to embed into websites. Proposal fits the challenge it's in. There are such tools out there already, but the more the better. Accepting payments is a prety basic necessity so I don't doubt the value this project will bring. Key metrics are right on the spot. Succinct but very accurate. Userbase and the adoption should always be the top priority, and in here, they are.  I don't see anything missing in this proposal, and it's plain to see the team is full of professionals.

IMHO this brings credability to the project in the eyes of the voters. The team members are already known, which is a big advantage compared to a lot of other proposals whish have no teams assembled. The budget is clear and broken down into identifiable items. It's reasonable if not underpayed. As a developer myself I can guarantee the timetable to complete the work is reasonable. There's a staightforward yet a sensible plan for implementation that shows easy steps to follow along.   One thing I was missing is described possible challenges to market and spread the knowlege to your peers and some mention of competition would be nice as well.  Overall I believe the project is feasible and can be implemented by the team mentioned.

There's a clear roadmap with simple milestones with a sensible timeframe for implementation.  The problem is clearly stated and the proposed solution is succinct but clear on the end result.
