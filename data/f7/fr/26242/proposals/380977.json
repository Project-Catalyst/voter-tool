Brazil is a huge country so having a communication strategy that could count with multiples ways and channels of reaching people is essential.\r\n\r\nIt would be also nice to see who is/are their target audience and how many people they want to reach and engage, to assess its full impact. I'd defintely include as one target audience low income students. Its essential in every project that involved LATAM to try to include marginalized tech groups as much as possible so these people have more tools or ways to have a better life in the future and cardano can also be seens as powerful transformational criptocurrency.

Through workshops, translated materials, a mentorship program, and a stakepool for sustained funding, the proposers have ambitious goals for this proposal. I believe that this proposal will answer some of the questions in the challenge because of the proposers' commitment to bringing in new cardano members in latin american countries. Having these groups in place to guide new members and lay a groundwork for future development is crucial in the latin american countries because they currently do not have as much support. Once the foundational support is in place, then more individuals and organizations can get involved with the cardano community, which is exactly the goal of this challenge.\r\n\r\nMy only comment is in regards to clarifying the many different groups mentioned in the proposal. I am not familiar with all of the acronyms of some groups (such as DALE), so if the proposers could clarify the groups' full titles, it would be helpful for average voters to understand what groups the proposal is referring to. I would also give a brief description for some of the groups since most voters will not be familiar with the many groups mentioned in the proposal.
