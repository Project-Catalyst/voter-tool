En effet, il y a un manque de cours sur ce sujet en portugais, pour les \u00e9tudiants br\u00e9siliens, et le syllabus semble tr\u00e8s robuste. Il est bien d\u00e9fini dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me et la solution propos\u00e9e est raisonnable, s'inscrivant dans le d\u00e9fi.\r\nQuelques points de questions/\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer :\r\n1) J'ai compris que ce cours sera enti\u00e8rement en ligne. C'est une bonne chose car il a une plus grande port\u00e9e. Cependant, s'il se d\u00e9roulait en personne, une communaut\u00e9/un r\u00e9seau br\u00e9silien plus fort pourrait \u00eatre construit entre le professeur et les \u00e9tudiants. J'envisagerais d'avoir au moins quelques sessions en ligne. A propos, il pourrait \u00eatre plus clair s'il y aura plus d'une session par an ou si ce sera une seule.\r\n2) J'ai aim\u00e9 que ce cours soit gratuit pour les \u00e9tudiants. Cela rend la proposition beaucoup plus inclusive ! Cependant, aucun crit\u00e8re de s\u00e9lection n'est indiqu\u00e9 ici (si ce sera par qualification, revenu total de la famille, etc). Quoi qu'il en soit, je consacrerais au moins quelques cr\u00e9neaux aux \u00e9tudiants pauvres et \u00e0 faible revenu, en particulier dans les r\u00e9gions des favelas. Cela serait en accord avec les OMD #04 et 10 des Nations Unies qui sont aujourd'hui tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s dans les projets et les organisations pour aider \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les in\u00e9galit\u00e9s.\r\n3) Je souhaiterais \u00e9galement d\u00e9velopper davantage le plan de communication dans la proposition. Si l'intention est de faire conna\u00eetre la blockchain \u00e0 ceux qui ne la connaissent pas, un plan de communication pour atteindre les gens en dehors de ce monde est tr\u00e8s important. J'inclurais dans le plan des campagnes dans les universit\u00e9s, les \u00e9coles et je proposerais cela aux entreprises.

The proposal seems to fit in the challenge, making Brazilian students, which are very creative, aware of Cardano. However, I have some points to add: 1) I've seen that you are a professor in UFPE. Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation. Therefore, if it is overpriced you won't have a great number of people attending it; 3) I imagine that, in order to keep this project going, you will charge for these classes and make it running, however I would like to see it more explicit;", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is well written and I have no doubt that a Professor with such curriculum willing to pass this knowledge beyond will be capable of conducting this proposal.

The perfect vessel to further the word of Cardano. Initially I had questions regarding how will this proposer acquire the materials on Cardano for it seems the proposer is quite new to the community. Sure enough though, the LATAM Cardano community came in numbers to support the proposer with all the materials they needed. These interactions are recorded in the comments section.

The 3 (three) month timetable to implement this proposal is clear and has an adjoining detailed action plan that further ensures confidence all goals set by the proposer will be achieve.

There is a link from LinkedIn which gives us additional security or not security in the ability to implement this great idea. The knowledge, skills and knowledge of Cardano blockachain do not stand out on both links that are placed in the proposal. Perhaps the lecturer himself will learn through the lecture what is the best school for both the one who teaches and the one who listens to the lecture. The budget is clearly presented but in my opinion $2500 per presentation with preparation of the presentation is unreasonable. These are too high costs per presentation. The plan is well developed but no risks are covered or mentioned. What if students do not come to the lecture or a small number come or the lecturer does not have the necessary skills to deliver the knowledge? One-month lectures are the perfect time frame for the realization of this idea because the lecturer has plenty of time to organize and prepare.
