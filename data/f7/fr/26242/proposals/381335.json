The proposal manages to present an ingenious business model, one that combines a social component in order to respond to the large population of people who live in starvation conditions, with a \"reverse bidding\" model executed through smart contracts in the Cardano blockchain. Just for this approach, I must commend you. Even though this is an ambitious project, I believe it was well-planned, given that the goal of the initial phase was to build and test a \"Proof of Concept\", so I believe the goal of the proposal relates directly to the challenge. Finally I would like to point out another positive aspect of the document, since it is made clear and explicit what is expected of the company in terms of expansion, as well as what features will be added by that time. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": " Here again I would like to congratulate the team for presenting all the information that was required for the community to assess the feasibility of the project in a thorough and accurate manner. There is a very good description of the skills and experience of the core team members, along with links to their LinkedIn profiles. An great description of the people and resources required for the successful implementation. A budget that is broken down into clear line items based on the resources previously discussed. I believe the values assigned are appropriate. The proposal is missing an aspect that I think is not minor: the legal considerations of the implementation of smart contracts in the industry in question. It would have been interesting to learn about the team's approach from that perspective. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team presents a roadmap designed in sprints with clearly defined phases. Although it is an ambitious project, from the reading of the proposal it is possible to understand what will happen at what time, which I find very positive. Even though there is no section in the proposal intended to define success metrics, however, one can determine from reading the proposal what the criteria for success are. As a recommendation for the team, I would focus on improving the definition of the success metrics. This is because these are the ones that connect the team's vision with the strategy of your project. As an example, instead of describing it as a \"Software adaptation for the agriculture sector\", I would recommend the team to describe it as \"the first test transaction was conducted with the MVP of the software adaptation with a farmer and his suppliers.\". As a result, the community is less likely to doubt how to measure the success of the proposal.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 9, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge by integrating cardano into the agriculture system in Brazil. In doing so, the proposers bring in new members to the cardano community both by using the interface and also by introducing people to the cardano ecosystem. If more people are aware about the benefits of this project and cardano as a blockchain, then they will be more apt to adopt cardano into their own lives, which will help cardano grow in latin america. This proposal will improve the lives of people in Brazil through the fee collection and distribution through NGOs. Should it be successful, this marketplace model can also be applied in other regions around latin america and around the world to improve countless lives in the future. For example, I can see the waste management being a useful application in many countries, especially first world countries, such as the United States, who have a reputation for being very wasteful when it comes to food resources (score given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience provided, I believe that the proposers have enough background knowledge in the field to successfully implement this proposal. Combined, they have the skills across many different fields to pull off this project.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think that this proposal will be successful. The plan outlined has a solid roadmap with reasonable goals that can be attained in the given timeframe. The budget seems pretty high, but reasonable because of the work that will be put in by the proposers. The proposers clearly outlined the roles in the project and their future intentions to continue developing the program beyond this funding round, which leads me to believe that they are committed to developing this program to benefit all of latin america. \r\n\r\nOne concern that I have is that the infrastructure might not be in place to successfully implement such a program. Only about 80% of the Brazilian population has access to the internet, and I would think that a big portion of those without internet access would also be in the group that is not receiving enough food. I know that the interface does not necessarily interact directly with the individuals who will be helped by the NGOs, but the infrastructure issue is just something to think about. How will farmers use this network if they do not have internet access? What other infrastructure requirements must be met to implement this project? If the proposers could address this concern, it would strengthen the proposal. (score given: 4)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers provided some information to audit the success of the proposal. Their roadmap will allow the cardano community to follow the success of the project throughout its course. The proposers also mentioned that they aim to have 5-10 farms involved in the program by the end of the roadmap, but beyond that, I do not see any other key performance indicators. \r\n\r\nIf the proposers could include some other indicators of success, such as the number of users, the number of suppliers, the amount of money gathered in fees sent to NGOs, etc, it would greatly strengthen the proposal's auditability. Additionally, if the proposers could elaborate on often they will update the community and what means of communication they will use, it will give voters more confidence in the proposal (score given: 2)", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_310", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 6, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "A project that stands out, explains and solves farmers' problems with Cardano will be important and worthy of funding.
