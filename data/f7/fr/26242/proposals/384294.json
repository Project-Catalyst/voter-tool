Il serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique que les promoteurs expliquent en d\u00e9tail ce qu'est un bootcamp, je ne connaissais pas le concept avant et j'ai d\u00fb faire des recherches, mais c'\u00e9tait toujours un peu confus. En th\u00e9orie, c'est une tr\u00e8s bonne chose, car cela profiterait \u00e0 3 sujets tr\u00e8s importants : 1) la cr\u00e9ation d'opportunit\u00e9s d'emploi pour les femmes d'Am\u00e9rique latine, ce qui r\u00e9pond directement aux objectifs du d\u00e9fi. 2) de nouvelles personnes avec lesquelles travailler et diffuser l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano. 3) aiderait \u00e0 combler le manque de femmes dans l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me, ce qui est facilement perceptible. Cependant, certains d\u00e9tails laissent \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer dans cette proposition. Les promoteurs promettent certaines choses mais n'expliquent pas vraiment ce qu'elles seraient. Par exemple, de quel pays ces femmes seraient-elles originaires ? Dans quelle langue ces enseignements seraient-ils dispens\u00e9s ? Comment se d\u00e9roulerait le processus de s\u00e9lection ? Le cours serait-il enti\u00e8rement gratuit ? Qui serait cette sp\u00e9cialiste en psychologie, et comment accompagnerait-elle les 30 femmes s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es ? Comment ce soutien communautaire se ferait-il ? \u00c0 mon avis, certaines questions tr\u00e8s importantes sont laiss\u00e9es en suspens, ce qui nuit \u00e0 notre compr\u00e9hension et \u00e0 notre confiance dans l'impact du projet.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Les soumissionnaires sont un couple qui a quelques informations importantes sur son identit\u00e9.

Cependant, ce projet n\u00e9cessite l'implication d'une s\u00e9rie d'autres professionnels. Bien qu'ils aient affirm\u00e9 qu'ils s'associeraient avec l'ONG Laboratoria, nous ne savons pas qui de l'ONG travaillerait sur le projet et dans quels r\u00f4les. Serait-il n\u00e9cessaire pour nous d'avoir plus de certitude, par exemple, y aurait-il des personnes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es dans l'enseignement ici ? Qui serait le psychologue, qui s'occuperait du marketing, de la conception ? Une meilleure compr\u00e9hension des autres participants serait n\u00e9cessaire, selon les partisans. Aucune feuille de route n'est donn\u00e9e, donc nous ne savons pas combien de temps ce projet serait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9, \u00e0 travers quelles phases, combien de temps chaque chose prendrait, dans quel ordre elles se produiraient et pourquoi, etc etc. Il n'est pas possible d'avoir un aper\u00e7u du processus. Et \u00e0 propos du financement : c'est un montant tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9, 70k pour enseigner \u00e0 30 femmes ! Bien qu'il y ait une explication sur la fa\u00e7on dont cet argent serait utilis\u00e9, elle est tr\u00e8s superficielle. Par exemple : 5k pour faire de la publicit\u00e9 pour le bootcamp. Pourquoi cette valeur ? Et comment cette annonce serait-elle faite ? Encore 5k pour l'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9. Encore une fois : pourquoi une telle somme ? De quel genre de s\u00e9lection s'agit-il et pourquoi faut-il y consacrer autant d'argent ? De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, les autres sujets auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre mieux d\u00e9taill\u00e9s.

I believe this is relevant for the community because diversity in any organization promotes factors such as creativity, better decision making, flexibility, respect, and improved brand image. From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates. Will they become part of the educational staff in the future? Mentoring could also be provided for the development of future proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal does a great job describing the characteristics of the two leaders of the project. Daniel and Maria manage to combine skills and experiences that combined with a partner like LABORATORIA, make a very strong team. For this project it is essential to have a deep knowledge of Haskell or Plutus, which from what I understand will be the mentors they are planning to hire. So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate. As a result, it would have been beneficial if the team had included in the proposal actions to reduce or counteract this risk.  \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With regard to auditability, the team has provided a successful description. There is a roadmap in 5 phases, which I consider to be well explained, and enables the community to understand what will happen at each stage of the implementation process.
