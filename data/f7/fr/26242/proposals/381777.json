De cette fa\u00e7on, l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me en tirerait certainement un grand profit, car il pourrait compter sur plusieurs nouveaux membres comp\u00e9tents (nous savons que le Br\u00e9sil est la plus grande puissance sud-am\u00e9ricaine et qu'il y a beaucoup \u00e0 faire l\u00e0-bas, mais ce qui manque, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment cela, un enseignement appropri\u00e9). Et aussi, \u00e9videmment, le pays, car il pourrait g\u00e9n\u00e9rer beaucoup d'offres d'emploi pour plusieurs professionnels qui souffrent de la crise financi\u00e8re du pays, qui s'est intensifi\u00e9e surtout apr\u00e8s la pand\u00e9mie - plusieurs professionnels qualifi\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s et ont beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 trouver des opportunit\u00e9s. Il est tr\u00e8s positif de voir comment l'auteur d\u00e9termine exactement qui serait le public cible du projet, ce qui d\u00e9montre un sens tr\u00e8s important de la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il sait ce qu'il va faire et pour qui il va le faire, cela g\u00e9n\u00e8re une ligne directrice essentielle, que je commenterai mieux dans les prochains sujets. Il d\u00e9crit \u00e9galement certains sujets qui seront abord\u00e9s dans le cours, afin que nous ayons un aper\u00e7u exact de ce qui sera travaill\u00e9 ici. Il d\u00e9termine \u00e9galement la dur\u00e9e totale du cours, ce qui nous donne une bonne id\u00e9e du temps dont nous disposons. Et le plus important, c'est que le cours serait gratuit, c'est-\u00e0-dire que nous pourrions tous y participer, ce qui fait tomber les barri\u00e8res sociales et profite pleinement \u00e0 la situation en Am\u00e9rique latine. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, je ne pense pas avoir \u00e0 critiquer l'impact de la proposition, c'est quelque chose qui r\u00e9pond parfaitement \u00e0 ce que nous recherchons dans ce d\u00e9fi.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "En parlant d'\u00e9quipes, je crois que l'ensemble du projet serait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par une seule personne. J'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 cette id\u00e9e, mais je pense que ce serait mieux si nous avions un groupe. L'auteur, qui donnerait le cours, est sans doute tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9tent, puisqu'il est docteur en physique, professeur dans une universit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Br\u00e9sil, etc. Mais il serait int\u00e9ressant de mieux comprendre la relation directe entre lui et la blockchain Cardano. Comment a-t-il d\u00e9couvert le projet ? Depuis combien de temps fait-il partie de la communaut\u00e9 ? Que d\u00e9veloppe-t-il exactement ici ? J'aimerais que ces doutes soient lev\u00e9s. Je pense qu'il serait important d'engager deux professionnels ici : un designer, pour pr\u00e9parer le contenu visuel du cours et aussi les pi\u00e8ces graphiques promotionnelles, et quelqu'un du marketing, afin de tisser des strat\u00e9gies de communication qui permettraient au cours d'avoir un large public. En ce qui concerne le sc\u00e9nario, cette partie est parfaite. L'auteur divise les activit\u00e9s en fonction de chaque mois, de 1 \u00e0 6, et chaque mois est bien expliqu\u00e9 dans les sujets. Ce qui se passerait et qui commande quoi, de sorte que nous comprenons parfaitement le processus, sans laisser de vide. Les explications mensuelles sont \u00e9galement accompagn\u00e9es du co\u00fbt du licenciement de chaque mois, ce qui rend \u00e9galement le rendement budg\u00e9taire tr\u00e8s plausible. Ainsi, la seule partie qui pourrait \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9e selon moi est de clarifier le lien de l'auteur avec l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Je pense qu'il s'agit d'une proposition facilement v\u00e9rifiable, et je vais vous dire pourquoi. L'auteur nous fournit un script tr\u00e8s bien travaill\u00e9, extr\u00eamement pr\u00e9cis et plein de d\u00e9tails. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 cela, nous pouvons contr\u00f4ler exactement, chaque mois, si ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 promis est fait. Je conseille que ce soit fait par des membres de la communaut\u00e9 Cardano originaires du Br\u00e9sil ; de cette fa\u00e7on, il pourrait y avoir un dialogue direct entre la communaut\u00e9 et l'auteur, et un suivi progressif, afin de surveiller le processus et pas seulement les r\u00e9sultats. Mais, en parlant d'eux, il est important de souligner l'impact de ce cours sur la population locale. Cette partie, \u00e0 mon avis, devrait \u00eatre faite par l'auteur lui-m\u00eame. Une sorte d'enqu\u00eate de donn\u00e9es post-cours, dans laquelle il entrerait en contact direct avec certains des \u00e9tudiants, pour recevoir un retour \u00e0 la fois sur la qualit\u00e9 du cours et sur son impact sur leur vie pratique. Ces enseignements ont-ils ouvert des portes ? Si oui, lesquelles ? Les personnes impliqu\u00e9es ont-elles l'intention d'\u00eatre des membres actifs de la communaut\u00e9 Cardano, soit par le biais de Catalyst, soit en travaillant comme d\u00e9veloppeurs de blockchain sur diverses propositions ? Ce type de donn\u00e9es pourrait \u00eatre collect\u00e9 et transmis \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9.

In the detailed CV we can't find the necessary experience, skills and knowledge that the lecturer should have. The budget is clearly presented but it would be much better if it was divided differently. Maybe to require half the budget in this Catalys F7 and half in the Catalsy F8. Holding a lecture for 6 months is a challenging job and is not a safe investment. But if they had a 3-month lecture, it would be easier to follow the development of the project and influence the improvements. There is a detailed implementable plan and it is very well developed as well as details of actionable tasks and order of execution are presented. The proposal offered a timetable to complete the work but in my opinion it is not realistically presented. As I already said there could be a much better brake down budget but also a time frame from 6 months to 3 months of lectures. We can find in the proposal a clear explanation of technical aspects and technologies for implementation but there is a lack of insight into possible risks and they could be especially in online workshops.
