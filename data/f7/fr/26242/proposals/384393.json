Starting with the issue of impact, we do not know exactly what these educational materials would be. What would you talk about, specifically? What topics would be covered within the blockchain universe, in what order and why? I also didn't understand if it would be written or audiovisual materials, or even a mixture of these modalities. The link attached to this team's page can only be accessed by creating a login. It would be much better if they provided a home page so that we could understand who they are and what they do, and thus, what content would be created here, without the need to create a fixed link - I don't really know what it's about, I wouldn't like it to keep getting emails about it and so on. In other words, there is no way to properly measure the impact if we do not fully understand the heart of the matter, all we know is that the intention here would be to create educational materials for people from Latin America about the blockchain Cardano. In addition to not knowing practically anything about the materials, we do not know who the target audience would be - in which country, which age group, if they would be of school age, if they would focus on people in the technology area, if the materials would be made available for free... That is, there is a general lack of information here.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There are no data to analyze here. I will comment on what would need to be done. First, the team should have created a roadmap, a schedule based on months (or weeks, depending on the magnitude of the project), in which we could understand what activities were being developed in a progressive way, with the objective of resulting in a final product. It would be interesting for these phases to be divided into subtopics, which would be these small activities, and also for us to be informed who the professionals involved in each part of the process would be. About the team, it would be necessary to know them individually. This includes an individualized presentation of each, containing: their names, professional training areas, how they would act in this project, examples of previous work, how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem... And finally, it would be essential for us to understand so that the 50k requests in funding would be used. In other words, the team should divide the amount into different parts, for example, such value for marketing, such value for content development, and so on. Each of these parts should be explained individually as well, to justify the asking price. With that we would have good information to analyze, unfortunately there is nothing to be evaluated in this part of the project.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "We only have two pieces of information here: completion of all proposed items / number of participants. This is very abstract, unfortunately such information is not very useful for us to form a notion of auditability. The team should have included a series of metrics and KPIs to be achieved so the community would have a sense of what to monitor when it comes to bottom-line results. It would also be necessary to monitor the process, a member of the Cardano community from a country where they were going to develop the project, that is, who spoke Portuguese or Spanish, could closely monitor the development of activities. But for that, it would be necessary for us to know what activities we are talking about. In other words, once again there is no way to evaluate information that is missing, I suggest that this team reformulate its proposal, including all the information I mentioned.
