Therefore, I feel like this proposal could do much better in a challenge aimed at Scaling up community informational hubs and even merging with existing projects in those challenges.

", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal holds good auditable factors like a roadmap, funding breakdown and KPI to measure progress. But there is somewhat of a contradiction in this proposal that I have not found a clear answer to. I will explain this intuition here in my rationale: There is stated that the people in power don't want change because of threats to individual status of power. Yet it is also stated that a relationship based on monetary incentive would not go far. However, if people in power can improve economic status and create opportunity, that generates more power. So this argument is a paradox. Furthermore, the problem solution appears to be part of the problem statement. Reformatting this could improve the proposal's readability.

However, I do not think that this is really an issue since Cardano has set one of the biggest deals in history with Ethiopian government, primally with the minister of education, to put every primary student on the blockchain. That said, I really think that awareness is not the case.\r\n\r\nIf the case is the implementation of ADA as an official currency of the country, maybe creating discussions about this subject may help, however the politicians might be waiting those projects that are being carried out to be more mature and have a second look over the blockchain.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I do not think that the problem stated is well defined and the scope could be rethink.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As I've said, I think the scope should be changed in order to aggregate more value to this proposal. Since there must have lots of discussion amongst the political class (since the deals that have been being closed), I think the discussion presented should have a more economical approach.\r\n\r\nThat said, maybe adding some economy's specialist would be great and he, as a lobbyist, could make the point of adoption of ADA countrywide.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I'm missing a more detailed roadmap and budget, since you are asking for USS 30K (40% of the fund), it seems necessary to pay more attention in these expenses.\r\n\r\nWhen the proposal says that it aims to 'engage civic and political organization leaders' in some months, this is not quite certain. It depends on a enormous amount of variables and shouldn't be exposed here like an assurance.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The KPI are superficial here, some of them having no deadline or more explanation in the timetable. Another thing that I'm missing and it should be added is actual numbers (e.g. We aim to have 3 discussions with officials about having ADA as an official currency by the end of April).\r\n\r\nOther point that could be improved is the description of the costs, since it's a good amount of this challenge that is being requested.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 7, "ng": 16, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal brings a problem that can be addressed in this challenge, however, it's built upon statements without any backup. That is, even though they might be somewhat true, they might also not be accurate. It's recommended that proposers sustain their statements with more external evidences or relevant data. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the solution to the problem is actually another problem, at least in the way it's written. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the proposal could be improved significantly by adding a more objective rational and connecting better the solution with the problem.

However, as the own proposal states, the acceptance in the political level is a huge challenge.

In addition, one of the ultimate goals of this proposal is to have \"DAO legislation 12+ months\"\r\nBut this is unrealistic in an environment with very low acceptance to the blockchain technology.

Within the lobbying challenge, I believe it might also be interesting in a future iteration of this proposal to not only visualize lobbying for Ethiopia, but rather take advantage of the African Union's headquarters in Addis Ababa to set up a lobbying effort which could, from that geographical vantage point, engage with all AU member nations, both at a bilateral and multilateral level.

However, as stated in the previous section, to be auditable the budget for this specific instance should be broken down further, perhaps so as to for example match the proposed KPIs and give a more concrete timeline idea so as to distribute funds accordingly as these goals are attained progressively. For instance, the discussions (with their required budget) could be set at one-month intervals, while the draft legislation is being prepared (with its own specific budget requirements), which could then be a further deliverable, as a basis for engagement with politicians at the national or international level, if the draft were to be made applicable to multiple African countries.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_787", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses lobbying from an important perspective--bottom up.
