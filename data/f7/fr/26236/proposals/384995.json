And, like in the universe, creativity, innovation and ideas abound all around us.  But wait: nobody says good ideas, winner ideas.  This kind of ideas live in a mix of supergood, good, regular, bad and very bad ideas.  However, it's the duty of any organization that wants to survive and evolve in something more special,  find the way of hunt those good ideas in a ocean of ideas (and other skill hunters) while reduce its risk of selecting bad ideas (money, human and technical  effort, the process itself is exhausting).  \r\n\r\nSo, with that general scheme in mind, the proposal is focused on the reduction of risk by bad selection meanwhile puts the Cardano's treasury in position of \"ride the winners\".  \r\n\r\nI hope the voter does not be an anti-free market or anti-capitalism because, in its core, that's the basis of this proposal and, let me say it: It's absolutely neccesary explore this kind of alternatives.  Someone has to put herself or himself in the grill and these guys want to make the job. \r\n\r\nThe basics of the logic behind the proposal and its exhuberant terminology are the following:  \r\n\r\n-  They want to create a market for the projects requesting funds.  A market leaving inside the Cardano ecosystem, a market in which participants are the Cardano community.  Proposers of the projects and potential investor in those projects will be members of the Cardano community.\r\n\r\n-  The projects selected (guinea pigs of the experiment) will receive 20% upfront of the total funding requested  (20% drawn down from the proposals budget) .  The remaining, they expect will be financed by mr. Market and its dinamics.\r\n\r\n-In exchange of their investment, the investors will receive tokens equivalent to the amount of the investment (in the same way of an investor receive stocks in a company).  \r\n  \r\n-  Each penny investing in the mini projects will be backed for the budget of the proposal, in this way they backed  the value of the investors tokens. \r\n\r\n-  The proponents plan to develop a sample of 8 mini-projects, of which they expect to have 3 projects successfully fully funded (they remark that fact with total honesty).  A success rate of approximately 40% in the world of mini-unicorn hunting is close to achievable (al little bit optimistic, but come on ...).\r\n\r\nFinally, I know, there is more details and profound characteristics in the proposal machinery.  However, the market is the same animal in all the ecosystems  and here we have a proposal based on market.\r\n\r\nAnd as a market-based proposition, it is well known that risk is like energy: it does not disappear, it just transforms itself.  In the case of risk, the risk is transferred to other stakeholders.  \r\n\r\nI feel that the intention of the proposal is not the insensible and in some cases, criminal transfering of risk,  I feel the proponents search the honest and clean sharing of risk between the Cardano community and the Cardano treasury (I guess they know damn well they can go to hell if it's any other way)  while create a method to connect our community with the innovation and creativity roaming the world. And we are an excelent home for that innovation and creativity without a family.\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, the risk does not disappear, and the selection of the risk (in this case, the selection of the mini-projects) deserves its own process, its own massage room. And that, I think, is the missing piece in the puzzle of the proposal.  And of course, it's not about selecting the winning horse every time, it's about putting the odds on the side of the stakeholders (in the experiment scenario and in a future format of the experiment going forward), including the same proponents of mini-proposals.   \r\n\r\nI cited \"Testing both successful and unsuccessful funding scenarios is important, so selected proposals must have a reasonable level of uncertainty in their proposed outcomes. Safe bets in the experiment don't leverage the Catalyst treasury or require market mechanisms such as RABCs.\" \r\n\r\nTwo things have to be clear:  1.  Each project has uncertainty itself.  It's simply the nature of the things. 2. Uncertainty is a variable that is not susceptible to manipulation (selling otherwise is a sin), so the proposal's approach in that sense is wrong.  \r\n\r\nThe selection of the risk is the only way to have a decent relation with the risk.\r\n\r\nListen, even the Bowie bonds (David Bowie bonds) got a reality check.\r\n\r\nIn general,  I think this is a proposal that deserves to be tested.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Two things were dificult to find in the proposal:\r\n\r\n1.  The total amount of the funds requested:  after looking for the needle in the haystack, I found it hidden at the end of the proposal.

Links to specific information about the work of each of the members of the proposing team.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the proposal requested around 30% of the total funds of the campaign.  I would like to know if the proponents have contemplated the possibility of developing some aspects of the budget such as workshops, community management, experiment execution, in partnership with other members or teams in the community.  \r\n\r\nI think the proposal meets the requirements of a proposal whose implementation is feasible.
