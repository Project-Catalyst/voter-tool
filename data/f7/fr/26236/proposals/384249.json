Comme nous l'avons vu, le Catalyst Circle v1 a eu du mal \u00e0 mener \u00e0 bien certaines initiatives car il d\u00e9pendait du b\u00e9n\u00e9volat de certains de ses membres et aussi de membres de la communaut\u00e9. Cette proposition allouera suffisamment de fonds pour r\u00e9soudre certains des probl\u00e8mes ressentis par le Catalyst Circle, m\u00eame si son budget ne sera pas suffisant pour financer des probl\u00e8mes plus importants, comme la cr\u00e9ation d'un mod\u00e8le de r\u00e9putation pour Catalyst, mais il vaut mieux commencer petit et \u00e9voluer. L'impact de cette proposition en tant que semence pour le financement de futures initiatives de gouvernance peut \u00eatre \u00e9norme si elle est mise en \u0153uvre avec succ\u00e8s, car elle peut s'\u00e9tendre tr\u00e8s facilement si la communaut\u00e9 y voit de la valeur. Peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame que le budget de 7 000 $ par \"groupe\" est suffisant pour payer l'ex\u00e9cution de plus d'un projet, en fonction de la taille des projets.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "L'\u00e9quipe qui propose ce projet est compos\u00e9e d'un membre du Cercle Catalyst et de l'\u00e9quipe administrative. Ces deux \u00e9quipes sont tr\u00e8s engag\u00e9es et capables de mener \u00e0 bien ce projet, puisqu'elles m\u00e8nent respectivement l'initiative de gouvernance et le suivi de ce qui est fait, et elles sont les mieux plac\u00e9es pour le faire. M\u00eame s'il n'y a pas de feuille de route dans la proposition, de par sa nature, elle n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire et les \u00e9tapes du soutien financier rapide du Cercle des catalyseurs sont clairement d\u00e9taill\u00e9es et appropri\u00e9es pour atteindre les objectifs de la proposition. Le risque de ne pas trouver de bons projets pour r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s, ou de ne pas utiliser tout le budget, est bien discut\u00e9 et il est propos\u00e9 de mettre les fonds de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour de futures initiatives du Cercle, ce qui semble tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9. De plus, la proposition pr\u00e9voit un budget pour les co\u00fbts impr\u00e9vus, ce qui est important lorsque l'on tente quelque chose pour la premi\u00e8re fois, car cette initiative prendra probablement plus de temps que pr\u00e9vu. L'\u00e9quipe de proposition laisse \u00e9galement de la place pour ajuster la feuille de route et le plan en fonction de l'\u00e9volution de Catalyst, ce qui est crucial puisque la plupart des choses dans Catalyst changent constamment. Enfin, les membres de l'\u00e9quipe d'administration responsables de l'audit des propositions travaillent d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur d'autres audits et initiatives open source dans la communaut\u00e9, ce qui me fait croire que l'argent sera d\u00e9pens\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable et transparente.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Il existe un plan clair sur la fa\u00e7on d'ex\u00e9cuter la proposition, m\u00eame si une feuille de route n'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re habituelle, il est possible de comprendre comment cette proposition va \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre et puisque tout va \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9 dans un environnement open source (CC GitBook), il est tout \u00e0 fait possible pour la communaut\u00e9 de suivre ce qui est fait et de suivre les progr\u00e8s.

The problem is time.  And time is in function of the necessary (yes, necessary) hurdles to conclude: a) the proposal submitted for Rapid Funding corresponds to a real need in the community b) the proposal can effectively address that need.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal has experienced people in charge and the Catalyst Circle is a trusted body in Cardano's governance structure.  Its ideas evaluation technique (described in the proposal) is a process curated by many iterations in the Cardano Governance environment.  Potentially that technique can be a great contribution to a bigger problem:  we need an effcient methodology for discovering and processing ideas, in less time and with fewer obstacles. And of course, with less risk, because  It's not a secret that discovering truly effective ideas is a business with a low probability of success (and that fact is a reality beyond the control of humans, include the Catalyst Circle).   However, it is an unavoidable job for any organization seeking to evolve.\r\n\r\nBasically, I think the proposal says: \"let's give the guys their funding. They know what they are doing.\"  Meanwhile, how to detect, evaluate and fund ideas with real impact potential, with a minimum amount of obstacles but with the maximum possible risk reduction, yet screams for a solution.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the solution to the Rapid funding problem lies beyond the Catalyst Circle itself. Perhaps we need deeper integration of the Catalyst Circle's expertise and experience into the overall operation of proposal funding across the Catalyst Project. And perhaps endowing the Catalyst Circle with its own funds may mean alienating a body that can change for the better the way proposals are evaluated and funded across the hole Catalyst Project.  \r\n\r\nI believe that the Catalyst Circle is precisely one of the places where an efficient methodology for processing ideas can emerge.  \r\n\r\nSo, perhaps the funds are needed not to find a Rapid Funding Mechanism, they are needed for the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself, which in its transition could teach to the hole ecosystem a better way to evaluate and select proposals. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "-  In terms of funding, of course, they will be safe with them. But it seems to me that the implementation of the proposal corresponds to the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself and not precisely to the search for a Rapid  Funding Mechanism.  However, the Catalyst Circle is a governance tool in our quest for governance independence.  Therefore, the exercise of providing funding to the Circle does not deviate from the needs of the Cardano ecosystem.  We need the Catalyst Circle to evolve as a decision-making body.\r\n\r\n- As with the many other proposals submitted at F7, provide information about the proponents and their work. Likewise, external links to that information.
