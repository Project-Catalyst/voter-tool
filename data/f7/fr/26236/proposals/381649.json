A commencer par le fait qu'il s'agit de quelque chose de tr\u00e8s large. Le soumissionnaire veut cr\u00e9er un serveur discord pour discuter et avec cela r\u00e9soudre plusieurs probl\u00e8mes de Catalyst, cit\u00e9s sur un site web que nous n'avons pas pu ouvrir (un message d'erreur appara\u00eet). \u00c0 aucun moment, il n'est sp\u00e9cifiquement question de moyens plus rapides, plus efficaces et plus transparents de distribuer le tr\u00e9sor de Catalyst et de r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer les professionnels impliqu\u00e9s dans les diff\u00e9rentes activit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me, comme le souhaite le d\u00e9fi.
