L'objectif de ce d\u00e9fi est de cr\u00e9er un m\u00e9canisme alternatif et plus rapide pour Catalyst lui-m\u00eame, pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la fa\u00e7on dont les fonds sont distribu\u00e9s. L'exemple des campagnes \"GoFundMe\", dans lesquelles les fonds sont imm\u00e9diatement disponibles pour le cr\u00e9ateur de la campagne, est le plus proche de cet objectif dans cette proposition, m\u00eame si les fonds de Catalyst ne sont pas utilis\u00e9s.

Actuellement, il est seulement indiqu\u00e9 que le projet sera achev\u00e9 dans les 30 jours suivant le financement, mais sans expliquer la port\u00e9e et ce qui doit \u00eatre fait - en tenant compte du fait qu'ils ont mentionn\u00e9 que la plate-forme est d\u00e9j\u00e0 partiellement construite - il est assez difficile de croire que cela sera livr\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai mentionn\u00e9.
