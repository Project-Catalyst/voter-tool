J'ai \u00e9galement quelques doutes sur le probl\u00e8me que cette proposition tente de r\u00e9soudre, ainsi que sur la solution propos\u00e9e.  Elle sugg\u00e8re que le crowdfunding est absent de l'Afrique, or le crowdfunding \u00e0 travers l'Afrique est \u00e9tabli et se d\u00e9veloppe rapidement depuis son explosion en 2016, avec des options adoss\u00e9es \u00e0 la CTB sur la plupart des acteurs majeurs comme Thundafund.  Alors qu'une plateforme de crowdfunding ADA serait un ambassadeur bienvenu de la communaut\u00e9 Cardano/Afrique (dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle se distingue de... Project Catalyst), cette proposition visite \u00e0 peine l'id\u00e9e.  Les six premiers mois de financement sont plut\u00f4t consacr\u00e9s \u00e0 la finalisation d'un projet pilote d'\u00e9change de paires ADA/monnaie locale et \u00e0 une campagne de m\u00e9dias sociaux visant \u00e0 encourager son adoption.  Le d\u00e9ploiement et le test ult\u00e9rieurs d'une plateforme de crowdfunding devraient permettre de financer le premier projet un an apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du financement, la plupart des indicateurs cl\u00e9s de performance \u00e9tant li\u00e9s au succ\u00e8s de l'\u00e9change sous-jacent.  Cette proposition a un objectif ambitieux pour son crowdfunding :  100 projets financ\u00e9s \u00e0 hauteur de 100 millions de dollars au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e de la proposition.  Elle sugg\u00e8re un d\u00e9veloppement encore plus important \u00e0 l'avenir, en particulier pour la bourse, et l'on peut donc supposer que le crowdfunding b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera \u00e9galement de cette croissance, bien que rien d'autre ne soit mentionn\u00e9.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Cette proposition ambitieuse manque d'un certain nombre d'indicateurs cl\u00e9s qui renforceraient consid\u00e9rablement la confiance dans son ex\u00e9cution.  La port\u00e9e du projet n'est pas li\u00e9e au financement pr\u00e9vu dans son budget et aux ressources propos\u00e9es, en particulier le personnel.  Il est difficile d'imaginer l'amor\u00e7age d'un bureau de change, le d\u00e9veloppement et le lancement d'une p\u00e9pini\u00e8re de start-ups financ\u00e9es par crowdfunding, tout en atteignant les chiffres d'adoption vis\u00e9s avec une \u00e9quipe de deux personnes.  En outre, il n'y avait pas de liens sp\u00e9cifiques ou de preuves donn\u00e9es pour les qualifications de l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9veloppement et de marketing, ce qui laisse planer un doute sur leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter m\u00eame une version d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e des phases initiales du plan.  Le budget a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit clairement, mais il ne semblait pas suffisamment li\u00e9 \u00e0 une feuille de route pour fournir une voie claire pour la proposition, comme les composants \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper, les ressources en dehors de l'espace de bureau et de l'h\u00e9bergement \u00e0 obtenir, ou comment certains objectifs comme les rencontres sociales devaient \u00eatre financ\u00e9s et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s.  En outre, le processus d'\u00e9tablissement d'un \u00e9change local, m\u00eame de base, est lourd de responsabilit\u00e9s et de risques, et rien dans cette proposition ne sugg\u00e8re que ces id\u00e9es sont comprises.  En plus d'une feuille de route d\u00e9taill\u00e9e pour les 3-6 premiers mois de financement, il serait utile de voir une analyse de risque convaincante de l'\u00e9change de paires de crypto-monnaies dans la monnaie \u00e9thiopienne locale, et la stabilit\u00e9 que l'ETB d'une personne pourrait acqu\u00e9rir via une telle plate-forme.  Si cette proposition \u00e9tait r\u00e9duite \u00e0 un tel objectif, et peut-\u00eatre soumise \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration d'un dex, ce serait peut-\u00eatre une poursuite valable.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "La feuille de route fournie, une pouss\u00e9e ambitieuse dans defi sur une p\u00e9riode d'environ 3-4 ans, manque de la granularit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9valuer les \u00e9tapes r\u00e9alistes au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.  Si l'on se concentre sur les 6 premiers mois de d\u00e9veloppement, avant l'objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir une plateforme de crowdfunding, il serait souhaitable d'indiquer certaines mesures qui pourraient aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la confiance dans le projet : les utilisateurs hebdomadaires ou bihebdomadaires qui devraient \u00eatre int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au dex, les mesures d'engagement sur les m\u00e9dias sociaux, les indicateurs de ce qui ferait une r\u00e9union de d\u00e9veloppeurs r\u00e9ussie pour lancer le projet.  Il devrait y en avoir plus, mais ce serait un bon d\u00e9but.  Enfin, une feuille de route plus granulaire fournirait des dates de livraison pour les \u00e9v\u00e9nements et les ressources avec une meilleure r\u00e9solution que les fen\u00eatres actuelles de 90 \u00e0 180 jours.  Je pense qu'un projet aussi ambitieux et \u00e0 cette \u00e9chelle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierait soit d'une \u00e9quipe beaucoup plus importante, soit d'une concentration beaucoup plus faible sur les 6 premiers mois de la feuille de route.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal suggests a novel way of integrating payment systems through COTi to enable crowdfunding opportunities in Africa.
