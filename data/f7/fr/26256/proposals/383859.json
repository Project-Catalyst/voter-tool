I will elaborate on my reasoning.\r\n\r\nAs a senior developer myself, i can surely say that the AdaPay integration via plugin should be the target of this challenge settings. However, this proposal takes this challenge a step further and talks about providing an SDK which will also be used for some already in progress project by the proposer. \r\n\r\nTherefore, to me it seems this is an additional point just for the sake of supporting this SDK development. In my opinion, to have adapay integration via plugin does not require or in any sense help further with meeting the goals of this challenge. Why would we need an SDK when a simple plugin integration with ecommerce sites is the  success criterion for this challenge settings. \r\n\r\nTherefore, i am more on the direction of disagreeing with this proposal in this challenge settings. My suggestion would have been to put this in open source challenge for cardano.

However, from the budget point of view it seems that there is only one developer (the proposer) who will be working on this project (atleast this is so becasue no other details of team is presented in this proposal).\r\n\r\nThere is also written that they might have to collaborate with plutus devs  to generate smart contract generator, but it is not really mentioned in proposal, how is smart contract generator fits into AdaPay solution integration with ecommerce. It would help  a lot to a simple voter (who is not coming from tech background) if the proposal is written in a manner that is visually clear, outlining the thoughts of proposer in text clearly. \r\n\r\nThe budget outlined (in comparison to total allocation which is around 30% of total challenge budget) is on high side, when it does not even match up the success criterion of this challenge settings. e.g. \" innovative plug-in that will be integrated with our current ADA Pay system on the one hand and support all the different e-commerce software mentioned above (both shopify and woocommerce)\".  IMO there is no need of an SDK and removing that part will significantly bring down the costs to implement this proposal. There are other proposals in this challenge which fulfil exact success criterion of challenge in less budget.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, technical details such as QA (load testing, UAT), scalability metrics etc are missing.

One risk, imo is that the if the main developer for some reason is unable to contribute then who others can basically pick up the responsibility to carry on the implementation of this project ? \r\n\r\nThe positive is that proposer is open to collaborate with similar ideas, but nevertheless i feel that auditing the progress and success of this proposal requires more detailed information in terms of 3, 6, 12 months or weeks of deliverables.
