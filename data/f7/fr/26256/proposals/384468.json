La proposition aborde tr\u00e8s bien cet aspect dans son plan d\u00e9taill\u00e9 ainsi que dans l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 du probl\u00e8me et de la solution.\r\n\r\nLa conception d'une interface utilisateur/UX simple et facile \u00e0 int\u00e9grer est aussi importante que l'int\u00e9gration d'une solution bien con\u00e7ue d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part. Cela est conforme \u00e0 la strat\u00e9gie de Cardano qui lui a permis de rester dans le top 5 ou 6 des crypto-monnaies depuis sa cr\u00e9ation.\r\n\r\nLa proposition de solution mentionne \u00e9galement clairement les plateformes de commerce \u00e9lectronique qu'elle cible dans le cadre de cette solution. Pour moi, cela correspond donc tr\u00e8s bien aux param\u00e8tres du d\u00e9fi.

Pour moi, le budget des ing\u00e9nieurs JS semble plus que ce qu'il devrait \u00eatre, mais cette question peut \u00eatre gard\u00e9e pour les temps de r\u00e9vision. Dans l'ensemble, cette proposition demande plus de 40% de l'allocation budg\u00e9taire totale, et je pense que le budget est un peu trop \u00e9lev\u00e9.\r\n\r\nJ'ai \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que le langage de programmation est \u00e9crit en Java (node.js). Je pense que ce que le proposant voulait dire \u00e9tait d'avoir soit Java, soit Node.js, soit les deux, mais d'apr\u00e8s le texte, il semble qu'ils utilisent Java, qui est \u00e9galement appel\u00e9 Node.js ?\r\n\r\nDans l'ensemble, la proposition est bien \u00e9crite, mais il y a encore des am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 apporter.
