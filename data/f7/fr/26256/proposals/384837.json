En outre, non seulement l'\u00e9quipe a align\u00e9 ses mesures et objectifs cl\u00e9s sur les crit\u00e8res du d\u00e9fi, mais le probl\u00e8me qu'elle r\u00e9sout s'inscrit dans la vision plus large de Cardano, qui consiste \u00e0 fournir des cas d'utilisation transactionnels r\u00e9els pour ADA.   \r\n\r\nLe projet est \u00e9galement une exp\u00e9rience qui est \u00e9volutive dans la pratique.

En outre, certains des membres de l'\u00e9quipe sont des membres r\u00e9put\u00e9s de la communaut\u00e9 Catalyst et y contribuent depuis longtemps, ce qui t\u00e9moigne d'une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l'ensemble du processus de financement et des attentes requises pour r\u00e9ussir.\r\n\r\nCela est illustr\u00e9 par la ventilation simple et claire du budget, des solutions technologiques qui seront utilis\u00e9es et des attentes en mati\u00e8re de financement futur.

En outre, l'alignement sur les param\u00e8tres du d\u00e9fi [par exemple, le rapport entre le nombre total de tentatives de transaction et le nombre de transactions achev\u00e9es] est clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9.
