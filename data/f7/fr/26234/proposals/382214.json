Ils auraient pu nous indiquer dans quel mois chacun d'entre eux aurait lieu, leur emplacement exact, les personnes qui les pr\u00e9senteraient, leur audience estim\u00e9e, etc. On constate que les auteurs ont des partenariats solides, notamment avec le groupe AMA, qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien connu chez Catalyst pour le lancement de projets ayant un impact positif sur le continent africain. De telles connexions sont essentielles pour assurer un bon bagage et un soutien de qualit\u00e9 au projet, il est certain qu'avec cette \u00e9quipe g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les ateliers auront un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 ; cependant, j'aimerais que les auteurs aient inform\u00e9, comme je l'ai dit plus haut, ceux qui les pr\u00e9senteront.

Par exemple, d'o\u00f9 viendraient les intervenants pour justifier une telle valeur ?
