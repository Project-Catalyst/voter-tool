Il y a de nombreuses mentions concernant les retomb\u00e9es de cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement, la diffusion en direct de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement, l'utilisation d'une agence de marketing de performance, d'une \u00e9quipe d'engagement communautaire, d'un partenariat avec des m\u00e9dias r\u00e9put\u00e9s, etc. Il n'y a pas d'objectif clair de la part du proposant lui-m\u00eame sur ce que son implication dans cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement se traduira, par exemple, la couverture m\u00e9diatique, les mentions dans les m\u00e9dias, les visiteurs pr\u00e9vus sur le stand, la conversion des prospects, l'engagement dans les m\u00e9dias sociaux, etc. et comment tout cela pourrait \u00eatre li\u00e9 aux objectifs du d\u00e9fi. J'aurais aim\u00e9 vous aider \u00e0 formuler cette proposition et j'aurais souhait\u00e9 en avoir connaissance plus t\u00f4t, mais malheureusement je ne peux pas justifier mon parti pris personnel pour donner une note sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 3 \u00e9toiles. Une note de 3 \u00e9toiles peut sembler \u00e9lev\u00e9e, mais d'apr\u00e8s mon exp\u00e9rience personnelle, faire partie d'une grande exposition peut augmenter fortement la notori\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une marque, dans ce cas la marque Cardano's Gaming Ecosystem, mais vous aurez besoin de beaucoup d'outils d'engagement pour y parvenir.

Il n'y a pas non plus de plan clair sur ce qui se passera pendant la dur\u00e9e du stand, quel est leur plan d'engagement, quels mat\u00e9riels de marketing seront utilis\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9senter l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me de jeu Cardano, qui couvrira les co\u00fbts de l'engagement et du plan de marketing, etc. Bien qu'il y ait une mention du budget n\u00e9cessaire, les d\u00e9tails de l'utilisation de ce budget, pour une raison quelconque, sont plac\u00e9s dans la section des commentaires. D'apr\u00e8s les chiffres disponibles, la majorit\u00e9 du budget est consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la production du stand.

This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs. It could then act as a pilot exhibition & proposers could then come back in a future fund with 'proof' and arrange a much larger event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides a decent outline of a plan but it is not easy to understand.\r\nA simple presentation would have helped showing how activities, resources and funds  are aligned.\r\nThe $15k is not broken down so it is impossible to work out how its going to be spent.\r\nThe proposers could really help themselves by adding their LinkedIn profiles or evidence of their experience in this area.\r\n\r\ni hope the proposer takes onboard these comments in a positive light and returns with a more coherent proposal or uses the comments section or ideafest to provide clarity on the questions answered.

Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.
