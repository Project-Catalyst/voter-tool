La d\u00e9centralisation est un pilier central et tr\u00e8s important pour toute blockchain publique. M\u00eame si Cardano a une excellente distribution des producteurs de blocs par rapport \u00e0 d'autres blockchains PoS, il est important de noter que dans l'espace cryptographique, il existe de nombreux cas o\u00f9 la concurrence est nivel\u00e9e par le bas, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans ce cas, c'est le probl\u00e8me des blockchains PoS qui ont peu de validateurs (moins de 30) et dans de nombreux cas, diff\u00e9rents validateurs sont contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par la m\u00eame entit\u00e9. La d\u00e9centralisation est ce qui assure la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 la censure dans une blockchain publique, car elle rend les co\u00fbts des attaques (comme l'attaque \u00e0 51%) plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, d\u00e9courageant les cr\u00e9ateurs de blocs de s'entendre pour attaquer la blockchain. La proposition d\u00e9crit clairement et objectivement les points douloureux qui centralisent la production de blocs dans Cardano, \u00e0 savoir les grands \u00e9changes et les propri\u00e9taires de multi-pools.\r\n\r\nLa solution propos\u00e9e vise \u00e0 faciliter l'UI/UX de ceux qui d\u00e9l\u00e8guent, par le biais d'une place de march\u00e9. En tant que mod\u00e9rateur de la communaut\u00e9 Cardano, je re\u00e7ois presque quotidiennement des plaintes d'utilisateurs qui ont des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 rechercher des informations sur comment et o\u00f9 choisir un pool. Aujourd'hui, ce type d'information est trait\u00e9 manuellement dans la grande majorit\u00e9 des cas et le fait d'avoir une plateforme qui peut offrir une curation a de bonnes chances d'\u00e9galiser les chances entre les FS.\r\n\r\nLes m\u00e9triques/indicateurs/KPIs indiquent un grand impact potentiel sur l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me des FS.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Tout d'abord, Stakeboard est d\u00e9j\u00e0 un projet en plein d\u00e9veloppement et dont plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments livrables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9s avant de recevoir le financement de Catalyst, ce qui indique une \u00e9quipe fiable et productive.\r\n\r\nLes informations sur l'\u00e9quipe d\u00e9crites dans la proposition sont d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, les exp\u00e9riences d\u00e9crites et le travail d\u00e9j\u00e0 effectu\u00e9 indiquent que l'\u00e9quipe est tout \u00e0 fait capable de d\u00e9velopper ce travail.\r\n\r\nLa ventilation du budget d\u00e9crit 3 postes, mais il y a peu de d\u00e9tails sur la fa\u00e7on dont l'argent sera d\u00e9pens\u00e9. La d\u00e9finition de 5 000 $ pour \"UX\" me semble vague, ce qui compromet l'\u00e9valuation de la faisabilit\u00e9 du budget demand\u00e9. J'aimerais voir plus de d\u00e9tails indiquant la quantit\u00e9 de travail pour chaque \u00e9tape/temps requis x r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration correspondante.\r\n\r\nMalgr\u00e9 le budget demand\u00e9 vague, je pense que le montant demand\u00e9 est raisonnable compte tenu de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de 2 ing\u00e9nieurs et des livrables propos\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nLa feuille de route est tr\u00e8s bien pr\u00e9par\u00e9e, il y a de la clart\u00e9 dans le calendrier, les livrables/\u00e9tapes dans le temps.\r\n\r\nLe plan lui-m\u00eame ne pr\u00e9sente pas une grande complexit\u00e9 technique ou des obstacles, car le concept est plus ax\u00e9 sur la conservation des informations/donn\u00e9es sur un site Web.
