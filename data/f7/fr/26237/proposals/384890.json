Presumably we can infer that this person will not necessarily build the prototype, but rather \"consult\" on design, stack, etc.  I also assume that the Budget item called \"Technical Architecture\" is intended for paying that consultant, though this is not clear from the proposal.  With the benefit of doubt and given that the Budget is only for the first three months and it is clear that further fundraising and recruiting will be required beyond that, I feel more comfortable that the proposers can feasibly execute on the proposed project's first three months.
