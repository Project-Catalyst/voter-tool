Of course this project is well-needed in will have a positive impact in general.

The problem is nicely motivated by explaining the current manual process used by the Stake Pool with which one or both proposers are associated, which allocates 50% of its margin to mint a coin that is used to enable delegators to vote for which charity will receive these funds.  As someone who would like to contribute more to charity, and would love to participate with others in identifying worthy charities, but doubts the trustworthiness of existing centralized or manual processes, I think it is an excellent idea to enable more entities to support this kind of charitable giving.  The proposal would develop an SDK to enable making this process trustworthy via smart contracts. It is nice that the proposal makes clear that the SDK would be available in open source, so I think the proposal clearly fits the Challenge goals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": " The idea is nicely explained.  However, the roadmap lacks much detail, basically amounting to seeing what's out there, adopting a solution if a suitable one is found, or building in case it is not.  There are no milestones or deliverables listed.  The bulk of the budget appears to be for the proposers' research and development work.  The project appears to depend on recruiting Plutus developers to work on a solution if a suitable one is not found in open source.  In my opinion, the proposal would be better placed if some of this initial research had been done already, enabling the proposal to be more specific about what will be done (use existing or build a solution), which in turn would make it easier to provide more detailed milestones, deliverables, and more clarity around the Budget and how it will be used.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Again, there is a lack of milestones and deliverables against which progress can be monitored, and there is no mention of any periodic updates or reports that would enable people to monitor activity such as research to look for suitable solutions in open source.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This SDKs is directly meet what Cardano ecosystem needs for developing its inside governance model now and then, and it also meets the challenge brief.

For better rates, the team should provide more detailed roadmap instead of outlines of 1 month, 3 month, 6 month. This is hard to everyone to assess.
