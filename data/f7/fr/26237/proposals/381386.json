The first is an open source \"DAO solution\" (smart contracts and related software for implementing algorithmically managed DAOs) and the second is one specific DAO, which has the purpose of funding maintenance and further development of the first.  The first part is clearly within the scope of the challenge (\"tools for managing DAOs\").  The second part is less clearly consistent with the Challenge because it is a use case, not a tool.  That said, the Challenge KPIs includes \"Number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months\", which is presumably intended as an indirect way of measuring the impact of the tools.  Creating a DAO using the tools would directly contribute to that KPI.  It is also nice that the proposal explicitly states that code will be open source under Apache 2.0 license and documentation released under a Creative Commons license (I wish more proposers would make this explicit).  Overall, I think the proposal is reasonably consistent with the Challenge goals.\r\n\r\n        This proposal is one of a largish set of related proposals by the same team.  The proposers can be commended for their bold and ambitious vision, their hard work developing this vision and proposals, and their efforts to explore how a large vision can be broken into smaller pieces that are more flexible and easier to fund.  This is challenging because different parts of the vision depend on others, requiring the various proposals to consider contingencies depending on which proposals are funded.  For example, many of the proposals include contingencies to develop the DAO solution in case this proposal is not funded.  This is not an ideal situation for Voters, because they cannot consider the proposals in isolation, and the net effect will be a rather fragmented signal from Voters that may not make sense to anyone.  Overall, my opinion is that the proposers should do more towards breaking the project down into pieces and prioritizing these for voting in each fund, enabling Voters in subsequent funds to know more about what is already achieved.  For example, this one could include only the DAO solution and not the actual DAO: the latter necessarily comes after and depends on the success of the former.  Similarly (referring to other related proposals), much progress can (and arguably should) be made exploring and defining the legal framework (as envisaged in the DAO-NET proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DAO-Net/380999-48088) before implementing the DAO solution required to launch the actual DAO.  The proposers mention platforms for discussions about voting.  I would suggest looking at the \u20b3GOV: Agreements Building Platform trending idea (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/%E2%82%B3GOV-Agreements-Building-Platform/380926-48088) proposal and seeking collaboration/integration.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "      - I see the discussion around breaking large projects into multiple proposals. I have some thoughts about that, which I discuss below (duplicated across reviews from other proposals).  First, let's consider this proposal on its own.\r\n\r\n        I think this is a highly ambitious project with many risks (some of which are enumerated in the proposal, with accompanying mitigations).  The two main risks I see with this proposal is that the proposal raises many questions that are not addressed by the proposal, and that it just seems too ambitious.  Some of the questions that come to mind: 1) Regarding \"Blockchain ledgers will anonymously track membership\", it's a given that the solution will be developed on Cardano; I'm not sure if \"Blockchain ledgers\" means anything more than that.  And 2) what does \"anonymously track membership\" mean?  I assume this relates to Atala Prism integration, as envisaged in the main DAO-NET proposal, but for Voters to be able to evaluate this proposal, it would be preferable for this proposal to be more self contained and/or to more explicitly explain the connection. 3) How does one become a member? 4) How are votes \"anonymously\" tracked? 5) Why/how could a member be \"suspended\" and by whom?  6) Isn't the 44,000 for Fund 6 the number of voting wallets, NOT the number of individuals, meaning that the initial \"target market\" is overestimated. 7) Regarding, \"Theoretically a 25% market participation rate for the above tightly defined market is plausible\", well sure, but 80% is \"plausible\", as is 0.8%.  Where does 25% come from?  8) Regarding \"reduce the number of identifiable influential members as much as possible\", are the proposers concerned that, by explicitly structuring the DAO to avoid legal accountability for members (yes, I think at least some will see it this way) that they may attract some unwelcome attention to themselves (particularly in the \"use case\" part of the proposal)?  The lack of clear explanation to understand these and other issues makes me feel that the proposers have some exciting ideas to explore, but that the details of many challenging aspects of the proposal are far from being nailed down, making the ambitious timeline seem even less achievable.  The success definition envisages developing the DAO solution, launching the platform, and having 6 DAOs and 1,000 members, all within 6 months.  I think this is highly unlikely, especially in light of concerns about resources discussed below.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe following thoughts are repeated across several reviews because they apply to duplicated material in many proposals.\r\n\r\nTEAM & RESOURCES\r\n\r\n  While the \"Relevant Experience\" section lists \"Blockchain developers, Plutus pioneers, SPO operators, Community Advisors and Solutions Analysts.\" (plural of all). Given that there are only two team members, is it the case that both team members fit all of those categories, or is this summary somewhat overblown? Finally, with no disrespect whatsoever to the Lead Developer (they has achieved a lot!), I do not feel that the experience shown through the linkedIn profile, relevant GitHub repos, prior and existing companies, etc. reflects sufficient seniority or experience (both technical and leadership) to lead such a complex and ambitious project. In particular, I could find no evidence of any experience with Haskell or Plutus, beyond some repos that are virtually empty skeletons that have not been touched in months. My understanding is that Plutus Pioneers receive NFTs proving participation, and it seems that the perfect use case for them is establishing such credentials. As someone who's been through the PPP material without officially registering, I have mixed feelings about \"requiring\" such credentials (that would exclude me!). That said, I think it would be useful for proposers to provide some evidence of their experience in particularly important areas, even if not via an official NFT.\r\n\r\nBREAKING LARGE PROJECTS INTO MULTIPLE PROJECTS\r\n\r\n    IN GENERAL, I think it's fine to submit multiple related proposals, provided they are clearly identified, and dependencies and contingencies elucidated.  Generally, not all will be funded, which will signal the community's priorities.  In case of a \"success disaster\" (too many proposal being funded), I would expect proposers to prioritize appropriately and refuse funding beyond what they can reasonably and accountably achieve. (As the proposers point out, \"Project Catalyst process already has auditing requirements for achieving milestones before funds are released\", which mitigates to some degree concerns in case more proposals are successfully funded than the proposers can handle.) However, I would much prefer that the voters had the opportunity to contribute to this prioritization, especially among closely related proposals.  Therefore, I think it is highly desirable that we find ways to better organize and relate different proposals, and to avoid duplicating material across many proposals, increasing workload for everyone and fragmenting the discussion.  For example, we could require or strongly encourage proposers with multiple proposals to make some \"holistic\" representation in one place that would relate the proposals to each other, address issues such as priorities, dependencies and resources/capabilities.\r\n\r\n        IN THIS CASE, this is one of eleven proposals with a total budget of $519,800, all with the exact same two team members. As stated in the proposal, the Lead Developer will be \"required to participate in every proposal for integration purposes and have manageable workloads\". It's hard to see *anyone* being simultaneously effective across this many roles that involve technical development in challenging areas such as Plutus smart contracts.  I do not think this situation is clear enough in this large set of proposals. While the proposers have made some effort to link and relate their proposals to each other, it is far from complete, with some proposals linking to some \"related\" proposals.  A Voter can certainly review some proposals and not even be aware of many of the others by the same team, and in some cases, directly related proposals are not included under \"Related links\".  I think there should be an overarching whitepaper, roadmap, documentation of dependencies and priorities, etc. to provide Voters with a clear enough picture to inform their decisions.\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": " A set of tasks and milestones is enumerated, and some clear and measurable KPIs are established.  Unfortunately, I think the outcome is almost certainly going to be that the goals are not achieved, but that is reflected in my score for the Feasibility section.  The main reason for my lower assessment of accountability is that this proposal mentions only two other proposals as \"related\", which downplays the reality that this team has eleven proposals with a total budget of $519,800, many of which are \"related\" to this one, and many of which have contingencies for various voting outcomes.
