I agree with this commendable idea and it does fit within the challenge, however it is unclear what impact this proposal would have beyond the CryptoTrolls game that it will be based on. It is also unclear if this approach is already being taken by other blockchain games (including p2e) and if not, what have been the challenges to date? (In my research I have found there are at least several games working towards such a model). Unfortunately, no comparison is provided as to why this idea is different from these other games already within the ecosystem. Therefore, while good for this game in particular, there is nothing in the proposal to indicate it would go beyond that, therefore impact is very difficult to determine, hence the 3/5. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the plan and experience provided it is likely that this project could be implemented successfully, however there are some significant components missing that are needed to give voters confidence it can be done. For example, in months 0-3 the proposers say they are focusing on \"getting the right developers on board\" but there is no indication of who these people might be, what skills do they need, where will you be searching for these people? What criteria are you using? Given that the budget is requesting $37.5k per developer, this is important information for voters to consider.  I appreciate that the proposers are upfront and acknowledge that specific dates are difficult as development is not always a linear process, yet provide clear enough milestones and dates to give a general sense to the voter. One way to make the proposal stronger in this section would be to identify what you foresee as the biggest challenges and how would you mitigate them? Given that the key players (devs) are yet to be identified, some strategies to ensure success would give voters more confidence that you have thought about all aspects of the project. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, I find that this could be a difficult project to audit. It's unclear what opportunities would be available for oversight of the project and how this would be relayed back to the community. The proposal mentions an \"advisors council\" a couple times in the document but the structure and membership (even very high level) is omitted. While in the long run the DAO would be handed over the community and open to much more scrutiny, additional thought should be given to how these initial steps will be reviewed and what iterative process you will use to remain accountable to the community. Given the lack of clarity around this issue I neither agree nor disagree. In the future, addressing this component more explicitly will improve the overall score and strength of the proposal.

The creation and distribution of videogames will not be oblivious to the impact of a decentralized world. Therefore, it is essential for the Cardano ecosystem to study the videogame - DAO relationship. On the other hand, I find it pertinent that this relationship is studied by those who are directly involved in one of the pillars of the study to be carried out, in this case, videogames.   And the fact that those who propose to make contributions to the better understanding of an area of knowledge are already involved in that area with their own work, adds a certain dose of skin in the game that allows a better measurement of the advances that the proposal makes (the complete skin in the game takes place in the complete absorption of all the lows: financial, technical, time, reputational, etc., an act that provides the legitimate right to absorb all the highs of all kinds: financial, technical, time, reputational, etc.).  Therefore, I think the proposal has the potential to shed new light on the possibilities of the Cardano ecosystem in the video game space.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A budget of $70000 usd (15% of the total budget allocated to the \"DAOs \u2764 Cardano\") campaign may sound like a hefty figure (especially when the vast majority of the proposals submitted to F7 aspire to a figure of similar importance). However, being a proposal that will run for 12 months (there is nothing in the proposal that explicitly states otherwise), a budget of $5833 usd/month to carry out the experimental study that the proposal wants to conduct, is in my opinion a figure that makes sense. \nNote: if in fact the requested budget does not cover a 12 month run, the figure seems excessive to me.  A more detailed explanation of the budget is absolutely necessary to clarify the scope of the budget and the activities to be carried out. \n\nOn the other hand, in the Roadmap section of https://cryptrolls.io/, the proponents clearly mention the following: \"We've chosen to work with a roadmap based on phases rather than dates. We do so because in this blockchain environment, with its never ending innovative character, it's hard to put such specific time stamps on development....\" .  In the implementation of any project, such a stance adds a significant layer of uncertainty to the execution. As long as the reasons are reasonable and absolutely within the project execution framework, and as long as it is not part of habit, in the real world missed deadlines are something we have to live with.  But the dates must exist.   Therefore, this position of the team puts the implementation of the proposal at risk.\n\nI see the need for a more detailed exposition of the budget and activities recorded in the Roadmap section of the proposal.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are no KPIs to measure the success of the proposal or its performance during the implementation process.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_541", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 18, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Une DAO est un mod\u00e8le d'organisation id\u00e9al o\u00f9 les joueurs peuvent participer aux revenus et au processus d\u00e9cisionnel de son avenir.", "experience": "Gestion d'entreprise et de projet, Entrepreneuriat, Coaching, Marketing, Crowfunding"}
