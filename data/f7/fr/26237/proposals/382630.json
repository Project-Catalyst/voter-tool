This proposal exemplifies the true nature of the Challenge and Cardano writ-large. The DAO concept is a new and innovative way for social organization in a way that is participatory and incentivized by and for the many, not just the few. By creating a model DAO that will be used to support environmental and humanitarian groups recruit and fund their projects, this proposal has massive potential to bring positive change. The proposers also have laid out a simple template for how such a DAO would operate upon interest from participants, which to me shows they have thought about how such a structure could function and deliver results. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, with the plan and experience presented it is extremely likely that the proposal would be implemented successfully. The best part about this plan is that the DAO structure is not simply for one project or another but creates an opportunity for a variety of organizations and individuals to work together towards their mutual goals. By maximizing on the knowledge of the crowds, and integrating players such as (Sierra Club, Habitat for Humanity, The Nature Conservancy) this project could grow beyond what is initially ideated. There is also significant technical expertise on the team and board of directors that will oversee the development and implementation of the DAO. Not only do they have the technical expertise on the Cardano/blockchain side, they also have several members who specialize in challenging areas such as environmental law, ethics, and policy. Given these exciting pieces of information I highly confident that the plan would be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided it is likely that the project could be audited. The addition of a board of advisors provides an additional layer of oversight not common across the blockchain space. I also appreciate that the proposers explicitly state that all workshops will be recorded and uploaded to youtube while all templates will be made publicly available to the Cardano Community. Why I'm giving 4/5 and not fully marks is because I do not see opportunities for the Cardano Community itself having any participation in the oversight or auditing of the steps. Given the potential impact that this project could have, I'd like to see more community involvement. One suggestion which could help in this instance would be to select a number of Cardano Community representatives/experts to sit on the board of directors. Overall great work and looking forward to the results.

Otherwise, the core idea behind this proposal is interesting and has the potential to develop into something with great potential, but I find that for such a grand project the plan is not very detailed and I need to fill some of the gaps with my own imagination and as such I find it hard to conclude how well it addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team\u2019s experience and skills is provided through an external link, proving their capability to implement this proposal.
