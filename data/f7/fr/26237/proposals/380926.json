Je pense que cela correspond parfaitement \u00e0 l'objectif du d\u00e9fi, qui est de d\u00e9velopper des outils pour g\u00e9rer les DAO.  Je donne la note la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour l'impact parce que je pense que le d\u00e9veloppement r\u00e9ussi de ce projet peut grandement am\u00e9liorer la communaut\u00e9 Cardano, \u00e0 la fois en am\u00e9liorant le processus Catalyst, ce qui se traduit par une prise de d\u00e9cision meilleure et plus efficace, et en cr\u00e9ant des outils qui seront utiles \u00e0 davantage de projets sur Cardano.  Ce dernier avantage correspond \u00e0 l'objectif du Challenge, qui est de donner aux cr\u00e9ateurs de DAO des raisons de se tourner vers Cardano plut\u00f4t que vers d'autres plateformes.  En tant que personne pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e depuis quelques ann\u00e9es par l'\u00e9tat lamentable du discours et de la prise de d\u00e9cision, et int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par les approches technologiques visant \u00e0 les am\u00e9liorer, je pense que les avantages du d\u00e9veloppement et de l'adoption r\u00e9ussis d'outils qui am\u00e9liorent le discours et la prise de d\u00e9cision pourraient aller bien au-del\u00e0 des avantages de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Cardano, et profiter \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.  Bien entendu, ce merveilleux r\u00e9sultat contribuerait \u00e9galement \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre et adopter Cardano.  La proposition consiste \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l'interface utilisateur et l'ergonomie en s'appuyant sur les enseignements tir\u00e9s des exp\u00e9riences d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es avec la version pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.  Cela inclut la cr\u00e9ation d'applications mobiles, ce qui am\u00e9liorerait consid\u00e9rablement l'adoption.  Je me demande si les auteurs de la proposition sont familiers avec loomio.org, qui a une histoire et une \u00e9thique assez similaires, et un chevauchement significatif mais pas total en termes d'approche.  Je serais vraiment int\u00e9ress\u00e9 d'entendre les r\u00e9flexions des proposants sur la comparaison entre les deux.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "La proposition vise \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer un projet bien \u00e9tabli avec une version d\u00e9j\u00e0 existante, et provient de proposants ayant une solide exp\u00e9rience d\u00e9montrant la capacit\u00e9 des proposants \u00e0 travailler ensemble et \u00e0 faire avancer les choses.  Il n'y a aucune indication claire dans la proposition que quelqu'un dans l'\u00e9quipe a de l'exp\u00e9rience avec les contrats intelligents Cardano, Plutus, etc.  Nous pourrions consid\u00e9rer que ce n'est pas une exigence dans l'imm\u00e9diat, puisque ce travail est pr\u00e9vu dans la feuille de route pour septembre 2022.  Cela dit, je pense qu'un plan pour une int\u00e9gration \u00e9ventuelle avec les contrats intelligents Cardano peut affecter les d\u00e9cisions UI/UX, donc je sugg\u00e9rerais que cela soit au moins consid\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, en faisant appel \u00e0 quelqu'un avec l'expertise n\u00e9cessaire au cas o\u00f9 l'\u00e9quipe ne l'aurait pas.

La feuille de route n'est qu'\u00e0 un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9, avec quelques mots par trimestre.  Le point concernant le premier trimestre 2022 est en gras et mis en \u00e9vidence, mais ce que cela indique n'est pas clair.  Je pourrais l'interpr\u00e9ter comme indiquant que cette puce correspond \u00e0 l'ensemble du champ d'application du financement propos\u00e9, ce qui semble \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s coh\u00e9rent avec la ventilation des co\u00fbts (sauf que ceux-ci incluent les applications mobiles alors que la puce ne mentionne que l'\"application Web\").  Avec cette interpr\u00e9tation, il semble que les phases ult\u00e9rieures, y compris la gamification, la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation et l'int\u00e9gration de contrats intelligents, seraient hors de port\u00e9e de cette proposition, et seraient probablement couvertes par des propositions futures.  Cela att\u00e9nuerait \u00e9galement ma pr\u00e9occupation ci-dessus quant au fait qu'il n'y a aucune indication d'exp\u00e9rience ou d'expertise autour des contrats intelligents Cardano.  Cependant, cela soul\u00e8verait \u00e9galement la question de savoir si Catalyst devrait financer le travail sur un projet qui n'a pas de connexion sp\u00e9cifique \u00e0 Cardano, m\u00eame si cela est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'avenir.  Les param\u00e8tres cl\u00e9s me semblent raisonnables en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais moins clairement utiles pour rendre compte de cette proposition particuli\u00e8re.  Une des raisons est que les d\u00e9lais associ\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque mesure cl\u00e9 sont impr\u00e9cis (par exemple, \"apr\u00e8s le lancement du MVP\", qui n'est pas sp\u00e9cifiquement mentionn\u00e9 dans la feuille de route ou ailleurs, ce qui rend difficile d'\u00e9valuer quand cela pourrait \u00eatre.  D'autres mesures sont \u00e9galement associ\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9lais vagues par rapport aux futurs fonds Catalyst (quelle phase/date ?).  Cela dit, ils sont raisonnablement sp\u00e9cifiques et mesurables, et raisonnablement interpr\u00e9tables \u00e0 des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances raisonnables.  J'aimerais en savoir plus sur la fa\u00e7on dont les param\u00e8tres (exposition et int\u00e9gration) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis.
