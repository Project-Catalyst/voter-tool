DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. This proposal explains the plan of providing a tool to create DAOs, however it only explains a rough setup of a workflow how within it, DAOs are supposed to vote on things and roughly that they are created themselves by a similar mechanism. The proposer fails to explain in detail how this is related to the cardano ecosystem and does not present concrete metrics/ goals so it can't be told whether the proposal will align with the challenge if implemented.\r\nThe scalability of the proposal cannot be assessed as it lacks any detailed technical description of how the solution works.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer does not provide sufficient information about themselves and does not provide proof of their alleged qualifications.  Feedback: For future proposals, maybe consider linking some verifiable personal information about yourself or some of the work you have already done. The proposer does not seem to have a clear idea about the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. This is difficult to determine for this proposal anyways, as the solution to the targeted problem is not described in a clear manner. Especially the technical details are missing. Feedback: Try to define more clearly what you want to achieve and how you want to do it in future proposals. The budget set for this proposal does not have any justification or diversified items. Hence, it is also impossible to define whether the budget is rationable. Feedback: For future proposals, try to draft an accurate plan on what each item of your proposal will cost and rationable calculations on how you justify those costs. You need to consider that a lot of projects and teams want those funds so you should show them how exactly you are going to use them.\r\nNo timetable or milestones are provided for the proposal. This indicates the proposer has not properly thought about the different steps of enacting the proposal. Feedback: Create a detailed plan on what each aspect of the proposal needs work and time-wise and try to create milestones from it.

The propser has given examples of how the DAO is useful when an employment role or contract can be put up for voting. This is generally how most DAOs vote on any proposal in general.
