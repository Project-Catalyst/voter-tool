Not only it has a clear understanding of the challenge and its goals, but it solves its main question splendidly. The source of the problem of the challenge is isolated and clearly identified, it is the lack of auditability of some facts that are used to distort information and create fake news and scams. The solution proposed addresses this problem in a brilliant way and with an unbelievable solidity. They explain that by building Factpage not only they are creating a repository of media using verified audit trails, but they are also classifying them in terms of different qualities effectively creating a taxonomy, which in turn will add value to the Cardano ecosystem because truth about Cardano and ongoing and past events will be much easier to be established even for beginners. The key metrics used are highly aligned with the outlined challenge settings. For instance, enhancement of transparency and the construction of a repository of scam attempts are some of them. Finally, they have discussed as well, paths to achieve scalability in the future by means of reliably automating different tools that will be used, which will turn the solution to a decentralized model.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A lot of evidence of relevant skills and experience was given to support the naming of Peter Van Garderen and Dr. Hossain Maserrat to the project. The proposal describes their professional past as well as provide LinkedIn links to further explore their professional career. Also, they have estimated the type and number (just two) of team members required for the project. Moreover, the budget is well explained, broken down into identifiable items that are granular enough and the total amount asked for is reasonable. The timetable is realistic and takes into account that only the first 3 months will be sponsored by the fund resources. They are very clear in describing how each phase will develop what they have proposed. For example, they explain how they intend to construct a proof-of-fact explorer and how they intend to escalate in the future, making everything they can automated.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap traced is over the top. It has enough milestones and they all are relevant. Plus, the time horizon is pretty reasonable. Besides that, the metrics defined are strongly aligned with the goals of the challenge. For example, they set making truth easier to be established even for newcomers and transperancy being enhanced two metrics to be pursued. However, more quantifiable KPIs could have been defined such as number of scam attempts in the repository or amount of information regarding Cardano treasury.

This provides us with trust in them that they have the relevant experience. What I am missing in the proposal is the white paper they are referring to.

This would've provided more insight on the legitimacy of the technology they wish to use for their proof-of-fact.
