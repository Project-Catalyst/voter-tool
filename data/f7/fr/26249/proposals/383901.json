In addition to this, I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal identifies and adresses multiple approaches and topics which fit perfectly into the challenge and go beyond it, and they provide a powerful solution that effectively adresses the challenge. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

This proposal incorporates an environmental component that should be part of the development of nations. It is not the proposal that one can normally find in this challenge but its content makes it relevant. Without a doubt, it will be able to add value to the cardano ecosystem by turning it into an instrument or for the protection of species, the metrics could better align with the configuration of the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent accompanies the proposal with a page that contains the relevant information on their skills and experience necessary to implement the proposal. The members of the necessary team are incorporated into the proposal. It would be important to count before the financing with the support of associations that have worked in the protection of animals. This process of searching for associations for the protection of endangered species has been taken into account in the project, but without their prior endorsement there is a risk of not obtaining their support and considering this as a very interesting proposal, without success in reality. The schedule seems quite optimistic to me and the budget is clearly divided, however it is quite high for the objectives you are looking for. I wonder if these resources could help an association that is already working in the protection of animals more than a group that wants to create an instrument to help them.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal explains the technical aspects that it will develop and establishes a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for their achievement.

Although working with wildlife conservation organizations, and providing fundraising through tokens and NFTs is a great goal, the proposal might be better suited for a different challenge setting.\n\nTherefore, I cannot give the proposal a high score on impact and alignment. I believe the impact from this project could potentially be big for both wildlife preservation and the Cardano ecosystem, but proposals need to be aligned with the challenge settings so we make sure we allocate resources to the areas that is deemed important by the community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "For me to give a higher score on feasibility, I would have wished for a little more information about the proposing team. What contacts do they have with potential partner organizations, and what experience do they have with wildlife conservation work etc.\n\nThe budget seems reasonable for what they want to accomplish in the first 3 months, and it should make it possible for them to start developing their NFT platform, as well as establishing partnerships with the first organizations.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs included are well defined, and makes it possible for the community to assess how successful the project is. \n\nI think the impact for the endangered species organization is quite clear if they successfully raise >$1 million in the first 12 months. However, I wish that the team expanded on how and in what ways they expect this to benefit the wider Cardano community.\n\nI think they have made it quite clear what they want to build and when, and thus I give a good score for auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_73", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 4, "ng": 18, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal has all the hallmarks of becoming something special in the future which would add great value to the community. I do note a query about the challenge setting but feel that with the correct planning it certainly can do much good for Nation building. There are currently a number of excellent Catalyst Project funded social and environmental cause driven projects that are in progress and this proposal could easily join them. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan provided is solid without ticking every box with the key missing ingredient being the team and their credentials. Not sure why greater transparency not provided as this proposal is a potential winning formula. Very nice website that shows good production skills but no content at this stage. I do see that the plan is to build a team in the plan but this proposal would have been benefitted greatly by more emphasis on the skills of existing member(s).

I can see that a lot of time and effort has gone into the proposal to this stage and gives me confidence but it's difficult to know for sure. The budget is straightforward but again cannot be fully presented without having a team in place. I reiterate that this style of proposal has excellent potential in the Project Catalyst/Cardano  ecosystem, it could certainly contribute to nation building but I would like to see collaborations already happening so that the KPI's and budget can be seen to be reasonable metrics for auditability.
