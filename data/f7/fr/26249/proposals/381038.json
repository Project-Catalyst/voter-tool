It will allow them to bring their products market with certification that will give them pricing power.\r\n\r\nSecondly it will allow the facilitation of support for rural farmers by governmental organisations because now they will be direct evidence, on the blockchain, to show that they have market support for their product.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has presented a codepen as evidence of their experience. This is functional to an extent. The major concern here is that they have only applied for $5000. This is nowhere near enough to execute on a plan as ambitious as this.
