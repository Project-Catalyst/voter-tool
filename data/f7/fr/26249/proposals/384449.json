Also, the idea and constructs of the project seem well-designed, and I will also be available as a leader and an expert in this area to support the idea and project execution. Even so, as described before, the general assumptions have been considered as well as the notion constructs. I would suggest that for the next phases, there should be additional consideration given to data privacy, data security, and storage, as well as to all the underlying principles and concepts of regulatory compliance, quality assurance in product control, and effective monitoring mechanisms involving not only products logistics and distribution but also data transfers at different levels. Although the team's experience in developing similar solutions may be an excellent sign, it may also be useful to share the team members' experience details and overall experience in similar projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite the challenge, this proposal presents a solid understanding of why new criteria will be needed to address the challenge. It is essential that this proposal explains how it aligns with the community's goals. Several improvements can be made and a proposal can have a higher impact level and explain what is the problem to be solved and how this proposal will benefit the community. Moreover, I believe that we need to understand how to scale up the proposal to meet future challenges.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the event that the right team is able to develop this interesting application, it could have a considerable amount of success and adoption within the Cardano ecosystem. It is worthwhile to support this proposal because it helps address the challenge, is a great decentralized app idea, and is an effective way to put Cardano to work.

The experience observed is that of having developed other applications in medical aspects. Proponents are not observed to have direct knowledge of health policy, experience in pharmaceuticals, or experience in distribution of medical products or marketing.The question is: Is the experience in building other applications enough? Or is experience in marketing of pharmaceutical products required? I think the team that comes forward could be strengthened to ensure that they have the necessary skills and experience to develop an application with this content. On the other hand, the budget is adequately described and divided into identifiable elements. I believe that this project requires more research on its need and possibility of impact, since the Harvard Business Review article is not enough. On the other hand, the proposed times to develop the proposal are quite optimistic, being possible. The proposal in its technical aspects, architecture and language is well founded.
