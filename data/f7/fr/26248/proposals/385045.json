The project is very well substantiated with calculations done by specialized people.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The creators have a reliable background as climate scientists, environmental and computer engineers. They have the expertise needed for this project. They are currently actively working on this project. The proposal has enough evidence to support their project.

The budget has also been drawn up transparently and estimated realistically based on their experience.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is clear that the project wants to communicate transparently with the community.

If successful this proposal has the potential to place Cardano at the lead of the climate fight in the world. Moreover this project is absolutely aligned with the Cardano 2025 Mission and could significantly contribute to its accomplishment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The task undertaken is definitely a big challenge in itself, and so far major consortia have tackled similar challenges and discovered that the magnitude of the undertaking is difficult to conquer. From the proposal description it is clear that the proponents are aware of the difficulty and risks of the task at hand. However, given their perfect expertise and qualifications, and especially the very small budget they are requesting as of now to begin this crucial work,  I would wholeheartedly entrust them with my confidence for this high risk high reward undertaking. One thing which can mitigate the risk would be to find other external experts / dedicated groups / organizations who can evaluate the resulted methodology and eventually contribute to its further improvement. In my opinion this work is absolutely necessary, but it is only a beginning and it will take several iterations to make it into a useful tool that I anticipate will evolve along years to come. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I am quite familiar with the challenge of evaluating the success of such enormous (yet crucial) undertakings - given my mission to align Cardano 2025 goals with similar criteria. The proponents did their very best to provide KPIs and suggest evaluation metrics that are reasonable for this stage of the project, with a view of how these metrics can be used in the long run. Given the incipient stage of the project the KPIs proposed suffice even if it most probably will not be possible to evaluate all of them completely at the end of this stage.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_721", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "By Using Cardano's carbon footprint, we can make the shift to positive.
