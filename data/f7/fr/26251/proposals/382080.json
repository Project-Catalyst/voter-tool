Assuming that the proposers have the capability the proposal per se should be possible to complete with this assessment.

This fits the challenge setting and If successful the impact would be great for the ecosystem since more Dapps are needed to drive adoption. The proposal identifies a problem that's relevanat, and should be worked on for sure. It's clear how the propsal will add value to the cardano ecosystem, by including android developers without any skills in crypto start to try to write Dapps. A little disapointing, but there are no KPIs or metrics introduced in the propsal. I hope the proposers have thought about scaling their solution, because if more people start using their tooling, I'm not sure if just two developers will be able to keep up. The proposal is lacking a detailed description. This would have greatly help me to understand the technical details and architecture of the proposed SDK. As an ex-android dev myself, I'dhave been happy to help. The ecosystem is missing an android sdk implementation and has to rely on javascript implementations which are not meant to be run on android. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Fragkiskos Katsimpas has only relevant experience in iOS development, which is very different than android, but he's a consultant now and I'm willing to believe that he has android experience even though not stated in his linked in. Unfortunately I couldn't find the other proposal \"Greg\" because of the lack of information and lack of links with credentials provided. In all honesty they say that they have software engineering experience and not android specific experience. There will be two members implementing the whole SDK which is definately possible, speaking as a dev myself. The budget is another point which is a bit lacking in the proposal. The budget is stated, but no breakdown of costs or hourly rates have been provided. There is not timeline stated for the completion of the project, nor a definition of success is given. The proposal says what it's going to do, but not when will it be finished or how it will be finished which is kind of disapointing. I would recommend to the proposers to do a technical document outlinging the planned out architecture so that it's a truly open source effort. The community wants to help, you just have to let it! The plan doesn't describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal which is not a big deal by itself, but combined with the other points it is.  There is no mention of possible risks concerning the implementation, usability or anything else, and when you're writing software you need to think of the worst case scenario as I'm sure the proposers are well aware.

If there isn't an open source repository I struggle to see if the community will be able to follow along with the implementation and progress of the project. As I mentioned there are no KPIs or metrics to speak of, so skipping this point. Every proposal needs to have a roadmap at least, keep that in mind for future proposals and I can advise you to take a look at other proposals to see what's considered common information. Alongside that you can take a look at the community generated documents specifiing the criteria for a proposal.   If the proposers put themselves in the shoes of the voter and look at their proposal, I think they'd realise they don't inspire much confidence.
