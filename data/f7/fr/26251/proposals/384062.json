The impact of such a project would be great, because who doesn't want to get payed to learn. It's a really nice idea, and the proposers of the idea already have some know-how on doing things. The identified problem is valid, because right now at this stage of the cardano development there aren't enough devs who are well versed in haskel or other related programming languages and technologies. There is a clear value to this proposal, which will help the cardano ecosystem grow with more developers growing their skillset. This proposal finds a nice spot in the challeng setting, and will bring a lot of new devs to the system if completed successfully. I hope the proposers have thought of a long term way to scale, because the funding would indeed increese with the need for adoption, and a strategy for future funding would be a good idea. This is maybe one of the few things lacking in the proposal and is my suggestion and hope the authors bring some attention to this unknown. There sure are a lot of learning ideas and proposals in the ecosystem, but this is the first I've seen to offer financial incentives to help people learn.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "And it's empty right now, and I would have been glad to see a simple readme with a description of the intention of the project, just as a good will gesture. If the proposers had added linkedin profiles or some kind of credentials, it would greatly improved the credability of the project in my oppinion. There's a lack of concrete timetables and the actual budget distribution is too general. There are no answers on how will the teachers and testers be aquired (are they going to be hired later on or are there onboard already?) Do the proposers have the necessary manpower and resources to do what's stated in the proposal? These are some serios but unanswered questions which bring down the feasability of the project a bit.  I was hoping for a more clear breakdown tables of expenses and timetables to complete the planned work. This would enable supporters of the project monitor and lend a helping hand if there was a specific roadmap and plans for implementation and hiring. I see the \"what\" but I was searching for the \"how\" do they plan to make this idea a reality, and the proposal lacks a bit info in thata regard. There is some description of what resources would be necessary to bring the project to it's fruition although a bit vague at times.  My suggestion fro the proposers would be to ask themselves: \"What are the risks for our project?\" so they can prepare accordingly, because throghout the last couple of funding rounds there were a lot of stories of hurdles that almost brought the whole project down. I'd also suggest some kind of a colaboration with other educational platforms and proposals.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "One thing that left wanting is the KPIs. It would have been nice to have an expected adoption rate or expected results for a given time since the start of the project.  The roadmap and milstones are missing as well, so I struggle to see the steps that need to be taken to lead the project to it's end. There's a clear description of the targeted problem, but not the targeted solution.  The proposer should put themselves in the shoes of the voter, maybe go to the discord channel and ask what would the users want to see in a platform such as this one. This would give them great feedback and quick at that to greatly improve their proposal for the next funding rounds.
