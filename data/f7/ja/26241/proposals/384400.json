The roadmap is good and I don't contest that at all. And while it's mentioned that the game was \"tested\" and that part is complete, I saw very little if any actual information about the playtesting of the game. It begs the question: If the game is produced, how do we know it will be a fun? How do we know it will be an engaging and enticing gameplay experience that people will want to return to and spread word of? Unless some detail is shared about the playtesting process (how many people, how many hours, how much were game rules revised as a result) I'm not sure we can say the game will be good with much certainty. And if it isn't, we won't find out until after it's released. If this proposal fails, I would encourage the proposer to give us more on the playtesting process and results the next time it's up for vote.
