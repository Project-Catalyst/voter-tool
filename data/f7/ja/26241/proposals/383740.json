Their crossing game NFT using will attract players to join with their current assets from many games together, moreover, they are also aware of the paint of players and help them to solve it. Therefore, this idea will have a strong impact on Cardano gaming communities. \r\nOne more important part in this proposal can show that the team is really concerned about what challenge given is their goal and key metrics, these number is so promising for a wait. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Not only the bright vision, but the team also has a very detailed roadmap that can help CA and voters to assess the reasonability of their required budget. It's also make sense with the detailed explanation of the game materials and gameplay. \r\nIndeed, they're aware of game balancing - one of the deadly points of game development that hard to control. This awareness will help them run the game with less risk in the game economy and user flows. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provide several ways to increase the audibility of the project, all are very detailed.\r\nIncluding the detailed explanation of the game is absolutely helps us easily understand how it will affect the communities, that's also solving the named problem.

Giving the whole cNFT ecosystem a new resurgence in interest and speculation. The proposer has introduced an idea of integrating game play from a variety of different NFT projects. I have not read of any such projects or thoughts of projects like this on any of the social media platforms. Which i spend on average between 4-6hrs a day going through all new NFT projects to alt coins. What the proposer has found is that many NFT projects have dropped in value when there is no gamification behind the NFT.  Instead of trying to create a game for each project the proposer has thought to create a game to integrate many forgotten NFT's. This will bring back many NFT collectors that have been left holding the bag on empty promised art. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the proposer having gaming development experience shows a high degree of potential success. The proposer also has reached out to an NFT designer that already has run a successful cNFT mint to collaborate with and gamified the cNFT. The proposer has outlined the budget and team to align his goals with the need of the Cardano cNFT and gaming community. As much as DeFi, Dex's, and DAOs are essential to onboarding more Cardano users so is gaming and cNft's. The budget seems to be broken down to allotted hours and pay scale for developers. As long as the team that the proposer has the same vision i see this as being a successful project and be financially viable independent of Catalyst Project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has stated some lofty goals that  seem like it may over extend the team working on this project. As I have watched some cNFT,s some times not meet the timeline on the roadmaps they have created for gamification and future mints they have still gone on to grow a loyal community on twitter and discord. I have very little doubt that this team may have some setback on following there roadmap to a tee but have the necessary skills to overcome minor setbacks and complete the project with successful outcome. They have outlined several ways to audit the project through out the duration of the project, with onboarding new users and collaborating with other cNFT projects. This will be an exciting project to follow if Catalyst funds this project.

I myself had never heard of the Cross-NFT modality and I think it can be a good choice to involve players from different angles. I think the proposal is well aligned with the objectives of the challenge, because it would promote the exchange of NFT on the Cardano blockchain, which is one of the goals here. It is positive that the team already has a prototype of the game, that is, it demonstrates that they are really involved in this project, the funding would, of course, boost its execution, but they did not wait for this to happen to get their hands dirty. I really believe in this kind of team, we all need financial help, but many times the impression that is given is that the proposal was made only with the objective of getting the financing, it doesn't seem that people are really involved in the thing, which is not is the case here. On the attached website, we have a lot of information (script, team, contact and etc), as well as videos that demonstrate what this game would be, in practice. At one point in the proposal description, the proposers state that about 20 projects in addition to this one would be developed. I would like to understand this part better, what projects would these be? How would they relate to Cross-NFT Gaming? I believe the heart of the matter here is really \"joining worlds\", but this could have been even more detailed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailing here is good, but not ideal. We have enough information about individual team members both in the proposal and on the attached website. This allows us to have a lot of confidence in their work. We know what each one would do in this project and their areas of training, in addition to the fact that they had already started the project, as I also mentioned in the previous topic. The team has a script with a satisfactory level of detail, as well as the presentation of the team, present on the website and in the proposal. We know what would happen as the months passed. Because it's a complex proposal (generally the ones in this challenge are), I think it would be good if we had an even greater level of detail. But, what is provided to us is not bad either. And finally, speaking of budget, it is possible to understand why they asked for the USD 37k, basically this amount would cover the salary of the professionals involved, but some parts should have been better explained. For example, how would the project be marketed? What does \"community building\" mean? Overall, the team gives us good information to get to know them, their script and use of funding, but I think I felt a lack of depth in the script and a complete understanding of the expense part.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is very auditable. In the \"Metrics and Goals\" topic, proponents provide us with a short summary of what their main goals would be, allowing for tracking of the final results. The process can be followed through the script, which, as I said before, has an interesting level of detail that could be improved upon. An idea I had here is: this proposal asks for direct contact with users. A sort of satisfaction survey, I would say. The main objective is to cross different games and players right? So there's no better way to achieve this than by asking the target audience directly how their experience is going; this could be done by the game's own team. Such data could be brought to the rest of the community, along with information related to the topic of metrics and goals. I believe so, it is possible to follow the development of things well based on the information passed on by the team.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 11, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Although many cool technological developments happen because they are first introduced in gaming, I don't think gaming as such is a must have for Cardano to be successful. Also, the challenge itself is not too well worded. Therefore, assessing the impact/alignment is a tad difficult. The game itself looks like a cheap rip-off of Splinterlands and Cardano's current NFT capabilities pale in comparison to industry leaders like RMRK through which this type of a game could reach amazing success. Having said all that, NFT Fighters brings along a unique idea: interoperability between games. And that's worth exploring! First within Cardano, later cross-chain. If succesful, it could lure in many new community members through the backdoor of fun and games.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I happened to see prodiga's presentation in Ideafest and was blown away by his commitment to the cause. Now that I see the profiles of the rest of the team, I'm confident that the team will deliver on their promises. Looking at the website, it's obvious that this is very early stage and the team really needs the nudge that Catalyst funding can provide. The budget is realistic and the team's work effort is priced reasonably. My only concern is that since this is a multi-proposal project it might deviate the team's attention and focus. Yet the team has planne for the individual proposal to be implementable in isolation. I would strongly suggest they get this done and think about more far-reaching metaverse dreams later when the Cardano infrastructure is more developed. Or perhaps those things are better done with dedicated partners like Terra Virtua.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree that the auditability of this proposal is on a decent level. The roadmap is self-explanatory, goals reachable and the budget makes sense. The fact that the prototype exists increases confidence in the project. Challenges and risks are mainly thought through the lens of game mechanics and perhaps a bit wider approach could be taken to pinpoint what can make or break the project. Whatever the outcome might be, good luck with the project!", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 6, "ng": 14, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Cardano NFT\u7a7a\u9593\u5168\u4f53\u306e\u529b\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u305f\u30af\u30ed\u30b9NFT\u30b2\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30d7\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u3001\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3067\u7c21\u5358\u306b\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3067\u304d\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "experience": "4\u4eba\u306e\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3001\u3059\u3067\u306bGingerbread Squad NFT Project\u3068\u5171\u540c\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30a2\u30d6\u30eb\u306a\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002"}
