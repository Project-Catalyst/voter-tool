Currently, Cardano ecosystem lack of marketplace and some utility for helping game developers, and I hope that there should have some common places that game developers can come and use instead of developing by themselves - it will spend a lot of time and energy. Therefore, this idea I think will impact strongly to our ecosystem. Moreover, their success metrics also tell that the team is concerned about what challenge given.
