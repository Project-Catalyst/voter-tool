Hence, my advice to them is that they should give some more detail about features and how it works in case studies or technologies that will use for it. And the roadmap should be outlined with more detailed tasks of each field instead of just a single target. \r\nThey have good key metrics that prove that their ideas will strongly impact the Cardano ecosystem, but this is not a simple project that needs a more detailed plan with risk management. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal team provides a roadmap but is not detailed, and the budget is not broken down into detailed parts. But I think it is rather enough for auditing their progress. \r\nThe good thing is they have clear and promising KPIs and detailed features of the tool to finish. \r\nOne more good thing is their explanation of the problem and how the features of their project solve it, can help everyone easily understand for assessing their work feasible or not.

The roadmap is well estimated in my opinion, the terms seem concrete, the team is well trained and multidisciplinary in the gaming area. The budget is clear and reasonable to achieve the objectives set, however it is not divided by areas (eg DevOps, Development, Design, Marketing, ..), doing this would certainly help to better outline the costs, perhaps even dividing them by phases.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Everything is concise and to the point. The need is clear, implementation is already promising. There's enough information about the team and metrics which would help the effective tracking of their progress by the Project Catalyst community.\r\nI looked at the image of the provided game asset analytics dashboard, it's very detailed.
