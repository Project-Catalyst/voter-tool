However for this specific proposal, which is developing an MVP, it is not particularly clear what the steps involved are to achieve the MVP. The proposal really needs a plan vs budget vs deliverables vs milestones to provide confidence in feasibility. At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date. This is a simple fix for the proposer, they need to due the due diligence on feasibility and i would suggest they reach out to a project manager/mentor to help with future proposals or presentations to a VC.\nA number of people are named in the proposal but it is not clear if these are actually going to be part of the delivery team. In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month. These are sensible assuming the named resource are simply taking this as their permanent salary and they do not need to engage contract resource which could cost significantly more.\nOn the basis of what i have seen from the ideafest video only have confidence to give this 3 stars.\nThere is a note about recruiting marketing and sales people.

There's a clear way to add value to the cardano ecosystem through leveraging NFTs and the blockchain integration into the game. I love that this project has well through out KPIs and metrics.

All resources linked in the proposal are relevant and further explain details like how the future process and charity work will be done.

It is quite complete, both in terms of content and design. We have a lot of information about the project, and we can get to know it in an attractive way. Now talking about the idea itself: this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities. As a bonus, we could still meet one of Cardano's general objectives, which is to promote sustainability, through the donations made (the authors attach a link that is specifically about this, through which we can better understand this part of the donations).

The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training. The linkedin profiles were also linked, in the end of the proposal. It is also positive how they leave open the possibility of hiring freelancers for design and storytelling areas.

The money asked for funding is also explained very adequately; we know what each small fraction would correspond to for the execution of the project, even though it is a high value (60k) it is quite understandable for the many people who would work here and also the various activities that would take place.
