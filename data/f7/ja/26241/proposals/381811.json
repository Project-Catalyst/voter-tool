The team is transparent which is a great thing. The budget is clearly defined but I personally don't prefere a proponent of large sums. In my opinion, it would be better if the requested amount of $ 80,000 was halved and half of the funds were requested in this Catalyst F7 and half in the Catalyst F8. Maybe the budget is realistic for the realization of such a project. It would be good to see within the budget allocation how many hours it takes to build certain parts of the project. Detailed implementable plan is excellently presented and details of actionable tasks and order of execution also exist. Any project that has a time frame of a year is quite risky in my opinion because we never know what can happen. So I advocate shorter time frames. The proposal states a time frame of as much as 18 months, which sounds quite unrealistic for a project like this in terms of the speed of project implementation.
