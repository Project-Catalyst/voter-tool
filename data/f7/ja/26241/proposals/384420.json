This proposal clearly states how it will add value to Cardano however they did not mention on how many people does this project aims to help, explain how many people that this project aims to bring onboard Cardano and what will success metric look like (example : aiming for 100000 users within 1 year after V1.0 delivered)?

Will it be able to scale to address future challenges? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.

Their roadmap in the proposal is only the list of group activities/ features that the team plan to do without a specific timeline. \r\nMoreover, they don't even provide any budget breakdown to show which one of activity or jobs in the project will use how much money. Sadly, I really love this idea but just only assess it at low feasibility. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We can't audit this proposal because there is nothing.
