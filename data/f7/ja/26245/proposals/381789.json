I would rephrase that with \"we decided to make Littercoin a non tradable assets on exchange to not discourage its usability in businesses accepting it\" (as already explained further)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team is already familiar with the funding process and project development within Catalyst, the budget breakdown is accurate as well as the key milestones to reach along the timeline.

However, it is not as clear that this would constitute a business opportunity per see. However, it is broadly in the spirit of the SPO challenge, namely to fund proposals that in various ways innovates the use-cases of stake pools that go beyond the traditional \"mining to earn rewards\". It can showcase how Cardano as an ecosystem is different and incentivise people to enter the system for these values. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal has clear monthly plans for how it will implement its solutions. It also contains breakdown of how the funds will be used which further boost confidence that the proposers have thought about this thoroughly. Lastly, the advantages of the proposals are listed in a concise manner: onboarding non-crypto circular economy businesses to cardano, showing the power of Project catalyst in terms of innovation. The proposers are also aware of their plutus contract limitations and the difficulties of finding developers. This suggests a mature realism and makes up for the lack of LinkedIn profile links and such evidence that normally would be desirable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They provide a website link to openlittermap.org which means we have a clear way of following the progress.

The data is collected by participant and community that care about the environment. This project have been through Fund 4, and have improved their platform since. In this proposal, OpenLitterMap creates a new SPO Business model by making a Littercoin token as a mean to incentivize its participants and community for their contribution collecting litter information. This proposal is aligned with this challenge settings, and will further drive adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reading through their previous proposal in Fund 4 back in February, I can safely say that they did their promise on creating this OpenLitterMap to be an open data collecting for litter and trash pollution around the world. This time around, they're working to create the value for their token, Littercoin. There are timelines, budget allocation, and what to achieve or the goals. Although their website is up and running (with many people participating), this proposal still lack of information and details in many aspect. The timeline still lack of detail on how to achieve those goals, for example, In 6 months, what is considered as 'first Littercoin transaction' mean? Is it a transaction between 2 people who traded their Littercoin for Ada, or is it a transaction for people exchanging their Littercoin for service on selected retail store (as mentioned in the proposal)? Regarding pool delegation, do you have the right people to work on it (creating a stake pool)? How do you attract delegates if you've mentioned that the majority of people on OpenLitterMap aren't typically interested in cryptocurrency themselves? Aside from the implementation details, the team are still not clear either. Who will be working on smart-contract development, previous engineer? Or hire a new one? The budgeting details still lacking too, and it would be better if it broken down into more details rather than just a percentage of allocating the budget. I'd suggest to include details on salary, work hours, resource cost, etc, so we could understand why this proposal need USD 65,000 for their budget.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal have a roadmap, but not very clear and lack in details.
