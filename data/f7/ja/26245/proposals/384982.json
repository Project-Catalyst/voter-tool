The proposal articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for the stakeholders (how to offer SPO businesses a proven 'business in a box' programme that ensures they own commercially sustainable impactful businesses).\r\nAs a SPO I think that any Cardano SPOs sees value on this proposal.\r\nAt the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is well being specified with implementation and with revenue model, definition of success that support economic model.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer team is very well skilled about the whole context and, knows the Cardano community very well because they work as developers and there is a huge experience in business courses (https://www.50thgeneration.org/).\r\nThe scope of the solution is well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what business program will be implemented, and so on\u2026).\r\nIn my opinion (I'm 20 years experienced senior information manager on financial sectors) the budget requested is coherent with the elapsed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones, with  KPI metrics that are shown.

This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal adresses the problem of small stakepools attrcting enough people to be sustainable, a mechanism that can ultimately lead to centralisation. Helping SPOs to overcome this can be beneficial, however I feel that the proposal could be more concrete and go more into what the programme should cost or whether it's open source etc. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.
