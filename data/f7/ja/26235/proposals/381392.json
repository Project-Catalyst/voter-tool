By organising into a DAO, stakeholders can obtain a decentralised way of decision making and thus act more efficiently to potential legal threats. It would also create a way of funding legal actions. The executing faction would be stronger as it no longer relies on a single project to decide a direction, but many can cast their vote according to their stake and act as one, making legal action much more efficient. Creating a dashboard overview only adds to this efficiency. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is partially assembled. Profiles have been determined in order to attempt to complete this team.
