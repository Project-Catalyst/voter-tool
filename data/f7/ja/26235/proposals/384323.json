Researching and analysing the legal possibilities of an ISO and integrating that into a risk and opportunity radar will provide legal direction and security for anyone receiving tokens as part of an ISO. As a EU-citizen I can say that there is currently no legal framework for any of this in my country and the ruling sentiment regarding these products is one of uncertainty in terms of fiscality. These frameworks are eventually needed as cryptographic currencies (and products) gain more adoption.
