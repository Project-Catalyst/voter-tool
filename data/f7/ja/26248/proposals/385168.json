The solution statement is to create a Cardano caravan, while the detailed plan only described and ask founds for carrying out Twitter spaces to start discussing the idea and discuss also about Community Advisor role. I don't find the correlation between a caravan of Cadano for raising awareness about the ecosystem, and why It'd be important to discuss CA role for that matter in those twitter spaces, when there's other resources and tools for training CAs (like Catalyst School, community Catalyst webpage, guidelines, etc). Instead, in case of winning, I'd advise to use those twitter spaces to discuss about best practicing methods for carrying out the project, such as the routes and cities It'll visit, people who will embark upon the journey, which content will be prioritized to explain the overall Cardano ecosystem, etc.\r\nI think the proposal should be better thought out by the team before coming to Catalyst, and I don't see the need for financing Twitter spaces for that matter. I think it'd be a waste of treasury's resources, since they didn't explain practically anything about the Cardano caravan idea, only asking funds for start thinking about it.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Budget breakdown it's not well designed and explained at all. They ask for 2000 USD, and they say 500 per week. So basically they're asking 250 USD for running each \"show\" (Twitter space) to speak about CA role and voter role in Catalyst (nothing related to the solution statement about developing a Cardano caravan). 500 USD It seems quite high in my opinion for simply doing a Twitter space of a couple hours per week for simply discuss an idea. There's a lot of twitter spaces that are runned for free by Cardano community members. And also, they don't state any rationality about why they ask these amount and why it'd be reasonable that amount (so it seem a random number in my opinion).\r\nAlso, there's no KPI's or metrics for success presented, so we don't know how success/failure after this Twitter spaces will look like.\r\nRecording the twitter space sessions doesn't seem enough for bring auditability to me.\r\nAs an advice, some KPI's that come to my mind could be:\r\n- Numbers of assistants that join our Twitter spaces.\r\n- New CAs and voters onboarded (I don't see how this would help the idea of the Cardano Caravan, but since in the proposal that's the HOW they've described, it'll be good to measure if there's newcomers in those roles).\r\n- Number of interested members in running the Cardano caravan. And number of cities on where we have Cardano caravan enthusiasts.\r\n- Number of possible cities/countries the Cardano caravan will attend to.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_833", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal of 'Cardano Caravan for Advisors' is a hands-on approach that is likely to integrate online and offline community interaction, increase awareness for Cardano and be a tool for community engagement.

It's great to start small but why this? was it random or was there analysis beforehand? the reason for it should be stated in the proposal. \r\nIt would also be nice to see here if theres already some event interested in holding this trial/pilot. This previous engagement or at least interest validation (as in a letter of interest) could have have been done before also, to give more credibility to it.

(-0,5 star score)\r\nIn the same sense, it should be more clear what approach and communication strategy will be used to engage with event organizers (-1 star score).
