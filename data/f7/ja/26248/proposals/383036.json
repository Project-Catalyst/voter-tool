The proposer or proposing team failed to explain how this website would replace existing websites that connect neighbors or that are targeted to connect people in need. There is \"nextdoor\", the horrible facebook that also allows for give/take/support connections between members, there is craigslist, ebay..... basically I think this is a good cause and very interesting idea, but the proposing team should provide an objective why this specific proposal might fill a gap. There is for instance no mention of what area this proposal is targeting - maybe adding this information might make it clear, that there is no alternative at the moment. Generally, the idea is interesting, the roadmap, the budget and the provided information about the geographic area, the proposing team and the KPIs are not enough to assess feasability and general relevance of the project. The proposer should address the risks of a platform that is connecting strangers to share personal information like their address and to maybe add the option of paying in crypto - which makes any phishing or social engeneering scam very possible. How will the website prevent fraud/ scams?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer did not provide proof of prior work, references or a clear roadmap with actionable steps.

How can I confirm if the person in need of help has a real problem or is a scam?\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to achieve the results of the proposal the team needs to have more people with experience in volunteering and community management to market and carry out various activities on the website.
