However, ready-made and well-made presentations to pitch Blockchain technology will help in many instances.

The background provided about the team members makes them more than qualified for this project. Especially since this is a start-up from F6. We get a well-detailed roadmap and funding breakdown. The only thing I'm a bit worried about is the funding, this is a very lean funding amount as stated by the proposers as well but is it enough for this proposal?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We get a well-documented proposal that fills all the holes for auditability. The roadmap provides transparency on the project and together with the KPIs, we get a clear view of what the team wants to accomplish. In the roadmap, we see successes defined by the proposers that are in line with the proposal. What we don't see is some risk management, what if it takes longer to develop presentation models than expected? Or if it takes longer to search for the information needed for the presentations?

The initial focus of the project is in manufacturing industry but the approach can be scaled to other industries. The adoption of blockchain technology in traditional industries is still very minimal and in my experience as expert in manufacturing, most people don't know how the blockchain technology works hence preventing the adoption. This project provides a solution to the problem and I am very confident that it can pioneer blockchain technology adoption by the traditional companies.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members consist of mix industry experts and academic student and given the combined experience presented by its team member, it is highly likely that the project can be a huge success.
