UN SDG would also, of course, be benefitted from this extra funding. The proposal is also well structured with clear problem statement and solutions.\r\n\r\nAs further suggestions, I'd include the initial launch date planned for the final version of platform (at least the year it is intended to be made available for broader public), not just the MVP. Its hard to know by the proposal when the final desired outcome will be ready and the impact to the community would be brought. It seems theres still a lot of work to do and start with a resaarch is great.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear also how the plataform itselfwould be self sustainable in financial terms. Will it depend of funding or for a long  time ? will there be ads on it? or would it be charging small fees in the transactions? However, there's still a lot to go on until it's ready so theres time to think more critically about it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea seems really feasible.

In addition, its not an expensive project by now, as it is just in research phase. In the fututre, it can get a bit expensive but if succesfully developed, it will bring a great impact.\r\n\r\nEven if it doesnt get to DApp phase, making the paper available can benefit the community as others can try to look for a similar solutions themselves and contribute to a the final goal.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There good milestones (delivering the white and yellow paper) and fair metrics - they could have some target though.\r\nI'd try to add also some way to measure the quality/effectiveness of this papers developed, maybe by surveys, feedbacks from the community, NPS, number of (positive) mentions (possibly in ohter papers), etc.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 9, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is for funding a research project that will build a viable business model around Sustainable Development Goles (in line with UN).
