Was wondering how things are going on with them, then out of the blue this gem of an idea. This proposal definitely fits with this Challenge setting, which is to find those misfits that seek to change the world. And these guys are onto something here. Having the capability to have a physical version of an NFT is still a niche road that only a few are yet currently exploring. Exploring in terms of how or if it adds value to the NFT by having capability to have it's physical version. One avenue that would most likely benefit from this is product miniatures. BANDAI, the largest anime merchandiser is exploring blockchain and NFT this very minute. Now imagine BANDAI, made available a one-of-a-kind NFT of a skin of an anime character that is only available for one day. That NFT can also be 3-D printed to be added on to that baseline character.
