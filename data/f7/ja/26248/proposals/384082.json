The datings apps (like tinder) are global and if this problem is bases solely in the proposer local experience I'm afraid the reach of it may not be so high.\r\n\r\nOther problem stated is in the current failing to find the romantic partner and that it could be solved using AI in blockchain with many attributes. However, it's possible also to solve this using AI without blockchain support, that any existing app can implement (if they dont already do it). Whatsmore, finding a sutiable romantic partnet can be quite subjective and linking it to attributes may also not be the answer - sometimes people get well along together being so different but the talk was enough to make them like each other.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this market is really competitive (there are plenty of dating apps already) and with low ehave ADA (or create a walltet for ADA) just for using the date app, I see complex \"sign up\" process and the use of the app would be limited to those who already have ADA. I also wonder how would be the communication with people outside Cardano - because first it would be needed to explain what is a blockchain and only then present the app.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I see a limited potential of this app, with a high competition in the market.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The experience of the team is quite vague and there's no way to verify it.
