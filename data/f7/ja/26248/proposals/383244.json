But I still haven't really seen much of it for landlords and investors beyond their backing of money for the proposal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in my opinion, the proposer should expand the participants to buy tokens to individuals and organizations such as: charities, individuals who want to help the homeless or even the government to have can make a bigger impact\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The proposer has spent five years serving as a homeless shelter counselor was a great experience to implement this proposal.

Lewis carried out the project alone, without others with the right expertise in the work of the proposal to support the project in the long term.

This is an important thing because if the proposer does not have a plan for this so investors and landlords can't invest to this token because they don't know how this proposal use their money.
