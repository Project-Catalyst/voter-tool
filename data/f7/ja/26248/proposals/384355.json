Also, I know the Cardano Ecosystem and its actors pretty well by now so I am sure I can confidetly evaluate this proposal. The proposal provides a great idea that will be of great benefit Project Catalyst and to the ecosystem in general; mapping and classifying blockchain ecosystems. It will be really important to have this serious scientific backing in order to help establish Cardano and blockchain in general. It will help a lot towards future scalability for sure.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DLT360 has so far shown (with their proposal from F6 they currently govern) that they are a serious and competent project partner for catalyst. I is highly likely that they are up for the challenge.

It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.
