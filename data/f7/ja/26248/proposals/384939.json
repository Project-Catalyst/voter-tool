This is some next level thinking. The Misc Challenge is the right place for this proposal because it has so many angles and touches upon so many important topics. Therein lies the biggest weakness, too. Perhaps RAZ tries to be a little bit too many things at the same time (eCommerce platform for \"good\" products, stakeholder engagement network, due diligence tool etc). Regardless, this team is clearly going to create a multiplying positive impact via their multi-chain solutions. Eagerly following what lies ahead.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is amazingly impressive: a committed, diverse and experienced bunch of professionals who can achieve great things together. There are many features and functionalities in the current Worpdress site, perhaps even too many. I have a feeling that, if funded, quite soon this team is going to be joined by additional talent who are toing to make the UX/UI even more attractive.

The deliverables lack technical detail that communicates an understanding of the nuances of Cardano integration. The proposal and attached/related information have the tone of an early funding round, which isn't a problem in itself, but for a Catalyst proposal I would like to see more technical details related to cardano integration, because these ties to Cardano have been included to make the project more relevant to Catalyst, whereas the external information related to RAZ seems blockchain agnostic. The dashboard for Catalyst proposals will only be of value once the project is in a mature state which seems very far off. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "considering the broad scope and early stage of the project, I'm not confident in the ability of the team to achieve the stated goals. A more detailed technical roadmap, detailing the integration with Cardano and communication an understanding of the underlying technology required to achieve the blockchain related features (like proof of existence) and gamification of the platform would increase my confidence. As it is, I'm only confident that they will achieve the token sale. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The scope is very broad. The KPIs provided are far off and difficult to measure. 10k is dedicated to token minting and distribution which is not a costly procedure in itself.
