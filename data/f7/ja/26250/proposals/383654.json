Hence, can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research and university education in programming but not personal professional experience in the field of IT, hence this part of my assesments in this categeory will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done in mind.

Since this is a mini-proposal, it's not that bad however, especially considering you provide a more detailed description via a past proposal.\r\nThe resources necessary to implement the proposal are described. The only critiques in my opinion are that no plan for risks in implementation or for lack of funding are presented.
