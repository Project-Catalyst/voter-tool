Transparency would be a big step forward to gain users trust. Thinking for a solution to secure the users funds in the bot's wallet would be a better approach for a successful product.\r\n\r\nThe proposer has taken into consideration the risk regarding the Telegram API performance but is not aware about the legal constrains (how regulated is, in Ethiopia, the payment system using cryptocurrencies?).\r\n\r\nThe budget is outlined and broken down into identifiable items.
