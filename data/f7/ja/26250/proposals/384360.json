Is it really a problem that people don't know what the dyes used for their clothing are? It would have been useful to hear an explanation why this is concerning.\r\nThe solution is formulated clearly as well, but it needed to be expanded on in the detailed plan, so that we know how said NFT's would be linked to the clothing. I imagine you'd have to enter a partnership with a certain brand first of all. Then there's the question of how you would get the NFT. Maybe a QR code when buying the item? The problem then is that most people aren't involved in crypto, so they don't have a wallet. Would it not just be simpler to have this information written on a label when you buy the item? I fail to see why a complicated solution like an NFT partnership with a brand would be required here. If there is a reason, then it should have been present in the detailed plan, which is missing. Due to this and the fact that the proposal fails to specify any KPI's as well, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.
