More details about the Smart Contract building process, the testing process and the documentation building process, as well as more details about the specific tasks to be accomplished by the Plutus developers and the project integration manager, would help to connect many dots.  In other words, the credibility and feasibility of the proposal cannot rest solely on the proponents of the proposal and their credibility, knowledge, experience and active participation in the Catalyst ecosystem.
