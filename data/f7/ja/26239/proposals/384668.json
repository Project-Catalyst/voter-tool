I believe they are genuine and that the project is feasible.

It is nice that the proposers have an array of overlapping proposals that they submitted to the Catalyst Fund 7 and this one is very narrow in its focus - creating a contact point for Japanese people to report FUD via phone or LINE, etc. The team also gives an example of an ongoing scheme where the Japanese have been identified as a possible target as seen in the \"Cardano Foundation's Position on Suspicious Activities in Japan\" issued to BTCNEXT. However, one problem is that I am not convinced that the Japanese citizen who does not use online tools to report these problems will be able to find this specific line and phone number for reporting FUD/SCAM and that they will do it. Not sure about the specific impact that THIS proposal will have, despite the importance of the Japanese market. How will the Japanese people in their 40s and 50s who are not used to reporting on the web, find this number? The other aspect of the proposal:  \"actively search for FUD/SCAM twice a week, search and list them on the blacklist, and plan and implement measures to deal with them\" seems more feasible in terms of impact. However, the key step might be the next one - what to do with this information. Creating a blacklist is good, but how will the following be achieved: we aim \"to have more than 30% of SCAM/FUD/Misleading Expressions withdrawn\"? How will be this be done? I would have liked to see a better plan with more forethought about possible pitfalls and problems to be more certain of the final impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I think that the proposal is likely to be implemented successfully as it is limited in scope and the budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals. But implementation and having a desired outcome is not the same thing. Catalyst is not implementing proposals for proposals sake, the aim is to steer the ecosystem to a better place. Will it happen as a result of this proposal given the experience of the team and the plan that they laid out for themselves? As the team mentions \"To protect our members from repercussions, we operate on an anonymous basis.\" - I would have liked to see more information about these possible \"repercussions\". The proposer has not explained them, I do not see any possible \"repercussions\" that would require the anonymous nature of the team. I am not saying that there aren't any - but the proposer should have explained the need for anonimity clearly. I haven't seen sufficient information about the implementing team and its competencies that would make this project viable AND effective. The key to these projects is that they stand a reasonable chance of being effective. If they are just implemented - but the end result is not really anything material for Cardano, then it is doubtful whether we have done anything worthwhile. The proposers could have listed a few examples of specific FUD/SCAM that they aim to target - that is available now and how they intend to eliminate it through this system. The budget is limited to $1,500 and seems reasonable for a proposal of this scope. However, I have doubts about the value for the money, despite the low sum involved.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auduting this proposal should be relatively easy for a native Japanese speaker. The team proposes to (1) set up a line and phone number for reporting FUD/SCAM [this should be easily verifiable], (2) increase the number of teams and organize team chats [not sure how this will be measured without precise numbers and with the planned anonimity], and (3) actively search for FUD/SCAM twice a week, search and list them on the blacklist, and plan and implement measures to deal with them. [this will depend a lot on the team's transparency and creating traceable workflow and documentation about actions taken]. As with many proposals, it is not just the implementing of actions, but the quality of work that will be paramount and it will be up to the proposer to convince an auditor that the quality of the work has been high - as it is hard to ascertain from the side. As for myself, I've been a CA in every fund since Fund 2 and vCA since Fund 3, plus a proposer. I've been part of the ecosystem since 2017 and have even set up my own stakepool (without formally registering it) for fun and to learn how difficult/easy it is. I've been staking since the ITN and have a lot of Cardano general knowledge and experience and Catalyst insight.

By choosing a phone number you are also limiting the proposal to locals in Japan and not those that are active in the Japanese community but live abroad.
