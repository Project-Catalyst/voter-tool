Given that the provided information is correct, the team would be able to set up an online hub. The budget is broken down into hours and seems reasonable for the work to set up the page and keep it going. It is quite humble actually. I find some key information missing about a roadmap with actionable steps and maybe some prior work that the proposing team has been doing, to be able to assess the feasability of the project. I think it would have been relevant to include possible networking with similar projects to merge the ongoing efforts that the community already puts into finding out about misinformation and scams.

There are many points that leave me particularly uneasy with this proposal. First, I do not believe that attracting the publishers to the hub will be an easy task. Second, from my understanding the user experience would be a bit clumsy because publishers would disclose the title of the publication and a link to its original source. That would hinder readers' adoption. Third, it is not explained how those verifications will take place. If that depends on manual processes it will be extremely hard to escalate in the future. On the other hand, if the solution works it will naturally build a repository of scam attempts which is a key metric of the challenge. However, other metrics such as easier information about the Cardano treasury and websites expanding to include more beginner-friendly content about Cardano are not mentioned.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Not enough evidence of relevant skills and experience is provided in the proposal. The claimed experience is not backed by any other source such as a LinkedIn or GitHub profile. Also, it is mentioned that a programmer will be needed to execute the project but who will play this role is never referenced. The budget only accounts for the development of the hub, but I believe other things will also impact the costs of the proposal such as maintenance of the hub, hiring of people to help verify publications, promotion of accurate information and marketing of the hub to attract publishers and readers, for example. No timetable whatsoever is provide which is quite serious because it is a vital information. Finally, no discussion on challenges and relevant risks to a successful implementation were considered.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No roadmap or time horizon to the completion of the proposal was provided and no KPIs were explicitly defined. The only metric mentioned was the repository of scam attempts and fake debunked theories. Because of that it will be excessively hard to audit the progress and success of the proposal. Also, there are some questions without answers about the solution that makes it opaque. For instance, it is not explained how the hub will assess if an information is true or not, what identifies a cyber-attack or how they intend to scale the solution in case the number of publishers/requests of verification increases sharply.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_341", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 7, "ng": 15, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem statement for this proposal might turn out to be too vague to effectively resolve. It seems a bit more of a a general rehash of the Challenge itself. Hence, the proposed solution might find it hard to resolve such a wide-ranging problem. The proposed Information Hub would allow the verification of publishers' identities through DIDs and  reputation - which would - according to the proposal - allow the use of alerts about scam attempts, fake theories, etc. This is - as a general idea - a worthy goal. As with many practical problems, the issue might be in the details. Nowhere in the proposal do I see what is the Publishers Info Hub - a website, a webpage, an Android app, a database, etc... How detailed will it be. Which are its essential components and why? Do we have example hubs from other walks of life that will be used as a template or inspiration? Also, I would like to have seen the definition of a \"Publisher\" that the proposers are using. In the 21st century publishers of news are media houses, TV stations, radio stations, book publishers, internet portals, e-newsletters, twitter accounts, Facebook pages, even Youtubers also publish information of relevance. BTW, as the proposal suggests to start working with \"the top 10 publishers\" - it would have been easy to improve this proposal by listing them by name and also providing the rationale behind the decision. \r\nAlthough saying goes, build it and they will come - I am not sure that the proposal has really given sufficient thought to how things work in the real world and why would this wide array of publishers (and readers) be motivated to come to the Publishers Info Hub. The three incentives (I used to work in media) are not sufficient to engage a Publisher: 1. \"Publishers will be able to post article titles and links back to their websites\" (to Publishers its just extra work - not likely to attract them) 2. \"Publishers would be alerted about scam attempts, fake news, etc\" (today news sources are a dime a dozen, its the quality of news that matters). 3. \"Each publisher would have external experts (hub users \u2013 readers, other publishers) endorsing the quality of the content it produces\". [this argument does not convince me too much, seems to use some circular logic]. The incentives for readers seem to be more of partly wishful thinking, partly game plan. For example, readers already have access to a multitude of live (blockchain, crypto related) news feeds. What will set this one apart - in terms of readability and interest? People don't read databases or repositories - who will write the original and quality news? Etc...\r\nI am afraid that all this \"generality\" in the approach means that I do not view the impact of this proposal as significant. The proposal fails to convince me that the proposal will have significant impact as it may be too wide and too wishful, because it is less focused and targeted. \r\nAs regards my experience, I've been a community advisor since early Fund 2 and a veteran Community Advisor since Fund 3 and have participated as a successful proposer.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal would have benefited from providing more information about the specific skills, know-how and experience that the proposer has in building similar hubs of information .... OR ... the proposers specific skills that enable the team to build this platform. The provided information in the proposal is \"more than 20 years of experience in programming and media\" - however this seems to be on the sparse side. It is too general and effectively does not inspire confidence in the proposer's ability. It would be best to include links to projects that have been implemented, specific experience that is relevant, etc. The precise makeup of the team is not clear, while we do have the names of two proposers, it is unclear who is \"the team\"and what are their individual competencies and tasks. The proposal mentions in the cost that the budget will be used for \"Development - experienced programmer's work \u2013 50 USD per hour x 200 hours = 10'000 USD\" - yet that seems overly vague and the use of the word \"programmer\" indicates that the proposal could be much better refined to reflect the team's planned work and competencies. The budget is not outlined sufficiently clearly - as we do not see what type of \"programming work\" will be covered. Furthermore, some cost items have a price tag of 0 USD - meaning that additional funding is coming from somewhere - but we are not presented with the amount that will be covered and from where. I am unclear about the specific timetable to complete the project. It also feels as if the plan is barebones and could serve as a skeleton for a much more focused proposal in the future, if this one is not voted in by the community. I would have loved to see some more technical aspects for the Publishers Info Hub - they are lacking unfortunately. Didn't see sufficient consideration of risks that could derail implementation. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Alas, the proposal does not have a clear roadmap with milestones and I find that auditors would be vvery hard pressed to verify if certain deliverables are being provided along the way at certain times during implementation. The proposer could have easily improved the proposal by \"thinking out his implementation plan\" on paper. It would have given the team - and auditors - a roadmap for delivery with deadlines for certain deliverables. These milestones could have had been flexible, but they are missing. Also, I find that the specific framework of success - a bigger picture - is missing. The number of users, the type of positive influence that can be measured, the measurable contribution to Cardano. All of this may be due to a lack of specific focus on one or several components of the problem that needs to be tackled - in fact - the wideness of the problem statement may be difficult to address with a proposal of this size. THe team might benefit - if the proposal does not pass - from  brainstorming a wider approach (with a larger budget and team) or a narrower problem focus - that has clear KPIs, deliverables and milestones. WIthout some improvements, it will be difficult to audit the success of this proposal.

By utilizing Atala PRISM you promote the usage of the Cardano blockchain in verifying the publisher's identity and by identifying trustworthy publishers we as a community know who to trust.

It would've been beneficial to provide evidence of the relevant experience. The second thing that is missing is a clear roadmap in the proposal.
