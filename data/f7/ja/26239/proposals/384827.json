Besides that, the idea of having a single page that categorize the types of scams is really helpful for newcomers. Also, the goals of the proposal are strongly aligned with the outlined challenge settings. The proposer clearly articulates that the solution will build a repository of scam attempts, it will make easier for truth about Cardano to be established because the cyber-attacks will be debunked, and transparency will be enhanced because individuals will be able to find the necessary references in the platform.

However, there is no plan in case additional funding is required. Also, the timetable is realistic but could have been divided into more milestones. Some of the stages of the project could have been better explained in terms of how things will happen. For instance, how communities will form around identifying scams and how they intend to expand their userbase were not much explored.

One idea to enhance auditability is a periodic report, at least monthly that could be released to better follow the progress of the project. Regarding the four metrics described (two direct and two indirect) only the first seems aligned with the proposal. It is not clear from the solution how it is supposed to impact the other three metrics. Instead, some metrics that could have been defined were number of end-users of the platform, number of scam attempts exhibited on the website and a measure of trust in the Cardano environment to assess if it was eroded by any cyber-attack (maybe even compare a decline of trust from an attack before the platform was active and after it was published).
