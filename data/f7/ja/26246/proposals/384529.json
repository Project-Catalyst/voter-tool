However, when it comes to visual content, it also requires designing/editing skill to get the information across effectively, so you should probably consider that.

It would have been helpful to have some estimation of the impact such as solution could bring - i.e. how many new SPOs will be developed or how much time new SPO will save?

It could have been helpful if you mention some other community members you are collaborating with on your SPO or the SALMON pool. More information about you will be helpful as well.

One key risk is how to make it available for the community so the resource created will make the required impact. I.e. add it to SPO guide\nresources.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Also here it is straightforward as the deliverable is clear and the proposer will publish the diagram and scripts in a public forum, such as github or a Miro board.
