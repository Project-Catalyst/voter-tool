While decreasing carbon emissions for global sustainability is a worthwhile goal, that is not the focus of the \"Global Sustainable Indep. SPOs\" challenge.  This challenge is seeking to improve the economic model and operation of small SPOs so that the decentralization of Cardano transaction validation can be strengthened.  My recommendation is that the proposers target either a DAO, smart-contract, or energy conservation challenge for a future funding round. \r\n\r\nThe proposal does include establishment of a SPO which will plant a tree for each delegator; however, its not clear how establishment of one small pool will enhance the sustainability of independent SPOs more generally.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal includes a detailed description the team, project plan, and budget.  The project has a reasonable chance of being able to start a stake pool and follow through on planting of trees.  Additional details regarding the costs of planting and growing the planned trees would be helpful so that the long-term viability of the project could be assessed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is seeking to establish a Cardano node and utilize the fees to sponsor planting of trees.  The clarity and audibility of the proposal could be improved by including a goal for the number of delegators, the demographic of the delegators attracted to the project, the average size of the delegators, and how the expected returns compare with the costs for planting and growing trees.

And can hence competently evaluate sutainability criteria in proposals in this category. The proposal matches the challenge well and it is clear the proposer has properly read the challenge and has a good idea for participating in it's solution. Their proposal has the potential to add quite some value to the Cardano ecosystem.\r\nThe proposal articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and the concrete challenge in an good manner.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nThe proposer makes a credible statement about scalability and it seams reasonable that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers provide sufficient verifiable information about themselves. A lot of information was added due to my request, which I really appreciate. Feedback: For future proposals, maybe consider telling us a bit more about the blockchain/cardano related work you have already done. The proposer provides a plan of implementation and defines the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. The buget is fine-grained and seems rationable. The proposer has provided a plan for the case if they need additional funds, as some of the budget is planned in for this case, and as they seem to intend to pay for 60% of the project themselves (mismatch in outlined budget and requested funds), they seem liquid. Milestones are provided for the proposal.unfortunately, no risk analysis has been done for the project except for the accounting for uncertainities in the budget outline. \r\nIn its current form, the proposal provides sum plan that can be feasible if executed properly.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Milestones are presented, however some og them could be more detailed and concrete, and the Metrics/KPIs are more implicit than structured explicitly.

It seems like too many moving parts to fit into one proposal. Team members are listed but I would appreciate more specific details of how they will contribute to the project.
