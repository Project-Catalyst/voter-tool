Africa is a continent consist of developing nations, and recently have seen an increase in economic growth and activity across the continent. Crypto trading have become one of them, and it's growing rapidly. However the government are still somewhat blocking these activity (trading for crypto), and left the majority of people with cash cannot exchange their money for crypto through a bank. This is where the proposer provide a solution by building Cardano peer-to-peer exchange where people within a country and region can trade, and transactions can be done easily through cash or through mobile money which attracts less charges compared to banking transactions.
