It seems to fit into the challenge as being a deployable dapp by a new team that has a token that would create a measurable TVL but I have a little bit of hesitancy as to wether or not this can be defined as a DeFi project as per the challenge. Potential Directions listed in the challenge brief are things like DEX's, stable coins, borrowing/lending apps, etc. I'm not willing to say it doesn't fit because there are varying notions of how DeFi can be defined but I'm substracting one star for this reason.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I feel very confident that this proposal could be implemented successfully.

Not only is it a shining example of translating the current criteria for a high quality proposal into a user-friendly, readable format, it has made my job as a CA easy to identify and assess Impact, Feasibility, & Auditability. \r\n*Impact on Cardano: As articulated under the title \"Why Cardano?\" and clearly identified who this proposal will impact under: \"Stakeholder identification, this proposal not only impacts off chain issues & solutions, the Cardano blockchain, and the Project Catalyst community, it takes impact to a whole new level by addressing climate change & contributes in a real & meaningful way to fulfilling Cardano's mission of \"Making the World Work Better for ALL.\" \r\n*Impact on Challenge Metrics & Goals: The challenge asks the question: How to encourage new teams to Deploy Defi Solutions on Cardano? This proposal fits into 1) the goal of \"This challenge intends to sow new teams... value to the community,\" AND they have managed to \"form a community in order to gain competitiveness/sustainability.\" They have collected a team within the project and they have connected to communities across Project Catalyst. The key metrics & goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings as indicated succinctly below the title \"What success looks like?\" This proposal has a budget well below the maximum $50K, a team AND a community both off & on chain to support and promote their impactful work through the creation of a D'App on Cardano & 12 month goal to produce a \"Peer reviewed research paper\". \r\n*Scale: By co-creating and \"Reaching Cardano DAO Level 3 in one year,\" they will have the framework to meet future challenges as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. I believe the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges. \r\n*Impact on the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs): As indicated through their use of the SDGs proposal tool https://cardanocataly.st/proposer-tool-sdg/ made by Catalyst Community to assist in mapping our impact to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nThank you to this team for taking the time and making the effort to create a clear & understandable proposal. \r\n(6) I most strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and goes one step further by their efforts to impact climate change.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility\r\n\r\n*Skills, Experience & Team: The proposer provides evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the practical portion of the proposal. They have identified the essential building blocks and infrastructure on the Cardano blockchain needed to deliver on the project scope and they have indicated they are \"seeking\" a Cardano Blockchain specialist & accountant. \r\n\r\nNote: It is possible that the information regarding a Cardano blockchain specialist on board as a team member, or the indication of technical advice in the creation of this proposal is contained in the GitHub document. The average voter may or may not have the ability or time to navigate this platform (I do not). In my opinion, having this spelled out in off-chain user language could help improve the readability of this proposal.\r\n\r\n* Budget Amount, Additional Funding, Timeline & Plan: The budget is within the goals of the challenge and may be reasonable to achieve the set goals. I strongly believe the proposers have the ability to work out future funding as the need arises because they are solution-oriented & connected to the wider community. I am neither an accountant nor familiar with the time it takes to complete the outlined tasks nor if the milestones are attainable. I am unable to verify whether or not the individual amounts are reasonable, conservative, or insufficient to accomplish the goals of the proposal. What is crystal clear to me is the first steps in the right direction to impacting the environment and the creation of a new model around incentivizing the collection of recyclables.\r\n\r\n* Resources & Technical Feasibility: The proposal team has identified the building blocks & technologies on the Cardano blockchain needed to deliver on the project scope under \"Solution Design\". I do not have the technical background to confirm the legitimacy/accuracy of this information.\r\n\r\n* Challenges & Risks: identified under \"Risk identification.\" \r\n\r\nI am unable to rate the technical aspects of this proposal so my rating would be (4) IF I did not think outside the box, challenge the status quo & consider the impact of this proposal outweighing my personal shortcomings in understanding blockchain technologies, I am \"borrowing the extra star from the Impact criteria. I feel this proposal is too important to fail based on my life experience.\r\n\r\n(5) is my overall rating for feasibility: It is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully with passionate members of the Project Catalyst & Cardano4Climate community behind this team to help fill in any gaps that may or may not exist.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability\r\n\r\nMy opinion of & support for this proposal is clear. As I am in the process of learning the language of project management and still unsure of the terms KPI, Metrics & what success looks like, I may not have fully captured the requirements for these concepts & \"proven\" this is an auditable proposal.\r\n\r\n* Roadmap: as indicated in my assessment of this proposal for feasibility, through no fault of the proposal team, I do not have the experience nor knowledge to rate their roadmap. It appears to me to be logical & well-though out.\r\n\r\n* Metrics \u2013 KPIs: are succinct & listed below the statement, \"Success means for us creating value for the Cardano community through the experiment of building a Dapp that has social, economic, and environmental impact. Practically, for the foreseeable future, success lays on delivering the intermediary goals ...\"\r\n\r\n* Problem Description: Why? \"Every hour, an estimated 2.5 million plastic bottles are thrown [out].\" The challenge? \"How can the Cardano community incentivize recycling and enhance individual collectors' income using Tokens and Smart Contracts?\"\r\n\r\n* Solution Description: What? \"Add value to recycling supply chain by providing trail of evidence, liquidity, and a free market for tokenized used plastic bottles.\" How? \"Our proposal aims to explore a sustainable business model and practical implementation of a DApp on Cardano that incentivize individual and collective collectors/recyclers by providing liquidity and enforcing traceability of recycled materials.\"\r\n\r\n(5) I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information within their \"Working Plan\" to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n\r\nAt the rate I write assessments, it is quite possible that I will run out of time before the 5pm UTC deadline to \"rate\" all the proposal I want/need to. I can let the pressure of this expectation go because, as a community advisor, a passionate supporter of the experiment called \"Project Catalyst\" and an active member of Cardano4Climate, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are headed in the right direction(s). \"Climate Change is a failure of cooperation\"- Scott Poynton. Together, WE will not fail.

Speaking of such seems like a very relevant list of partnerships within the community (Cardano4Climate) and several other organizations.  \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and seems very reasonable and a bit on the low side.
