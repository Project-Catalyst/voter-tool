It is not detailed in the proposal things like: what content of these workshops; in which schools (or universities, but I believe schools - which would also be a problem, because this type of teaching is a little difficult and advanced for those in elementary and high school. who are already dependent on the world of technologies, at least ); who would give these classes, how would the training of professionals be carried out; how often these classes would take place; how success would be measured, that is, how common taught women get inserted into the Cardano ecosystem, so as to measure the proposed benefits for the blockchain... Too many details. I'm also a little worried because it's such an ambitious idea to introduce the blockchain into a community that, unfortunately, gives so few opportunities to study and work for women.

Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this.

I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once.
