However, without a more specific, in-depth knowledge of the dynamics taking place in the geographical area to be addressed, it could be like drilling in a field without knowing its specific characteristics: in many cases the drill bit will end up breaking without penetrating.  \r\n\r\nOrganizations such as WADA and others that have done excellent work on the continent (hand in hand with Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem) have accumulated a valuable amount of experience that would be worth consulting.\r\n\r\nMethods such as events have been so commonly used that their rate of effectiveness has tended to decline dramatically.
