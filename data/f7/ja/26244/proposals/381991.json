This issue has already been addressed by the team as they are part of a coalition of twitter accounts that create digital spaces in which different topics are discussed and in which the community is encouraged to participate. In essence, the team is asking that the community allocate funds to make these spaces sustainable. This is clearly in line with the objectives of the challenge. However, when examining the success metrics, I find that they are very generic or confusing and do not permit an objective assessment in relation to the objectives of this challenge.\u00a0\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As members of the team are currently implementing the solution, assessing its feasibility is relatively straightforward. To verify that Twitter accounts were active, all of their Twitter accounts were provided. It seems reasonable to me that a $35 payment will be made to each episode. The requested fee is for the maintenance of these spaces for six months.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Lastly, this proposal can be audited easily. Evidence of this can be found on each of the Twitter accounts associated with this community. I believe more effort should have been made regarding the metrics of success; for example, one metric could have been the level of participation, another could have been the number of new users that joined the community as a result of these events. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 4, "ng": 16, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As someone with 10+ years experience in client education at a Fortune500 company, I am excited by any proposals that create organic and high-volume content and spaces for exploration. The bottom line is they really work and deliver bang for your buck if they are conducted regularly enough that they become a go-to resource. The spaces that this proposal aims to support appear to do just that. Any voter should be able to see this. The payments seem reasonable per session and it seems very scalable. The only limitation is the lack of non-English speaking resources. It would be good to see some of these funds and spaces being launched in other languages - or at least have a plan to do so. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is a very straightforward proposal: support what already exists and make it possible for them to grow. In this way, the plan presented is highly likely to be implemented successfully. That being said, whether or not this is the most effective use of funds is less clear because of a lack of real, measurable goals/KPIs. Similarly, there doesn't appear to be any risks mentioned. What if one of the spaces is wound down? Who will be moderating the \"ongoing community vibe/safe space\" and making a decision on who will continue to receive funding? I would like to see more detail around the ongoing measurement and parameters for funding. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are no real KPIs to speak of and the proposal speaks mostly in absolutes \"all of them to have grown\" is a good aim but it is not a sufficient goal to measure success. I would like to see a number attached to this. Similarly, for the other goals, such as \"create more...\" - I would need to see actual numbers in order to evaluate effectiveness.

The proposal makes a good, basic case that this is a logical route to growing the Cardano community. Something that is missing, however, as far as the challenge is concerned, is how this could serve as a platform for development beyond the existing communities, and hopefully beyond Twitter, where a large share of current evangelizing for Cardano already exists. A little more vision might have helped this proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As noted earlier, since this work is already happening, it leaves little doubt that this proposal is feasible. The website is also sharp and appealing, showing that the team behind it has experience and familiarity with this kind of work. I have some questions about the numbers though, which I'll get deeper into in the auditing section.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is where this proposal could use much more, in my opinion. What are the goals in terms of target audience numbers? How many more people are you hoping to reach and introduce to Cardano? In fact, growth numbers would have done much to strengthen the proposal overall. While mention of \"1000s\" of people reached presents us with a nice accomplishment, without reasonably precise growth numbers the real terms of this accomplishment it's hard to get a handle on the success of the model. This makes auditing it that much harder. This is something could easily be built into a roadmap. Perhaps, every three months, the team could pool their results into a quarterly master document and show the state of their audience growth.\r\n\r\nThis kind of analytics work is very important for social media-based operations to do. It provides the team with a way to intelligently manage their own growth, but also allows those of us who support your project externally to offer informed advice.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_853", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "10\u306eTwitter Spaces\u306b\u8cc7\u91d1\u3001\u6280\u8853\u3001\u6226\u7565\u7684\u306a\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u6bce\u9031\u4f55\u5343\u4eba\u3082\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\u30ce\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3002", "experience": "\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b \"Spaces \"\u3092\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\uff09\n\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3001\u591a\u69d8\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3001\u8208\u5473\u3001\u8a00\u8a9e\u3001\u5c02\u9580\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u6301\u3064\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u306a\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u3059 - \u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u3082\u4ed5\u4e8b\u4e0a\u3067\u3082\u3002"}
