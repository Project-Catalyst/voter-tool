However, there are several areas that need to be addressed, including: (1) The following three \"managers\" are mentioned; a description of their profiles and links to their resumes would be beneficial. The roles that these individuals will play should also be described. As a physical location will be rented, it is necessary to describe whether or not you already have an agreement with this location. Do you need licenses? Permits that need to be considered? It is also unclear from what date the site will open. (3) this challenge seeks among other objectives to add new users to the ecosystem, I recommend that the author focus on how this will be achieved.\u00a0\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, the proposer also does not mention the minimum requirements for evaluating auditability, although it mentions a time frame within which it will be economically sustainable after 6 months, but more details are definitely required.
