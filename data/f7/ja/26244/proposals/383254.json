High crime rates, low wages, poor sanitation, among other things. For which they propose a series of solutions intended to bring new opportunities associated with the blockchain to the community. As for the alignment with this challenge, I can see the connection, and I believe if implemented well, we can begin to take advantage of the city's potential that has not yet been explored. Furthermore, I also find the metrics of success to be well defined and aligned with the challenge's mission. An element that I found to be lacking in the proposal's description is the analysis and consideration of the possibility of scaling and sustainability of the hub.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a brief description of Sidney's skills and experiences, however, no references are presented that would allow me to validate them. Wada is a well known organization within the community, so I see it positively to be included as a partner. However, I believe it is necessary to describe the people from Wada who will lead or support this proposal. Some of the actions are briefly described, but I would have liked a more detailed explanation of the initiatives being contemplated. The requested budget is divided into four identifiable areas, however, I believe it is necessary to provide more information in order to make an accurate assessment, for example, \"Marketing and community outreach,\" which represents 75% of the total budget requested without any explanation as to what actions they plan to take.  \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a statement from the team that the project will be implemented in 18 months, and 9 milestones are listed. Here I also find opportunities for improvement. For example, instead of describing \"crypto buy back guns scheme\" I would recommend something like \"XX amount of guns bought by XXXX (timeline)\". Of course this is an estimate, but it is necessary for the advisory community not only to be able to audit but to measure the impact. I congratulate the team on presenting a set of simple success metrics in line with what they are seeking. However, to make a thorough assessment it is necessary to identify objectives for each metric. This is the best way to assure the community that it will be audited during the implementation period. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 10, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": " Relation to personal qualifications: As a year-long activist in both party-politics and non-party related political (grassroots) groups I know how important decentralised communities are for democratic and economic empowerment.
