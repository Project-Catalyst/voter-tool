In order to demonstrate how DTL solves everyday problems, the team proposes to create a number of physical \"Xperience centers\". The authors also suggest a hybrid experience that allows the individual to select which type of experience they prefer. An excellent job has been done in describing both the demographics of the first hub location as well as the target audience. In conclusion, after analysing the success metrics presented, I can determine that there is a clear alignment between what this challenge seeks and what this proposal aims to accomplish. Congratulations guys. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Once again, the team does a fantastic job of demonstrating feasibility by giving a detailed and complete explanation of their action plan, they provide links where you can explore the ramifications of Konma, where you can see that it is actually a DAO. Konma as an organization has 7 proposals in the current Catalyst cycle, of which none describe the team members. I was only able to identify 4 people on the Marketplace website. It is not entirely clear to me if these people are the ones who will be leading the implementation of all initiatives. Although the budgets of the proposals detail the relevant hires, it would have been helpful for me to identify at least one leader for each proposal. Although the budgets of the proposals detail the relevant hires, it would have been helpful for me to identify at least one leader for each proposal. The budget is broken down into 4 items, but unfortunately, I have several concerns. In the roadmap the project is described as \"Searching for real estate (Nov 2021),\" while at the end of the proposal submissions period they could confirm that they already had the local contract. Another aspect that should be improved is the breakdown of the operational costs, meaning that salaries are mixed electricity, setting up coffee, etc...\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team makes an excellent case in this regard. There is a road map for every month beginning in November 2021 and culminating in October 2022, as well as a brief description of the actions to be taken. I do, however, believe this could be improved. Instead of describing, \"Searching for real estate (Nov 2021)\" as a deliverable, it may be more useful to describe it as \"A real estate contract has been signed\". Similarly, instead of describing \"Renovations in progress (Jan 2022)\", I would recommend describing it as \"renovations completed\". As a result, the community will know what to expect at each phase of the implementation. When it comes to the success metrics, I find that they are concise, accurate, they cover all aspects of the project, and they are completely aligned with the challenge. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 9, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Very good idea and well written proposal.\r\nBring real experience to local communities is essential to show the true blockchain applications and can strenght the bond with it.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is also very well written and structured.

I appreaciated the experience is very detailed here as well\r\n\r\nMy only point of concern is not to turn the experience into a mere \"shopping brainwashing\". The shopping itself should be just a collateral effect, not the main  mean to make the experience vivid, so, proposer should be careful here.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Konm is already a company, which is verifiable by the links provided.
