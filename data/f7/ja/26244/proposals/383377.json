Because the solution of this project is not a good innovation of what Cardano community has now. The project is to do a GitBook but we already have many documents that gives information about Cardano and challenges. The project is to Challenge Team GitHub Organisation and Repositories but Cardano already have many support similar to this. And why Fund 6 is included here?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal demonstrates Gitbook structure but about the Challenge Team GitHub Organisation and Repositories, there is a lack of demonstration how you will build and maintain it. However you are thoughful with breaking the tasks (into days) and who will be in charge of which task. A little advise is that you can rearrange the structure of the proposal, now it's quite hard to follow your idea and plan.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes key metrics and the roadmap.

In the future, all challenges in Catalyst should be decided upon by the community, and not suggested by some central authority. This is a very important part of Project Catalyst, and providing a space for all the documentation and information about the challenge settings is something which can only help the community.\n\nHowever, I am not sure the proposal is very well aligned with the challenge setting of scaling up Cardano's community hubs. The campaign brief specifies that the challenge is about building a global ecosystem, and specifically onboarding new users to Cardano, in particular those that are not English-speaking. I don't think the proposal addresses those challenges very well, as it will be building a community service for those who are already deeply involved in Cardano and Catalyst.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think this project is very feasible to complete in the way presented. Payment will be provided to those maintaining the GitBook and GitHubs, which will ensure that they do a proper job.\n\nI think the budget cost is very reasonable compared to the value this project would add to the Catalyst community.\n\nThe proposer is already a very active participant in the Catalyst community. This means that he will have a good understanding of how to collect and present information in a way that is useful for other members of the community. He should also be committed to completing the project on time, and in the manner presented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the proposer has provided enough information to conclude it should be very easy for the community to audit the progress of this project. \n\nIt has been made clear what they will create, and when it will be up and running. It should be easy for everyone involved in Catalyst to check if this is done successfully.\n\nAgain, I think the impact of the project is apparent, but the proposer didn't explain well enough how it aligns with the challenge setting. That's why I gave a lower score for impact/alignment. The auditablity itself is very high, in my opinion.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_73", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 4, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "F8\u30c1\u30e3\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u60c5\u5831\u3084\u6587\u66f8\u306e\u5358\u4e00\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u3001\u7dad\u6301\u3059\u308b\u3002", "experience": "Stephen Whitenstall\u306f\u73fe\u5728\u3001Funded Proposers\u306e\u30b5\u30fc\u30af\u30eb\u4ee3\u8868\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001F6 Improve and Grow Auditability Challenge Team\u306e\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
