I also like the idea of the fundings being released by work packages as it evolves, according to its schedule, completition and depencencies and have a system manage this \"stage-gate\" would be awesome.

It would be good check with whomever \"owns\" this information if you could have access to it before starting.

Firts, it should be clearer if the desired solution is going to be developed internally or if it would be an arealdy exiting commercial solution - or if both would be evaluated. It seems to me that the idea is to keep this management in idea scale but that brings the question of this place is really the best for this kind management and if the solutions proposed would be available from ideascale.

On the other hand the author uses this timeframe in order to test his own proposal as a prototype to the proposed audit and rund release portal. What I would expect, from my experience building portals for +3 years is an architecture concept taking into account roles & rights and the different user groups a bit more detailed, as it could be the critical point for ease of use for Catalyst users.
