The problem it does set out is definitely present:  voters (especially non-english speaking) have a monumental task before them to effectively parse the volumes of information related to proposals and challenge settings in order to conscientiously cast their votes.  This is a proposal to solve this by rolling out a pre-existing funded proposal -2minReview- to a wider audience.  The original Fund6 proposal that was approved by voters seemed to be more targeted at a developing Vietnamese crypto community that had barriers to entry to be community advisors, assessors of catalyst proposals, and this tool was an attempt to overcome language barriers and communicate essential information to these potential voters and CAs.  The proposers indeed claim to have assessed around 2000 proposals from the last 3 funds, and to have helped 100s of vietnamese as well, so this may be evidence the tool was effective, however no support of these claims was included.  It is difficult to measure possible impact from further implementation and integration of this tool to a larger Catalyst audience, and it is also to difficult to tell from this proposal whether the target is to quickly inform voters, empower community advisors, or both.  Lastly, the lack of links to previous work made it difficult to assess their standards for \"filtering and analyzing\" catalyst proposals with this tool (the original proposal can be found here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/2Min-Review/370212-48088).", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal includes multiple budget and roadmap breakdowns from various angles, and it was very clear they have an actionable plan to roll out a mobile application and website for their 2minReview tool.  The roadmaps are focused on rolling out the program on the web, followed by iOS and then Android, and they demonstrate a clear workflow for weekly stages over the course over 5-7 months.  The roadmap also includes several milestones presumably already reached through November and December of 2021.  The team's linked profiles include many relevant skills, heavy to the development side, and it is worth noting that the team has nearly doubled from its Fund6 proposal.  The budget at first glance appears a little light, but they also appear to be leveraging existing assets as SPO operators; if so I expect the resources requested to be adequate.  The team appears to be cognizant of the risks related to the Ideascale API, and importing the relevant data into the tool, and have provided a mitigation strategy for that possible landmine.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The tasks are clearly organized and with natural audit points at weekly and monthly intervals.  They also include trackable KPIs that they will be collecting themselves and providing the auditors, things like registrations and user satisfaction.  It would be very helpful to have metrics for number of assessments made by CAs with the help of this tool, if that is something it is seeking to assist with.  There also does not appear to be any means of providing community transparency for the audit, such as a public gitbook or record of commits, or even a consistent media channel.  For voters outside of the proposers immediate community, this project and the previous one are a bit of a black box, that would benefit from an increased level of auditabilty and accountability.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Our platform will help busy Cardano voters worldwide reach the Catalyst's proposal information in a convenient way, thereby, increasing the quality of voting at each Catalyst fund.
