The development of auditing templates is the second aspect in which they adress the challenge. \r\n\r\nFeedback: much more clarity could be provided in terms of exactly what the DAO does and what its benefits are. After studying the universe of DAO-NET proposals, this is my interpretation of what the Audit DAO would do, but it is not desirable that CAs have to do that much reading in order to fully appreciate what you propose here.

They also write extensively about various challenges that generally face the DAO ecosystem and touch upon various aspects of this. However, there is very little written about the actual Audit DAO itself but rather general risks of DAOs. Given that it is an audit DAO, there is not much specific expertise indicating that the team has the skills or relevant expertise to develop these templates mentioned. \r\n\r\nFeedback: there were proposals in fund6 with a very strong legal background and auditing expertise. Some indication that you are aware of these teams and how you could work with them would be desirable.
