What excites me the most is when you declare '' the Duo community is proud to call Cardano home.'' This team proposal also considered scales to address issues. the problem can be solved in the future, I am interested in your solution.

Its biggest benefit would be the immediacy with which this information will become available.  As a youtube show and associated podcast the community could quickly catch up with funded proposals and their progress, and stay up to date as new funded proposals enter development.  Beyond just auditing, this proposal could collect valuable feedback via interviews (Q&A:\"what did you do right/what do you regret\" about the proposal and funding process) and in the process boost the proposal base of Catalyst gamers.  This proposal has the potential to scale over time, covering other areas of Catalyst, but it could also remain solidly in gaming, including as an ambassador of the Cardano gaming community, and achieve scaling via rolling out more frequent videos, or specialty topics, or even Catalyst Swarm type events.  Despite only addressing a subset of the funded Catalyst community, it has the right elements to keep the community up to date on the development sprints within that subset.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Someone who is a game developer is someone who understands what process a just funded game developer has to go through, including establishing the relationships needed to get shows like this scheduled and executed on terms sensitive to development cycles.  The proposal team looks to be that someone.  While they don't include any specific milestones along the lines of particular games or personalities to feature, they do indicate they want to start with 'freshest first' i.e. Fund7 games, and then continue to cover previously funded games, once every two weeks, for a total of approximately 12 hours of content over 6 months.  This bi-weekly schedule makes for clear goals.  The funding requested should be able to shoestring decent post-production and access, and even includes a small budget for cross-promotion.  They don't include a likely scenario:  popular enough to need more funding for more shows, or cover more games, however they do indicate familiarity with non-Catalyst sponsorship of this type of media, with an expectation to move to that when possible.  The actionable event list is pretty simple:  make show 1, make show 2, etc.  While it would help voters assess feasibility to provide a basic two week script for rolling out a show and podcast, this is something this type of channel typically develops on the fly.  There is no breakdown in the roadmap for how long it will take before the first content is available, so the expectation is that it will be two weeks.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team plans to produce the shows, which will be publicly available, and then to report engagement metrics like views, subs, listens, to the community, likely via media channels (including the one they propose to develop.  never hurts to have a little meta in your life.)  They address the unlikely issue of a lack of content, and indicate that would merely open the show up to wider, non-catalyst gaming community on Cardano, which still keeps them accountable to the Cardano community.  They didn't include specific KPIs for auditability, such as sub thresholds, or view thresholds over particular time frames by which to establish success.  I would suggest getting view duration/retention rate to some high threshold.  Because the shows are ~1hr, this will drive the engagement metric that gets the videos recommended.  Additionally, monitoring the clickthrough rate for links to the games, designers, previous interviews, etc. will provide the community with good information about how effective the audits and information have been.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 7, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "2\u9031\u9593\u306b1\u5ea6\u3001\u65b0\u4f5c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3084\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u5404\u30a8\u30d4\u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3059\u308b\u3002", "experience": "Tech Founder & CTO\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e10\u5e74\u3068\u3001\u30ea\u30fc\u30c9\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u517cYoutuber\u3068\u306e\u5171\u540c\u958b\u50ac"}
