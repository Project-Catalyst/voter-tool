Generally this is done by plain documentation and video would certainly bring a more \"human component\" to this process at the same time it allows funded proposers to proper explain all the development done, in words and images.\nHowever, the documentation part still would be essential as it is really proof of what was done. The proposer here understands this and offers, together with the video, a place to keep this documents. Having everything in a dedicated platform, and with a standard template, would defintely make things easier and help community.\nI also see this proposal very aligned with challenge as it would increase the \"Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts\".\n\nThe only reason I didnt give 5 start here is because it is still unclear how much work would have to be put on to make these videos. Usually, this kind of media demand much more effort (and specific knowledge of tools and design) to be ellaborated, even with a template, than a regular documentation (word documents, spreadsheets, powerpoints). My concern is that funded proposers might not want to make the videos (either because of time it takes or because they dont know how to do them) and this project ends up being not very broadly adopted. To overcome this, it could be included in the scope of the project some support/training on creating the videos, besides providing the template, a possible way to outsource the creation of these videos (even if with a small fee) or other ways to facilitate the creation of this content. It could also be mentioned how was the impact, in a quantitative manner, of their previous funded proposal (Wada Media Funnel for Proposers), that involved video creation as well.

For instance, it says \"Travel and security logistics \" but it could explain somewhere why these trips are necessary. \"Team costs\" could also be better ellaborated (is it just to pay the team or involve other kind of costs? how much will be paid per hour or per peson?).\n\nLast, There's a simple roadmap but it is not time-framed and only some vague actitivites are described.
