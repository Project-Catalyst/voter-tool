this problem statement seems to be factually incorrect, aside from being extremely vague. The tragedy of the common postulates that individuals acting in their own self interest might lead to a situation where a highly demanded resource may become depleted due to there being no planning in how the resource is to be obtained in a sustainable manner. In this problem statement, it is simply said that the tragedy of the commons occurs on \"free\" resources (common, rather, such as drinking water in certain regions, or trees etc) and leads to resource ownership or policy to protect resources (are these two bad things? I'm very confused). \r\nThe solution as well, unfortunately, is extremely vague and does not sound like a solution at all: \"Policy making and ownership decision making is difficult to make right in many countries as power may often tip the scale.\" This is simply again stating a general problem.\r\nThis proposal does not fit in this category as it is extremely unclear what it's about.
