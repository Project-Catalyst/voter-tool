In addition to this, I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal presents an excellent approach to tackling several interconnected problems: Sustainability, waste and economy, and also concrete problematics like waste beeing illegaly shipped to Ghana. This proposal approaches these problems by generating a genuine approach that connects blockchain, the SDGs and a feasible solution. Really well done. It excellently matches the challenge.
