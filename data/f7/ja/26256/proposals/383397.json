As you can see we talked about product packaging as well as integration into customer systems as a SaaS. That helps us to extend cPay Plugin to many web platforms of different complexity. As well as speeding up from delivery to faster end-users integration. Of the 19 proposals to participate this time with COTI's challenge, only our cPay project clearly saw the project's scalability for its future. In addition to the COTI platform, cPay can also create smart-contract payments directly on it or integrate other coins besides COTI, ADA..etc.\n\nOnce again thank you and please give our cPAY 5 stars from you.\nThank you!\nTrong"}, {"q0": "The proposal states a clear problem and provides a solution to it.
