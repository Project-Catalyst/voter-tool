It can be difficult to consider a proposal of this nature, in isolation, without understanding how it connects to the larger picture, however, I do believe each of these proposals must stand ultimately on their own merits.  So lets consider this proposal in the COTI challenge.  It does meet the requirements of the challenge brief, as it proposes to develop an AdaPay plugin, specifically targeting Shopify, but the proposers indicate numerous other popular platforms like WooCommerce that should fall within its scope as well.  To this end they expect to develop the plugin and deploy it on their existing ecommerce enabled site for testing, and then rolling out the finished product for mass adoption.

The roadmap is well laid out, and a surplus of resources are being requested for a full stack development team, presumably freelance (for a plugin, this is adequate; for the overall Konma project at large you would like to see this development team in-house and dedicated).  For the overall layout of the Konma projects, it is clear there is some kind of management team behind the inspiration, but (and in the true spirit of a DAO) I could not find any information on them.  And while the roadmap appears detailed, when you realize it spans 6 months of development for this plugin, suddenly it seems to lack both granularity and perspective.  18 weeks to testnet will likely have this piece of software substantially behind its peers.  Is this a UI/UX issue?  If so I think voters would like an idea about how the interface would handle, in the name of 'good things come to those who wait.'

It would help to know what the significance of the initial userbase is, the Konma marketplace, but this is one of the difficulties of assessing this one piece of a broader funding approach in Catalyst.  The viability of this marketplace may be tied to other proposals.
