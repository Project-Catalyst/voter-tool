I can see there is a smart contract and dapp connector, a word press plugin, but no where it is mentioned how all this fits into together with AdaPay solution as is given in the challenge settings.

So there is a +1 from my side for the team here :)\r\n\r\nThe smart contract and plugin development seems to be therefore a doable tasks within the given timelines and likelihood of successful implementation, in my opinion, therefore,  is quite high.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i strongly agree that this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I agree that information provided here is in alignment to track the progress and success of this proposal. \r\n\r\nHowever, it would be nice to give more detailed information on budget requirements as i think the total budget for this challenge is 100k and this proposal asks for 1/4th of the total budget.\r\n\r\nAn example would be detailed justification of  why there will be 10k $ needed for Wordpress plugin. In general wordpress plugins (another proposal here for joomla plugin asks for like 3.6k$) are quite simple to implement but I am assuming in this case there is some sort of communication needed via smart contract. ? the justification for this budget is left to reader/voter assumption.\r\n\r\nAnother example is for better audit-ability sake is that proposer had given more details about Smart contract development. A 10k $ to implement a SC could have been split further (instead of 5k of two parts) into man hours and presented here. Questions such as How many hours a developer will work?, what is the rate per hour expected for developer. I believe if it is going to be a SC on coti, then it will be a solidity smart contract. The developer has significant work experience with Haskell, so I am assuming the learning curve with solidity is much easier and faster. \r\n\r\nEither way a more detailed information on budget would have been great, therefore I am not in full agreement with the auditing part of this proposal.

The targeting of a wordpress plugin makes sense (better development environment, substantial userbase), and if successful, further scaling could be addressed, at low cost, in further funding rounds.

A detailed roadmap would be very useful, including breakdowns for the use of the web server which accounts for 60% of the proposed budget.  It also seems like the smart contract development is an important start point for this proposal, but there is no information to assess how that will be approached, or what it seeks to achieve within AdaPay.
