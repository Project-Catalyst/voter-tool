The proposal aims to eliminate adulteration, wastage, and profit prioritization in the global food supply chain industry, which is a tall order, however, this can help companies with ethical behavior showcase their supply chain, which is the bottleneck in the current state of affairs. Therefore this project is reliably addressing an important challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is balanced and has a long-term roadmap.

The output of the proposal is also measurable in a quantitative manner. \r\nThe budget requested is reasonable to complete the roadmap as proposed.

The name has a better ring to it and the professionalism has increased. That being said, Great proposal, it's becoming a more pressing matter for people to know where their food comes from and how it's being made. Is their food being processed as it should be? Is the food coming from local farmers or not? By applying a trace on the product end-to-end you solve the problem of traceability. By using blockchain technology to store the data this proposal addresses the challenge very well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the detailed plan of the proposal, the description gives a clear outline of what the team has planned. We get an abundant amount of information presented. On IdeaScale the proposers give a brief description but all the rest can be found on the website presented.

Part of this proposal will be a Dapp so it fits the current challenge setting. If implemented the proposal will bring not only value to the ecosystem, but food to underprivilaged countries like india as well, which is note worthy. No KPIs to speak of which is a bit disapointing, since supply chain management is a metrics optimized process. As a developer I find it really strange that no mention of challenges when trying to scale the solution, because that's one of the toughest challenges to supply chain management and cloud kitchens. The proposal currently misses KPIs and any kind of metrics on which to measure success as well as definition of success.  I see that the proposer has already a submiter proposal for the previous funding round. I'd like to take a minute and appload the persistance and encourage it for future rounds as well. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have added links to the projects website which in tern has the linked to all their linked in accounts which is proof enough for me to check their credentials. The proposers already have a team in place to do work, although the work technicalities is not mentioned in the proposal or in the whitepaper. The budget is there and there is some breakdown, but I'm missing the hourly rate and an estimated time to work on a feature. Because of this I can't know if the timetable is relatable or not, so I deffer to the proposers and hope they have their time managed better than the proposal. I did not find any actual plan for implementation. Both the whitepaper answer to a lot of questions like why we're doing what we're doing and plans to help out farms and optimize the supply chain management model of the cloud kitchens, little mention on how they plan on doing that. As a developer I really enjoy reading whitepapers and digging into technicalities, but I didn't find much to dig through here. To be fare there was a mention of using sensors to gather data on the farm and using AI to process that data and use the blockchain to save it, but again no mention of how would you do that. The plan describes some resources for the implementation of the process, but no thourough reasoning is provided unfortunately. Devs want to look at the technical aspects of the proposal like architecture language and technologies used that are crucial for imeplemtnation. My suggestion would be to look at the previously funded proposals and look at how much detail they provide for simmilar proposals and copy their approach.   Overall the feasability of the project seems a bit murcky to me, that's not to say that it wouldn't be possible, but with lack of more details I simply can not estimate if the project would succeed or not. As a developer who's worked for KraftHeinz on a supply chain management solution, I can say with certanty that making a process decentralized and using blockchain and using AI wouldn't automatically make the gas for delivery cheaper. Good luck to you all and hopefully we'll see you in the next round as well with a refined and detailed idea. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Tracability is pretty good. The proposers have a website that they update the progress of their work, so anyone interested has a place to go and follow the project. Metrics and KPIs relating to the success of the proposal are lacking and I've nothing to comment on. Metrics are very important as you want to optimize a process you need to know it's metrics first, becauase a process that is not monitored and measured cannot be optimized. There's a clear roadmap with milestones and a timehorizon stated in the aforementioned website. There's a clearly stated problem, but a not-so-clear solution to the problem.

The problem and solution, as written in this proposal, are understandable but could be better.  The clearest example was on the website, in the whitepaper, which I downloaded to read.  The voters might not go to such lengths.  To improve, you can make a concrete use case and show the problem in simple, non-jargon terms.

The details of the project are confused with the structure of larger project and this portion in the proposal.  The team is critical and there is only one sentence about them.  And they are a great team and are accomplished, but it's hard to find the details.  Additionally, the proposal reads like a \"wish list\" or uses general jargon (Industry4.0, IoT, ML, etc.) without enough technical details to gain my trust.  I want to love this project because of the vision and the very real problem, but I can't support it because of the mediocre execution.
