In addition to this I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. In addition to this, I learned some programming during my university studies, so I can comprehend the basic ideas behind a lot of the technical details. The proposal identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved and provides an interesting, comprehensible solution that will add value to the ecosystem and meets the challenges KPIs. It will be a useful tool for many developers and other users of the deeper features of the blockchain. The only thing I don't understand here is why the plan is to use Ethereum-based smart contracts. The proposal can be, if implemented correctly, scalable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are transparent about their background and seem competent and up to the task.

The survice would summarize events happening on the blockchain. There's an implicit problem that would arise with the scaling of each individual Dapp in the ecosystem. This corelates well with the challenge settings. Clearly the proposal adds value to the cardano ecosystem, by providing a library that the Dapps will be able to build on top of. There are unfortunately no keymetrics to speak of.  The proposal is missing a few key elements like: an explanation of why their solution is better than other solutions that do the same, and build on top of PAB. Compared to other proposals that also try to build common tools that developers can use, this project is truly ambitious, because it wants to do all the work which is noble, but not optimal speaking as a developer myself. There are a lot of propositions for common tooling and my suggestion for the proposers is to focus on one and collaborate with other open-soruce projects.  Other than that, I believe the project will have great impact on the community if implemented! ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are mentioned team mebers with cridentials provided and links alonside so I verified the authors and team members have the skill to provide the promised solution.  The budget is otlined clearly, but I was hoping for time estimations and hourly rates to be able to compare with other simmilar project. Having said that, there is an executable descriptive plan with steps to take along with a well described time horizon to do all development necessary. There seems to be a bit of a missmatch between the linked PDF time schedule which states that the online IDE will take 4 months insdead of 3, but that's not as big a deal. The proposal could have been more technically detailed, because I would have been interested in having a look, but keeping in mind the proposers might not want to open-source their development, that seems fair enough.  The proposal doesn't specify the technologies that will be used, except for stating haskel as a first class citizen of the implementation. Challenges that may come along the way are not addressed in the proposal and I wish more developer projects would include them to avoid disapointing their users caused by lack of buffer time. My suggestion for this project is to check out the proposals in the Developer Ecosystem, where they can find simmilarly minded people theying to open source tooling that would bennefit all and colaborate with them on this.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have some plan on popularizing their work to the community but that plan kicks in after this stage of the proposal is complete and no other steps related to informing the community were mentioned in the proposal, which is a problem for the auditability of the project. Based on the proposal and the listed links it's going to be hard for the community to follow the success of the project. There's a general roadmap, but concrete KPIs are missing. I wish dapp developers and proposers payed more attention to metrics since they would help the projects performance down the line. Milestones are present in the proposal, but doesn't matter as much when the community can't follow up on it's progress. The targeted problem is clear and the solution is clearly defined as well.  Another suggestion I have is to put yourselves in the shoes of the voter, and critically look at your proposal and check if it answers all the questions a voter might have.
