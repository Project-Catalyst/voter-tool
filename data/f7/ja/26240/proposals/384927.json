NFT eco system across blockchain domain is booming and it is bringing up its own challenges along with it.\r\n\r\none of such challenges lately being faced is of bots choking the blockchain when an NFT sale is going live. This proposal is trying to find a solution to this problem and has given their take and solution to such an existing problem. In order for Cardano blockchain to be not choked and always at best performance it is important to deal with such use cases. \r\n\r\nThe team provides a great solution on how it can be achieved, and plans to keep this an open source solution to help future dapps leverage their solution.\r\n\r\nTherefore in my opinion this proposal perfectly fits into the category of Dapps and integrations.

The transparency is great and gives good confidence to the community. The expertise of the team members is well known and they already have lot of contributions in cardano community, as is visible by github repositories.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the plan presented here along with the budget is well split and explained in details. The estimated date of first version for wallet authentication launch is somewhere in first quarter of 2022, so we are not looking for a long waiting period for the implementation of this proposal. This in my opinion, is quite a positive thing, and overall i am quite confident that his proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPI and project tracking link is publicly available on github.

The proposal fits the challenge settings, since it's going to create a dapp. There's implicit value for the cardano ecosystem and for the project in specific. There are valid key metrics that seem well thought out and closely intertwined with the projects success. As a developer I see no issues to scale this progress along with uprising challenges. I see nothing missing, except the technical architecture of the solution, but that's not a big deal for 99% of people. This project will bring know-how to the ecosystem, because the authors are going to try and solve a very specific issue and open source their solution so other dapps can build on top of this solution or reuse their logic, which is invaluable. I don't have any concerns about this proposal since I looked through the team working on this.

Repeated tests have shown that the congestion problem doesn't only affect CNFT drops but the blockchain as a whole. Addressing the problem of congestion soon, before the next major influx of users to Cardano is crucial, particularly before L2 solutions are deployed.
