In addition to this I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects.  In addition to this, I learned some programming during my university studies, so I can comprehend the basic ideas behind a lot of the technical details. His proposal identifies a serious problem, the lack of accessibility to finance, especially to Crypto assets in many african countries. The solution to it seems simple and, if implemented correctly will be beneficial both to people in related countries and to the Cardano Ecosystem. While the product relates to the challenge, KPIs and Metrics are not explicitly mentioned thus it is difficult to say whether they align well with the challenge metrics. Same can be said for scalability (even though the defined product has the potential for being scalable).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers seem competent according to their website and them being backed by WADA  makes it credible that these are not just claims and they are up to the challenge. Still however, the proposal is lacking some important points: While the concept is explained comprehensively, the roadmap of single steps is a bit coarse-grained and the budget does not have a rationale. The proposers are also not discussing how much resources or developers will be working on the project. Feedback: I know it is difficult to grasp the structure and the workflows of Project catalyst in the beginning. However, try reading some guides for your future proposals on what a good proposal is supposed to contain and investing the time in doing it right. A lot remains unexplained here. I am sure you are a great startup and have very good ideas, so you need to make sure that you provide a proper implementation plan if you apply for funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": " A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented, and the product is clearly defined, this it gives this proposal a certain auditability. The Problem statement and the provided solution are clear, understandable and relatable. The only thing lacking regarding auditability is the missing metrics and KPIs. Also, the roadmap could be a bit more detailed.

Although, it would be better to specify the person in charge, so there could be accountability to who's responsible for this proposal in case anything happen when funding is approved. Unfortunately, there aren't any explanation in details regarding the budget allocation. The proposal provides the information on what they will be doing, but didn't provide technical detail on how to implement it. For example, what mobile platform would it be for? Android, iOS, Mobile Web App? What are the resources needed (e.g for database and framework/library)? By providing this details, we could then verify if the working timeline given (3 months) would be feasible or not. Creating an Android, iOS, and mobile web app at the same time will be harder than just focusing on only one platform. The proposer said that the wallet that they will create doesn't need a lot of development time, but didn't explain further in details about why and how. I gave it 2 stars mainly because lack of explanation about technical details and the budget breakdowns to justify their requested fund.

It won't be difficult to create both versions at the same time since for development we will be using Flutter which is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. So we won't have to design the Android and IOS version, we will design the Android version and generate the IOS directly. We will use Mongodb as a database.\nWe won't really create a wallet, what we will do is integrate extensions of the wallets that already exist in our application. This is the reason why it will not take us very long.  \n\nDuring this step we will focus on the detailed study and analysis of the problem of exchanging ADAs to local currencies.\n\nWe will have to carry out the following steps:\n- Detailed study of the problem\n- Implementation of a basic architecture\n- Proposal of the graphic model to use\n\nFund needed: 2000 USD\n\nStage 1: Active Development (Up to 1 Month)\n\nDuring this step we will begin the active development of the ADA To Mobile Money application.\n\nWe will take the following steps:\n\n- Development of the Administration part\n- Development of the user part\n\nFund needed: 8000 USD\n\nStage 2: Conversion solutions (Up to 3 Months of development)\n\n- Connection of the application with a first extension of ADA wallets that already exists\n- Implementation of the API of a first mobile money operator such as M-Pesa for example\n\nFund needed: 4000 USD\n\nStage 3: Testing with internal users:\n\nFirst tests of the application by beta testers in order to correct the first version of the application which will be published.
