I appreciate the detailed backend features that promises intensive execution on the technical side, however would have been great to see the rationale-behind and the anticipated process of customer development.

Furthermore, I am also unable to establish the creadibility and the anticipated roles of the working team. Winning a hackathon does not guarantee success in real life. I think perhaps the team need to rework this proposal, give it an appropriate level of depth and submit next time.
