In addition to this I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects.  In addition to this, I learned some programming during my university studies, so I can comprehend the basic ideas behind a lot of the technical details. This proposal identifies a real-world problem, and provides a solution to ti that however is not primarily based on the Cardano blockchain and rather focused on general industry than blockchain industry, even though it utilizes blockchain (even though not neccesarily Cardano.

The problem fits the challenge setting, since it's a dapp. If successful this dapp will have a tremendous impact for the comunity and cardano. I like the set goals of the proposal and them seem very reasonable, considering how large of a scale this project has. I also love the ongoing colaborations between already existing solutions like Glow. I'm a bit worried about scaling, because they mentioned a few developers that are going to be working on this PoC, which is ok for now, but for the future more developers would be necessary considering the scale. I don't see anything missing from the proposal, all checkboxes are there. Compared to other proposals this is quite original and leveraging blockchain in the right way. In combination with RFID tech, seems ieresting. As a developer I'd like to have seen a more technical idea of how they plan to build this dapp, but that's not going to affect my scoring in any way.

The proposers have listened to the comments from the community and have broken down the budget in a clear and understandable manner. Timetable is more than realistic and will be enough to complete the work described. I like the fact incentives for devs to stay with the project are predicted from the start of the project. All elements necessary to implement the proposals are linked at the bottom for anyone to look through. Technical aspects of the proposal could have been more clear, but I wouldn't hold that against them.  The project is really in sync with what's already been done and it shows they've been actively looking to build on top of other peoples work, which is the way to go to save time and effort.
