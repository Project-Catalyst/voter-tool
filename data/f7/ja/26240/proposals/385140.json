Because of the high gas fees the etherium users will have an economic incentive to move their assets in a cardano enabled way which makes sense. If implemented this project will add value to the cardano ecosystem, by boosting liquidity and migratin users from etherium. No key metrics were mentioned, so I can't say they align with the challenge settings. Not much technical details are linked or explained so I don't know if the proposers can address future challenges. The proposal is lacking in a few respects: No resources, links names or credentials KPIs or metrics of any kind are mentioned in the proposal.  As a developer I find the lack of detailed information technical and otherwise alarming.

The mentioned relevant skills can not be verified in any way, so I don't count on them. No specific plan for a type or number of team members is present in the proposal, which is a red flag for me since any practical proposal would need people to do it. The budget is mentioned but there's no concrete breakdown or explanation on what specific work needs to be done and an hourly rate to do it. I have no idea if the timetable offered for implementation is good or not, because no technical specs or architecture is provided. As a developer I would have been able to estimate at least if the timetable is sensible or not for the job stated to be done. No time is mentioned concerning the integration of the implemented bridge. The deffinition of success is good, but it mentiones what it should accomplish, but the proposal doesn't state how would it support it. No resources of any kind are mentioned as necessary to implement the proposal. Having looked at over 30 proposals by now, this is very odd to me. The technical aspects like architecture language or technologies that are goind to be used for the implemention are never mentioned. A high level overview is not enough for a proposal of this magnitude.  I would love for this project to become a reality because it's a great idea, but as it stands now, I'd suggest to the authors of this proposal to have a look at other technical proposals and have a look through the proposal templates and questions to be answered.

The roadmap is present but it could be a bit more concrete about the milestones and task segregation. The problem statement description is clear. The solution on the other hand needs some more work.
