The youtube video added to the proposal gives a very good detailed information on both the current problems in music industry and potential solution to this problem via blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nFull points from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that the proposer has the experience (business domain) and has collaborated with one of the blockchain tech companies who will provide the implementation side of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe tech lead for this project given has public profile given, although would have been better if his website link was posted here on the proposal itself :) . As a senior developer myself, i could see that he comes from a infrastructure background, and holds a BS degree in software engineering, but i have some concerns when it comes to a project of this scale. This kind of project (dapp) would need more experienced technical hands imo. But that is just my opinion.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that you could collaborate also with some senior devs for. helping hands with smart contract development and i am sure this project will be implemented successfully.

However, i feel that  community will have ability to track the progress of this product via the proposer. \r\n\r\nHowever, i can see that the 16 weeks plan is given, additionally, a 3-6-12 months roadmap is given. What i am missing is when Smart contract development will be done ? If 16 weeks are spent with web app, iOs and testing, that means more than 3 months, after which we expect 1 Record label piloting the software. Are smart contracts already expected by then ? \r\n\r\nI see there are some unclarity, and room for improvements.

Based on the timeline, a more detailed information (ie; how many users are the proposer planning to get for the prototype - throughout the process of developing - milestones for success, a brief explanation of the tokenomics of Initial Coin Offering and NFT marketplace that will take place). What does success look like down the line? The features that can be input into the platform should also be briefly explain to provide vision for voters.
