I somehow feel easier to use 2FA authentication to just sign up and login to the wallet, so that's a plus, in my opinion. What concerns me is how do the proposer plan to adopt users to use the wallet in terms of usability (UI & UX) whereby current users are comfortable with existing wallets such as Yoroi & Daedulus. I am a UI/UX designer, and I was wondering if there are more detailed laws of UX (such as Aesthetic-Usability/ Miller's Law..etc) within the front-end interface. Yoroi & Daedulus have quite user-friendly UX but there are features that lack of flow (for example; Yoroi Wallet - unable to categorize transaction based on the user's needs. Or a feature where user can manage its portfolio..). Thus, I would love if the proposer can explain further \"user-centric approach\" as this is essential for adoption of users.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe the proposer have great experience in developing based on the above. However, key metrics to measure are not detailed and roadmap are not mentioned, therefore, it will be difficult for voters to see success in this proposal. I see that the proposer has mentioned that the old Medusa wallets have over 1000+ users, but how can we increase the number of wallet holders in the next 3 months, or 6 months. A list of ways to market the product (such as; Within 3 months, there will be an airdrop of free NFT(s) from creators of Cardano that has been using Medusa to people who follow our Twitter. This is just a rough example.) should be clearly underlined to ensure confidence of the project. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Seems to me that the funding required are reasonable, but I feel that there is more that needs to be broken down; such as business advisors, marketing budget, and risk budget..\r\n\r\nThere are users that are done with Yoroi and Daedulus  (especially Yoroi) due to it having synchronization issues at times and other reasons. A good way to improve and innovate this proposal is to have a UX survey analysis on what the users want in an application since there is already a working product. Why have UI/UX like Daedulus when you have a brilliant idea that can create a different yet unique approach. This will definitely impact on making a great, secured, 100% anonymous, and user-friendly dencetralized application.
