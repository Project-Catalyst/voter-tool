A framework would fit better in the Developer ecosystem, but It's ok for this challenge as well. There will be a tremendous impact if this gets implemented since NFTs are a hot topic for the past year and continue to grow and evolve. I didn't see any metrics per se, but there is some mention of a definition of success. I would have liked to have some measurable KPIs though. Keeping in ming how large the team is and their skills, I think they wouldn't have an issue with scaling up when necessary.

That brings the credability for this project way up. There are know number of team members as well as a required skilset in order to get the job done. The budget is more or less clear, although as a developer I find it strange that the hourly rate for all different types of jobs is the same. It seems a bit strange, but if that's the way they want to go, that's their perogative. There's a realistic timetable to do the described work, so no worries there. There's a very concrete and detailed plan for implementation - kudos for that.  The technical aspects of the project could have been a bit more detailed, because as a developer I like to dig in, but I can appreciate not all projects want to be open sources so that's understandable.  I really respect the fact the project will build on top of open source projects, because that's the way to go IMHO. Overall I think the proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I have my doubts about the tracability of the project because no channels like telegram or discord were mentioned. I really didn't see how would a regular comunity member be able to follow along with the progress of the project. The metrics are a bit lacking, but there is some definition of success. The roadmap could be a bit more detailed, but it's good enough to understand the milestones of the project.  There's a clear and understandable problem, but the author of the proposal could have done a better job explaining the solutuion, because it assumes the voter and all readers will have prior knowledge of a lot of technical terms.
