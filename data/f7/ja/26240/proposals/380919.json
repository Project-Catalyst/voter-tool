Practical, laser-focused and user-oriented. I like the name - as it reflects what seems to be at the heart of the https://cardano-tools.io project. Namely, bringing NFTs and minting, burning, tracking tokens or registering tokens to the masses. The size of the project is also very well scoped - and the budget corresponds to the ambition. The proposer clearly has an understanding of the problem and what he intends to deliver. The website is already functional and the project consists of a sequenced expansion of its functionalities - allowing even the non-technical user to play around with NFTs and their traits. Great! I want to try too!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I love proposals that are concise, yet informative. It's a fine art writing a measured proposal, yet conveying everything. The plan and budget set aside are great. I like that specific sums have been correlated to functionalities that will be built into the https://cardano-tools.io project. The proposer cleary has the relevant experience as a Fullstack developer for 10 years, as the creator of cardano-tools.io and a Plutus pioneer. Most of the functionalities that he intends to add ... such as Burning tokens...  Search for token fingerprint ... Display current owner of tokens seem so logical and necessary (among others)... Each component has an associated cost. That's it. I'm certain this project has all the preconditions for success (unless the proposer sees some risk that he has not listed). Can't wait to see it in action. One tip: it wouldn't hurt to put some \"lipstick and rouge\" on the website. Maybe doll it up a bit - so it doesn't look too tech-nerdy... as we want non-technical users to use it too (this is just an idea for a possible Fund 8 proposal).\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditing seems to be a relative breeze thanks to the clarity that the proposer has provided. He proposes a list of new functionalities and each ones is specified. The proposal includes a certain three-monthly timeline (3, 6...)  and the six-month goal is to  create a detailed proposal and proof-of-concept for a smart-contract for NFTs with forced royalities - 5000$. Amazing stuff. The proposer states: \" Making as many featurees as possible accessible for users will increase the adoption of cardano.\" He is right.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 9, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "With the number of NFT markets booming in Cardano, many people are trying to create the same infrastructure again and again.

Therefore it can be said that this project is effectively addressing the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has already open-sourced a website template for the NFT site.

However, the author barely explores the relationship between the Cardano blockchain and his website, naturally we are led to think that the products managed here would be part of our blockchain, but it would be important for the author to clarify that this is the objective here and how it would happen. It will reveal \"make the conquered resources\", but it would be interesting to specify what the resources are, if it would be the handling of tokens, as mentioned before, and how this facility would be provided. Despite being consistent with what is asked in the challenge, I found a proposal in general confusing, it is not explained in a clear and detailed way how this application works. For example, in the excerpt \"The cardano-tools.io webapplication covers multiple workflows\", which workflows? I went to the site and tried to understand what's going on there, but it's not a very expository site, not if it's not finished yet or if it's like that. I suggest that website owners rethink the user experience a little, that is, how whoever arrived there for the first time can understand what happens and how to make it happen. In short, a proposal makes sense with the challenge, but there was a lack of detail both to understand what will be done and to understand what already exists. So I can't be so sure the impact would be high.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the author's ability to execute the project, we know a few things about him, except that he is the creator of the attached site, he is a long-time developer and also a pluto pioneer. However, it would be positive if the author explained better who he is, from examples of previous works (for example, what he developed over the 10 years mentioned here). We could also get a more solid sense of this if we were given his Linkedin page, if he has one. Another thing that worries me is that he doesn't mention the intention of forming a team, this project is very complex in my view, because it seeks to intensify and diversify the activities present in an existing site, which would require the work of different professionals from some areas. In addition to programmers, I think it would be beneficial for the team to have a designer and someone from marketing, respectively, to make the site more ergonomic and positive, and promote the product to the community. Regarding the requested financial amount, we are listed for which part of the project each amount would be allocated, which is very positive and essential, but I would like each of these parts to be explored further. For example: Handle multiple policies; what kind of policies are these? It would be important to clarify, so that it would be possible to understand each part of the project more solidly. Despite that, it's good how well it divides the money next to each activity that would be developed. And lastly, when it comes to time, he divides activities into 3, 6, and 12 months, with most being done in the first quarter. I was a little confused by the split. If most things would develop by month 3, what happens in months 4 and 5? Is it really plausible to concentrate almost everything until month 3, and then the work is completely focused on a single activity? This may be justified in case this later activity is more complex, but as someone who doesn't work with this, I felt the lack of an accessible explanation to justify such a division.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately there is no information regarding auditability in a specific way. What can be done is to monitor if the tasks listed are being done in the defined period. With this, the community could have some communication channel with the author/team, in order to monitor the progress of activities, this could be done from a team specialized in token handling and with the technical knowledge necessary to understand the general functioning of website activities. Also, the author does not reveal how the project results would be presented to the community, that is, how the benefits would be measured, how could we be sure that the money invested was well used? What could serve as a communication channel would be the telegram, in which the author is willing to listen to criticisms and suggestions, which is extremely positive.
