The problem fits with the challege setting, since a platform would be made using the mean stack. This will surely add value to the cardano ecosystem and to the businesses in africa strugling with counterfit unverified documents. The key metrics are in line with the end goal of the proposal. I don't know about scaling since no specific team or necessary skills are mentioned apart from the mean stack. I'm missing a bit of detail when it comes to the budget and possible team to get the work done. Compared to other proposals this one sure is more impactful than most. As a developer I'm a bit woried about the lack of technical people on the team right now, because I think they're not approached yet or assembled.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "No references are provided by the business entrepreneur from Kenya. No linkedin links no credentials that could be verified so that doesn't seem very transparent and tracable. The lack of specific team members and links brings the credibility of the whole project IMO. It seems the proposer has some idea of the skillset that will be required for the implementation of the project, but no team is assembled which might drag the project down the line. The budget is broken down, but it's very coarce IMO. I don't see any reasoning behind most of the listed costs. Marketing could be 1300$ for google adds to 30k, and without the rationale provided I'm not sure if the cost is relevant or not. As a developer the timetable seems realistic to me only if there is already a team assembled and by reading the proposal for the second time I don't see that being the case. There is some plan for implementation, but again more details are needed for me because as it stands now, I can't be sure if the project is feasible or not.  The finantial and legal aspects of the proposal seem very well described, but this level of detail is lacking in other places in the proposal.   Overall I didn't find enough information to positively say if this project would be feasible or not.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I didn't see a way for a community member to track and follow along with the project development so auditability for the project might be difficult. The metrics seem ok for the end goal, but don't help with auditability. I'd suggest listing a telegram or a discord channel to send news to interested members. Theres a good roadmap that has the main milestones set. The description of the problem and solution is clearly stated.
