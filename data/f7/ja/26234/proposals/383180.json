This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs. It could then act as a pilot exhibition & proposers could then come back in a future fund with 'proof' and arrange a much larger event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides a decent outline of a plan but it is not easy to understand.\r\nA simple presentation would have helped showing how activities, resources and funds  are aligned.\r\nThe $15k is not broken down so it is impossible to work out how its going to be spent.\r\nThe proposers could really help themselves by adding their LinkedIn profiles or evidence of their experience in this area.\r\n\r\ni hope the proposer takes onboard these comments in a positive light and returns with a more coherent proposal or uses the comments section or ideafest to provide clarity on the questions answered.
