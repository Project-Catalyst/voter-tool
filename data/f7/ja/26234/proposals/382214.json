Also, there are well outlined events scheduled within specific timeline for the project and a work breakdown structure is also incorporated within the proposal. The events scheduled for the proposal will definitely increase the cardano presence in the eastern region of Ghana and also increase the number of ADA holders. Additional, the proposal also provides a detailed breakdown of the budgetary allocation for each activity the team seeks to undertake. Therefore, with the inclusion of a well-developed timelines for each event and a proper budgetary allocation, it will be very easy implementing the project successfully", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\r\nThe project provides a metric to monitor and track the progress and success of the project. For instance, the project intends to develop a database to capture the details of students who attend conferences, capture those who will remain active proposers and those who will successful create a cardano native wallet. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_732", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Great idea to educate college and University Students. the metrics of success are not specific: how many do you intend to reach out to and how many do you envision to join the community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "the proposer did not put any evidence of previous work done under WADA. the proposal mentions only the number of conferences per phase but other details are left out.

The sum requested is both reasonable and allocated responsibly. There is no reason to believe, given the request, that the two-workshop-per-month roadmap is feasible, as every conceivable provision appears planned for. If I had a quibble: An example of a more detailed lesson plan or powerpoint from such a the workshops might have made a valuable contribution, but given how well laid-out this proposal is as it stands I don't think it was absolutely essential. Still, as someone with some pedagogical experience it always helps to see illustrative direct examples of the kind of work proposers do.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "That partners with educational institutions are listed speaks very well for this proposal, and demonstrates a proactive approach to engaging communities and building relationships in Ghana.
