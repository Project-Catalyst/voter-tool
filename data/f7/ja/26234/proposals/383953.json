Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.  I also have run a web development company from 1997 and have been the author of many ground breaking projects in web and Flash related projects in my country.I have done live event with guests in studio, discussing various topics on the State Broadcasting Channels for both National and International audiences.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "\r\nThe proposers  has  provided some evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in  conference management.

But the budget is very high. When spending such a large sum of money on a project, this may not be the best way to spend at this point of time when Metaverse has not still become popular. \r\nRather than establishing in a little known proprietary metaverse its better to work with Google or Facebook in their  Metaverse properties which will be far more popular.\r\n \r\n The type and number of team members required to implement the proposal is not fully known\r\n \r\n \r\nThe team structure is listed along with various partners.\r\n \r\n\r\nHas budget been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items?\r\n The budget has  been given in detail. It is very high in my professional opinion as a CEO of a web development company for over 10 years and organizer of various events. Also considering the return on investment it is not worth it at this point. Maybe in three to five years when Metaverse is widespread it may have use.\r\n \r\nIs budget reasonable to achieve the set goals?\r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Most of it involves buying a block of land in the Somniumspace.  \r\n\r\nHas the proposer provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required to implement the proposal?\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\n \r\n\r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\n \r\nTheres a realistic timetable  to complete the work\r\n \r\nThe proposal doesnt give a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.  .\r\n \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are  described.   \r\n  \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have not been addressed \r\n\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal  \r\n \r\nGiven experience and plan presented it is not highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully\r\n\r\n\r\n This proposal is broadly expressed but budget is much higher than it could be and also at a root level it doesnt add value to the Challenge goals, hence I have given it a 1 star rating.   \r\n\r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

Throughout the Cardano ecosystem, there is heavy emphasis on educating and mass adoption of Cardano, both sometimes mesh into one objective, which is mass adoption through education. Key pointers that perhaps the proposer should note are that in this Challenge, there is a conscious effort to create meaningful participation in Project Catalyst, increase voter-proposer interaction, onboard and integrate new members into Project Catalyst etc. We have not also taken account the current focus of Cardano which is activation in the African continent. Migrating some aspects of Cardano's core interaction on a metaverse would alienate many, both from the point of view of the technical aspects such as computing power, hi-speed internet connection etc. to the social aspects such as the need to learn another layer of interaction, which is the UI of Somnium space. Things are already hard to interact with and communicate as it is. One last point the proposer should take note, shortly put, the main client here is Project Catalyst. So perhaps in future iteration, this proposal should be about how to help Project Catalyst achieve their goals in this Challenge setting. Of all the metrics in the IMPACT section, unfortunately this proposal has missed them.
