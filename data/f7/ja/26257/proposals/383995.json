This supports well the Fund 8 goals: grow contributors, grow dev and app ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this initiative can pose a conflcit of interests with the Fund 8 goal of making Cardano into an open-source projects, because commercialization of open-source projects is precieved by investors as having a low ROI. This proposal would be stronger, if it included a specific analysis or plan for how to mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the potential conflict of interests, which could constrain the impact.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the proposed budget of $500k, it is definitely possible to bring new advisors into the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, aiming for professional-grade programmes can be a limitation: the professional programes have a pre-developed pipelines and work methods aimied at maximizing financial output that might not be perfectly aligned with the cardano's mission.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion as a person who worked with a number of mentors and founders who went through acceleration, the proposal can be made stronger by reformulating it more flexibly, such as: make it easier for the funded projects to find skilled advisors or financial resources. This way a broader solution space can be considered and solutions such as an Advisor Marketplace, etc. fit in, leading to more projects and teams finding support.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of analysis of alternative ways to bring knowledge and financial resources to catalyst projects.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of discussion of the sufficiency of funds to provide change for a noticeable % of projects not just few.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics that the proposal suggests (the number of projects, the number of programmes and investors) can track activities related to the initiative.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal can be made stronger if it includes metrics tracking the progress on its intent and Cardano community's objectives, such as:\r\n1) the growth rates (users, revenue) of projects that underwent acceleration vs others.\r\n2) the % of Catalyst-funded projects that match the internal criteria of accelerator programmes.\r\n3) the % of open-source projects in accelerator programmes.\r\n4) the % of projects focused on building tools for the developer/app ecosystem of cardano.\r\n5) the sastifaction of the project swith the acceleration in comparison with alternative approaches.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the impact on Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 5, "ng": 9, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This challenge supports the Cardano community objectives as it creates a platform for Cardano startup innovation and blockchain technology co-creation.\r\nAn access to financial, human, and intellectual capital to fuel the success of Cardano and further growth of Catalyst ecosystem.\r\nI Strongly agree for this Challenge to be in the Fund 8 of Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As stated in challenge brief, more needs to be done to provide for the best breed of Catalyst-funded projects by providing pathways into professional business support, investment and mentoring programs. \r\nThe complexity in Catalyst is rising, and this challenge is needed to support this growth.

Proposers are here, in Catalyst, because it already is a source of funding and community support.
