At the same time, the proposal does not directly support the strategic goals for the Fund 8: grow the number of contributors, make Cardano an open-source project, and grow the dev and app ecosystem. Even though the several projects in this initiative can be apps, the impact given the requested budget on the ecosystem is likely limited.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the proposal could be made stronger by:\r\n1) providing an a list of high-potential use cases / pain points of science, where Cardano could provide technological solutions.\r\n2) providing a list of recent success stories to give insights about the potential impact and the required resources to achieve it.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not directly support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a detailed discusion about high-value use cases.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Catalyst community is well positioned to provide software-based solutions to important global problems, such as the quality of scientific research.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, without a discussion of specific use cases, it is hard to judge about the necessary skills and resources to prepare the solutions.

I'd suggest to consider some of the following metrics:\r\n1) the % of cardano users brought by projects developed within this initiative.\r\n2) the satisfaction of the scientific community with the created solutions in comparison with available alternatives.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points for the absense of unabiguous and computable metrics.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 1.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Bringing scientists together in an innovative way that could expand the reach of the Cardano ecosystem aligns well with the mission.
