So, I'd suggest adding questions looking into the competitive advantages created by apps and integrations, such as:\r\n1) Which use cases with significant audience we can solve better than other ecosystems?\r\n2) Which new/unusual use cases with significant audience can we bring to blockchain for the first time?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the proposed challenge budget of $2.5M and previous similar challenges run by Catalyst community, the community can definitely address the challenge and attract new developers into the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI have made a deduction of 1 point because the challenge team (the proposer) consists of only one person, and it is not clear how much experience the team has with building Cardano apps and integrations to provide experience-based advice to participants. So, I set a score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed KPIs allow to capture progress, by capturing the growth in the technical usage (transactions, tokens use, etc.) and community growth (the number of teams, etc.), which do allow to track adoption.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the underlying objective of the challenge - to grow the adoption of Cardano, I'd advice considering the following metrics:\r\n1) The % of users brought by apps built for this challenge.\r\n2) The satisfaction of users with the apps in comparison with existing alernatives.\r\n3) the marketshare of the apps built in this challenge vs their alternatives for other blockhains, etc.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point because the suggested metrics did not fully capture that impact on user adoption.\r\n- 1 points because the suggested metrics did not consider the user satisfaction and competitivenes of the solutions vs potential alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe assigned score is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 10, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This assessment is very thorough and may warrant an excellent score but I was on the verge of flagging it just to bring attention to some general confusion that will be reoccuring if the community does not clarify certain aspects of challenge setting proposals. Hence it is important to highlight for the community advisory body. \n\nOn the second metric, feasibility, the CA deducts one star because it is assumed that those who propose are also the ones who are part of the challenge team. This is not correct as I specifically asked about this in the telegram proposers' chat. Challenge teams can be mustered/gathered afterwards too.\n\nOn Verifiability, this CA has some ideas that would improve the measurement of progress towards Cardano adoption by end-users. Though feedback is good, I do not believe they warrant a 2-star deduction seeing that the existing metrics are recognised by the CA to satisfy the requirement of being able to track progress towards the challenge goal, which is what CAs are asked to evaluate. If CAs were asked \"is this the best way of doing/auditing X\" then that would lead to a very different Project Catalyst rating system. \n \nFurthermore, there seems to be some confusion in regards to what KPIs in challenge setting proposals are intended for. On one hand, these KPIs could refer to assessing the success of the challenge itself. On the other, these KPIs could also be intended to outline what KPIs proposals that are submitted to this challenge could be evaluated against. CA suggestions 1 is of the former type. Suggestions 2 and 3 could be applied to both. There is definitely room for improvement in terms of clarifying what KPIs are designed for here.
