Moreover, as evidenced by proposals in Fund 7 there are practical solutions that can improve the situation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal can be made stronger by:\r\n1) presenting historical cases where the inability to quickly \"move rapidly from volunteers to paid professionals\" has created notieceable damage to the community.\r\n2) providing an analysis of the expected ROI on quick funding.\r\n3) providing an example of the size of the issue: what is the relative number of projects that cannot be funded through Catalyst?\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of the problem.\r\nMy rating is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The catalyst community is well positioned to make improvements with regards to the speed of funding.
