As in Fund7, it would be interesting to also incorporate as KPIs the transaction volume increase and augmentation of SPO activity in LatAM. The fact of having an already established Challenge team also helps enormously in ensuring the verifiability of a second iteration of the same Challenge, where the experience pbtained from the first version will undoubtedly assist in refining concepts, engagement strategies and project onboarding after the voting process.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_787", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "\u5927\u91cf\u5c0e\u5165\u306b\u306f\u3001\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb\u306a\u8996\u70b9\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30e9\u30c6\u30f3\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306a\u3069\u306e\u65b0\u8208\u56fd\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f\u53d6\u308a\u7d44\u307f\u304c\u3001\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30dd\u30cd\u30f3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u306e\u9375\u3068\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002", "success": "\u30e9\u30c6\u30f3\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u51fa\u8eab\u8005\u3084\u30e9\u30c6\u30f3\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u306b\u7e01\u306e\u3042\u308b\u4eba\u305f\u3061\u304c\u5e45\u5e83\u304f\u96c6\u307e\u308a\u3001\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u7d50\u6210\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30a8\u30b3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u6210\u9577\u3055\u305b\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
