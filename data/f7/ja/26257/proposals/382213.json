Establishing a successful open source projects takes a lot of time and effort. So, it's much easier to find people who are already experts in developing open source projects and incentivising them to learn more about cardano.

On the other hand, it can be about the adoption of those projects (Github stars, etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso, in my opinion, it's important to bring into Cardano ecosystem more developers experienced in developing open-source projects, so a more qualified metric can be helpful: the number of contributors who are contributors of open-source projects with more than 1000 (propose your number here) github stars.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, it is important to consider the developer satisfaction with the projects and their competitiveness with the alternatives.\r\n\r\nI have deducted points for the following reasons:\r\n- 1 point for incomplete and somewhat ambiguous definitions of metrics.\r\n- 1 points for not considering the developer satisfaction and the competitiveness of projects.\r\nSo, I set the score of 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 8, "ng": 11, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Open source encourages collaboration and innovation.

The more tooling we have the more likely things will get done in our Cardano ecosystem instead of somewhere else.\r\nThe open source version of the challenge is important because it fosters sharing and building as a community (just like GNU/Linux) and help to mutualise efforts instead of everyone reinventing the wheel in their closed corner...", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As demonstrated in the 6 previous funds, there is no doubt that our community has the resources to address this challenge given the hundreds or projects already funded in previous funds and all the projects that missed being funded due to exhaustion of funds...", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Verifying the number of open source project is probably the most easiest thing to do in the computer world.
