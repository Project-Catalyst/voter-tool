We need resources to setup Grassroots hubs. But at the same time it should not be where WADA and other established groups like East Asia dominate and take all the funds.

This should be open to those countries or regions which dont have their own challenges like South Asia Central Asia Middle east, Oceanic Islands etc.  THis would have a huge impact on society so that we can create income generating oportunity as well as stake pools in rural areas.
