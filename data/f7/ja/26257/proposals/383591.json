For example, from the definition of success \"We got contract with a ERP for construction\" and \"We can get into 500 companies in 3 countries\", it speaks about the activities of a single company/team, which makes the potential impact low with regards to the Fund8 strategic goals: grow the number of contrbutors, make Carano an open-source project, and grow the app and dev ecosystem.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, even a broader challenge of building a CO2-registry can still perfectly fit within bigger DApps & Integrations challenges, so the community ROI from separating it is not clear.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discusion about specific use cases and their importance for Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of alternative approaches to prove that focus on this user segment can bring high ROI to the community.\r\nMy rating is 1.\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Assuming a broader challenge of building a blockchain-based CO2-emissions registry, the Catalyst community is well positioned to propose and implement solutions for that.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the challenge is formulated as a project for a single company and because it does not provide any references supporting the skills and the experience of the team, it looks risky.\r\n\r\nI can suggest the following to improve the feasibility of the proposal:\r\n1) Provide an overview the neccessary problems/use cases that need to be solved to have a registry that can cover 50+% of global CO2 emissions.\r\n2) Provide examples of recent success stories with regards to tracking of CO2.\r\n3) Discuss the funds and technologies necessary to track 5%, 25%, and 50% of global CO2 emissions.\r\n4) Discuss best practices of cost-effective tracking of CO2\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\n- 1 point for the challenge team from one proposer, reducing the ability to provide advice and experience-based insights to participants.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The suggested metrics (measure scope?, measure steel, measure cement) are ambiguously defined: what is scope? in which units to measure steel? would the steel be categoriezed based on % of carbon, etc?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the suggested metrics do now allow to track progress of the implied problem (the tracking of global CO2 emissions). Out of my product management experience, looking at some of the following metrics could make the proposal stronger:\r\n1) % of the global CO2 emissions tracked.\r\n2) the cost of tracking each incremental % of CO2 emissions.\r\n3) % of Cardano users onboarded as part of  projects within this initiative.\r\n4) the satisfaction of users/partners with the proposed solutions vs alternative ones.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "There is no obvious alignment in this challenge to achieving Cardano's mission as defined by the Fund 8 challenge setting strategic goals.
