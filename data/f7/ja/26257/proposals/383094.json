However, at the risk of being labelled 'subjective' I don't agree strongly enough to give this proposal five stars because I cite the proposer's own subjectivity by stating, \"Hydra will not solve every scaling problem in Cardano\". I question the basis for this assumption and would argue that Hydra's theoretical 2 million tps will solve the scaling problem. But that in itself is an assumption hence the question, why don't we wait and see? This challenge may well be required but maybe at a later funding stage when Hydra is released and demonstrates that there is room for improvement required, or that we may want alternatives to Hydra to expand our scaling options.

Certainly milkomedia.io who will soon release their EVM sidechain are marketing the possibilities in the area so this challenge may well prove to be feasible.
