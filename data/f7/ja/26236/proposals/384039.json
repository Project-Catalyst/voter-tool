The main goal of this proposal is to improve accountability and transparency in a scalable and adaptable manner. I believe that the proposer's goal of increasing the community's involvement in proposal iteration is a great idea. However, if the proposer could include information about how they could use their project for fund distribution in the future, it would help voters better understand it in relation to the challenge category it fits under.  Another question I have is with regards to scalability. How will this concept be scaled to magnitudes of 10x or even 100x? The proposer could include information to address that question.

However, the proposer could provide some more details about the proposal overall that would strengthen it. For example, how will interested parties be selected to be on the Dandelion project?

The proposer mentioned that they will provide a public record of the meetings, which is good for auditability.

Rinse and repeat, chasing the next problem.  In many other scenarios has shown being an spectacular tool and in the Rapid Fund area could not be different. In fact, the Agile methodology is one of the tools that the Dapps certification process will use.\r\n\r\nThe general picture describe for the proposal has logic:  The proponent wants to develop a framework  and then test the framework in an ecosystem that he knows well.  The agile team would be made up of collaborators from diverse backgrounds in the Cardano ecosystem (this openness gives the proposal a valuable dose of transparency).  \r\n\r\nHowever, it is not clear what substance is being studied.  That is, the proposal describes techniques or moves to win the game but does not provide details about the opponent, field conditions, weather, etc. I know the ultimate goal is to develop a framework to contribute to the community's needed rapid funding efforts, but after reading the proposal 4 times, my mind has to make a lot of assumptions connecting the dots (I hoped that the miro board help me with a more nuclear information, but again, it describes only the moves) \r\n\r\nQuestions such as the following arise:  \r\n\r\n- What makes Dandelion project so special?  I'm sure that the reader wants to feel some of the proponent inspiration about that project.\r\n\r\n- What would be the procedure for recruiting Agile team members?\r\n\r\n- How does prescribing Dandelion as a testing ground not compromise the search for a future framework that is applicable to a general problem, in this case, finding a Rapid Funding Mechanism?
