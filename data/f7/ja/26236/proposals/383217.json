If a smart contract has to be designed with specific deliverable for every project, this may slow things down even more?

Although it is a very important topic, it is not so aligned with the Challenge since it's goal is to create and/or suggest other mechanisms to choose projects and distribute funding to them without going through the usual Catalyst process, which takes 3 months overall, and payment is done monthly. That being said, the concept of this proposal is still valid, but this is probably something that IOG is currently working on already, and the team didn't mentioned anything about talking to IOG about it. A similar thing happened to the Community Advisors rewards mechanism: some CAs wanted to develop a new, improved mechanisms, but they consulted IOG, which mentioned that they were already working on it, so the CAs decided to wait for it to be release instead of working in parallel. In any case, if this proposal is funded, it would be the case to contact IOG and work closely with them, maybe using the budget to pay for the developer to support IOG's development or some other deal, it this is to be the case. The proposers are right when they say that this would highly underber IOG's team and free their time to perform more productive work, which would benefit the whole ecosystem, and what is also essential to scale-up Catalyst. Some KPIs could be added to be able to measure the impact of the proposal, such as number of hours saved by IOG team every Fund, if this proposal is successful.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team is known in the Catalyst community, as they are active members in the Eastern Town Hall project, as well as SPOs, Plutus Pioneers and more.

Nguyen Van Hieu seems to be the only member of the team who is going to work on the proposed smart contracts, and it is mentioned that he participated on the Plutus Pioneers Program. Having participated myself, I'm not sure if the participation there is enough to enable someone to develop the smart contracts mentioned in the proposal, since it's mainly an introductory course. Some past work or code examples and/or repository would really benefit the feasibility of the proposal, as we would know with more assurance that he's able to deliver. The budget is well explained, but some info would be good to be included. For example: is the DevOps going to work full time on this? Also, 2h a week for project management seems good but I see a risk that it might not be enough, specially due to the fact that some involviment with IOG might be needed and recurrent meeting might be necessary. The proposers are aware of some risks that were mentioned in the proposal, but they lacked to mention the risk of working in parellel with IOG and at the end they end up not using their development, and use something developed by IOG itself.

I think that ada would be the most relevant token, but clarifying that in the proposal would be helpful for voters to better understand the project.\r\n\r\nI also appreciate the proposers' honesty in acknowledging that they may come across unforeseen circumstances that could delay the project. One question I have is, in the event that the project is delayed, what will the proposers do to ensure that the community can still place their faith in the proposers to complete the project?

Are you hearing about the Van Halen contract clause?  Basically, Van Halen (the rock music band) demanded a bowl full of M&M's as one of their requirements to play in public. As a particular feature, that bowl could not contain any brown M&M's.  If this clause was violated, the band could get paid without performing.  \r\n\r\nAbsurd as it may seem, this clause was a sampling technique to know if the contract had been read carefully enough to be fully complied with.

And let me tell you with all honesty: the bullets waiting to be fired from this campaign are as intelligent, compelling and necessary as yours.    Plus, this is the first version of the Rapid Funding Mechanism campaign, so many shots will have to be fired to find a solution.\r\n\r\nOverall, the proposal touches on a topic that absolutely needs to be explored.  Smart Contracts are one of the best tricks we have, so why not use it to solve our problems? \r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal presents an interesting approach to the problem.  \r\n\r\nBut, Madam voter and Mr. voter, if you find the proposal a bit costly, I don't blame you.
