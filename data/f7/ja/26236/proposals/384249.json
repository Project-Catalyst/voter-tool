The problem is time.  And time is in function of the necessary (yes, necessary) hurdles to conclude: a) the proposal submitted for Rapid Funding corresponds to a real need in the community b) the proposal can effectively address that need.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal has experienced people in charge and the Catalyst Circle is a trusted body in Cardano's governance structure.  Its ideas evaluation technique (described in the proposal) is a process curated by many iterations in the Cardano Governance environment.  Potentially that technique can be a great contribution to a bigger problem:  we need an effcient methodology for discovering and processing ideas, in less time and with fewer obstacles. And of course, with less risk, because  It's not a secret that discovering truly effective ideas is a business with a low probability of success (and that fact is a reality beyond the control of humans, include the Catalyst Circle).   However, it is an unavoidable job for any organization seeking to evolve.\r\n\r\nBasically, I think the proposal says: \"let's give the guys their funding. They know what they are doing.\"  Meanwhile, how to detect, evaluate and fund ideas with real impact potential, with a minimum amount of obstacles but with the maximum possible risk reduction, yet screams for a solution.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the solution to the Rapid funding problem lies beyond the Catalyst Circle itself. Perhaps we need deeper integration of the Catalyst Circle's expertise and experience into the overall operation of proposal funding across the Catalyst Project. And perhaps endowing the Catalyst Circle with its own funds may mean alienating a body that can change for the better the way proposals are evaluated and funded across the hole Catalyst Project.  \r\n\r\nI believe that the Catalyst Circle is precisely one of the places where an efficient methodology for processing ideas can emerge.  \r\n\r\nSo, perhaps the funds are needed not to find a Rapid Funding Mechanism, they are needed for the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself, which in its transition could teach to the hole ecosystem a better way to evaluate and select proposals.

But it seems to me that the implementation of the proposal corresponds to the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself and not precisely to the search for a Rapid  Funding Mechanism.  However, the Catalyst Circle is a governance tool in our quest for governance independence.  Therefore, the exercise of providing funding to the Circle does not deviate from the needs of the Cardano ecosystem.
