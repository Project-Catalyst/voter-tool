In this way, new professionals would understand what, after all, the ecosystem is and what its decentralized identity system is, and with that, new members would certainly be added to the community. It's also very positive how proponents put current problems into context - so we're more focused on what they need to solve. This proposal solves the objectives of two challenges: the present challenge, by Atala Prism, since, as I said, new users would be joined, and it would also directly benefit Japan, disseminating our blockchain technologies there, as the specific challenge about Japan search. It is possible to understand 100% of what is intended to be done through the list of activities found in \"detailed plan\", and I assure you, this is one of the most positive proposals for the Cardano ecosystem that I have evaluated so far at f7: introducing the Japanese market Atala Prism , NFT and various technologies relevant to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the detailed plan, we have the main activities that have just been developed, such as commenting on impact. Proponents also provide a roadmap that temporally organizes the activities. However, this script should be more detailed, in my opinion. For example: \"5~6th month: Engagement expansion\". How would this expansion take place, what marketing strategies would be developed here? About the team, I think this part is perfect. We have the names, main roles and linkedin profiles of those involved. In this way, we get to know the team well and understand its specificities, and they are certainly capable of successfully executing the project, since the professional activities of those involved are well diversified and include specialists in Cardano (ambassadors and SPOs). Finally, the budget is also explained in a very satisfactory way, we know how the amount of 50k, which despite being high, makes sense for this proposal, will be used. How it will be divided and why each part corresponds to each percentage of the final amount. Ultimately, the only improvement I can identify here would be an increase in script details.

The KPIs serve to analyze the reflection of this proposal in Japan - there are two, as the proponents point out: the amount of translated materials and the audience reached with the \"learn to win\" program. This last part is something that the team itself should analyze, collect data and present to the rest of the community. As it is a project aimed at the Japanese target audience, it would be very interesting for some member of the community from the country to accompany this proposal and establish continuous contact with the rest of the community.

Even the scope of this challenge would better fit in \u201cConnecting Japan/\u65e5\u672c Community\u201d or \u201cMultilingual resources\u201d since it\u2019s mostly about translating documents from English to Japanese.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "While the proposers have provided information regarding their experience and skills, they have not provided any links that would prove that information. Beyond the main goal of this proposal there are others included, that are not well detailed and derail from the focus on the main one. Therefore, as I have suggested in the above assessment, I believe this project would benefit from having it be split up in 2 or 3 different proposals, each submitted in its own challenge, with its own budget and metrics.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The budget has been well divided into reasonable sections, yet the KPIs paragraph is extremely short and vague, and not addressing all the objectives of the proposal.

I suggest the team re-submit this proposal in a future fund with some of the feedback incorporated.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 2, "ng": 21, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "ATALA Prism Pioneers Program\u306e\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u542b\u3080\u3001AtalaPrism\u304a\u3088\u3073DID\u95a2\u9023\u8cc7\u6599\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7ffb\u8a33\u7248\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u3002", "experience": "\u30d7\u30ed\u30c0\u30af\u30c8\u30d7\u30e9\u30f3\u30ca\u30fc\nPh.D.\u30b5\u30a4\u30a8\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30b9\u30c8\uff08\u30b4\u30fc\u30c9\u30f3\u4f1a\u8b70\u62db\u5f85\u8b1b\u6f14\u8005\uff09\n\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\n\u30a2\u30bf\u30e9\u30fb\u30d1\u30a4\u30aa\u30cb\u30a2\u30fb\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\n\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\u30ce\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30b5\u30c0\u30fc\nSPO\nIOG"}
