The idea of this proposal is to figure out what would be required to implement it into a gaming environment and then make that available to the community via 2 articles and a published use-case. That is also the reason the funding requested is so low. \nDetailed KPIs linked to design level decisions are near impossible to figure out, especially since the Atala Pioneer resources are not even yet available. Our test-case is planned within our Discord server for Duo, our flag-ship game, which is open to anybody. \nThe burden of auditability requested by the reviewer seems very high, especially given the small amount of technical information available about Atala."}], "solution": "Atala PRISM\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u8cc7\u7523\u306f\u30a6\u30a9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u7d10\u4ed8\u3051\u3089\u308c\u3001\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30b3\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u533f\u540d\u6027\u304c\u7dad\u6301\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "Tech Founder & CTO + Plutus Pioneer + Fund 6 + full team of engineers\u3068\u4e26\u3093\u306710\u5e74\u3002(\u4e0b\u8a18\u53c2\u7167)"}
