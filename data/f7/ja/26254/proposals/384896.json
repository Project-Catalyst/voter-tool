As a filmmaker: I can see this as having great value to fundraise for future projects, so that is where I find the \"acceleration\" of the decentralized identity.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Love the experience given. Gimbalabs, Plutus, and a diverse team outlined at https://winwin-team.web.app/ . I like that they provided this link, and much about their team's experience. I would feel confident funding this proposal due to their team members.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I like how easy it is to evaluate this proposal.

When people donate their money they deserve to be guaranteed that they are sending that money to the exact person they mean to and the causes they support. If the team is able to pull off what is presented in the proposal it would pay dividends for the ecosystem and likely would encourage entire sectors/groups to move over to Cardano, further increasing the impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, it is likely this proposal will be implemented successfully based on the experience and plan presented. The roadmap is well laid out with a clear timeline and deliverables are identified at each stage. The budget also seems reasonable given the potential upside of this project. Other proposers should take note on how to present the team to the community: where voters don't need to just take the word of the proposers to exemplify their ability to deliver but instead can go and see for themselves. This openness allows opportunities for individuals who want to learn more to get in touch. I would have liked to see at least a mock up or outline of the platform, and the process users would need to go through to develop the DID but based on the team's past success I am still confident in their ability to deliver. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the proposal provides sufficient information to audit its progress and success. The proposers provide a clear roadmap, milestones, and KPIs which the community can measure against. The proposers also intend to put their product on the testnet prior to mainnet which enables community members to actually get in and test it out. This is likely to improve the auditability and success because any potential errors or bugs would be tested for in advance. Knowing how active the Cardano Community is, this would be a welcome invitation and give additional weight to the project. As the majority of the budget is for the development of the platform itself, voters will easily be able to measure if the project was a success by having a working product on mainnet.

Unfortunately, the proposal does not provide a solution. PRISM technology alone doesn't allow for the identification of trusted entities. Only a governance framework and trust registry can begin to address the identified problem, and this proposal makes no mention of either. There is no discussion on how any entities that might register for a DID would be verified, and that is the key to solving the problem. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal provides easy to access links to background information about all the team members and their skills and experiences. They are accomplished software engineers and dedicated community members. It seems that several members of the team participated in the Atala PRISM pioneers program. Thus the lack of a clear explanation of how the technology would be used to solve the problem is all the more surprising.

However, as Atala PRISM is not yet available on Cardano's mainnet, the proposal would be strengthened by recognizing this as a risk and explaining their plan should PRISM's mainnet launch be delayed. The only KPI that addresses the stated problem, which is to verify whether entities can be trusted, states that the team will measure \"Number of entities with PRISM DIDs and conversation rate of signed up entities to Prism DID verified entities.\" It would be helpful to provide more detail regarding what will be measured. The KPI seems to imply that someone will be verifying an entity after that entity has been issued a DID.  It isn't clear what is meant by \"conversion\" or how an entity will become a \"Prism DID verified entity.\" Without that detail or explanation of what that process looks like, it would be impossible to audit the KPI.
