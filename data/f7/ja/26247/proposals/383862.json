It basically enables anyone to become an SPO, even without hardware and thus effectively rewrites the SPO function within the ecosystem. It unlocks the ability to rent computing power from users in a tokenised manner, compensating all parties involved, instead of datacenters. This is a great opportunity to increase the robustness of both ecosystems. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very experienced with Dr. Kabir Veitas, the NuNet CEO as the teamleader. Given that a solution like this is in very high demand and there is an ability to self-fund part of the project, makes this highly feasible.
