I believ the sentence in the proposal: 'Refinement of data collection techniques to find what works best in an African context' is key here. The AI-solutions are not defined yet as it relies on the data that is yet to be gathered. The current focus by this project is set on efficiency increasement.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is quite auditable as all necessary components are present to assess this. Yet while going through the proposal there is an underlying feeling that it needs a risk analysis for when civilians tend to be reluctant in providing the necessary datasets.

This will be very beneficial both to the Cardano ecosystem, and to the local population, by developing new perspectives The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they and their project partners will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

Why only Africa? There are ultra poor people all over the world. Cardano community should not favor one region so much over other regions while ignoring the other regions.

Central Asia, South Asia, South East Asia, Siberia, Oceania, Caribbean Islands. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "THis is a very high budget. Even though the same WADA team is doing it, I feel they are overreaching themselves. They have many proposals on this fund and many funded proposals available on previous funds. I dont think they can fulfill all these at the same time.  THis is not personal, if anyone thinks it is. It is merely acknowledging that the same team of people can only do so much. They cannot do infinite amount of work. This is a large project and a high budget. But it seems the same people are represented in every one of the WADA projects. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "While metrics have been provided, on the simple basis that the same people are doing this job as well as tens of other proposals in this fund alone, leave aside the other funds they have got funding, It is not likely they can perform this project effectively.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 3, "ng": 13, "nfo": 11, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I liked the overall idea of AI Oracles in the African Market project proposal, and the overall defined activities and milestones sounded like a rational idea to me, not only for the requested investment value but also for the overall project proposal. However the breakdown of the requested investment of 100K was not fully clear the costs and budget allocation and that's why I haven't given a 5. Was also expecting a timeline overview of the activities (high-level is there but a different level of granularity will be useful) and for a more clear understand of the milestones and roadmap.\nBut the idea and constructs of the project seem well-designed. Even so, as described before, the general assumptions have been considered as well as the notion constructs. I would suggest that for the next phases, there should be additional consideration given to the financial constrains and pitfalls and effective monitoring mechanisms.

After having read this well-written proposal, I can also strongly agree that it will bring tremendous positive impact both for Africa and to CVardano's mission. The proposal clearly explains a from-the-ground-up approach to their project identifying what is missing, what needs to be completed and how, in order to lay down the platform to build AI tools and infrastructure. It's easy for someone in the developed world to take for granted some of the basic data points described in this document because the gathering, storage and use of such Intelligence is commonly used in business, politics, policies and normal progress. The clarity of the approach and the plan provides confidence that the team behind this endeavour know what they are doing.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "My initial thought after having read the preamble and the plan was one of doubt due to the sheer scale of the undertaking. But funds requested, high thought it might be, is a realistic reflection of the amount of work that needs to be done. I imagine $100k will go further in an African project than it would in a western country so the listed solution/plan and the month-by-month roadmap looks very achievable. Where the project can improve upon their presentation is in a more detailed breakdown of the Budget Rationale. This is presented at a high level and for the amount requested, I feel the reader deserves granularity of information in the same way the rest of the document had been written, so as to leave no doubt. This however did not impact my strong agreement of this project's feasibility. I would also suggest links to be provided for each direct team member of this project though again, this did not impact my assessment. The WADA Alliance is a known & active participants of the Cardano Community and spearheads a number of IOG's ventures in the continent. In any case, a quick LinkedIn search leads to the qualifications of the members and the accompanying video presentation also presents the entire WADA Alliance team which includes the participants of this proposal. Lastly, their current relationship with Singularity NET via 1000BlackVoices is a such sign of support from the very entity this challenge was set up for so the chances for success is further improved.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The foundation of this proposal is the gathering of data in order to build the AI infrastructure and tooling. This can essentially act as the auditable point for this project. In addition, the large amount requested and the participation of accounting and legal personnel would very likely lead to auditable artefacts as the plan progresses. The WADA Alliance are also notorious for updating their website of all the projects past and current and this can act as another channel for information. Overall, I strongly agree that this project is highly auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 9, "ng": 15, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u7269\u7406\u7684\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u306b\u63a5\u7d9a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30d5\u30ea\u30ab\u306eAI\u30aa\u30e9\u30af\u30eb\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306b\u706b\u3092\u3064\u3051\u308b\u306b\u306f\u3001\u6226\u7565\u7684\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u53ce\u96c6\u8a08\u753b\u304c\u4e0d\u53ef\u6b20\u3067\u3059\u3002", "experience": "\u30c6\u30af\u30ce\u30ed\u30b8\u30fc\u5206\u91ce\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b50\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\n1000 Black Voices\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30e9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u901a\u3058\u305fSingularityNET\u3068\u306e\u95a2\u4fc2\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066"}
