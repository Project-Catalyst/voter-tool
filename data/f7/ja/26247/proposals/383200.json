You can't build ML models without data and this would make the data accessible to the larger ML community without having to go through all the hassle of running your own node. Will increase the number of people experimenting on Cardano Blockchain data which is the first step to producing useful ML based products. My one question is what is the funding model going forward to keep the service running. How many people/queries can that AWS instance usefully serve? If the proposers aren't intending on making a commercial product out of this, a nice output could be to create and AWS package that people could run on their own instance. This would allow someone to prototype a product here, then switch to their own instance to run their product to manage their own reliability and data access.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a relatively simple plan and the proposers have ample experience to execute. The budget is a little messy, total is set at 30k, so taking out fixed components that leaves 5k for the AWS service which at $160.month is 31.25 months. Is that how long they intend to leave it running for? Or will they spin up more instances for a shorter period?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Delivery of the service is in one sense easy to audit. However it would be better if the proposers put some numbers around the amount of data/queries they expect to be able to handle. Measurement of success would be better served by targeting a number of unique users of the service, and even better a number of new projects that get spawned out of initial access to the data here and then going on to running their own node once they prove up their idea.

To that respect, this is a great idea in order to create more insights and identify efficiency opportunities. Deploying it as a free service would lower utility barrier and in extent the more it gets used, the more efficiency gain can be realised. Therefore, the ROI (return on intention) gets fulfilled as it would basically pay itsself back.
