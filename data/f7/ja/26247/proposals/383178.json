Seems like a great project and its good to get projects using AI which provide a service to the community. It would be nice to have a more clearly defined deliverable than just design the model.

Will the code be released?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is not very - detailed research tokens, design reinforcement model. The proposer claims experience in the space however doesn't provide any qualifications or references other than to the Photrek website.\r\nAs there are not really any details on what will be implemented, its hard to give it a high likelihood of successful implementation.\r\nWhat does Design the model mean? Are you actually going to fit the model to data and test it? Its not clear to me that reinforcement learning is the right category of algorithms for pricing illiquid securities. This is generally used when you have an environment you can repeatedly simulate and take different action each time to find the best course of action. Valuing illiquid tokens seems more like a classification problem. Find the correlation (or other parametric/non-parametric relationship) between coins and use that to change the value of an illiquid coin when coins it has a relationship with move.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer aims to research the tokens and design a model, however the outputs of this project are not very well defined. Will you implement the model. Train and test it? The proposer has not given any clear metrics for success which can be measured. They have stated that success would be identification of a set of potentially valuable tokens or a set of features useful for valuation. That doesn't line up well with the states goal of valuing the illiquid securities for which the metrics would be accuracy of valuation for an illiquid token which has not traded when a price event occurs against which we then have visibility.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 6, "ng": 19, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Working in the trade of consumer goods, it has come to my attention that the value of an asset in markets is primarily determined by their supply and demand volumes.
