Success would require that the generated pictures are one people actually want to use. I would be nice to have more details on what types of morphing are intended. I don't see any information on where the images themselves are intended to be hosted? Given the plan is to initially use the hardware then switch to cload software, I am not sure the best use of funds is buying a $6k computer. How long are you intending to use the PC for before switching to the cloud? Could you get that much compute for less than $6k?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has set out a timeline against which delivery can be audited.
