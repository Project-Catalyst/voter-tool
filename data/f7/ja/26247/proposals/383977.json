It can't evolve into something that starts to label anything and everything against a certain agenda as hatespeech. It is good that there is an acknowledgement in the proposal that this project is not supposed to tell what the truth is, as these are all subjective in nature and pose a real danger to censorship. So the question that needs to be asked would be wether or not the world would be a better place by censoring articles that are (politically) incorrect?

There has been put some thought in making this project self-fundable by means of SPO-funding and revenue from ML-services on SingularityNet. \r\nOne possible loophole that could be identified is what would keep a user from intentionally searching from articles that are registered as malicious in your system in order to reap daily rewards.

The lack of a roadmap has been accounted for for reasons that the proposers do not wish to make guesses on uncertainties in the near future, but they have vowed to publish this as soon as possible, an openness which is appreciated. On the website there is limited information available on the team members, which could be elaborated a bit more in terms of auditability improvement.

The problem I have is that how far does their plugin goes into telling something is \"fake news\" since the plugin doesn't actually tell you it's true/false to quote them \"Verifee does not determine what is and is not true.
