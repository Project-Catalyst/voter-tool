Personally, I'm a huge fan of turning things into financially viable investments, but the danger in these things is that people will start to disregard scientific evidence to back things up and go straight for the money. This could turn into a lot of backing for ideas that may have received counter-evidence, while completely disregarding that evidence as it would affect the investment made. So there is some ethics at play here to what degree this should be possible and desirable. Therefore I feel inclined to disagree.

In fact, we fully agree with your point. \nToday, most self-defined impact funds have an opportunistic approach without any scientific backup or reflection on the long-term impact.\nOn the other hand, when you look at early ventures, it\u2019s often difficult to evaluate upfront their potential impact (positive and negative). Thus, to tackle this issue and maximize impact generation, we have chosen to adopt the following strategy.\n- Focusing our project selection on two key points: a) The intention of impact - what counts the most is the entrepreneur\u2019s ambition and b) making sure that the business model structure does not inherently imply a negative impact. For example, if the growth of a company is linked to the production of tangible products, the need for scalability and the impact intention can quickly become misaligned\n- Building the impact roadmap (objectives, timeframe, milestones) with the founders and scientific experts. We do not wait for project owners to generate impact, we help them in doing  so progressively.\n\nWith this system, we hope to avoid the main errors you mention. We will develop these points in our upcoming Medium articles (https://medium.com/@cardashift)."}, {"q0": "Also in line with the SDGs, this is a very well thought out proposal to truly scale up impactful Cardano projects.\r\n\r\nThe only question mark is the ambiguous \"up to 3 Catalyst impact projects\" goal.
