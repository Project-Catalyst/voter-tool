The biggest question mark is the estimated cost ($200,000 USD). Trying to raise all that from Project Catalyst is a long shot.

Another question mark is the timing. According to the timeline the first phase (sourcing) is supposed to start already 1 January, 2022. However, the Catalyst funding would only be available soonest in late February. Therefore, creating interest, spreading the word and engaging the community would have to happen completely without funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Problems statement \"Without communities, blockchain ecosystems and decentralization could not take hold.\" is matched with a solution: \"A decentralised governance experience through an avant-gardiste incubation program in Tunisia that aim to educate and build an eco-system.\" The slides talk about a DAO but it's not opened up when/how/where/why is that DAO formed.
