This is very much the type of professional business support that the challenge aims to generate. \n\nWolfram did not make it easy to figure this out, since they put their proposal on Wolfram Cloud rather than in Ideascale (it took me a while to figure out that I could access it my creating an ID).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is little question that Wolfram Blockchain Labs has the capability to deliver assistance to Cardano start-ups, and they have a highly-qualified 5-person team with relevant experience for providing such support.

Further, the description of the support of what would be involved in the program is very general, so it is somewhat difficult to determine what would be delivered and how.

What is your process on this? Since there is no roadmap presented we get no information on how this project will enroll people and what timeframe we are talking about.
