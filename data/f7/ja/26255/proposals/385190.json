Perhaps a better way to run this would be in the spirit of decentralization similar to how DAOs are runned, in which the proposers can serve more as a facilitator in the process instead of the ones running everything, and leave the actual functioning of 'firm' to the  mentors and mentees who are invested in the community. This can allow it to be self-sustaining in the long run, so in the short run what the proposers can do is to get the infrastructure needed up and running, for example through designing incentive mechanisms (think: DAOs, POAP, Tokenomics etc) to build up the community and keep them invested.
