Amount of content originally created in Polish\r\n\r\n2. Amount of content translated into Polish\r\n\r\n3. Number of users that have joined local Cardano groups\r\n\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\n\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the out\r\nput of information on the website and social media pages. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system. \r\nI have given this proposal a 5 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to write articles and put links to some of the articles if published on social media or mass media, on the proposal itself .

This also includes costs of creating podcasts and merchandise. Also carrying out quizzes, kahoots and livestreams on various channels.They have also identified marketing and awareness building costs with ad costs, consultations and other promotional costs.

Both of them are described understandable clearly not only about what is being done but also how to do.\r\n- The budget is outlined and split into identifiable items very detailed .
