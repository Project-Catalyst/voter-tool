Also. how to guarantee these students will really be \"well informed\"? Maybe exams could be made, with different types of questions.\r\n2) will the students have a limited time to reply? I understand having fast reply is essential to guarantee a good user experience. At the same quality, it is necessary to ensure the quality/assertiveness of the information provided.\r\n3) Last, I'd highlight here in the proposal who the target audience is. Is the ovjective to mainly address new member already engaged questions or to attract still nont engaged people? This changes a lot the communication strategy.\r\n\r\nI like the idea to start small and see scale up aftewards and to have an open log with the Q&A, especially translating the most reputable one.

The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is comprehensive and well laid out. It is a simple enough plan, easy to execute.  As questions grow the repository would also grow. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding languages and students to answer questions. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among non English speaking newcomes to DLT and Cardano\r\n\r\nI cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge but I also say it would be useful hence i have given it a 3 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have  not provided evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in building these sort of projects. The Linkedin Profiles of Core leadership has not been provided. They are students at a business school in France. While the concept is simple,no proof has been given that they are able to execute this plan.  The links are not sufficient. \r\nI have visited the links.but its to the corporate site of the school, not anything of the proposers themselves. I cannot assess if the proposer is competent to build this content since no information has been given as to prior experience in this area. \r\nThe proposal   has stated that the students of the school from 10 countries will work together and reach out to other students.  There is no guarantee if other students will join, or if they would be competent in providing this service in an efficient and timely manner.He has not provided the team structure of members and their capabilities and has mentioned other partners who he would work with such as web developer.\r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. They have allocated themselves 1200 USD for learning.  This should not be a cost factor per se since learning is a voluntary process and should not need to be paid for. They can charge for answering questions but learning itself should not be charged for. 2000 USD to create a simple web page by which questions can be added and a repository created is far too high, speaking in my professional opinion as a web and solutions developer for over 20 years. The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 2000 USD for a simple web site seems somewhat high to be reasonable. \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal  does not give a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has no plan stated with no detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of development. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have not been addressed \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal . Given experience and plan presented it is hard to say this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 1 star rating. Also I have rated it like this because the budget is too high for such a project.  \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\nGiven experience and plan presented and the other issues mentioned above, it is highly unlikely this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given a 1 star rating. If these issues are addressed and you resubmit you would have a good chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "\r\nThere is no clear roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\nThere are some clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal. These include reaching over 1000 people, and getting at least 20 to be active in Cardano and Catalyst. Having interaction with at least 3 languages and 1000 Q per month to be answered. \r\nThere is no basis to know how they plan to reach these 1000 people or persuade 20 of them to be active. There is no way to know how they plan to get 1000 questions per month  since that presumes everyone who is reached will have a question and keeping asking at least one question a month. This is not realistic.\r\n\r\nNo marketing budget has been allocated. \r\nThere is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem and but there is no practical solution which would solve the problem. \r\nThe proposer has not identified possible hurdles, challenges and difficulties. \r\nThe information provided is not  sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence I have given it a 2 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "it is a good idea to develop a multilingual page. the proposer mentioned a landing page where the viewer will now select the language to interact in. this requires the viewer to know the language in which the landing page is crafted before accessing the language he wants to interact in.
