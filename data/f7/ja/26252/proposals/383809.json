You need to consider that a lot of projects and teams want those funds so you should show them how exactly you are going to use them. No schedule or milestones are provided for the proposal.

Feedback: Create detailed plan on what each aspect of the proposal needs work and time-wise and try to create milestones from it. The proposer has not considered or discussed any possible risks or challenges that might occur for the proposal. Technical details are not explained, hence it is difficult to assess both the actual skills of the proposer and the implementability of the proposal. Feedback: Explain the technical details behind your proposal. This will not just benefit the community in understanding it, but it will also help you to improve your entire proposal.
