I cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge  hence i have given it a 2 star rating.\r\n.\r\n \r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject.

The budget has  not been outlined clearly Everything seems to have the same price.  ALso the price is very high considering what the output is. Prices seem to have been arbitrarily chosen.
