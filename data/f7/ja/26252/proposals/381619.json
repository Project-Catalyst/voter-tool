This enables greater acceptance and browsability of Catalyst. This would also enable more educated voters \r\n  Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  the number of videos, and the number of languges each will be translated into.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of interviews that are done and videos that are created. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and  among voters regarding various projects and give a benefit to proposers by enabling them to easily and effectively reach a larger audience than those who would be reading proposals.\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and do interviews , and put links to some of the videos/interviews  on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. Get some interviews published in local media of your country, whether social media or mass media, and share the published article or video link. That also adds lot of credibility\r\n \r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has   provided evidence  of herself  where her relevant skills and experience is clear since she is a moderator and Town Hall organizer. SHe has included her LinkedIn profile.\r\n These links are sufficient since she is a reputed Town Hall moderator. Her skills required for the proposal are of an interviewer and moderator which she is doing every week at the Town Hall anyway.I visited the profile.The proposer is quite competent to do interviews and make videos.\r\n \r\nThe proposal  gives details of other external services providers such as translators, video creators, video editors etc. No details of these individuals are given.\r\nThere is no team structure and breakdown given as in named individuals but the specific roles are clearly laid out. \r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as software and domain subscriptions, translators and  and other costs.   The budget is  very reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required.The timetable is realstic to carry out interviews and produce the videos. \r\nThe proposal  does  provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of steps needing to be completed for each finished video.\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.   \r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects . The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal beyond the short time frame between submission of proposals to voting time. She identifies that a critical success factor is having a good team to quickly turn out videos.\r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.

Has not mentioned how often interviews will be done.There are  clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal  they could define number of videos created, number of translated versions done, how many videos uploaded in a week, views of each video, no of feedback comments, how many shares of each video. There is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem . \r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have been identified by the proposer as the short time window available between the time the proposals are closed, and voting begins. The risk is that only a few videos would be completed which could give an unfair advantage to those who were interviewed. \r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information provided is  somewhat sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence i have given a 4 star rating. \r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "GREAT IDEAS!

The budget is clearly broken down into details. Having said all that however, there aren't any details regarding what are the team will consist of, other than telling us that the proposer 'will build a team after this'. It would be better if the proposer could explain how the team is created, for example: recruit people from Townhall Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, -who can speak english- to help with interviewing their respective country's proposal. Another great idea would be recruiting well-known or small YouTuber to help with interviewing people about their proposal, e.g Thinking Crypto.
