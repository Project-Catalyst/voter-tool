This proposal shows somewhat how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would create a community built around their proprietary LMS. This may be a disadvantage where since its proprietary it may have vulnerabilities.Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. These include Number of students on the LMS, No of members opting for courses, daily increase of members, of community, No of comments, posts, shares. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is not very comprehensive but what they have included is well laid out. It is a complex plan, and may require many skillsets which are being sourced from external providers, to execute.   Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding languages and courses. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among non English speaking newcomes to DLT and Cardano starting from Tamil Community.I cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge but I also say it would be useful hence i have given it a 3 star rating.\r\nIt is a complex project.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have  not provided evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in building these sort of projects.

The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 250 USD for a video  and 125 USD for a podcast episode seems somewhat high to be reasonable. 300 USD per month for 3 posts and 5 stories per week is high.\r\n\r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable p. lan if additional funding is required . \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met.  \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal gives a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.

Given experience and plan presented this proposal may be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 2 star rating.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.
