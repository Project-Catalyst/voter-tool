There are just a couple of paragraphs more or less cut and pasted from the proposer's company's website, and I cannot see any connection to Cardano at all.  Even if I want to give the benefit of the doubt that the project would be in context of the Cardano ecosystem, I see very little detail about what project is actually proposed, making it difficult to assess potential impact.

Unfortunately I did not find any explanation for this in the problem or the detailed plan either. It is not good when a problem statement, instead of telling you something that you can understand easily, leaves you with unanswered questions. In this case: what population should they involve? What community network initiatives are you referring to? What Telecom companies are you thinking about?\r\nThe solution as well is very vague. How would this DAO work? Who would join it and how? What is the role of the smart contracts here? In the detailed plan it is simply stated in a general manner that recent world events have accelerated radical digital transformations and thus investing in partnerships with communities is what is needed to make telecom infrastructure sustainable. I would have expected to hear a practical use case here and the way in which this project will be built. Right now, it sounds more like a general presentation of what the \"Digital Ubiquity Capital\" company that is mentioned here does.\r\nAt the moment, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, as I do not understand what it intends to do.

The phrase \"developing on functional programming\" does not help me understand what relevant skills the people here have.\r\nI strongly disagree that this proposal can be implemented successfully, due to the lack of information on the team who would work on this, no details on how the budget would be used, no risk analysis and no plan outlining the technical approach and the usage of resources concretely.
