Two months at $2,500 / month for an outside technical resource to develop the architecture would seem to me to be a major barrier to success.  Personally, I would rate the likelyhood of success as perhaps a four or a five if it had a higher proposal amount that reflected what would seem to be a more realistic estimate of the technical aspects.  It's entirely possible that the architecture is either more simple than I surmise, or that resources are more readily available to do this work than I have experienced.
