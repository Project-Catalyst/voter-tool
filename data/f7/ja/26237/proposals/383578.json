The team does not ask for any additional funds. It would be good to have a detailed implementable plan and also details of actionable tasks and order of execution. The proposal sets out the timeframes within the project should be completed, but it would be good if it was elaborated in more detail in terms of dates, months, Q1, Q2, Q3.
