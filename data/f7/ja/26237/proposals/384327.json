This Proposals is a part of an assembly of proposals which all together, build a series of very well stated proposals which are in the specific proposal we are assessing here. The Proposal is well aligned to the challenge's purpose and provides an effective and impactful solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I do fully agree that the Team brings the needed experience and qualification and surely strong skills and a very committed engagement which is needed to successfully implement this proposal.  The KPIs and OKRs are well defined and realistic, the provided roadmap is sufficiently displayed and the proposal provides an overall strong intention in full alignment with the ecosystem which underlines the Proposals and the Proposers values.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the fact that the proposing team is, as funded proposer from Fund 6, already familiar with the reporting process the likelihood of an accountable reporting process is very likely.

This could accelerate the adaption of DAOs in Europe and also help other DAOs to be set up the right way Therefore this proposal fits into this challenge. A solution like this could attract the blockchain gamer community to Cardano, which shows the potential positive impact of this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very active in the community and has the skills and enthusiasm to realize their vision. The plan presented is well developed and gives a good understanding of the newly created use cases.

In general, I see it as very likely that this proposal will be implemented. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The goal and the result are clearly formulated.

DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. The proposal adresses a clear problem, the complicated regulatory framework in the EU regarding DAOs and supranational organisations in general, as both EU-specific and nation-specific regulations need to be considered. Providing a blueprint framework for DAOs to deal with these regulatory challenges seems both reasonable and very effective, and since it will facilitate the forming of DAOs within the EU it will sure be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DLT360 has so far shown (with their proposal from F6 they currently govern) that they are a serious and competent project partner for catalyst.

It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.
