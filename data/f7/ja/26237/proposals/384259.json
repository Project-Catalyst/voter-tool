The idea is to disintermediate the big \"ad tech\" companies that are purely profit driven, and (as a result) are not accessible by smaller players, including citizens, community groups, artists, etc., and for the same reason, do not choose content to display that is necessarily beneficial for the local community.  As someone who is concerned about the growing inequity in the world, and the \"systemic\" issues that are likely to only exacerbate this situation, I think this is a great idea to empower ordinary citizens and community groups to \"advertise\" a broader range of content, chosen for consistency with community values rather than pure profit; I think this is also consistent with the values of Cardano.  The proposers are enthusiastic about education and onboarding people who don't yet know much about Cardano, so if this is successful, it can certainly benefit the Cardano ecosystem.  The challenge is stated to be about tools for DAOS, whereas this proposal is a DAO use case.  That might suggest a lower assessment is warranted, but I think that, as it's early days for DAOs on Cardano, this project, whether successful or not, can provide valuable experience and insight, and will either have to build tools for the specific use case that may be generalized by others, or may end up being valuable collaborators with other proposals that explicitly aim to build DAO-related tools.", "q0r": 4, "q1": " This is an ambitious project with many dimensions, and there are some excellent skills and backgrounds among the team.  I am concerned, however, that there appears to be only one team member who potentially has the skillset to build key elements of the technical solution, particularly as it relates to Cardano (e.g., smart contracts for DAO, etc.).  While the \"Roadmap with Expenses\" section paints a compelling picture of the project's trajectory, the proposal overall is light on detail around the \"tokenomics\", which is a key component of the project's likelihood of success.  I am also concerned that the Budget may not stretch far enough given the size of the team and the number of different aspects to the project.  That said, it is not clear that this is the project's *only* funding.  Finally, I think the proposal would be stronger with more explicit discussion and quantification of the \"business model\", which would potentially help to convince voters that the approach can work and become self sustaining.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although the proposal does not explicitly address Milestones, Deliverables, KPIs, etc., one can glean some relevant information from the Road Map with Expenses section, and it seems to me that the project *could* reasonably provide evidence of progress and completion of various items on the road map.

Given the team's previous experience in the field, I see parts of the project which will be wildly successful. Like the organizational, marketing and business aspects. However the technical aspect of the project is not heavily represented in the proposal. Few team members have technical expertise and even those are not specialized. The project is still likely to succeed, but it remains to be seen, whether in the defined timeline. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The solution is intended to be public in nature. This means a website platform, publicly placed OOH advertisement and their LOCAL token.

For me the proposal reads as a method to disrupt traditional advertising by putting the advertising channel into the hands of local communities. The challenge brief outlines success as creating solutions to better manage a DAO on Cardano, I am unsure if the proposal is aligned with the challenge brief, the proposal might have fitted better in the Miscellaneous category as the proposal builds on a previous funding from fund 6, however the original category entered into has fallen away. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provided good descriptions of the team members and links to LinkedIn. The proposal has a detailed plan laid out and presents great figures and research on the advertising industry. The proposal outlines a plan to disrupt advertising through the LOCAL token.
