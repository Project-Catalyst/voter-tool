However, where I am struggling is that I really have no way to conceptualize what such an extension would look like or how it would work in an operational sense. How would one web extension work for the multitude of diverse projects across the ecosystem? Also, the project has a much wider scope that Cardano so it's unclear whether the effects would be more important within the ecosystem or more broadly across the internet.

While the idea is commendable there is not really any information on how the proposers will attempt to develop it. The timeline and key metrics are way too sparse and lack any granularity for voters to gauge. For example, saying \"design\" in month 1 is very confusing, what is all included here? What steps do you plan to take to design it? Another aspect that is lacking in the feasibility section is how it will be used by the Cardano Community. It's great to say that it will be but there is not indication of how users/DAO's would be onboarded and what that process would look like. I do appreciate the links to the proposers' sites but there are no names or any sort of identification on who the proposers actually are.

In order to improve marks in the next round, if unsuccessful, the proposers could do a better job identifying on and off-ramps for community input and testing.
