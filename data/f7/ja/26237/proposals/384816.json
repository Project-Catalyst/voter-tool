In my opinion this proposal touch important problem about adaption of DOAs, that could improve the cardano blockchain ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal is within the challenge setting and could help to accelerate the adoption of Cardano. I would have like to see more clarification on that part but I agree that this proposal has a great potential and therefore a positive impact for Cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones, coherent KPI metrics and a defined time horizon. The only thing I miss in this area is that the proposer has not mentioned possible difficulties and how to deal with them (e.g. difficulties in adoption of the tools/API\u2026) The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. The scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it's convincing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This team explaines very well how and what they will build on a timeline. Also provided key performance indicators, some that will be measured using github. They provide a tool that will benefit Dapp creation for DOAs. Turning this project into a DOA and making it open source makes it resilient to future challenges and tasks. There is a Github sources mentioned. So the community will be able to track the progress of this proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Creating one intra-chain dao to rule them all!.
