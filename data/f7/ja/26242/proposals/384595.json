Rio is the 4th largest city in Latin America and has several other attractions that could increase the potential impact of this proposal.\r\nAs covid diminishes, face to face events become important again to strenght the bond in the community and having also the event broadcasted online broadens its reach in Brazil (as I believe this event will be in portuguese).\r\n\r\nI also appreeciate that the main strucutre is already defined - Though it would be nice to have some sense on the content that is being tought here.\r\n\r\nIf this project is a success, it can be implemented in other cities of Brazil or LATAM by local community, with already the lessons learned in this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I missed here was the communucation strategy. How does the proposer intend to reach people outside community (or even within it)? This is key for a project like to succeed and have the desired attendes.\r\nAs suggestions, I'd start with social medias but communicate also in universities and courses .\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are 2 people already committed which seems enough to organize such event. Both have a list of qualifications and experience and links to linkedin to verify the info.\r\n\r\nThe plan is solid and time-framed, contemplating the whole development/implementation phase (only missing the communication part)\r\n\r\nBudget breakdown is very clear and detailed and not very expensive.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is mentioned here a clear definition of success, separated in key milestones. there are also good kpis with target.\r\n\r\nThe project is easily auditable", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 6, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I agree with the comment about communication strategy. I thank you very much for the feedback and I think this was really missing in our proposal, as it is an important part of the project that we should not have underestimated. Thank you very much for the positive comment, for believing in the proposal and I promise we will do our best to make CardanoRio happen. And it would be incredible if this event could be implemented in other cities in Latin America. Post Covid I think the whole world is missing the opportunity to interact with new people and see new places and this would be an incredible opportunity."}, {"q0": "Adoption is a game of first impressions and the team behind this proposal aims to increase Brazilian adoption through an impression formed by a locally hosted cardano themed carnival. A first impression can dramatically effect adoption and user loyalty to the Cardano ecosystem. Although the proposal definitely meets the challenge goals, the funding is for a single event that could produce a surge of new users, but would not provide steady continuous stream of new users to the cardano ecosystem. The proposal requests a relatively small amount and promises to deliver significantly more value for the community.

It is clear that the transparency and clarity is important for the team.

However we did put links to events we have organized (2 members of the team organized it separately, the team as a whole has never organized anything, this will be the first time, but based on previous experiences we think it will be fine).

The fact that this event can be broadcast and accessible free of charge online is an advantage that can benefit all those concerned in the Community. This small detail is also appreciable \"all the surplus money will be donated to a local charity.\" Unless I am mistaken, there is no section which clearly and explicitly states the benefits of this proposal for Catlyst in particular, but the benefits for the Latin community and specifically for the Brezilens are clearly explained and allow us to conclude also the positive consequences on the whole ecosystem.

The general transparency of this proposal as well as its nature in itself contains the necessary elements so that the community can follow its progress and even attend the event for those who wish it.
