I believe it is brilliant that the team is seeking to increase this level of awareness by creating and distributing quality audiovisual material based on the experience of real Latin American cases, they plan to publish in traditional Spanish-speaking channels (TV and video distribution platforms). Although I see the execution of this documentary positively, if I evaluate it strictly under the objective of this challenge, unfortunately I do not see a direct link between the average user who can see the documentary in traditional media and the fact that this person becomes part of the community.

In addition, references should be provided for similar jobs that have previously been performed. I believe this is the most effective method for evaluating this aspect. The team does a good job of defining the budget by phases, which allows for a more accurate evaluation to determine whether the budget is appropriate or not. Despite this, I believe that they need to go a step further. As an example, phase one outlines the development of the idea, the creation of the website and social media, and phase three outlines tokenizing the audiovisual material and assigning them a value of $5000 each. As a good practice, I would suggest providing information regarding the cost of the hour per specialty and the estimated length of the contracting.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team does a great job of separating the project into 6 phases, with a brief description of what would be happening in each phase. Unfortunately, the proposal fails to present information regarding the implementation times for each phase described. Due to this, it is difficult for the community to have transparency and auditability of the project. Regarding success metrics, the team defines two key elements: that the documentary is complete and that it is profitable for future projects. However, from my experience the first metric is more an implementation milestone than a success metric and the second one it is a success metric but it is very broad and depends on many external factors and is not necessarily directly aligned with this challenge.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 7, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact/Alignment: \nThank you for acknowledging the idea and the feedback in order to polish the proposal.

The idea here is to produce a documentary series that explains what Cardano is and how it affects the world we live in, positively, of course. Which would be great to add value and spread the ideas / technologies of our ecosystem, but I don't see how this would benefit Latin American countries. The fact that audiovisual productions are mainly aimed at distribution in the Spanish language would make the project have more reach in Spanish-speaking countries throughout Latin America (in Brazil there would not be as much repercussion), but this would not benefit the countries themselves , its economy, people and so on. Therefore, I believe that this proposal, despite being a good idea, will not have the impact that we seek in the challenge; it would be better suited for an f6 challenge that aimed to encourage new people to join our community and also engage more of those who are already members (whether CAs, proponents, vCAs...), I don't remember the exact name of the challenge , but this proposal would be great if it had been launched there. Around here, I believe it needs to be revamped. One idea I thought was, it would be perfect if the entire team involved in recording the audiovisual content were Latin American! That way, we could generate income and engagement for the people involved here, and in this way benefit the local community that we seek to reach in the challenge. In addition to financial help, these people would learn about our technologies and perhaps participate in future rounds of Catalyst or invest in some way. But the way the proposal is currently launched, unfortunately I don't think it fits what was asked.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The team proves to be able to produce the documentary series with high quality. This can be concluded because at the bottom of the proposal they attached a video of approximately 4 minutes, which is very well done (I really liked it), and also on the youtube channel they present to us, which has a very high audience (higher at 10k subscribers!), much larger than most channels that are attached to proposals. The videos on this channel are also of high quality, with very professional photography, editing and sound capture. It is always beneficial when we know the names of those involved and their respective roles; it was of high value that the team also provided this data in the proposal. About a script, they define the creation of videos in stages. In my opinion, these phases could have been further broken down. For example, in step 4, \"film the stories\", where would they be filmed? What stories would be featured? It's not very clear if the team already has some pre-selected stories or if they would think about it after funding. I was also curious about the broadcasting and distribution part, although the authors clarify that the objective is to make the videos circulate on Spanish language channels, I would like to understand which ones, with which target audience, etc. I missed the team worrying about the dissemination of the content that would be generated, even though they have a distribution plan, it would be safer for us to clarify how they would advertise and engage people to watch the documentaries, especially those who they never had previous contact with Cardano. About the financial breakdown, they explain to us how the money would be divided, but this information could be more detailed. For example: in step 1, the costs would be allocated to: \"designer, hosting, domains and community manager\". But how would the $5000 USD be split between these parts? Because of these things, I think this part of the proposal is good, but there is room for improvement.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team is concerned with drawing up a well-explained definition of success so that we can get a general sense of what to expect as a result of this project. It is also possible to exercise auditability through the monitoring of phases; as they define what would generally happen in each of them, we could choose a Spanish-speaking member to more closely monitor the progress of each step, bringing feedback to the community.
