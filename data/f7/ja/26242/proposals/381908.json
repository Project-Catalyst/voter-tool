the one hand correspond to the spirit of Cardano and Catalyst and on the other hand have a strong social / environmental component. The proposal involves tokenizing land in order to enable regrowth of land using proven ecological methods. This will address the issue of farmers not being able to ensure a healthy regeneration of land between harvest seasons. This proposal is very relevant to LATAM as food exports to developed countries represent one of many countries' main sources of income. In addition, I understand how this proposal can encourage new users to join the community. However, I must say that it was not possible to evaluate the alignment of the metrics since they were not included.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team describes in detail the skills and experiences in their web page that was provided as a reference. They have also described achievements with their \"land-management and forest regeneration\" method in previous years, although references would have been helpful to verify these results. An action plan is presented; however, I find it to be very general, which makes it difficult to evaluate its feasibility. Another aspect that could be improved in the proposal is the description of the associated tokenomics. Although there is a brief description of the token utility, it is crucial to provide a detailed description of the logic behind the generation of these tokens for a proposal like this one, which is based on the generation of this economy to contribute to the purchase and regeneration of land. Regarding the budget, I believe it is also imperative that for future Catalyst cycles, the team concentrates its efforts on improving this section. Although it is very positive that the topic has been broken down into identifiable areas, some of them need to be better explained. An example is the line item for \"Developers to launch the token\" which is estimated at $60,000 but does not explain the cost per hour, the number of developers needed, or for how long the developers are needed. Another example could be, the item for \"Promotion campaign\" would be estimated at $50,000, in which case you would have to provide answers to questions such as: How many professionals are you planning to hire? Which methods will be used for promotion? What is the expected result of this promotion? Unfortunately, no answers to these questions are provided. Lastly, I would like to mention another issue with the budget that I find is that actions are described to ensure auditability, but it is not clear whether or not these actions are considered as line items within the budget.

There is another aspect of this proposal that can be improved: the description of the success metrics.

So sorry I rate 2 points for this recommendation\r\nThere is no evidence for any of their experiences. I think you should publicize your team and their capabilities, and that's one of the reasons why I disagree with the proposals that will be successfully implemented. It would be better if the proponent provided a list of potential future risks and challenges.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Several milestones can be made from the plan but no indicators are suggested. Proposing a 3-year roadmap, I think it is advisable to give a specific action plan, a shorter time frame for us to easily check.\r\nThe proposal requires a large amount of capital, $185,000 more than a third of the fund's capital. But there are expenses that need more detail like a $50,000 ad campaign, which seems like a pretty big amount but doesn't have any explanation.\r\nTo increase testability, proponents can add several KPIs and metrics to help people outside the organization do better if milestones are reached. Scaling data/KPIs to measure success will benefit your proposal", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 3, "ng": 11, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a very good proposal, I support the purpose and the proposed plan to achieve it. Having said that I don't see any alignment with the challenge. This is a very significant amount of resources and a failed to see how it impacts Cardano's growth in Latam. Treasury's funds for this challenge should be allocated to proposals with a clearer short term impact.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "-The funding requested (185k) is quite elevated considering it does not include the land itself. (which is a rather small plot of 9.5 hectares)\r\n- 100k of the 185k requested go to \"promotion campaign\" and \"Finishing touch on the existing infrastructure\" without any details. \r\n- The team behind seems to have a clear long term roadmap on how to implement successfully the proposal, but no specific KPIs are provided that can be used to assess success.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "- At this stage the auditability proposal seems healthy, being such a long term plan the Community might get distracted in the long term.\r\n- No clear, quantifiable goals are proposed.

He join the Cardano Catalyst very early, understand and believe in the great potential of Cardano ecosystem. The proposal explain his solution in a very detail and understandable way.

The proposal also includes detail plan and analysis, which demonstrates that it's highly likely the plan can be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability is explained well on the proposal: the project will be very transparent and easy to track the behavior or progress of it.

Certainly this addresses an issue important to Brazilians and uses a long-earned set of expertise to begin to shift mindset. It also incorporates tokens in a real-world way, which protects and preserves natural resources important to us all. This is a highly specialized project, and if the model can be demonstrated, will enable other countries and communities to use it as a blueprint. The tokenizing of the land in this project and launching on the Cardano network gives an opportunity to highlight the creative use of this project in helping a local community and population as well as engaging those community members in the Cardano community, which is a key component of that challenge. If implemented successfully, this project will be meaningful, useful and impactful at the micro and macro levels. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has a lot going for it. The key proposer has already accomplished the transformation of the land over the past decade, which is a fundamental need for expanding the method and teaching others. He also has a decade in business in the Netherlands, which merges European and Latin American mindsets. The creative use of tokens and cryptocurrency will provide a grassroots teaching opportunity to the communities involved in the project, so that communities become healthier and are introduced to blockchain technology simultaneously. The tokenizing of the land and engaging global partners who support this sustainable cause has great potential to equip many thoughtful people with a new understanding of how cryptocurrency can be utilized to solve environmental issues. I don't see a developer on the team, so this is one key role that will need to be filled and is a significant cost within the budget. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have built in both professional organizations and project metrics to serve as evaluating bodies for the success of the undertaking. The need to audit the farmland itself (by the certifying bodies listed in the proposal) is a key element here, as the transparency and trustworthiness of what is happening on the ground will play a large role in maintaining trustworthiness of the project overall and the infusion of blockchain technology learning in Latin America through this work. As this challenge aims to bring more Latin American community members into the Cardano fold, it would be strong to see this proposal include methods for engaging the participants in the farming/agricultural roles AND the growth of the organization into new areas as a whole. Perhaps workshops on cryptocurrency could also be held at the location in addition to the agricultural workshops? What about partnerships between token holders and those who teach/care for the land? Involving qualified community members on the boards/ committees/governance groups? It would also be strong to understand how the team plans to chronicle and share their experience and findings with other groups so that their work could be replicated easily and do more good.
