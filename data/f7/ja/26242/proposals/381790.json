Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation.

Only through education can we increase the potential adoption of Cardano. Here we a proactive-outside-of-the-community associate professor from a reputable University in Brazil who has deep ties with MIT and 14 years of experience in teaching STEM courses has come knocking on Cardano's door. The perfect vessel to further the word of Cardano. Initially I had questions regarding how will this proposer acquire the materials on Cardano for it seems the proposer is quite new to the community. Sure enough though, the LATAM Cardano community came in numbers to support the proposer with all the materials they needed. These interactions are recorded in the comments section. Suggest the proposer to also be proactive in reaching out to the Catalyst School on any teaching materials. Google the keyword 'Catalyst School Cardano' and the first search result should be their website complete with all their contacts.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "100% the proposer with their experience as elaborated above and is clearly stated in the proposal complete with a LinkedIn link will definitely implement this proposal successfully. The budget requested is clear, reasonable and in this case, the format of the implementation plan of this proposal, does not require the budget to be broken down to smaller pieces. The 3 (three) month timetable to implement this proposal is clear and has an adjoining detailed action plan that further ensures confidence all goals set by the proposer will be achieve. Although the proposer has not taken into the risk and challenge, it is highly like the proposer will be able to mitigate this on the fly. For proposes of upholding standards, rating must adjusted fairly.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Roadmaps and milestones are very clear and also provided are detailed action plans, though the proposer has categorized them under KPI's. The KPI's are also clear and majority are measurable though they are not under one specific category but spread throughout the proposal. There are some KPI's that will be challenging to be audit for there are no number associated to them, but all-in-all this proposal is solid. As usual, a solid proposal is usually the by-product of a solid problem statement and solution which are strongly interconnected.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_635", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 8, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Create courses on blockchain technology in a Portuguese language school for students in science and engineering in Brazil. The problem statement is presented in a logical and clear manner, and is consistent with the challenge summary.\r\nThis proposal is perfectly suited to the challenge, helping students understand Blockchain will help society become more and more technologically advanced, they can apply this technology to improve areas such as cryptocurrency, chain provisioning, data management, healthcare and other fields", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved in creating the incubator is really strong, we can tell who each member is from the description of the proposal and on the attached website where we are told the area of \u200b\u200bexpertise, experience and what their current position has to do with the group. The proposal writer is an associate professor at the Brazilian Technical College, she also provides full information and a link to LinkedIn for the community to easily measure proposal performance.\r\nThe definition of success is described and clearly shows how the successful implementation of the proposal can be verified. Excellent idea, clear presentation, makes me fully confident this proposal will succeed.\r\nTo further increase the likelihood of this proposal succeeding, I would like to see a list of potential risks and challenges. What are the difficulties when implementing the course for students?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The suggested 3-month roadmap incorporates KPIs, which is great, it makes it easier for us to test. All sections of the KPI are easy to follow with a list of plans tagged after the first 3 month period, increasing transparency and recommendations\r\nBudget analysis was presented, but no details. The proposal claims to pay $2500 per month, although it doesn't specify how that money will be spent, I think it makes sense given the amount of work she listed to do.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Definitely such ideas are needed by the Cardano ecosystem because with workshops, lectures, courses, presentations, information about Cardano will be spread, and in the long run it certainly gives a certain value and brings positive results, impact. The proposal clearly defines the problem in Brazil and offers an excellent solution. KPis in the proposal perfectly correspond to the ones indicated in the challenge and the proposal is able to scale future challenges. Great idea!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the website set up in the proposal, it is clear that we have a highly educated person, but the question arises whether we have the necessary skills, knowledge and experience in the blockchain. There is a link from LinkedIn which gives us additional security or not security in the ability to implement this great idea. The knowledge, skills and knowledge of Cardano blockachain do not stand out on both links that are placed in the proposal. Perhaps the lecturer himself will learn through the lecture what is the best school for both the one who teaches and the one who listens to the lecture. The budget is clearly presented but in my opinion $2500 per presentation with preparation of the presentation is unreasonable. These are too high costs per presentation. The plan is well developed but no risks are covered or mentioned. What if students do not come to the lecture or a small number come or the lecturer does not have the necessary skills to deliver the knowledge? One-month lectures are the perfect time frame for the realization of this idea because the lecturer has plenty of time to organize and prepare. We can say that all the necessary resources and technical aspects to implement the proposal are listed.\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Roadmap with a time horizon are excellently presented and feasible.

Offering free lectures given in Portuguese for STEM students about blockchain and Cardano not only addresses the objectives laid out in the challenge but also will add value to the Cardano system clearly. Moreover, the proposal can be scaled to address future challenge. It will be helpful for people around the world to get knowledge about Cardano. So that I strongly agree the proposal is impactful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides a link of the proposer's information (experience, qualifications and certifications, video classes,etc) in Portuguese. I would love to see more about her experience relevant to Project Catalyst and Cardano ecosystem for preparing the learning materials about Cardano and Plutus. It would be great if the author adds information about the online education platform on which the course will be given. In my opinion, we need to make sure that the learning materials can fit the platforms and the user learning data is not trapped in them.\r\nThe budget is divided into 3 months fairly but not yet broken down into identifiable items.\r\nThe challenges and risks which relevant to the success of the proposal, have not been considered yet.\r\nDue to lacking of information I mentioned above, I rate Feasibility with a score of 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a roadmap with milestone and time horizon for achivement as well as metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal and clear understandable description of the targeted problem. Therefore, I agree the proposal is auditable.\r\nI would recommend the proposer should be in a collaboration for the success of the implementation.
