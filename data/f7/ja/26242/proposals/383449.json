The project proposes to solve this issue by conducting a Hackathon for individuals and companies in Latin America to gain knowledge of Ethereum and Cardano through the Milkomeda Protocol. There is not information available regarding the impact metrics of the proposal. Although the project clearly benefits the community, I would be interested in knowing how many developers the team plans to reach through the hackathon.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Milkomeda and dcSpark make a solid team and this can be easily verified. Almost exclusively, the requested budget will be used for the prizes to be awarded at the hackathon. As a result, I am not concerned about providing a detailed breakdown of the budget.
