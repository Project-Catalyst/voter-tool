This proposal has effectively identified a problem within the challenge. The problem the proposal is trying to solve is the miseducation of certain people on the blockchain technology. I would suggest to the proposer to be more precise on the subject that will be treated on the platform. The proposer should also be more clear on the type of content that will serve as learning material, whether it will be articles or videos. Apart from that, I think that this proposal can add value to the cardano ecosystem by bringing new users who can help build it. Furthermore, I think that the proposal can scale in future challenges.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The idea in this proposal is very interesting. However, there is a lack of information that can compromise its feasibility a little bit. Providing these information can greatly improve the quality of the proposal hence its chance of being funded. The budget should be broken down into identifiable items. In addition to that, the proposer should include a plan for future funds if needed. Furthermore the  proposer should include challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation. I have a neutral note on the feasibility of this proposal based on the amount of information provided in that regard.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal includes milestones but it is really vague.
