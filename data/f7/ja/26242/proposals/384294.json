From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates.

So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate.
