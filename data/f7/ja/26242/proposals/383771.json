We need more individuals like you in the Cardano community. The purpose of this proposal is to address the issue of accessibility to clean water in remote communities with high poverty rates. The author of the proposal, an SPO, seeks funding for the installation of water purification systems in communities that lack access to basic services. Several communities in the region face this challenge, which is entirely in line with the mission of Cardano from a social perspective. I must admit that I find it very difficult to evaluate this proposal, since I believe it is an excellent proposal. However, in the way the proposal is described, and considering not only the social aspect, it is difficult to find a direct alignment with what is asked for in this challenge. Although it is mentioned that as part of the installation of these systems, knowledge characteristics of the Cardano ecosystem is imparted to these communities, no impact metrics are presented to assess it from that point of view.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I don't have many comments concerning the feasibility of the project. Given that the team already has a part of project underway, and from what they mention, they need funding to reach out to other communities, I believe they have the necessary skills and experience to pursue the project. Regarding the budget, there are also opportunities for improvement. Team members present a final value that is representative of the cost of installing a system in a community. In order to make an accurate assessment of the costs, a breakdown of the installation is necessary. How much will it cost to install the system, purchase the system, transportation, manage the project, and set up the installation room, for example?\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is not a problem here. Within four months of receiving the funding, the team plans to install the five water purification systems. All of the installations will be open source, describing the drafts, locations, equipment, and details for replication all over the world, which is very positive. Nevertheless, it is necessary to make much greater efforts to ensure that operations are transparent for the community. The project mentions, for example, that initial installations have already taken place. Thus, it would be useful for all information to be provided on the website. Perhaps installation photos and cost reports verified by professionals?\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 8, "ng": 12, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Clean water for everybody is a good and noble idea.
