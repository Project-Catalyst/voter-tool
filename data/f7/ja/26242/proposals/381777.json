The budget is clearly presented but it would be much better if it was divided differently. Maybe to require half the budget in this Catalys F7 and half in the Catalsy F8. Holding a lecture for 6 months is a challenging job and is not a safe investment. But if they had a 3-month lecture, it would be easier to follow the development of the project and influence the improvements.

The proposal offered a timetable to complete the work but in my opinion it is not realistically presented. As I already said there could be a much better brake down budget but also a time frame from 6 months to 3 months of lectures.
