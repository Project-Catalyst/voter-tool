The proposer wants to introduce the blockchain technology and the cardano network to the developers in brazil and a portuguese speaking audience in general. This is a brilliant idea as developers in those countries can use the power of the cardano network to build dapps that will solve their problems. The key metrics and goal of this proposal align with the challenge. Furthermore the proposal should be able to scale in future challenges. I have a positive note on the impact of this proposal.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information included in this proposal gives me confidence in its feasibility. The proposer is a phd in computer science and has provided a github link to back his claims. With it's knowledge, I think that the proposer can produce high quality informative video to his audience. However, the budget could be broken down a little more. I think that allocating funds to marketing without precision is somewhat vague. The proposer can definitely improve this point. The proposer can also improve the project by adding a plan which will be followed if additional funds are needed.

Proposer clearly points out the problem of lack of information about Caradano in his native Portuguese and offers an excellent solution.

We can clearly see the experience, knowledge, skills and work required so far for the realization of this project.

The budget is clearly presented, but it is not clear whether an external collaborator will be required for the video production, which carries most of the funds, or the holder of this project will do it himself. It would be good to elaborate on budget usage in a little more detail. Unfortunately, there is a lack of information for details of actionable tasks and order of execution, and the time frames within which the work will be done, it would be good if they were more clearly elaborated. In the plan that needs to be developed, it would be good to present the need for resources and technical aspects for the implementation of this idea.
