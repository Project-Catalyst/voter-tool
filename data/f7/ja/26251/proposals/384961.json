They will ad value to the Cardano ecosystem by giving ADA holders more security and quality of life when managing their ADA. There isn't much key metrics provided so its hard to see if it is inline with the challenge setting. The proposal is based on an open source integration of Ledger so it is aligned with the Challenge in that sense. The proposal is able to scale as long term maintenance costs will be covered by Ladger.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The relevant skills and team has been provided and proven via github links. The budget is reasonable and broken down in the long term and the funding requested will fund the first phase. There are 3 phases in total. The other phases will be discussed in the future. They explain what the functions will be of what they are building, but they don't provide the technical details of how they will build it. They do however provide Github links so if anyone needs more technical information they can find it in the Github links. The time to complete the first phase is 2 months which is great because it will already ad usability. They haven't considered any risks, but given the huge teams behind this and the open source aspect, should make them quite resilient to risks/challnges.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They provided roadmap with 3 milestones. No measurable KPIs were provided, but since it is already an established brand, they are already bringing more users to Cardano.

Down the road there might be staking and related daps available in ledger live. There's a clear goal to open source the integration with ledger live, which makes this proposal fit the challenge it's in. There's a clear message about the value that will be added to the cardano ecosystem through: employing valued members of the community, strenghtening trust and relations between the community and ledger live, bringing a significatnt codebase to be open sourced, used and developed by everyone interested and capable. They've chosen to Send / Receive and Synch ADA accounts on Ledger Live Desktop and Ledger Live Mobile as a phase 1 of the proposal and the indicators if that is done will be evident inapplications. Keeping in mind the teama sitting behind this proposal I have no doubt that they will be able to scale and face any of the mentioned challenges.  What's missing in the ecosystem right now are big companies collaborating with the community. This project is a perfect first step to bring the community closer to the providers of hardware wallets. As a developer I don't have any concerns about this proposal and am looking forward to it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are referal links which I managed to verify and checked out the mentioned team members and team members mentioned in the proposal. If voted in, the people working on this proposal are capable of completing the goal within the time limit.  The budget could be better broken down to explain the exact number stated as needed funds. It isn't transparent enough where the funds will be going and the calculation made in order to come up with the stated required funds. Nevertheless there's a realistic timetable to complete the first phase of the work without an issue. The technical part of the explanation isn't described, but if anyone is interested there are links in the proposal with the codebase which will be used in relation to the integration. So if anyone is interested, there are link to dig though. It's described what resources will be necessary to implement the proposal, but again I wished they were a bit more specific on the technical side of things.  The considered risk are relevant, but it's always better when you're prepared.  Overall a good proposal, I wish you the best of luck! And may the community be with you!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One thing I'm not worried about after reading the proposal is the tracability of the project. The authors took special care to list several ways to interact and to enable a channel allowing them to listen to the community. There are discord channels as well as regular AMA meetings. KPIs are missing but not exactly. Since there will be a github repository anyone interested would be able to see the implementation progress being done in there. The roadmap not only for this solution but for future funding rounds and ideas are also presented in this proposal, which is nice because it allows the people to see the way the proposal isheaded.

The technical specifications provided through the links show the credibility in the proposal, with the future plans of funding through further rounds showing the sheer commitment and passion the team carries in order to make this a success and add another trophy to their collection. The phase-wise implementation strategy and a moderate amount of groundwork add more weightage to the feasibility criteria. The funds requested seem practical and plausible given the amount of work involved and the anticipated high quality of the solution. The elucidated proposal with lucid goals seals the deal. Hence, I make no reservation in scoring the feasibility full marks.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer makes no mistake in providing the community with metrics that does absolute justice to the proposal. The open-source nature of the solution makes it easier for the auditors to track the progress. The number of ADA transactions and the increase in ADA wallet sync ups in Ledger add more insight to the success of the proposal.
