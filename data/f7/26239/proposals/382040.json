However, it could have been further explored. The plan addresses the objectives because it focuses in preventing attacks and having the trust in the ecosystem being eroded. Notwithstanding, its impact could be bigger if they also focused in promoting truth about Cardano, this way even for newcomers it would be easier to identify what is true. Also, there is no discussion on building a repository for old/new scams and scam attempts which would be compelling given that newcomers might not even be aware of those attacks. The key metrics defined are a bit shallow and not only they could be more objective but also, they could have been broken down into more granular topics.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Skyros' network of hackers definitely has the necessary skills and experience to qualify for the task being proposed.

Using a network of hackers for threat detection is a known practice in the industry.

Throughout my career, I have used multiple external services and I believe more information is needed to make a decision. \r\n\r\nYou provided some more info, responding to a question you got, and although you can not provide information about specific customers, there are ways to provide more information for example through use cases.\r\n\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. More information about the technical adjustments needed would have been helpful to evaluate. \r\n\r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. It could have been good to detail the distribution of the $20000 for the Hacking Network over the year. For example, a year cost per hacker is 3600, and that you will use 5 monthly hackers for this task. \r\n\r\nThe budget requested is 33% of the proposal's available funds. Considering the lack of details about the team and company and the budget challenge, it could have made sense to present a smaller scope of work and maybe for 6 months so the community could better evaluate the services through a pilot project and then fund the second half of the year.
