I love to first glance (speed read) over an proposal - before I read it comprehensively. I glanced .. and wow. First impressions can be deceptive (I know), but my first impressions were that the team took the challenge and then ran with it to unexpected places. The problem statement is sharp and incisive - not boilerplate. It reflects insight. I like that your solution aims to disarm malicious Stakepool Operators (SPOs). This (malicious SPOs) issue is clearly an emerging talking point-problem in the Cardano community. Of course, as in most debates, there are nuances - with some difference in what is seen as a malicious SPO and what is an SPO that is merely utilizing the opportunities afforded by the system parameters. I like that the proposers have hit upon the issue of trust, which is of essence for \"defending the Cardano ecosystem\". Trust erodes fast. The proposal has a view for how it can imbibe new value into the Cardano ecosystem - by strenghtening a key pillar that is based on trust - staking. I feel the proposers have aligned their proposal with the outlined challenge settings - by taking a very focused approach to tackle a critical tyoe of distributed denial-of-truth (DDoT) attacks that could disrupt the normal operations of the community or network.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team did well in presenting their competencies (the Stakeboard concept is well presented too - on Ideascale and the website). It is a great idea to combine the Stakeboard tool (that simplifies stakepool search) with the plan to support the decentralization of Cardano's blockchain by furthering this decentralization through validating SPO honesty. Here we come to the proposal that aims to further support the decentralization by shining a light on malicious operators. The team has provided Linkedin profiles and it consists of 2 Tech leads: CTOs, who founded multiple start-ups; SPOs; Plutus pioneers and with Emurgo academy experience. The team also includes a senior designer (nice looking site https://stakeboard.net/ there) and a business development lead. It sounds optimal for the job. The budget seems up to the task (although I am not an expert for the payment rates of developers - so will refrain from commenting on that segment). The part dedicated to funding cloud hosting misses the element of time (from when to when?). The proposal has a sensible plan for implementation - and the best thing is that the site is already up and running and clearly a lot of effort (not just planning) has been invested. A large part of the roadmap has been delivered or is under implementation - with the Twitter integration of the notification center - Alice (completed). The KPIs seems on the mark ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposers have made the auditing of their proposal relatively easy thanks to the inclusion of both a clear vision and a time-stamped implementation plan. Many components are already under development or are completed. As of late November, the team made it possible for SPOs to now verify ownership of their pools and create Stakeboard profiles. This is all critical for the implementation of the \"Defending Cardano Staking Ecosystem\" project - so we are already talking about deliverables being delivered - even before the project is voted on. Many key components have been already delivered and milestones have been met - as is evident in the proposal. Aside from that the team seems to have a very sharp focus on the targeted problem and I can see that this clarity of vision is another factor that can help to ensure that the project delivers a tailor-made solution for Cardano staking. My own experience with the ecosystem dates back to 2017 when I started regularly following and learning about Cardano. I've been on Ideascale from day 1 and contributed as a CA, proposer and vCA in all the funds.

The propser activities already have an impact on the challenge, as the team is working on the project since August and has already managed to alert ecosystem players on potential threats. The proposal is dealing with a key element of the Cardano ecosystem, SPO scams, and decentralization of SPOs, and a good prevention system is highly important for the community.\r\n\r\nBeing a CA from fund 6 and mentor to startups (where I see many pitches), this is probably one of the top proposals I reviewed providing all the required information. Well done. \r\n\r\nThe only concern I have is that the budget requested is 40% of the total budget of the challenge which could limit the amount of wining proposals. It would have been good to consider it and maybe make 1 proposal for Fund 7 and another for Fund 8. However, as you are already working on it without funding since August it is understandable to request the amount needed to go get the milestones presented.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provided a lot of required information to validate the skills including experience details and references for the work. The proposer is already working on the project and validate the capabilities and need. The proposer well defined the team needed to implement the project. The budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and it is reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work.\r\nThe proposal clearly explains technical aspects regarding SPO threats and scams using also some practical examples. \r\nThe proposer could have had some challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, for now, the key risk described is that they need the funding to operate, which is understandable. It will be interesting to know what is be a longer time horizon plan to maintain and improve such a platform. Maybe there are some revenue opportunities so you can become a self-sustained / profitable. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones are well defined. KPIs are well defined and measurable. I would recommend to include in addition to % of reductions, also the total initial number so it will be easier to assess the impact and understand the level of risk. For example, \"\u200b\u200bReduce by 50% the number of Stake Pools created by impersonators\" is it from 4 to 2 or 100 to 50? Once completed it will be possible to track the impact through the notification center and use the tools available for delegtors to make decisions.

In a scenario where a lot of stake pools are malicious the whole Cardano ecosystem is at stake. That being said, building a way to enhance resilience of the ecosystem and making it harder for trust among the stake pools to be eroded is definitely a compelling idea. In other words, the proposers have identified a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved and have clearly articulated through examples and statistical data about the stake pool that this proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. Also, the KPIs defined within the proposal are aligned with the outlined goals and can be objectively measured. The only point I missed a more thorough discussion about was scalability. No matter how good the solution is in unmasking malicious stake pools, if it is not scalable its impact will be limited.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have identified the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal within the cost breakdown section. Also, sufficient evidence was provided regarding the relevant skills and experience that will be needed. Additionally, the budget was broken down into identifiable items and the estimation costs were pretty reasonable. Moreover, the timetable provided not only is realistic but is also very informative. Nonetheless, not much information was given regarding the challenges and relevant risks they might face when implementing the proposal or regarding the alternatives the team has in case additional funding is needed (they have already mentioned that they are running out of resources to self-fund).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap described is very informative, it has sufficient milestones, and the time horizon is clear and realistic. The KPIs defined in the proposal are strongly aligned with the objectives of the challenge and are reasonably easy to measure. If they are achieved, they will convey a strong idea of success of the proposal. Through the explanation given, it can be seen that there is a clear understanding of the targeted problem.

By providing a place where members can search all the active staking pools and know that the malicious SPO are filtered out we will provide a better and secure place. Today there are a lot of SPO's that pose a grave threat to the community, unwillingly people place their trust in SPO's.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding feasibility, we get a massive amount of information about what the team behind this proposal has already done and what their vision is for Cardano and SPO's. Seeing the work the team has already done I have no concern that this proposal will not come to a success. The roadmap provided already starts in August and you can see the road they already paved and what has yet to come. One concern I have is the budget they are asking for, I have no doubt they can use the full amount they are asking but since this is asking for forty percent of the pool in this challenge, it might've been better to split this proposal up in two or three parts to have a better chance at securing funds.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "What we need for auditability is abundantly available in the proposal.
