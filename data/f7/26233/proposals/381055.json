To put the impact in perspective, I'd suggest adding in quantitative references such as the current size of the passive investment market in the U.S. of approximately US$50 trillion or 50% of the total U.S. stock market capitalization. Having a passive, easier solution for people who otherwise would not have the time, interest, or expertise to pick tokens/coins themselves to gain exposure in digitnal assets is certainly helpful to support the adoption of DeFi and Cardano ecosystem. \r\nI would like to note for the problem statement that one single passive invesment vehicle does not necessarily have less volatility than the average volatility of the broader cryptocurrency market. A less volatile market is a result of having a large scale passive investment setor and institutional/long-term capital (e.g. passive investment accounts for 50% of the total US equity market). In addition, there is no defined index for the crypto market yet (similar to the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq of the equity market), thus I'd expect to see more details of how asset allocation and balancing strategies, as well as the target risk/return profile, will be designed for the iDTFs. My professional is in asset management and equity investment, and I'd be more than happy to contribute more thoughts to the team if the project is going to be implemented.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "MLabs clearly has significant experience in the ecosystem, being behind some of the biggest projects on Cardano.

The suggested budget and timeline is properly broken down to detailed blocks of work.  On the technical feasibility front, the proposal explains some technologies and core functionalities for implementation. on the finance/operation front, I would suggest the proposer to also include more clarity, for example, what algorithm will be used for asset universe selection and asset weighting; if it will optimize for minimal tracking error or lower over risk-return ratio; who will decide the investment strategies and how to select such person. In addition, having a high-level plan for after the MVP stage would also be helpful for the community to evaluate the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project is auditable based on the core functionalities of the iDFT.

ETFs are a popular investment vehicle in the current financial landscape that allows people to invest in the broader market segments and help take the effort out of doing individual picks. The introduction of this type of product in Cardano with a fast growing DeFi ecosystem could provide a large impact to allow a new range of investors to participate in a simple way using a DAO traded fund that they may prefer. The proposer details some keys reasons this approach can have some advantages which provide evidence that this is a valid solution solving a problem. Specifically they list diversification, lower costs and long term returns. The only feedback to give here is that another key benefit that this solution offers to end consumers is time saving. Instead of having to find all of the DEXs as the example they gave and then purchase them individually the investor can just use the DAO traded fund in a far quicker time period. For some investors this would be vital if they want to more easily enter and leave the market or specific markets like Cardano DeFi or Cardano DEXs.

This challenge is \"Boosting Cardano's DeFi\" and this proposal is aligned with the challenge for the following reason. Defi inherently is still associated with high risk, that can be a deterrent for onboarding users. This proposal aims to mitigate some of the risks of Defi by creating ETF's where you'll be able to gain exposure to multiple assets instead of putting all your \"eggs\" in one basket. This can be helpful because alot of people want the upside that this new technology brings with the ability to mitigate as much risk as possible. In new tech also comes with alot of projects potentially not working out long term so with getting exposure to multiple projects in Defi you can really take advantage of the upside without over leveraging yourself in one project. I have seen popularity grow in this concept of \"crypto Etfs\" amongst other chains so we know if properly done this could ignite a-lot of adoption and help in boosting Defi on Cardano! ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "MLABS Is the organization behind this proposal so we should start there when evaluating if they have the ability to execute! It is still early when it comes to defi on cardano however after reading their credentials in the plan presented i must say it is highly likely they will be able to deliver. This is because MLABS is experienced in Defi development and is a well known team amongst the cardano and catalyst community. They are iog plutos partners and employ over 65 devs to help build potential future hall mark Defi dapps like sundae swap (a dex) and liquid finance (a defi lending platform) and many more. This shows us they are well respected and competent. We can also view their ability to execute the beginning stages of this proposal when we take a look at their plan to implement. For example they give us clear and transparent estimates of how they will use the funds, how long the implementation will take, and the amount of human resources they will need to get started. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "When evaluating if this proposal can be audited what struck me was that they gave us clear estimates of the time that this proposal will take to implement. This gives us a dead line as voters to track the progress of the proposal. I would also encourage voters to look at the key metrics section when it comes to auditing the progress of the proposal. They acknowledged that Defi on Cardano is early so it is hard to comp measurements like daily active users or total value locked and i actually appreciate this since Defi on Cardano is still in its infancy and we don't have the data to evaluate these key metrics. However they do give a competitive promise of delivering on these key metrics as the space evolves and the data is more transparent. For example with tvl they say \"We will have the ability to expand to handle whatever the load turns out to be.\" meaning that the load of tvl can be handled no matter the amount. This means we can audit the accuracy of this by seeing if the Finished Dapp is securely handling inflows of capital or if it is not.  closing thoughts to ada voters - If theres one thing that is important to Defi at this stage in many peoples opinions it is security so i respect that they planted a flag in the ground when it comes to being able to handle any amount of funds that come onto the finished product of this proposal. As Michael saylor says the strongest money will always attract wealth. So to me that means a secure way to invest in crypto Etfs is most important to bosting defi on cardano at this time. Mlabs wrote a beautiful proposal to launch their mvp (the dapp of this proposal) and promised in the reference i stated about handling tvl to make it secure no matter the load of capital.

As someone who has already traded with ETFs, i also know how the fundamentals of them work and am able to assess whether this project makes sense. This proposal offers a good solution to some points of this challenge, like accessability to DeFi. A tokenized asset has the potential to offer DeFi accessibility even to people that don't have a lot of money.
