This proposal is part of the challenge to Boosting Defi on Cardano! I believe the idea and full implementation of this proposal will undoubtably boost defi on cardano for the following reasons. Defi is currently in its infancy as i like to say and the link between Defi and real world industries and assets is still fairly under developed. We see many projects in defi with no real world use case or with no backage of underlying real world assets that have market caps sometimes in the billions of dollars. The reason why this proposal is important to Defi on cardano is because it creates multiple defi use cases backed by a real world use cases and contracts that could be viewed as assets. These use cases are around the travel industry. One could argue that a core principal of defi is also free market opportunities. In this proposal we see how the platform the cbtn (cardano based travel network) aims to create would provide liquidity to buy and sell travel contracts. Imagine if you buy a trip to Hawaii in March of 2022 that is for December of 2022. This could allow you to sell your trip in November 2022 at a premium if you were able to buy the contract at a discount in advance before peak booking season. This example uses Hawaii and Im not sure this platform is geared for travel in Hawaii but just use this as an example of the potential for defi arbitrage with these travel contracts at the center of said example.  To add to that this proposal is rich with the impact an onchain travel market could create! The example i gave is one of many things i could see this proposal could do in Boosting Defi on Cardano so in terms of impact it is a 5 of 5 for me!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "So when looking into both team members Videlina Gandeva & Pavlina Deleva i found that there social presence on twitter was not to big and they both started a twitter at the same time in september 2021 if i have the correct handles https://twitter.com/VGandeva & https://twitter.com/DelevaPavlina. I did find that Pavalina has her linked in bio filled out and it does connect with tripxv. Her bio is \"Administrator of both the next-generation TripXv and ClubXchain platforms\r\n\u041cember of the marketing team of Technologies and innovations corporation PLC\r\nDeputy Editor-in-Chief of the online media cluborfei.com\r\nMember of the Women E-Leadership Institute (WELI)\" I find that connection important to research as tripxv is the center of their plan in terms of the implementation of said proposal. From what i can tell if this is true that she is connected as an administrator to Tripxv then this proposal should be rewarded with credibility and that would help qualify the proposal to be more feasible. The other side of the coin is that i wish they gave a bit more details on their team and its relationship with Tripxy in the proposal it self since they are asking for a hefty amount in comparison to entire fund of this challenge. Nearly 20 percent of the entire fund is requested. I also think its important to see how they plan to use that 80 k and in the proposal they gave little details about where/how that 80 k would be spent. I would like to offer this constructive criticism as feedback for the team to show case how and where the funds will be spent. I think this shook my confidence a bit as to the feasibility of the proposal and that is why i must give this portion a score of three. I think the idea and the \"pitch\" is great but due to the amount requested i would have expected to see a bigger connection to the \"how this will be implemented aspects of the proposal\" ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For this portion of review we like to look at both the way funds will be spent and the timelines/key metrics in the proposal as it pertains to if the proposal can be audited. The time line is not very transparent as we don't have a step by step dates of completion of the platform. This can't be audited since the plans steps to completion are not clearly articulated. The key metrics however offer us shorter term things we can audit as mentioned in proposal like improvement, development, and marketing. We may be able to measure those things so i will reward that in my score. We also have a key measurement of \"100 000 tourist sites and 1 million tourists registered in the network in the first year\" that we can audit after one year. I think when looking at if we can audit the implementation of the funds we lack transparency as mentioned before so it will be hard to give the audit score above a 2 because the amount requested is a-lot and being able to audit the funds will be super important imo for the future of how catalyst gives out grants. My feedback for the team is to please add more transparency around the way these funds will be used and the timelines of implementation as well as your teams credentials and relationship with stated partners. I would also recommend a section around what other human resources you will need to aquire that you dont't have or have in order to implement the proposal. Human resources like devs and things of that nature as this would really help give your proposal more substance. My last feed back is to maybe give short term objectives that we can audit like 1 month in, 3 months in, 6 months in ect... I really wish this team the best of luck and will be watching them as i think this idea is really cool and would defiantly help in boosting Defi on Cardano if implemented successfully.
