Oracles are paid services and to include their costs in small projects could be a barrier that slows down the development of new platforms and solutions. In that regard, the idea here is to boost the DeFi ecosystem by diminishing the costs of these new DeFi projects, which would benefit if this proposal gets funded. Therefore, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge. Also, if funded, the team will match the same budget submitted in the proposal, and maybe also IOG, which would greatly increase the impact of this proposal. Some KPIs to measure the impact of this proposal are missing, which could be, for example, number of projects using the oracle solution, number of feed requests, among others.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to be very capable, and they are already building the mentioned oracle solution. No information about them is included in the proposal directly, but there is a link to their website where it can be checked. Also, they have partnerships with well know project and companies, such as Indigo Protocol and IOG, among others. The feasibility of this proposal depends on the fesbility of their oracle development, since this proposals wouldn't make sense without it. Therefore, there is an additional risk to the proposal, although it might not be such a big risk due to the team's background. The plan to implement the solution is quite clear and well described, but there are not any dates related to each step, besides the success metrics for 3, 6 and 12 months. They mentioned the budget is enough to run the service for 12 months, but they don't into much details. It's difficult to assess this for someone who doesn't work with it directly, so more information in this regard would have been beneficial. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success criteria of this proposal are clear and easy to be measure. Although, the detailed roadmap of the steps to be implemented here doesn't include any dates on when each step would be implemented, so it might be difficult to track progress on a monthly basis.  Also, some KPIs are missing, both for progress and success measurement. Therefore, the proposal should include, for a future submission, more details on how the progress would be tracked in a smaller time frame, besides the KPIs as well. And in this case, since the exact feeds and oracle data to be provided depends on community voting, some flexibility on these metrics should be expected.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 13, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is from charli3, one of the oracle projects building in the cardano network. At the moment, Charli3 is on the Ethereum network waiting for the  PAB and a functional bridge to join the Cardano network. They have decided to request funds, in order to give free data to projects building on the cardano ecosystem. Many are the startups that don't have access to much funds during the early phase of development. Paying for data feeds which are provided by oracle such as Charli3 can be expensive. The free data feed provided by Charli3 with the fund request will mostly benefit these project building on the cardano network. Needless to say that this action has a great value for the community. Furthermore, this project will be able to scale future challenges if additional funds are needed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is very feasible based on the amount of information provided by the proposer. Charli3 has already built a product waiting to deploy on the Cardano network. There is enough evidence on the skills and experience of the team. The budget has been broken down into identifiable items. In fact the funds requested will be allocated to the free data feed that will be available to the community. The cost of development is handled by Charli3. If additional funding is needed, the Charli3 team has a plan laid out for that.

I feel price feeds will be absolutely integral to cardano's defi, and many oracles are not in the process of integrating with cardano i.e. chainlink, wolfram blockchain labs etc. Many oracle solutions will be needed to provide a rich decentralized ecosystem of oracles and provide a hedge against a single oracle going down and taking all of cardano's defi with it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal, Charlie3 is without question a highly respected team and very well known within the Cardano community. This proposal itself I believe has a very high probability of being implemented successfully, given the teams prior work and ongoing projects.\r\n\r\nThe only red flag I have is regards to how this price feed will be sustained, we understand that Charlie3 is meeting project catalyst funds contribution 50/50 which is awesome, but it appears to be clear that they will request more funds in the future which obviously creates a small bit of risk that the next funding round is not approved and I'm curious to whether or not that means Charlie3 will discontinue the price feeds. \r\n\r\nOther than that I do believe this proposal itself will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is detailed and milestones are made very clear, however I would actually like to see more specific details KPIs for the 3, 6, and 12 month milestones. \r\n\r\nAgain I really feel like this team will deliver but the roadmap should not have any vague references and should be a little more specific!", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_577", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Charli3 Great project.
