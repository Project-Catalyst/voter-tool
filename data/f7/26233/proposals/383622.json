Bitcoin is currently the largest blockchain network in the market and many layer one blockchains have produced wrapped versions of Bitcoin so that it can be used in those ecosystems. Due to the popularity and use cases in DeFi a solution that enables the easy usage of Bitcoin in the Cardano and Ergo ecosystem would likely be one of high impact. The proposal team has mentioned and considered the other wrapped Bitcoin protocols such as wBTC that is currently used on Ethereum. In their litepaper they outline some of the key differences with one main area being that anetaBTC is non custodial which helps to prevent third party risk. This understanding of the market and the strengths of their solution over existing ones help to provide further evidence of the potential impact and adoption this solution could achieve.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is not listed on their proposal however if you visit their site you can find the team with some of the team having LinkedIn profiles added - https://www.anetabtc.io. A budget breakdown is not provided nor a list of tasks and time allocations to each stage of the implementation. Some of the technical team profiles backgrounds provide moderate evidence that they a sufficient technical background. There is no Github or code repository available on the proposal or their website which would have been good to see to help verify their expertise in the field. The litepaper provided details the comparisons between wBTC and anetaBTC and explains some of the architecture which helps give evidence of the teams expertise. To receive a better rating it would have been good to get even more thorough sources on the background of the team or code repositories to further have confidence that this proposal is feasible as the suggested proposal complexity is high. A budget breakdown would also be needed to showcase where allocations are made.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The clarity of the proposal is to a good standard due to the litepaper provided and explanation in the proposal itself. No success objectives or KPIs were included in the proposal. The proposal team has been writing blog articles sharing information about the project as it happens which makes it easier to find out what is going on in the project team. It would be good to have added more information on what parts of the project will be open source and when for this project so that the community can audit the technical implementation.

They provided a link to a lite-paper on Medium that delves into the technical details of how and what is getting built.
