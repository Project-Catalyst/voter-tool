So after reading the proposal and looking into the website https://www.the-entr.com/ i think the idea of fractionalizing income producing real estate and having the ability to use your fractionalized ownership by staying at the premises is an idea that will no doubt Boost defi on cardano! this is because real estate is a lego in finance that the wealthy have used to maintain and expand their wealth through out history. Fractional ownership as mentioned in the proposal will make it easier for everyone to take part in this amazing wealth creation vehicle. This proposal may be lacking in certain areas in my opinion as we progress through my review however its impact could truly be an extraordinary option to offer on the Cardano blockchain! I want to be sure to give the idea credit especially seeing how they adressed the elephant in the room when it comes to fractionalizing real estate which is identity verification. Working with Cardano to use the Atala prism is key in truly making real estate accessable to the masses.      ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In regards to the proposals team and team members experience i have confidence that they have what it takes to do what they say they will do as mentioned in there plan here -  \"Next step is to create liquidity and for this we want to build a secondary market. Blockchain technology\"  But what took some of that confidence away is they indicated why building a secondary market and having liquidity is important but they didnt seem to go into the technical aspects of how the funds would be used in order to do this and i was unclear if the funds would just be used for liquidity or if they would use some of the funds to build the market place? I think its important to have more transparency on the time it will take to see a finished product and where the funds will be allocated. Also some context on the proposals dev team and their roll in this would have been appreciated to picture how this proposal would manifest.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of being able to audit the proposal we don't have clear time lines or mile stones to audit the proposal. Maybe i missed something but to me the plan seemed more like a pitch than a plan. If i did miss something i hope this review gets flagged as i am very bullish on the impact of this proposal but am caught in between a rock and a hard place as my job is to be unbiased in these reviews and true to the voters. I wish the proposer would have added more substance to the auditablility of this proposal because unfortunately the only thing we can audit is if the market place can be built and we don't have a clear time line as to when that would be so i will have to give this proposals audit score a 2 for the reasons i've mentioned above.

The proposal is to have a brilliant idea to apply Atala PRISM for DID and based on the Cardano blockchain.

The reality is that real estate in the top 10 cities worldwide is highly unaffordable for most average income earners in those cities.
