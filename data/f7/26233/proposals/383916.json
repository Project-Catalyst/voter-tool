The proposer addresses the problem of \"lack of a platform where newcomers can utilize the integrated Defi solutions and ICO\" by proposing a solution of \"providing an easy way to deploy smart contracts on the Cardano chain\". The demographics the team plans to have an impact on are primarily the existing users on other chains and also new users along with them. Hence, on successful implementation of the proposal shall make Cardano one of the go-to destinations for Defi hosting. The positive completion of all the phases in the plan which includes DEX and NFT marketplace will bring in a lot of variety to the ecosystem also boosting new contributions and increasing the overvalue of the Cardano chain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided a detailed road map on a weekly basis, which adds a lot of credibility to the team. There is also a set of required skills the team mentions which looks apt for the challenge at hand and Konma Labs has shown with their expertise and success in the prior ventures which makes the likelihood of successfully implementing this solution sky-high. The budget requested also lies well within the limit of 20% of the total funds as mentioned in the campaign brief. And the budget breakdown is very elaborate and lucid. However, the place that I believe needed a little more information is regarding the risks and challenges the team might face and what are the mitigation strategies in place. Also how this new solution to the challenge overcomes the already existing vulnerabilities in the other chains. A little more insight into that would make it easier for readers and the community to be certain about the success of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Information provided in the proposal is sufficient to audit and track the success of the proposal. The proposer presents both product and project KPI to audit from both perspectives. The team has also planned to make the software available as open-source which helps the community keep the progress in check. Furthermore, the increase in staking and trading NFT allowing transition from other chains shows the increase in network traffic and value which is a transparent tool that helps the auditors draw their conclusions about the success of the proposal. With the phase I completion, the number of coins listed on the implemented DEX at the end of 6 months will also be an additional metric that the auditing process can make use of. Given the above rationale, the clarity and auditability  is distinct and hence I would like to score 5 out of 5 for the same.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal intends to create a DEX featuring an array of DeFi-options.  It is part of a larger project spanning 7 proposals in fund 7. The intention of the main project seems to be to create a sub-ecosystem on the Cardano blockchain. A DEX with DeFi-abilities is a crucial part in the whole that is intended. The DEX has a dual function as there is a set objective to bridge with other blockchains, putting the ERC20-converter to use and generating an influx of community members on this one. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is ambitious, but not impossible. The proposers still need to assemble a team for this. There has been provided a clear definition of the functions that are still needed.  It also needs identification of who already is in the team.

However, if this is the value-added of the team itself then more details in regards to the team's capacity to recruit effectively and the details of the DEX itself. Usually proposals that ask for amounts in the range of $75k will have MVPs or a very strong track record. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The milestones provided are very clear and easy to follow up on as they are provided on a weekly basis with recruitment in the first two weeks and ICO by week 23.

Konma is an organization and have an orchestra of different proposal (seven of them) on this Fund 7. Konmaswap is one of their project out of many, but that doesn't lower the quality of each proposal they made. From the knowledge of the teams needed (and how to find them), the detailed goals and plan, budget breakdowns, action plans, the KPI, product KPI, all of this is explained very well and in details. Especially regarding the skills requirement for the team. It shows that Konma are able to identify the resource needed for this kind of project to succeed. Overall, from this well written proposal alone, there is a high chance of success that this project will come to fruition.

There is mention of Consulting Mlbas, or Emurgo but due to the size of the funds requested it would be great to see the in house experience available.
