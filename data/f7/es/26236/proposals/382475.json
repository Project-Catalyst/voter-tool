Aunque este podr\u00eda ser el caso, ya que algunas plataformas est\u00e1n siendo desarrolladas pero parece que ninguna est\u00e1 completamente terminada todav\u00eda, este objetivo no est\u00e1 completamente alineado con los objetivos del reto. El objetivo de este reto es crear un mecanismo alternativo y m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido para el propio Catalyst, para acelerar la forma de distribuir los fondos. Lo m\u00e1s cercano que existe en esta propuesta relacionado con eso es el ejemplo de las campa\u00f1as de 'GoFundMe', en las que los fondos est\u00e1n inmediatamente disponibles para el creador de la campa\u00f1a, pero aunque esto no estar\u00eda utilizando fondos de Catalyst. Sin embargo, un proyecto de este tipo tendr\u00eda un buen impacto en el ecosistema de Cardano, y esta soluci\u00f3n, si se desarrolla adecuadamente, podr\u00eda escalar con facilidad. Los proponentes deber\u00edan haber incluido algunos KPIs sobre el impacto del reto para permitir su evaluaci\u00f3n. Si la propuesta no se financia en esta ronda, sugerir\u00eda buscar otro reto con una mejor alineaci\u00f3n con los objetivos de la propuesta, y tambi\u00e9n a\u00f1adir una secci\u00f3n en la propuesta explicando esta alineaci\u00f3n para que quede m\u00e1s claro no s\u00f3lo para los evaluadores, sino tambi\u00e9n para el propio equipo lo bien alineada que est\u00e1 la propuesta. Adem\u00e1s, algunos otros proyectos en el ecosistema est\u00e1n tratando de construir una plataforma similar, en el Fondo 7 muchas propuestas tienen ideas similares, por lo que podr\u00eda ser posible encontrar alguna colaboraci\u00f3n.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "El historial del equipo se menciona brevemente en la secci\u00f3n \"Experiencia relevante\".

Adem\u00e1s, afirma que el presupuesto se va a utilizar para contratar a personas adicionales para ejecutar el proyecto, pero deber\u00eda explicar qu\u00e9 tipo de personas est\u00e1n buscando, y explicar cu\u00e1ntas personas van a trabajar en el proyecto en total. Esto tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 relacionado con el presupuesto de la propuesta, que parece bastante corto para lo que se propone aqu\u00ed. Se menciona que se recaudar\u00e1 m\u00e1s dinero mediante peque\u00f1as aportaciones recogidas de propinas y porcentajes de fondos, pero depender de esto para construir la plataforma suena un poco arriesgado. La propuesta deber\u00eda incluir una hoja de ruta detallada de lo que se est\u00e1 desarrollando. Actualmente s\u00f3lo se afirma que el proyecto estar\u00eda completo en 30 d\u00edas tras la financiaci\u00f3n, pero sin explicar el alcance y lo que hay que hacer -teniendo en cuenta que mencionan que la plataforma ya est\u00e1 parcialmente construida- es bastante dif\u00edcil confiar en que se vaya a entregar en el plazo mencionado. Tambi\u00e9n menciona que contratar\u00e1 a algunas personas para trabajar en ella, y hacer eso y desarrollar todo en 30 d\u00edas no suena muy factible.

Con el fin de mejorar su viabilidad para un futuro Fondo, si no se financia en esta ronda, el proponente debe a\u00f1adir los elementos mencionados aqu\u00ed, y / o, alternativamente, buscar asesoramiento en la redacci\u00f3n de una propuesta, porque la idea es buena, s\u00f3lo necesita una mejor redacci\u00f3n para mejorar su oportunidad de ser financiado.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Lamentablemente, esta propuesta carece de informaci\u00f3n sobre su auditabilidad.
