Tambi\u00e9n tengo algunas dudas sobre el problema que esta propuesta intenta resolver, as\u00ed como sobre la soluci\u00f3n propuesta.  Sugiere que el crowdfunding est\u00e1 ausente en \u00c1frica, sin embargo, el crowdfunding en toda \u00c1frica se ha establecido y ha crecido r\u00e1pidamente desde su explosi\u00f3n en 2016, con opciones respaldadas por BTC en la mayor\u00eda de los principales actores como Thundafund.  Mientras que una plataforma de crowdfunding de ADA ser\u00eda un embajador bienvenido de la comunidad de Cardano/\u00c1frica (en la medida en que se destaca de... Project Catalyst), esta propuesta apenas visita la idea.  M\u00e1s bien, los primeros 6 meses de financiaci\u00f3n se centran en la finalizaci\u00f3n de un piloto de intercambio de parejas de monedas locales y ADA y en una campa\u00f1a en los medios sociales para impulsar su adopci\u00f3n.  Se estima que el posterior despliegue y prueba de una plataforma de crowdfunding permitir\u00e1 realizar el primer proyecto financiado en un a\u00f1o desde el inicio de la financiaci\u00f3n, y la mayor\u00eda de los indicadores clave de rendimiento estar\u00e1n relacionados con el \u00e9xito del intercambio subyacente.  Esta propuesta tiene un objetivo ambicioso para su crowdfunding:  100 proyectos financiados con 100 millones de d\u00f3lares en el segundo a\u00f1o de la propuesta.  Sugiere un mayor crecimiento en el futuro, sobre todo para la bolsa, por lo que es de suponer que la parte de crowdfunding tambi\u00e9n se beneficiar\u00e1 de ese crecimiento, aunque no se menciona nada m\u00e1s.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Esta ambiciosa propuesta carece de una serie de indicadores clave que aumentar\u00edan enormemente la confianza en su ejecuci\u00f3n.  El alcance del proyecto no est\u00e1 vinculado a la financiaci\u00f3n de su presupuesto ni a los recursos propuestos, en particular el personal.  Es dif\u00edcil imaginar que se pueda poner en marcha un cambio de divisas, desarrollar y lanzar una incubadora de empresas financiada por crowdfunding, e impulsar las cifras de adopci\u00f3n previstas con una plantilla de dos personas.  Adem\u00e1s, no hab\u00eda v\u00ednculos espec\u00edficos ni pruebas de las cualificaciones del equipo de desarrollo y marketing, lo que hace dudar de su capacidad para ejecutar incluso una versi\u00f3n reducida de las fases iniciales del plan.  El presupuesto se describi\u00f3 con claridad, pero no parec\u00eda estar suficientemente vinculado a una hoja de ruta que proporcionara un camino claro para la propuesta, como por ejemplo qu\u00e9 componentes habr\u00eda que desarrollar, qu\u00e9 recursos fuera del espacio de oficina y el alojamiento habr\u00eda que conseguir, o c\u00f3mo se financiar\u00edan y ejecutar\u00edan ciertos objetivos como los encuentros sociales.  Adem\u00e1s, el proceso de establecer incluso un intercambio local b\u00e1sico est\u00e1 plagado de responsabilidades y riesgos, y en esta propuesta no se sugiere que se entiendan estas ideas.  Junto con una hoja de ruta detallada para los primeros 3-6 meses de financiaci\u00f3n, ser\u00eda \u00fatil ver un an\u00e1lisis de riesgo convincente del comercio de pares de criptomonedas en la moneda local et\u00edope, y la estabilidad que podr\u00eda adquirir el ETB de una persona a trav\u00e9s de dicha plataforma.  Si esta propuesta se redujera a tal objetivo, y tal vez se presentara para su consideraci\u00f3n como un dex, tal vez ser\u00eda una b\u00fasqueda que valdr\u00eda la pena.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "La hoja de ruta proporcionada, un ambicioso impulso en defi a lo largo de unos 3-4 a\u00f1os, carece de la granularidad necesaria para evaluar hitos realistas durante ese periodo de tiempo.  Centr\u00e1ndonos s\u00f3lo en los primeros 6 meses de desarrollo, antes del prop\u00f3sito declarado de establecer una plataforma de crowdfunding, ser\u00eda aconsejable indicar ciertas m\u00e9tricas que podr\u00edan ayudar a establecer la confianza en el proyecto: usuarios semanales o quincenales que se espera que se incorporen a la dex, m\u00e9tricas de participaci\u00f3n en las redes sociales, indicadores de lo que supondr\u00eda una reuni\u00f3n de desarrolladores exitosa para iniciar el proyecto.  Deber\u00eda haber m\u00e1s, pero esto ser\u00eda un buen comienzo.  Por \u00faltimo, una hoja de ruta m\u00e1s detallada proporcionar\u00eda fechas de entrega de eventos y activos con mejor resoluci\u00f3n que las actuales ventanas de 90-180 d\u00edas.  Creo que un proyecto tan ambicioso y a esta escala se beneficiar\u00eda de un equipo mucho m\u00e1s grande o de un enfoque mucho m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o en los 6 meses iniciales de la hoja de ruta.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal suggests a novel way of integrating payment systems through COTi to enable crowdfunding opportunities in Africa.
