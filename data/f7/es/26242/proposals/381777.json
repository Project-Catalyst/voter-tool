De esta manera, sin duda beneficiar\u00eda mucho al ecosistema, ya que incorporar\u00eda a varios miembros nuevos y capaces (sabemos que Brasil es la mayor potencia sudamericana y que hay mucho por hacer all\u00ed, pero lo que falta es precisamente eso, una instrucci\u00f3n adecuada). Y tambi\u00e9n, obviamente, el pa\u00eds, ya que podr\u00eda generar muchas ofertas de trabajo para varios profesionales que sufren la crisis financiera del pa\u00eds, que se intensific\u00f3 principalmente despu\u00e9s de la pandemia - varios profesionales calificados han sido empleados y tienen mucha dificultad para encontrar oportunidades. Es muy positivo c\u00f3mo el autor determina exactamente qui\u00e9n ser\u00eda el p\u00fablico objetivo del proyecto, lo que demuestra un sentido de la realidad muy importante, sabe lo que va a hacer y para qui\u00e9n lo va a hacer, esto genera una pauta esencial, que comentar\u00e9 mejor en los pr\u00f3ximos temas. Tambi\u00e9n se esbozan algunos temas que se tratar\u00edan en el curso para que tengamos un avance exacto de lo que se trabajar\u00eda aqu\u00ed. Tambi\u00e9n determina la duraci\u00f3n total del curso, generando un buen sentido del tiempo para nosotros. Y lo m\u00e1s relevante de todo es que el curso ser\u00eda gratuito, es decir, todos podemos participar, lo que rompe las barreras sociales y beneficia plenamente a la localidad latinoamericana. En general, no creo que tenga nada que criticar sobre el impacto de la propuesta, es algo que cumple perfectamente con lo que buscamos en este desaf\u00edo.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Hablando de equipos, creo que todo el proyecto ser\u00eda llevado a cabo por una sola persona. Me gust\u00f3 mucho esta idea, pero creo que ser\u00eda mejor si tuvi\u00e9ramos un grupo aqu\u00ed. El autor, que impartir\u00eda el curso, es sin duda muy capaz, ya que es doctor en f\u00edsica, profesor en una Universidad Federal de Brasil, etc. Pero ser\u00eda interesante entender mejor la relaci\u00f3n directa entre \u00e9l y el blockchain Cardano. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se enter\u00f3 del proyecto? \u00bfDesde cu\u00e1ndo forma parte de la comunidad? \u00bfQu\u00e9 desarrolla exactamente por aqu\u00ed? Me gustar\u00eda que se resolvieran estas dudas. Creo que ser\u00eda importante contratar a dos profesionales: un dise\u00f1ador, para preparar el contenido visual del curso y tambi\u00e9n las piezas gr\u00e1ficas de promoci\u00f3n, y alguien de marketing, para tejer estrategias de comunicaci\u00f3n que hagan que el curso tenga un amplio alcance de p\u00fablico. En cuanto al gui\u00f3n, esta parte es perfecta. El autor divide las actividades en base a cada mes, del 1 al 6, y cada mes est\u00e1 bien explicado en temas. Qu\u00e9 pasar\u00eda y qui\u00e9n qu\u00e9 orden, para que tengamos una comprensi\u00f3n completa del proceso, sin dejar ninguna laguna. Las explicaciones mensuales tambi\u00e9n van acompa\u00f1adas del coste de despido de cada mes, lo que tambi\u00e9n hace muy plausible el rendimiento del presupuesto.

El autor nos proporciona un gui\u00f3n muy bien elaborado, extremadamente preciso y lleno de detalles. A trav\u00e9s de \u00e9l, podemos controlar exactamente, cada mes, si se cumple lo prometido. Aconsejo que sea hecho por miembros de la comunidad Cardano nativos de Brasil; de esta manera, podr\u00eda haber un di\u00e1logo directo entre la comunidad y el autor, y un seguimiento progresivo, para monitorear el proceso y no s\u00f3lo los resultados. Pero, hablando de ellos, es importante destacar el impacto de este curso en la poblaci\u00f3n local. Esta parte, en mi opini\u00f3n, deber\u00eda hacerla el propio autor. Una especie de encuesta de datos posterior al curso, en la que se pusiera en contacto directo con algunos de los alumnos, para recibir comentarios tanto sobre la calidad del curso como sobre su impacto en la vida pr\u00e1ctica. \u00bfAbren estas ense\u00f1anzas puertas? En caso afirmativo, \u00bfcu\u00e1les? \u00bfTienen los participantes la intenci\u00f3n de ser miembros activos de la comunidad de Cardano, ya sea a trav\u00e9s de Catalyst o trabajando como desarrolladores de blockchain en diversas propuestas? Este tipo de datos podr\u00edan ser recogidos y transmitidos a la comunidad.

In the detailed CV we can't find the necessary experience, skills and knowledge that the lecturer should have. The budget is clearly presented but it would be much better if it was divided differently. Maybe to require half the budget in this Catalys F7 and half in the Catalsy F8. Holding a lecture for 6 months is a challenging job and is not a safe investment. But if they had a 3-month lecture, it would be easier to follow the development of the project and influence the improvements. There is a detailed implementable plan and it is very well developed as well as details of actionable tasks and order of execution are presented. The proposal offered a timetable to complete the work but in my opinion it is not realistically presented. As I already said there could be a much better brake down budget but also a time frame from 6 months to 3 months of lectures. We can find in the proposal a clear explanation of technical aspects and technologies for implementation but there is a lack of insight into possible risks and they could be especially in online workshops. What if the students don't come? It would be good to address the possible risks.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not have a clearly defined roadmap in terms of date or for exmaple (Q1, Q2, Q3) when the course will take place.
