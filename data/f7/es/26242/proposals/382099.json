The potential impact of this project on LatAm Community growth is clearly explained with appropriate Kpis : number of transaction generated, unique wallets using the platform etc. \r\nFunding this project will offer a community a way to grow by getting its own ability to fund other LatAm projects, Dapps and SPOs.\r\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The ALDEA team has proven a lot.
