De hecho, hay una falta de cursos sobre este tema en portugu\u00e9s, para los estudiantes brasile\u00f1os, y el Syllabus parece muy robusto.Esto est\u00e1 bien definido en la declaraci\u00f3n del problema y la soluci\u00f3n propuesta es razonable, encajando dentro del desaf\u00edo.\r\nAlgunos puntos de preguntas/para considerar:\r\n1) Tengo entendido que este curso ser\u00e1 totalmente online. Es estupendo porque tiene un mayor alcance. Sin embargo, si fuera presencial, se podr\u00eda crear una comunidad/red brasile\u00f1a m\u00e1s fuerte entre el profesor y los estudiantes. Yo considerar\u00eda la posibilidad de tener al menos algunas sesiones online. Por cierto, podr\u00eda ser m\u00e1s claro si habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s de 1 sesiones por a\u00f1o o si va a ser una sola.\r\n2) Me encanta que este curso sea gratuito para los estudiantes. Esto hace que la propuesta sea muy inclusiva. Sin embargo, no se indica ning\u00fan criterio de selecci\u00f3n (si va a ser por calificaci\u00f3n, ingresos totales de la familia, etc). De todos modos, yo dedicar\u00eda al menos unas cuantas plazas a estudiantes de bajos ingresos/pobres, especialmente en las regiones de las favelas. Esto estar\u00eda en consonancia con los ODS #04 y 10 de la ONU, que hoy en d\u00eda son muy apreciados en los proyectos y organizaciones para ayudar a disminuir la desigualdad.\r\n3) Tambi\u00e9n desarrollar\u00eda m\u00e1s en la propuesta el plan de comunicaci\u00f3n. Si la intenci\u00f3n es llevar el conocimiento de blockchain a quienes no lo conocen, es muy importante un plan de comunicaci\u00f3n para llegar a personas fuera de este mundo.

Por ejemplo, \u00bfcu\u00e1nto se va a pagar s\u00f3lo al profesor? \u00bfcu\u00e1nto se va a utilizar para elaborar el material del curso? \u00bfcu\u00e1nto para adquirir las herramientas (micr\u00f3fono, ordenador, c\u00e1mara, programas inform\u00e1ticos)?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Existen algunas m\u00e9tricas, pero algunas de ellas est\u00e1n mal definidas (por ejemplo, la opini\u00f3n de los estudiantes no puede ser una m\u00e9trica en s\u00ed misma, sino que deber\u00eda estar mejor definida, como n\u00famero de opiniones positivas; considere incluso la posibilidad de crear un NPS sobre esto.

The proposal seems to fit in the challenge, making Brazilian students, which are very creative, aware of Cardano. However, I have some points to add: 1) I've seen that you are a professor in UFPE. Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation. Therefore, if it is overpriced you won't have a great number of people attending it; 3) I imagine that, in order to keep this project going, you will charge for these classes and make it running, however I would like to see it more explicit;", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is well written and I have no doubt that a Professor with such curriculum willing to pass this knowledge beyond will be capable of conducting this proposal.

The perfect vessel to further the word of Cardano. Initially I had questions regarding how will this proposer acquire the materials on Cardano for it seems the proposer is quite new to the community. Sure enough though, the LATAM Cardano community came in numbers to support the proposer with all the materials they needed. These interactions are recorded in the comments section.

The 3 (three) month timetable to implement this proposal is clear and has an adjoining detailed action plan that further ensures confidence all goals set by the proposer will be achieve.

The knowledge, skills and knowledge of Cardano blockachain do not stand out on both links that are placed in the proposal. Perhaps the lecturer himself will learn through the lecture what is the best school for both the one who teaches and the one who listens to the lecture. The budget is clearly presented but in my opinion $2500 per presentation with preparation of the presentation is unreasonable. These are too high costs per presentation. The plan is well developed but no risks are covered or mentioned. What if students do not come to the lecture or a small number come or the lecturer does not have the necessary skills to deliver the knowledge?
