Ser\u00eda beneficioso que los proponentes explicaran en detalle qu\u00e9 es el bootcamp, yo no conoc\u00eda el concepto antes y tuve que investigarlo, pero igual fue un poco confuso. En teor\u00eda es algo muy bueno, porque beneficiar\u00eda a 3 temas muy importantes: 1) generaci\u00f3n de oportunidades de empleo para las mujeres latinoamericanas, respondiendo directamente a los objetivos del desaf\u00edo. 2) nuevas personas para trabajar y difundir el ecosistema Cardano. 3) ayudar\u00eda a llenar el vac\u00edo de mujeres en el ecosistema, que es f\u00e1cilmente perceptible. Sin embargo, algunos detalles dejan que desear en esta propuesta. Los proponentes prometen algunas cosas pero no explican realmente c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan. Por ejemplo, \u00bfde qu\u00e9 pa\u00eds ser\u00edan estas mujeres? \u00bfEn qu\u00e9 idioma se impartir\u00edan estas ense\u00f1anzas? \u00bfC\u00f3mo ser\u00eda el proceso de selecci\u00f3n? \u00bfEl curso ser\u00eda completamente gratuito? \u00bfQui\u00e9n ser\u00eda esta especialista en psicolog\u00eda y c\u00f3mo acompa\u00f1ar\u00eda a las 30 mujeres seleccionadas? \u00bfC\u00f3mo se producir\u00eda este apoyo comunitario? En mi opini\u00f3n, algunas preguntas muy importantes quedan abiertas, lo que socava nuestra comprensi\u00f3n y confianza en el impacto del proyecto.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Los oferentes son una pareja que tiene algunos datos importantes sobre qui\u00e9nes son. Los detalles sobre Daniel son muy completos, ya que no pudimos conocer tan bien a Maria do Carmo, en relaci\u00f3n con la informaci\u00f3n que se da en la propuesta. Sin embargo, este proyecto necesita una serie de otros profesionales involucrados. Aunque afirmaron que se asociar\u00edan con la ONG Laboratoria, no sabemos qui\u00e9nes de la ONG trabajar\u00edan en el proyecto y en qu\u00e9 funciones. \u00bfSer\u00eda necesario que tuvi\u00e9ramos m\u00e1s certeza sobre, por ejemplo, si habr\u00eda personas especializadas en la ense\u00f1anza? \u00bfQui\u00e9n ser\u00eda el psic\u00f3logo, qui\u00e9n har\u00eda el marketing, el dise\u00f1o? Ser\u00eda necesario conocer mejor a los dem\u00e1s participantes, seg\u00fan los proponentes. No se da ninguna hoja de ruta, por lo que no sabemos cu\u00e1nto tiempo se desarrollar\u00eda este proyecto, a trav\u00e9s de qu\u00e9 fases, cu\u00e1nto tiempo llevar\u00eda cada cosa, en qu\u00e9 orden se producir\u00edan y por qu\u00e9, etc. No es posible tener una previsi\u00f3n del proceso. Y sobre la financiaci\u00f3n: es una cantidad muy elevada, \u00a170 mil para ense\u00f1ar a 30 mujeres! Aunque hay una explicaci\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo se utilizar\u00eda este dinero, es muy superficial. Por ejemplo: 5k para publicitar el bootcamp. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 este valor? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo se har\u00eda ese anuncio? Otros 5k para el sellado. De nuevo: \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 tanto? \u00bfQu\u00e9 tipo de selecci\u00f3n es esta y por qu\u00e9 requiere tanto dinero de por medio? Del mismo modo, los otros temas deber\u00edan haberse detallado mejor. En general, tanto el equipo como el gui\u00f3n y la divisi\u00f3n del presupuesto dejan que desear.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Se proporcionan algunos KPI que ayudar\u00edan a controlar los resultados, es decir, si lo prometido se ha cumplido realmente. El primer KPI no tiene sentido para m\u00ed: \"Conocimiento: de 0 a 5.000 mujeres con talento en la tecnolog\u00eda que conocen el Cardano Bootcamp\". \u00bfC\u00f3mo se puede medir eso? Es una estad\u00edstica muy complicada de definir. Las otras tienen sentido y son buenas. Sin embargo, como no hay una hoja de ruta, tampoco hay una forma m\u00e1s profunda de seguir el desarrollo real del proyecto. Si conoci\u00e9ramos los pasos que hay que dar, ser\u00eda posible establecer un contacto espor\u00e1dico con los proponentes y controlar si esas actividades se est\u00e1n llevando a cabo realmente en tiempo y forma. Por tanto, creo que es posible establecer una auditabilidad, pero s\u00f3lo en relaci\u00f3n con el producto final y no con el proceso, que es igualmente importante.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 17, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Women are under-represented in the Ecosystem, and the proposal aims to improve that. I believe this is relevant for the community because diversity in any organization promotes factors such as creativity, better decision making, flexibility, respect, and improved brand image. From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates. Will they become part of the educational staff in the future? Mentoring could also be provided for the development of future proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal does a great job describing the characteristics of the two leaders of the project. Daniel and Maria manage to combine skills and experiences that combined with a partner like LABORATORIA, make a very strong team. For this project it is essential to have a deep knowledge of Haskell or Plutus, which from what I understand will be the mentors they are planning to hire. So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate. As a result, it would have been beneficial if the team had included in the proposal actions to reduce or counteract this risk.  \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With regard to auditability, the team has provided a successful description. There is a roadmap in 5 phases, which I consider to be well explained, and enables the community to understand what will happen at each stage of the implementation process. Also described are five indicators of success that can be used to evaluate whether the project is having a positive impact at every stage of implementation.

The proposal is well aligned with the challenge objective. It could have been good to show and explain how it will scale over time, maybe include a potential revenue model (investing in students becomes more and more popular from other projects I am working on), and show how the graduates will be integrated into the Cardano ecosystem (how many of the 800 companies mentioned are related to Cardano?).

While I haven\u2019t come up with answers yet, I see your proposal as paving the way to a possible one.
