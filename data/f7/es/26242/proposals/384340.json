If successful, it would bring a major impact on the local communities. It would also bring a major positive impact on Cardano, receiving into its ecosystem new members who are different from crypto's usual market(small farmers as opposed to tech nerds.)

It is an impressive proposal but I feel it could be improved by including past achievements. This project is quite grand in scale, with the successful operation of farms on one hand(training, installation, sales, creation of network) and the creation of a dApp on the other hand. Hence, sharing proven experience in delivering such a project would be beneficial for the proposer.\r\n\r\nThe hourly rate for Emurgo developers seem low. Is it possible to get good devs at $10/hour? I am not experienced in hiring devs but I highly doubt it. What about the costs of staff who work in technology education workshops? Where would the funding for that come from? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasoning above is the reason for my rating.
