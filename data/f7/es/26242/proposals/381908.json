Pienso esto porque: la idea aqu\u00ed es renovar la tierra, es decir, trabajar en la tierra devolvi\u00e9ndole sus cualidades, tierra que fue comprada v\u00eda token en Cardano. Lo que beneficiar\u00eda al ecosistema en la parte de creaci\u00f3n de nuevos activos en la blockchain, contratos inteligentes y etc, pero el monto de la financiaci\u00f3n es demasiado alto para que s\u00f3lo se realicen estas actividades en el ecosistema. En mi opini\u00f3n, el proyecto tendr\u00eda que invertir m\u00e1s en dar un retorno a Cardano. Creo que este proyecto beneficiar\u00eda mucho a la localidad latinoamericana, no s\u00f3lo por el hecho de la renovaci\u00f3n del terreno, sino tambi\u00e9n por la generaci\u00f3n de puestos de trabajo con el proyecto (muchos empleados de aqu\u00ed vendr\u00edan de Latinoam\u00e9rica, sobre todo los que hacen actividades in situ). En este sentido, no hay duda. Pero, como dije, habr\u00eda que medir mejor el retorno a Cardano, no sabemos exactamente cu\u00e1ntos tokens se generar\u00edan, cu\u00e1ntas personas, en promedio, se atraer\u00edan al ecosistema y esos detalles. Por eso creo que no es un proyecto que cumpla muy bien lo que se ped\u00eda en este reto.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "No se da ninguna informaci\u00f3n sobre el equipo. Es un hecho que varios profesionales trabajar\u00edan aqu\u00ed, como podemos ver en la parte de la divisi\u00f3n de gastos. \u00bfPero qui\u00e9nes son? Necesitar\u00edamos conocer a cada miembro del equipo individualmente, nombres, funciones, relaciones con la blockchain de Cardano, etc. Cuantos m\u00e1s detalles mejor, lamentablemente no tenemos ning\u00fan detalle al respecto aqu\u00ed. Sobre el gui\u00f3n, creo que es medio, algunos de los pasos est\u00e1n mejor explicados, como Q1 - 2022, mientras que otros, como Q4 - 2022 se resumen en una sola frase. Sabemos que hay un plan de acci\u00f3n aqu\u00ed, lo que nos hace entender muy bien lo que se har\u00eda. Pero ser\u00eda interesante que esta informaci\u00f3n estuviera bien relacionada con un calendario, es decir, que cada peque\u00f1a parte encajara en una etapa del proceso, de forma temporal y organizada, para que tuvi\u00e9ramos una comprensi\u00f3n m\u00e1s s\u00f3lida del conjunto. Y sobre la divisi\u00f3n financiera, esta fue la parte que m\u00e1s dej\u00f3 que desear, porque el precio que piden es muy alto y las partes no est\u00e1n explicadas. Por ejemplo, piden 50k para una campa\u00f1a de promoci\u00f3n, pero no explican nada al respecto. No dicen qu\u00e9 tipo de campa\u00f1a ser\u00eda, qu\u00e9 medios se lanzar\u00edan, a qu\u00e9 p\u00fablico objetivo, qu\u00e9 profesionales trabajar\u00edan... 50k suele ser el precio que se pide por una propuesta completa, as\u00ed que si lo piden s\u00f3lo por una parte del proyecto, se necesitar\u00eda mucho detalle. Por desgracia, esta parte de la propuesta deja mucho que desear.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "La auditabilidad es buena, podemos hacerlo de varias maneras. En primer lugar, controlando si las actividades mencionadas en el plan de acci\u00f3n se han realizado realmente, y de forma adecuada. En segundo lugar, mediante el an\u00e1lisis de impacto; se dedican a establecer los impactos esperados para Am\u00e9rica Latina. En este sentido, es muy posible realizar un an\u00e1lisis, tanto cualitativo como cuantitativo, sobre los resultados esperados: esto podr\u00eda ser realizado tanto por la comunidad de Cardano como por el equipo del proyecto. Y por \u00faltimo, se dibujan algunos temas que est\u00e1n directamente relacionados con los resultados y formas de analizar la propuesta (podr\u00eda decir que son los KPI del proyecto). En otras palabras, el equipo nos da varias formas de monitorear su propuesta, pero tambi\u00e9n debe informarnos cuando las fincas son auditadas por el instituto de certificaci\u00f3n de productos org\u00e1nicos. Ser\u00eda ideal que se elaborara un informe con cada visita y se presentara directamente a la comunidad de Cardano.

The proposal involves tokenizing land in order to enable regrowth of land using proven ecological methods. This will address the issue of farmers not being able to ensure a healthy regeneration of land between harvest seasons. This proposal is very relevant to LATAM as food exports to developed countries represent one of many countries' main sources of income. In addition, I understand how this proposal can encourage new users to join the community. However, I must say that it was not possible to evaluate the alignment of the metrics since they were not included.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team describes in detail the skills and experiences in their web page that was provided as a reference. They have also described achievements with their \"land-management and forest regeneration\" method in previous years, although references would have been helpful to verify these results. An action plan is presented; however, I find it to be very general, which makes it difficult to evaluate its feasibility. Another aspect that could be improved in the proposal is the description of the associated tokenomics. Although there is a brief description of the token utility, it is crucial to provide a detailed description of the logic behind the generation of these tokens for a proposal like this one, which is based on the generation of this economy to contribute to the purchase and regeneration of land. Regarding the budget, I believe it is also imperative that for future Catalyst cycles, the team concentrates its efforts on improving this section. Although it is very positive that the topic has been broken down into identifiable areas, some of them need to be better explained. An example is the line item for \"Developers to launch the token\" which is estimated at $60,000 but does not explain the cost per hour, the number of developers needed, or for how long the developers are needed. Another example could be, the item for \"Promotion campaign\" would be estimated at $50,000, in which case you would have to provide answers to questions such as: How many professionals are you planning to hire? Which methods will be used for promotion? What is the expected result of this promotion? Unfortunately, no answers to these questions are provided. Lastly, I would like to mention another issue with the budget that I find is that actions are described to ensure auditability, but it is not clear whether or not these actions are considered as line items within the budget. Especially periodic audits by external agencies tend to be very costly. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally, we arrive at the section regarding auditability, which has its highs and lows.

Furthermore, the community will be able to access all the costs associated with the project, including contracts on chain, external audits, and images of what is happening in the farms. There is another aspect of this proposal that can be improved: the description of the success metrics. Although some of the metrics presented can be analyzed, it is necessary to make much more effort in this regard, especially considering that 37% of the budget allocated for this challenge is being requested.
