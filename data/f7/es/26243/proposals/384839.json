In general, no detailed implementation plan has been presented, but only a roadmap with some milestones. Technical details have been presented briefly and some resources that will be used (with a very brief explanation of how they are used however. Overall, the proposal would still need some more relatable detail planning that shows step by step what is achieved and how, in more detail than it is now presented.

I guess you will end up paying only with stablecoins, or I could not come up with a solution to this. Imagine you will want to pay with Cardano and they do not accept Cardano, how this would occur? Would it be transformed to some stable coin right in the moment of payment? \r\n\r\nMaybe I did not understand the proposal, but for me, there are some questions that need to be addressed first, and I am not sure if this would have that large impact, because first, you need to have people who want to pay with crypto, and possibly stores to accept it. \r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between crypto.com and bnb cards which you can load to your phone and pay by phone? \r\n\r\nAlso, QR code is not used everywhere.\r\n\r\nI get the idea, I am just a bit skeptical. \r\n\r\nRating given 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Relevant experience is stated, yet the proposer states that they will hire two full-time devs - it seems like they are not hired yet.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap seems reasonable\r\n\r\nRating given 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I am convinced that the proposal can be audited, yet more information would be nice to see in this matter.\r\n\r\nSome points from the roadmap can be used for auditing or stated KPIs.\r\n\r\nI think that the progress can be monitored and also the final outcome, yet it would be nice to have it stated explicitly on what metrics.\r\n\r\nRating given 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_54", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I think this proposal effectively spreads the use of Cardano as a payments layer and implements a sort of hybrid lightning network type of approach.
