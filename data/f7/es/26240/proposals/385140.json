El proponente articula claramente la importancia de tener un puente Cardano Ethereum sin confianza para que cualquiera pueda utilizarlo. Con las transacciones de coste relativamente bajo utilizando Cardano, atraer\u00e1 m\u00e1s proyectos de Ethereum para trasladarse a Cardano, ya que tiene m\u00e1s sentido desde el punto de vista econ\u00f3mico tener un coste operativo m\u00e1s barato, a la vez que seguro y protegido.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Applied Blockchain es una empresa consultora que tiene un historial y experiencia de trabajo con varias tecnolog\u00edas blockchain antes, y se explica en detalle en su sitio web. Esto tambi\u00e9n demuestra que el proponente conoce la composici\u00f3n del equipo necesario para trabajar en este proyecto para que sea un \u00e9xito. Aunque el presupuesto ha sido esbozado, necesita m\u00e1s explicaciones en detalle, como por ejemplo: el n\u00famero de personas involucradas y las horas de trabajo con detalles de los salarios. El desglose de los costes de 25.000 d\u00f3lares para cada punto no explica mucho por qu\u00e9 se necesita tal cantidad de financiaci\u00f3n. Podemos ver en esta propuesta que construir\u00e1 un nuevo marco de puente de cadena de bloques sin confianza llamado \"London Bridge\", y que se construir\u00e1 utilizando la tecnolog\u00eda Intel SGX. Ser\u00eda \u00fatil si pudieran explicar brevemente lo que hace Intel SGX, y tambi\u00e9n explicar c\u00f3mo se implementar\u00e1 en detalle. Por ejemplo: explicar c\u00f3mo el uso de Intel SGX podr\u00eda ayudar en la seguridad, en qu\u00e9 parte / aspecto se utilizar\u00e1 al desarrollar el puente, y cu\u00e1les son los desaf\u00edos al implementar este tipo de tecnolog\u00eda.

La propuesta dice que el puente de Londres ya se est\u00e1 integrando con otras cadenas de bloques, pero al investigar, es dif\u00edcil encontrar informaci\u00f3n sobre el puente de Londres y su historia.

Experience having created a large number smart contracts would have allowed them to learn many lessons which will increase the effectiveness of their work in the Cardano community. I would recommend that they include links to their company at least in the comments section, but best in the body of their proposal. One of the very important elements that makes the proposal more feasible, is the wallet receiving the funds is a corporate wallet, not a personal wallet of an employee. Every major request for funding should be organised like that.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The road map is clear and auditable.

No key metrics were mentioned, so I can't say they align with the challenge settings. Not much technical details are linked or explained so I don't know if the proposers can address future challenges. The proposal is lacking in a few respects: No resources, links names or credentials KPIs or metrics of any kind are mentioned in the proposal.  As a developer I find the lack of detailed information technical and otherwise alarming.

The mentioned relevant skills can not be verified in any way, so I don't count on them. No specific plan for a type or number of team members is present in the proposal, which is a red flag for me since any practical proposal would need people to do it. The budget is mentioned but there's no concrete breakdown or explanation on what specific work needs to be done and an hourly rate to do it. I have no idea if the timetable offered for implementation is good or not, because no technical specs or architecture is provided. As a developer I would have been able to estimate at least if the timetable is sensible or not for the job stated to be done. No time is mentioned concerning the integration of the implemented bridge. The deffinition of success is good, but it mentiones what it should accomplish, but the proposal doesn't state how would it support it. No resources of any kind are mentioned as necessary to implement the proposal. Having looked at over 30 proposals by now, this is very odd to me. The technical aspects like architecture language or technologies that are goind to be used for the implemention are never mentioned. A high level overview is not enough for a proposal of this magnitude.  I would love for this project to become a reality because it's a great idea, but as it stands now, I'd suggest to the authors of this proposal to have a look at other technical proposals and have a look through the proposal templates and questions to be answered. Make a better suggestion in the next Round8 and you'll be sure to be voted in! Good luck!", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No mention on how the proposers plan to keep the community in the loop for the progress of the implementaion of the proposal.

The roadmap is present but it could be a bit more concrete about the milestones and task segregation. The problem statement description is clear. The solution on the other hand needs some more work.
