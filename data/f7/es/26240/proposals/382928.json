But this proposal lacks milestones and detailed roadmap for three, six, and twelve months which could easily being improved by the team. I am quite confident that this project could be delivered successfully. My only concern is with only one person overseeing the whole project, there is a high risk of failure in case He is unavailable for executing the project (e.g. he got sick).
