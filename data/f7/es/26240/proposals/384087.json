Esto aportar\u00e1 mucho valor y despertar\u00e1 la alegr\u00eda en los o\u00eddos de los cardanenses. Hay una hoja de ruta clara que a\u00f1ade un valor creciente al ecosistema de cardano. Las m\u00e9tricas clave no s\u00f3lo son relevantes sino que est\u00e1n ah\u00ed. Muchos proyectos descuidan los KPIs, lo que es una pena. Las m\u00e9tricas puestas en este proyecto parecen relevantes hablando como desarrollador y usuario habitual de cardano. La propuesta ser\u00e1 capaz de escalar sin problemas, los autores tienen en cuenta y esperan el crecimiento futuro, lo cual es genial. No veo que falte nada en esta propuesta, ya que es corta pero est\u00e1 muy bien hecha. Esta es una pieza que falta en el rompecabezas y debe ser votada en mi opini\u00f3n.

Los aspectos t\u00e9cnicos son interesantes para m\u00ed como desarrollador, pero me doy cuenta de que no son obligatorios de ninguna manera. Los authros tienen un plan para los posibles riesgos y desaf\u00edos que tienen que ser capaces de superar y por lo que leo en el proyecto, lo har\u00e1n porque est\u00e1n preparados para ello. Me encanta el hecho de que los proponentes tengan un plan de autofinanciaci\u00f3n y no dependan de la financiaci\u00f3n comunitaria durante per\u00edodos prolongados.
