Todos conocemos EmurgoTrace y ScanTrust de Cardano, este \u00faltimo utilizado como mecanismo de seguimiento por la industria vin\u00edcola de Georgia para autenticar las botellas de la granja a la mesa.

Sin duda, se nombran dos de los miembros del equipo, pero sus perfiles de LinkedIn no ofrecen una experiencia directa en el desarrollo de DApp que pueda dar confianza. Intellics Engineering parece estar m\u00e1s centrada en la industria de la automoci\u00f3n y no hay informaci\u00f3n sobre los despliegues actuales y pasados de blockchain como se afirma. Si se van a aprovechar las experiencias en la industria de la automoci\u00f3n para mejorar la informaci\u00f3n sobre la calidad del vino, ya que est\u00e1n relacionadas con el transporte del producto, esto deber\u00eda haberse explicado mejor para crear el v\u00ednculo entre su experiencia y el despliegue previsto. La propuesta describe los hitos durante un periodo de 16 semanas que se centra en la investigaci\u00f3n, la conceptualizaci\u00f3n y la creaci\u00f3n de prototipos y ha proporcionado los costes de los 35.000 d\u00f3lares solicitados. Parece haber una desconexi\u00f3n entre las actividades de 16 semanas enumeradas y la distribuci\u00f3n prevista de los fondos. Mientras que el c\u00e1lculo de costes est\u00e1 centrado en el desarrollo, las actividades previstas est\u00e1n m\u00e1s centradas en la investigaci\u00f3n. Creo que esta propuesta puede beneficiarse de una descripci\u00f3n m\u00e1s clara de la propia DApp, como punto de partida.

A partir de este punto, se pueden extraer los hitos y la trayectoria de desarrollo y, con un c\u00e1lculo de costes adecuado y alineado, se podr\u00edan aumentar las posibilidades de viabilidad del proyecto.

Y de lo que no tienen (por ejemplo, el desarrollo en Plutus), c\u00f3mo van a obtener esa experiencia. Los hitos descritos aqu\u00ed pueden ser el punto de partida sin ninguna ayuda de Catalyst y ser\u00edan una buena base para una propuesta de DApp m\u00e1s sustancial en una futura ronda de financiaci\u00f3n. Buena suerte.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "No hay mucho presentado en la propuesta que proporcione alta confianza para la auditabilidad.

This proposal aims to store in the Cardano blockchain some characteristics about the quality of wines, such as their location, temperature, etc. Unfortunately, I see several points to be problematized here. The situation is similar to another proposal that also deals with the world of wines, which I evaluated recently (Wine open market - Stappato, present at the following link: https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBq7U). We know what the idea is, but there are not enough explanations for us to understand well how all this would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. It is not specified how this bridge would be established, which technologies would be used, how Cardano would be integrated, in a detailed way, in this project. All we are told is that the blockchain would be used to store some information, which would be tamper-proof, traceable and all the other advantages that the blockchain provides. But little is said about it. The proposal is concerned with explaining the crux of the issue much more - guaranteeing final consumers control over the entire wine-finding process - than how all this would use and impact Cardano. Another point I would like to highlight is: as in the other proposal on wines, I find it difficult for the target audience here to actually purchase these services, use this platform (from the attached photo and from the understanding I had, it would be a Dapp). How to reach people who are commonly unaware of blockchain? How to persuade them to use this Dapp, in addition to wanting to have greater control over the wine they will purchase, how would they relate to Cardano? The target audience here would be consumers of refined wines, usually older people and those with good purchasing power. In general, this is the target audience for fancy wines, right? I am not generalizing and putting them in boxes, but more practically, it is not a part of the population that uses blockchain. I would like to understand more in depth how this adoption would take place. In other words, unfortunately I do not see this proposal as something that will guarantee a good return for Cardano, both because it is something extremely specific, a very unique niche, in which consumers need a good direction to use blockchain (if the author had better explained the user experience, maybe this issue would be clearer); both because I could not visualize, in practice, how Cardano would be used here.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Explanations about the company involved, Intellics Engineering, are confusing. To begin with, they say they have experience in many very different areas, such as \"space technology, hotel systems and market industry\". How would it work in such diverse fields? What do they do with blockchain specifically? Have you ever worked with Cardano, or was it another blockchain? What is \"Industry 4.0 and IoT\"? It would be very positive if they had made a clearer definition of what their activities are, conceptualizing these different definitions that I mentioned last, in this way the understanding of the CAs would be much more solid as to who they are and what they do. Individually, the situation is much better, since they make the linkedin profile of their members available. With that we can get to know them individually, but that doesn't make up for the lack of knowing who would do what in this project. It would be necessary for them to clarify who would work here, developing which role and carrying out which activities. About the roadmap, we know which phases would be done and their respective costs (the funding requested would only cover the first phase). In the first phase, for example, the construction of the Dapp would be carried out, this would take 4 months and cost USD 35k. Right. But who would work here? The smaller tasks are defined, in fact, in the topic \"this phase will contain several important milestones\". This allows us to understand what would be done and in what order, as well as how long each activity would take. However, each topic could be detailed better, there is no way to fully understand the development of the project without knowing who would be responsible for each part, for example. The budget is explained in a somewhat superficial way, it is said how the money would be distributed, but each topic should also be more detailed. For example, 6k for marketing. It is said that some promotional materials would be made, such as pamphlets, shirts and publicity on social media. But in what way? What social media? How to reach the target audience? As in the marketing example, the other expenses could be better broken down. In summary, I think it's a little difficult to understand the activities of this company, but it's possible to get to know each stakeholder well; the roadmap is present and satisfactory, although not very detailed in some ways, as is the budgetary justification. The topic is well covered, just needing some adjustments.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is admissible through the data provided in the KPIs part, I found it positive that these data are quite diverse and are not limited to just measuring the amount of products/transactions performed. But some parts could be better explained; for example, user satisfaction. How would that be done, would any research be carried out? And what research? Would the results be shared with the rest of the Cardano community, and if so, through which platform? In my view, however, there could be more KPIs directly focused on the benefits of the Cardano ecosystem. In other words, if new members were acquired for the community, if they are active, if they suddenly started other activities within the ecosystem beyond the use of this Dapp. In the \"Challenges/Risks\" section, some possible obstacles are outlined, and a good way of auditing the proposal would also be monitoring if such problems really happened and if they were resolved. All this data must be directly presented to the Cardano community, as it is a project that has several phases, an idea would be that there was a meeting at the end of each stage, to situate the community on how the development is going and the results already partially obtained.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have the engineering knowledge, but some details were not entirely clear to determine the feasibility of this project correctly. That is: how the cork works. Judging from the gallery images on the website, the cork will need to be replaced by this device in order to determining the climate of the bottle's interior.
