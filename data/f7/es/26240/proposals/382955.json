La idea central y el concepto son asombrosos, pero para que yo (como asesor comunitario experimentado) pueda evaluar la propuesta ser\u00eda necesario incluir m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n en ella.

Ver que el proponente entiende los riesgos potenciales de desafiar a una gran industria como la inmobiliaria y c\u00f3mo eso podr\u00eda llevar a algunos problemas legales y a empresas e individuos problem\u00e1ticos, me lleva a pensar que el proponente tiene un profundo conocimiento del mercado inmobiliario, lo que aumenta la confianza y la credibilidad de la propuesta.
