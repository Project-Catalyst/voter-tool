The proposal is just in the right challenge setting, growing the ecosystem already and with this change it would spread even more. There's an implicit certanty this project will add value to the cardano ecosystem, because they have an already working product and polishing it alongside growing their community.  The proposal is well thought out and the authors have considered time for unexpected hurdles and challenges in the comming development.  This proposal adds simplicity to the ecosystem which is very important in the begining of any growing community.

The number of team members are known as well as the exact work they need to do to reach their goal. Ther budget is 2000 dollars which is next to nothing and it's clear it's going to be used for salary so it's a no brainer for me. There's a realistic timetable with work needing to be done described in steps.  The plan describes the resources that are going to be needed to implement the proposal like team members along with skills, software and hardware that's needed and already used. Good use caes on top of which to build and expand.  The authous thought about potential risks and have included time in the original timetable to fix anything that comes up.

I'd suggest for future proposals to give the community a way to easily interact and follow the progress of your project. A simple discord channel or a link to a github repository would be enough for anyone interested.  There's a clear roadmap with clear tasks to be done alongside a timetable, nothing to worry about here speaking from a dev's perspective. The problem and the solution statements could be more clear, because it took me a while to understand what's the purpose of this project in the first place.
