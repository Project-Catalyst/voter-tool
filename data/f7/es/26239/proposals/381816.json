Also, it is an important vulnerability of the ecosystem that should be treated as early as possible to mitigate this potential risk.

Also, the timeline of the proposal sounds genuinely feasible.

We don't have the usual structure of a proposal, instead, the proposer opted for a more easy-to-read proposal. By doing it this way the proposer makes sure we are more eager to read through the whole proposal and don't miss any information. This is why I am concerned about the first few months of this project. The proposal plans on delivering its first content 6 months in the roadmap but in the first 6 months, the proposal depends heavily on the work of volunteers. But we don't see how the proposer plans on gathering these volunteers, maybe he already has them or not. My other concern with the proposal is the relevant experience the proposer claims to have. He states to have 7 years of experience in marketing and supplies us with a LinkedIn page. But here he has been working as a freelance for 7 years and we don't see actual proof of deliveries. It would've been better to link to works he has done as freelance.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "We are provided with a roadmap on which I've stated my concerns in the previous rationale.

In addition to this, I am part of the catalyst community since several funds and know where to find trustable source of information which is an important resource for evaluating proposals in this category. The proposal identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved, however the solution seems like a mixture of different ideas that aren't very coherent and in this form make it difficult to see how they will add value to the cardano ecosystem, especially as a lot of information platforms and influencers informing about scams already exist. Key metrics are missing in the proposal. It's goals would, if properly implemented, probably adress the challenge metrics. However, this can be doubted due to the unstructured proposal.

Some milestones are presented  for the proposal, but they could be more concrete. This shows that quite a bit of the detail planning of the project still needs to be done. Feedback: Do a more detailed plan on what each aspect of the proposal needs work and time-wise and try to turn this into milestones. The proposers  background will aid with some aspects of the proposal, but someone with the technical background is unfortunately missing.
