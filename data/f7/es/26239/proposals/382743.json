Its main idea is building an environment where collaboration could be leveraged. Having said that even if it succeeds it does not mean it will be easier for people to identify if information about Cardano is true or attacks on the network are being avoided. In other words, it does not effectively solve the initial problem of risking a disinformation attack eroding the trust of the Cardano environment and making it lose value. Its metrics make sense in the context of the idea proposed but are not really aligned with the outlined challenge settings. In sum, I believe its impact is limited.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Not much evidence was provided regarding the skills and experience of the team responsible for the project.

The proposal does not indicate how many people will be needed or which positions they will have to play. Also, the total amount of the budget is reasonable, but it does not explain how they estimated each part. Besides that, there is a fund for unexpected costs which is positive. Moreover, the timetable is realistic but a bit short, they could have explored more possible actions to expand the impact of the proposal. Finally, more thoughts could have been given regarding the risks and challenges relevant to a successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Some evidence was provided to audit the advancement of the proposal.

The problem to solve is clearly described, but as the proposal itself states, it does not offer a single and concise solution to the problem. The idea is to establish active and regular communication between DLT/Blockchain communities about how to mitigate misinformation campaigns with the goal to share experiences and knowledge and ultimately arrive together to new solutions to the misinformation problem.\r\n\r\nThis idea can have great impact on the Cardano ecosystem and community (and also on other communities, which is great)! However, the fact that this proposal aims to create mostly the stage for communication  and leave the solution creation to community members could take away from the final impact. I believe that the proposers should aim not only to bring people together but also help them arrive to solutions or reach out to even more people that would like to implement their ideas. Ideally, in the end we would like a number of concrete solutions to come out of this.\r\n\r\nOf course, concrete solutions as a final outcome would require more time and effort, but would make the idea more impactful and worthwhile.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Even though the proposal seems quite feasible at first sight, my opinion is that it lacks a few things.\r\n\r\nThe proposers state that they are experienced members of the Cardano community with great connections to other DLT/Blockchain communities, but do not provide enough information to back up these claims (outside from their Catalyst profiles). The number of people that will be involved is not clearly stated (4 proposers), which is also true about the task division and how many people will be needed for each task.\r\n\r\nThe budget is outlined relatively clearly, but more information would be welcome, such as number of people and time devoted to each task. \"Treasury for unexpected costs\" is also defined without explaining what these extra costs might be.\r\n\r\nThe implementation plan is there but more information would help. It is not clear if the first phase of the project and especially the biweekly calls will be held for January only, or if they will continue for more. Also, the first phase seems the most demanding for the project team and without more information it is not clear if it can be achieved fully.

The third phase is about launching a \"defend against misinformation attacks\" conference, but no more information is provided.\r\n\r\nI believe that with a more concise plan and a backup plan in case things do not go as planned, e.g., there is not enough interest from the community, this proposal would be much more complete.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal defines a roadmap and has a clear timeline of ~3 months.
