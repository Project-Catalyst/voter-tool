Comparing the challenge setting with the goals of the proposals I don't see a full alignment between challenge and proposal.

This is an issue that my family has been looking at for several years, as weekly buyers of organic vegetables from Riverford, a UK supplier that buys from independent suppliers, and tries to offer them a good deal.\n\nMaking this type of arrangement more broadly accessible through a DAO is a very interesting idea. I expect that it will be challenging to capture the many aspects of food distribution in a DAO, but it is a simpler system than some and we need to start somewhere. Perhaps the proposer will be able to start with simpler aspects of the system and eventually move more of the operation to a DAO.\n\nBottom line is that this fits the challenge extremely well, and addresses a genuine and important problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although I love this proposal, and the proposer has relevant experience, the details of how the proposal would be executed are not specified. As mentioned under impact, it will be challenging to turn the food distribution system into a DAO, and the proposal does not say anything about how this would happen.

This approach in this area is novel, particularly in the developed world, where supply chains are often overrun by agri-business and small, independent farmers and unable to compete. By integrating the DAO structure into the farming sector in the Pacific Northwest, this proposal has the potential to improve the transfer of fresh food from farm to table. Current co-ops and community groups that work in this space are left with few ways to encourage more individuals to participate and develop positive feedback loops where the products (and their quality) are managed in an iterative and communitarian manner. If successful, such a proof of concept could easily be extrapolated to other areas, and likely a variety of farm types. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While I am giving 3/5 I have to say that I am very impressed with the idea presented and do think that there is good potential. The reason why I feel unable to provide a higher ranking, is that the plan really does not explain what steps are needed to organize and develop a system in a feasible manner. There are no technical details on how they will go about setting up the DAO. While the roadmap does hint at some of the key steps that will need to be taken, there is no explanation of what that work will entail and how it will be conducted. For example, \"Phase 1: 3 months:  Master Plan creation, basic architecture, and security plan\" but there is no outline or even indication on what would be created. Given the amount  being asked for, I would need more details on the \"how\" aspects of the proposal.

Within the \"auditability\" section of the proposal it's stated that auditing can happen at each step but there is no indication just how it would happen. Personally, I think that the proposers need to better explain a potential audit process (or how they'd like to encourage community audits) throughout the proposal, and if done appropriately, this would make it much stronger.
