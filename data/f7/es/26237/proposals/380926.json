Creo que esto encaja perfectamente con el objetivo del Reto de desarrollar herramientas para la gesti\u00f3n de DAOs.  Doy la calificaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s alta para el impacto porque creo que el desarrollo exitoso de este proyecto puede mejorar en gran medida la comunidad de Cardano, tanto por la mejora del proceso de Catalyst, lo que resulta en una mejor y m\u00e1s eficaz toma de decisiones, as\u00ed como por el establecimiento de herramientas que ser\u00e1n valiosas para m\u00e1s proyectos en Cardano.  Este \u00faltimo beneficio se ajusta al objetivo del Reto de proporcionar razones para que los creadores de DAOs graviten hacia Cardano en lugar de otras plataformas.  Como alguien que ha estado preocupado durante algunos a\u00f1os por el p\u00e9simo estado del discurso y la toma de decisiones, e interesado en los enfoques tecnol\u00f3gicos para mejorarlos, creo que los beneficios del desarrollo y la adopci\u00f3n exitosa de herramientas que mejoran el discurso y la toma de decisiones podr\u00edan extenderse mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de beneficiar al ecosistema de Cardano, sino que podr\u00edan beneficiar a la sociedad en general.  Por supuesto, este maravilloso resultado tambi\u00e9n ayudar\u00eda a impulsar el conocimiento y la adopci\u00f3n de Cardano.  La propuesta consiste en mejorar la interfaz de usuario y la interfaz de usuario sobre la base de los aprendizajes obtenidos de los experimentos ya realizados con la versi\u00f3n anterior.  Esto incluye la creaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones m\u00f3viles, lo que mejorar\u00eda significativamente la aceptaci\u00f3n.  Me pregunto si los proponentes est\u00e1n familiarizados con loomio.org, que tiene una historia y una \u00e9tica bastante similares, y una coincidencia significativa pero no total en t\u00e9rminos de enfoque.  Me interesar\u00eda mucho conocer la opini\u00f3n de los proponentes sobre la comparaci\u00f3n entre ambos.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "La propuesta es para mejorar un proyecto bien establecido con una versi\u00f3n ya existente, y viene de los proponentes con un fuerte historial que demuestra la capacidad de los proponentes para trabajar juntos y conseguir cosas.  No hay ninguna indicaci\u00f3n clara en la propuesta de que alguien en el equipo tenga experiencia con los contratos inteligentes de Cardano, Plutus, etc.  Podr\u00edamos considerar que esto no es un requisito en el futuro inmediato, ya que este trabajo est\u00e1 programado en la hoja de ruta para septiembre de 2022.  Dicho esto, creo que un plan para la eventual integraci\u00f3n con los contratos inteligentes de Cardano puede afectar a las decisiones de UI/UX, por lo que sugerir\u00eda que esto se considere al menos desde el principio, trayendo a alguien con la experiencia necesaria en caso de que el equipo no la tenga.  La falta de discusi\u00f3n expl\u00edcita de este tema es la (\u00fanica) raz\u00f3n para no dar la m\u00e1xima calificaci\u00f3n a la viabilidad.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "La propuesta incluye una hoja de ruta para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o, un desglose de los costes y algunas m\u00e9tricas clave.  La hoja de ruta es s\u00f3lo de alto nivel, con unas pocas palabras por trimestre.  La vi\u00f1eta correspondiente al primer trimestre de 2022 aparece en negrita y resaltada, pero no est\u00e1 claro lo que indica.  Yo podr\u00eda interpretarlo como que esta vi\u00f1eta es todo el alcance de la financiaci\u00f3n propuesta, lo que parece m\u00e1s o menos coherente con los desgloses de costes (excepto que \u00e9stos incluyen las aplicaciones m\u00f3viles mientras que la vi\u00f1eta menciona s\u00f3lo la \"aplicaci\u00f3n web\").  Con esta interpretaci\u00f3n, parece que las fases posteriores, incluyendo la Gamificaci\u00f3n, la Delegaci\u00f3n y la Integraci\u00f3n de Contratos Inteligentes estar\u00edan fuera del alcance de esta propuesta, y presumiblemente estar\u00edan cubiertas por futuras propuestas.  Esto tambi\u00e9n mitigar\u00eda mi preocupaci\u00f3n anterior de que no hay ninguna indicaci\u00f3n de experiencia o conocimientos en torno a los contratos inteligentes de Cardano.  Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n plantear\u00eda la cuesti\u00f3n de si Catalyst deber\u00eda estar financiando el trabajo en un proyecto que no tiene una conexi\u00f3n espec\u00edfica con Cardano, aunque esto est\u00e9 previsto en el futuro.  Las m\u00e9tricas clave me parecen razonables en general, pero menos claramente \u00fatiles para la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas de esta propuesta en particular.  Una de las razones es que los plazos asociados a cada m\u00e9trica clave son imprecisos (por ejemplo, \"despu\u00e9s del lanzamiento del MVP\", que no se menciona espec\u00edficamente en la hoja de ruta ni en ning\u00fan otro lugar, lo que hace dif\u00edcil evaluar cu\u00e1ndo podr\u00eda ser eso.  Otras m\u00e9tricas est\u00e1n igualmente asociadas a plazos imprecisos en relaci\u00f3n con los futuros Fondos Catalizadores (\u00bfen qu\u00e9 fase/fecha?).  Dicho esto, son razonablemente espec\u00edficos y medibles, y razonablemente interpretables a plazos razonables.  Me interesar\u00eda saber m\u00e1s acerca de c\u00f3mo se eligieron las m\u00e9tricas (exposici\u00f3n y embarque).  Resulta especialmente curioso que el proponente aspire a sumar s\u00f3lo el 2% de los votantes incorporados durante el Fondo 10.  Yo habr\u00eda pensado que esperar\u00edan \"ganar impulso\", con un aumento mayor.  A pesar de todas estas preocupaciones acerca de c\u00f3mo la propuesta se posiciona para la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas, estoy dando una calificaci\u00f3n de \"De acuerdo\" sobre la base de los proponentes son bien conocidos en el ecosistema, y el hecho de que hay artefactos concretos que pueden ser reportados y monitoreados, a pesar de que la propuesta no detalla esto expl\u00edcitamente.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal addresses the problem of decentralized decision making being hard on current platforms.

With my own experience in trying to organize debates and processes to reach consensus, I can say the proposal clearly identifies a very real governance hurdle which is a viable problem for this challenge to be solved.
