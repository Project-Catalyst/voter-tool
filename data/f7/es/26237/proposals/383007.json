This challenge is asking for solution that will help to make Cardano the go-to-blockchain for DAOs. Comparing the challenge setting with the goals of the proposals I don't see a full alignment between challenge and proposal. It seems that this team wants to build a community around their project and therefore can attract new people to our ecosystem. Even tough this idea is interesting and has my support I don't see enough explanation on why this should be funded under this challenge and how it will positively impact the growth of Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan for implementation is only roughly described. Also the scope of the project doesn't get clear as details about technical implementation or basic underlying mechanism are missing. \r\nAlso there is not real proof of life of the proposer team nor references about relevant experience. Yes, they want to partner with someone to deliver the solution. However, by the given information it is not comprehensible how this will be done.

There's a lot to love about this idea, and I commend the proposer not only for eschewing the easy/selfish option of selling to the highest bidder without regard for the wellbeing of the residents, but also for actively seeking to establish more equitable solutions.  As someone who's concerned about growing inequality worldwide, I truly appreciate this proposal.  The results of a successful attempt at this project could potentially be replicated, thus multiplying the benefit enormously.  Lessons learned from even an unsuccessful attempt may be valuable too.  Because I really like this idea, I am giving it a higher \"impact\" score than I think it technically merited, because the challenge is about \"tools for managing DAOs\", not use cases, and this proposal is explicitly not about building tools.  The writing style has some interesting turns of phrase that make the reader think hard about what the author is saying.  While this is enjoyable, it may be preferable in a proposal to be more explicit and direct.  (But please keep writing after your successful fair exit!  A series of \"retrospective\" and \"update\" blog posts about the process, what went right, what could be improved from various vantage points would be compelling reading, for example.)  I would love to see something come of this project, so I encourage the proposer to stay engaged with the community, seek collaboration with other proposers, and to think about longer term pursuit of these ideas.  For example, if the proposer's fair exit goes ahead with some manual or centralized approximation of the ideas represented here, it would provide invaluable experience towards building out the envisaged solution over time.  It might be a great retirement project!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer makes clear both his years of experience as a park owner, and his passion for the issues and commitment to equitable treatment of all stakeholders.  However, there is little mention of his technical capabilities.  Under Relevant Experience, we can see that he is an Electrical Engineer, and from reading the proposal, we can see that he has at least some technical background and understanding.  I would like to see this \"talked up\" a bit more, because I bet the proposer would actually have more to contribute to a team effort to solve this problem than just \"articulating real world trailer park use cases\".  Given the nascent state of tools for managing DAOs on Cardano (exactly the reason for the Challenge), and the explicit dependence on both tools and development and expertise resources, I'm afraid I find it difficult to be optimistic that the project is feasible in the stated timeframe, which appears to be rooted in real world constraints that will not wait for slower-than-hoped execution.  My advice to the proposer is to check out other proposals in this Challenge, many of which aim to build tools for managing DAOs, and to seek collaboration with one or more of the successful proposals, who may welcome collaboration with a compelling use case, which could result in a win-win-win-win (not sure how many stakeholders to represent there :-)).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal includes some tangible milestones that could be demonstrated if successful, but little detail that would enable monitoring progress towards them or distinguishing between valiant-but-unsuccessful attempt and cynical pocketing the funds and doing nothing (I am not suggesting that I think the proposer would do that, but accountability is accountability).  There is also no Budget or breakdown of how the funds would be spent, beyond \"contingency for unique requirements of this project not otherwise addressed by other initiatives\" and \"some upfront payment\" to potential collaborators.  Therefore it is difficult to see how the proposal will enable audit and monitoring progress.  I would suggest offering more explicit means in future proposals, such as regular status updates including outcomes of key \"decision points\", etc.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This idea focuses on trailer owners and park owners and offers an auction option to execute smart contracts.
