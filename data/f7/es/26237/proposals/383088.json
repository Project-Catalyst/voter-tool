DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. The proposal adresses a very real problem, the disenfranchisement and cultural appropriation that is happening to indigenous communities. The solution they provide links together Blockchain, intellectual Property, NFTs and DAOS and  will not only be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem, but also will help people getting a fair share of their IP in a way that is much more transparent than what is currently the state of business. It will connect people and give them a huge perspective, such it can be said to have a big impact. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

The challenge brief outlines success as creating solutions to better manage a DAO on Cardano.

The detailed plan presented is actually a problem statement and solution reworked, the actual plan was not presented. The proposal identified one risk and proposed a mitigation in one sentence, it would be great if the team could expand on the risks assessment and mitigation section. The team (WADA) has more than 10 proposals entered for fund 7, if all are successful I am worried that the team will be over loaded and not be able to successfully execute.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The team provided a high level budget and simple roadmap. The team identified Key metrics but did not assign measurables to it, I advice the team to add measurables (set goals) to the key metrics example: write 5 research reports, have 2000 attendees etc. I would like to see the team expand the budget (beyond simple line entries) and roadmap (create more milestones), furthermore, I would like to see the team connect the budget, roadmap and KPIs, in this way the team can track spending over time vs. performance. As the project stands at the moment, I believe it will be challenging to audit.
