The plan for implementation is vague. The budget itself is not really broken down. At least it is somehow linked to the activities.

However, the proposer clearly states that this proposal is kind of experimental, so I could live with that.

I see the value of this idea in building a community that invites more people to join the cardano ecosystem with the same idea. However, the proposal is not suitable for this challenge in terms of measurement indicators. You can carefully read the content of the challenge to implement as well as suggest the right idea for the challenge", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As I stated on impact, this proposal is not yet up to the challenge.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The gathering of documentation, resources and knowledge surrounding decentralised governance is a significant body of work that would be ongoing in nature, it's likey this like many other services to Cardano would need consistent upkeep and having someone to kickstart that who has a strong academic backgrond is quite useful in the long run. However, a larger team or greater ground support might lead to stronger outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe project management in the proposal is light, there's little to no information on the timeline or key points of workflow, so the budget sitting at a whole figure is hard to understand also. Is that all wages? Is there resources being created? Is this a resource finding mission? \r\n\r\n\r\nTo their credit the proposer does address the limit in the scope and does indicate that DGA would need time to develop gradually. It really is up to the community to decide if this is the best approach for a project of this nature or, if there is another way to build a repository such as this?

It doesn't apprear to have any visible checkpoints for the community to audit the progress, however one would imagine the activities of the proposer being that they would engage with the community - would lend some indication as to the progress of their research. \r\n\r\nThere are KPI's and a roadmap, again the proposer has indicated this is low on detail for good reason. However... the question remains is this how the community wants essentially their collective work in decentralised governance recorded or is there a way that has greater accountability in measurable milestones, KPI's and a more defined roadmap. Is it possible to have more clarity at this point in a research project of this nature?", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_699", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The solution statement is sensible in light of the problem statement and both are clearly written. Given that the challenge seeks to accelerate the development of tools and infrastructure for Cardano-based dApps, the proposed Decentralized Governance (dGov) research and collaboration forum makes sense. If this project is able to create a sizable and engaged community, it could promote the build-out of DAO infrastructure on Cardano. \r\nTherefore, such a forum potentially has real utility despite the modest budget proposed ($9,600) and has the potential to scale if it attracts participants outside the Cardano community. Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team's membership and credentials are unclear. Although the proposer is very active on IdeaScale, no links to a LinkedIn profile page or personal website were provided to verify the proposer's relevant experience with dGov. Moreover, it is not clear how the requested funds are to be spent (i.e., a detailed budget was not provided). Few details are given regarding how the team plans to recruit participants to the forum. The team possesses a clear vision of what they want the forum to be and the kinds of research questions they want to address, but the detailed plan does not layout a strategy on how to make this a reality.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The short-term goals (\"3-month goals\") are clear: 1) outreach, 2) formation of social channels and continued networking, and 3) develop a long-term roadmap and Fund8 proposal.
