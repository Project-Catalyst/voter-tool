La descentralizaci\u00f3n es un pilar central y muy importante para cualquier blockchain p\u00fablica. A pesar de que Cardano tiene una excelente distribuci\u00f3n de productores de bloques en comparaci\u00f3n con otras blockchains PoS, es importante se\u00f1alar que en el espacio de las criptomonedas hay muchos casos en los que la competencia se nivela hacia abajo, espec\u00edficamente en este caso es el problema de las blockchains PoS que tienen pocos validadores (menos de 30) y en muchos casos diferentes validadores son controlados por la misma entidad. La descentralizaci\u00f3n es lo que garantiza la seguridad y la resistencia a la censura en una blockchain p\u00fablica, ya que hace que los costes de los ataques (como el ataque del 51%) sean mayores, desanimando a los creadores de bloques a confabularse para atacar la blockchain. La propuesta describe de forma clara y objetiva los puntos de dolor que centralizan la producci\u00f3n de bloques en Cardano, que son los grandes intercambios y los propietarios de multipools.\r\n\r\nLa soluci\u00f3n propuesta pretende facilitar la UI/UX de aquellos que delegan, a trav\u00e9s de un mercado. Como moderador en la comunidad de Cardano recibo casi a diario quejas de usuarios que tienen dificultades para buscar informaci\u00f3n sobre c\u00f3mo y d\u00f3nde elegir un pool. Hoy en d\u00eda este tipo de informaci\u00f3n es curada manualmente en la gran mayor\u00eda de los casos y tener una plataforma que pueda ofrecer curaci\u00f3n tiene buenas posibilidades de nivelar el campo de juego entre los SPOs.\r\n\r\nLas m\u00e9tricas/indicadores/KPIs indican un gran impacto potencial en el ecosistema de los SPO.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "En primer lugar, Stakeboard es ya un proyecto en pleno desarrollo y con varios entregables completados antes de recibir la financiaci\u00f3n de Catalyst, lo que indica un equipo fiable y productivo.\r\n\r\nLa informaci\u00f3n sobre el equipo descrita en la propuesta es detallada, las experiencias descritas y el trabajo ya realizado indican que el equipo es plenamente capaz de desarrollar este trabajo.\r\n\r\nEl desglose del presupuesto describe 3 partidas, sin embargo hay pocos detalles sobre c\u00f3mo se gastar\u00e1 el dinero. La definici\u00f3n de 5.000 d\u00f3lares para \"UX\" me parece vaga, lo que compromete la evaluaci\u00f3n de la viabilidad del presupuesto solicitado.
