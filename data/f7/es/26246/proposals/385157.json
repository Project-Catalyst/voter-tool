Under 'describe your solution', it says development of sustainable technologies. I assume that the proposal is to design a power supply that is based on renewable technologies. Can you describe which technologies that you have in mind, and how you plan to bridge the periods when not enough solar PV electricity is produced? (e.g. electrical grid, battery) \r\n2. Change the discussion under Detailed plan from Bitcoin POW to Cardano POS (Proof Of Stake). Cardano is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the POW of Bitcoin. It would be better to frame the discussion about the Cardano stakepool technology.\r\n3. The education community program has very broad scope (e.g. food security/soverign) and the link is not clear to the stakepool operation with renewable energy. Can you explain this further? My proposal would be to focus on designing a renewable power supply for your stakepool as a first step. The other apsects could possible be addressed in later funding rounds.\r\n4.
