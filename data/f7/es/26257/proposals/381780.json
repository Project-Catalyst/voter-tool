This way the proposers can bring long-term and sustainable impact to those in need, and support the Cadano ecosystem at the same time.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of the social problems to be addressed.\r\nMy rating is 2.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given that the proposal requests for funds and ideas, the Catalyst should be capable to provide both.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, without a more detailed presentation of targeted social problems and examples of previous succesful projects, it is hard to say how much relatie impact can be made from the funds requested.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would be much stronger, if it provided specific historical examples how blockchain ecosystem and specifically Cardano-based solutions can bring impact to those in need.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics presented (the number of projects, the number of votes, the rating of proposals) evaluate only the activites within the challenge, but not the progressed towards the implied objective of helping the underdeveloped world and differently abled individuals.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would be stronger if it:\r\n1) clearly defined a list of targeted social problems.\r\n2) for each use cases measured the % of the world's population whose needs are addressed through the projects within this initiaitve.\r\n3) the satisfaction of those targeted by the challenge with the outcomes in comparison with alternative solutions available for their problem.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on problems set.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 4, "ng": 15, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This challenge doesn't directly indicate how it aligns with Cardano's mission rather it focuses on donations to its target groups however there is an argument to be made that any Challenge that has proposals directed at a defined demographic is contributing to the ecosystem and thus sort of aligns with the mission.

Or is it about building tools that enable individuals to make donations? I have to say that I think the Catalyst community would be much more interested (and, in fact, better equipped) to take on the latter. But I could also see this challenge, if passed, generating a large volume of confused proposals under both interpretations.

Since the team has been active in Catalyst since Fund 4, I think it's fair to suggest that their expectations could be more fleshed out and I would very much encourage them to focus more on detail if they can.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_853", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Donar es un acto incre\u00edble y refleja los valores de CARDANO y debemos pensar en las personas que requieren un trato especial", "success": "donaciones de la comunidad en forma de proyectos pr\u00e1cticos para el mundo subdesarrollado y proyectos para \"personas con capacidades diferentes\""}
