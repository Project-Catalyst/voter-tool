At the same time, the challenge does not directly support the strategic objectives of Fund 8: grow the number of contributors, make Cardano an open-source project, grow the app and dev ecosystem. Even though some of  the solutions for this initiative could be apps, given the requested budget it will be a small number of them. Also, it could be better to rethink the proposal in terms of specific apps and propose those within broader DApps & Integrations challenge.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the proposal would be stronger if it:\r\n1) provided a deeper discussion of mental health use cases that have high potential when solved with blockchain.\r\n2) provided examples of recent success stories of software solutions for mental health to help estimate the impact and the necesary resources.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a detailed discusion about high-value use cases.\r\n\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Catalyst community is well positioned to develope software-based solutions for major use cases, such as health.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, because the proposal does not provide a detailed discussion of high-potential use cases and example recent success stories in the space, it is hard to judge which skills, resources can be neccessary and which roadblocks to deployment can exist.\r\n\r\nAlso, mental health space is part of healthcare, an industry that can be strictly regulated in some regions, so the proposal would be stronger if it discussed the relevant regulations and if they can be blockers to adoption.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of discussion of potential regulatory roadblocks.\r\nMy rating is 2\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal does not present any non-ambiguous and computable metrics.
