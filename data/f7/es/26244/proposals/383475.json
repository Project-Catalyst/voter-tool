La justificaci\u00f3n de los autores sobre la necesidad de un proyecto de este tipo es que hay much\u00edsimas propuestas, la gente generalmente no tiene tiempo para seguir todo y tener estos res\u00famenes de contenido impulsar\u00eda la participaci\u00f3n en Catalyst, ya que la gente tendr\u00eda una forma m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctica de conocerlas. al menos una parte, de lo que se hace aqu\u00ed. Estoy de acuerdo con este pensamiento y creo que puede ser muy beneficioso, y puede corresponder a algunos de los objetivos del reto, como traer nuevos participantes a la comunidad Cardano, nuevos desarrolladores, etc, formando nuevos hubs, pero no creo que contemple el objetivo de democratizar el acceso para los no angloparlantes. Creo que democratizar\u00edan el acceso a Cardano para un p\u00fablico m\u00e1s general de habla inglesa, desde los principiantes en blockchain hasta los m\u00e1s experimentados, ya que estos contenidos ser\u00edan accesibles. Por lo tanto, creo que el impacto parcial de lo que se pidi\u00f3 en el desaf\u00edo. Ser\u00eda muy incre\u00edble que esta misma idea se llevara a otros idiomas, es decir, crear contenidos audiovisuales cortos que resuman/expliquen algunas propuestas de los fondos de financiaci\u00f3n, en portugu\u00e9s, espa\u00f1ol, italiano, japon\u00e9s, vietnamita...

Creo que la presentaci\u00f3n de los miembros fue perfecta, para m\u00ed es la mejor manera de explicar qui\u00e9nes son. El gui\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n fue elaborado de forma ejemplar, sabemos cu\u00e1les son las tareas a realizar para dar lugar a un todo (con mucho detalle, incluyen varios datos num\u00e9ricos que facilitan la comprensi\u00f3n de los pasos) y tambi\u00e9n cu\u00e1les son los objetivos, de nuevo utilizan n\u00fameros para especificar sin margen de error lo que pretenden conseguir.

As\u00ed que creo que ahora el trabajo ser\u00eda por parte de la comunidad para hacer esta auditabilidad.

The proposal presents a very real problem that a lot of people are interested in Cardano but do not have the time to learn, making it difficult to grasp the increasing number of proposals, affecting the development of Cardano. Cardano community\r\nThe solution was to produce short-term videos and podcasts in English containing analyzed information for the proposed 25% in each Catalyst Fund. A clear and understandable solution was provided as per the proposal to clearly describe the problem targeted.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We can easily check the group information based on the links the recommendation has provided. The proposed team consists of 3 members with experience in the Blockchain field and also accompanies Catalyst projects from Fund 4. At the same time, Duc Tiger is also the founder of Tiger View team, one of the core groups of the company. . Vietnam in the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, the team has also been funded in Fund 6, so I have full confidence that they can complete this proposal.\r\nWithout a doubt, the team of proponents has the right skill set, is highly motivated and is strongly committed to the Cardano ecosystem. With the experience of the CA and VCA teams, they easily realize the difficulty when voters have to absorb too many petitions while not having much time to evaluate them all. Take this suggestion as a matter of course. It saves voters a lot of time filtering out unworkable proposals. I believe that with the experience and planning presented here, it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented\r\nInterestingly, the proposal's authors explain the idea by presenting the obstacles they will face next.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the properties of this proposal, no timeline is broken down. As stated, the proposed team will start work from the start of the Fund 8 and Fund 9 proposal. It takes about 2 months for them to complete 250 videos in Fund 8 and 2 months to complete 250 videos in Fund 9. .\r\nThe proposal is feasible because it has very specific goals, has key indicators, KPIs and timelines, and is easy to track and evaluate. The given budget of $12,000 is reasonable enough and it makes me completely agree that the team is competent enough to tackle the challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I think this proposal makes a lot of sense, but not in this exact shape. Even as a CA, I find it impossible to stay up-to-date with most of the proposals in Project Catalyst. Having 2 minute videos, if properly done, would be of great benefit to the Cardano voters and community. Yet, at this iteration, I feel like the proposal could be very detrimental to the Catalyst experiment, due to the fact that it will make a selection of 250 proposals to be reviewed. That in itself is an influence on the voters and could become problematic for the entire eco-system. The only way to solve this would be to have either all proposals reviewed, or none. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team\u2019s experience confirms their aptitude towards delivering such a great task, the video for their proposal has also demonstrated the quality that we are to expect from each video. Yet what I didn\u2019t find in their plan, is how will all those videos and articles be reviewed before publishing? Will there be a core team who will be reviewing them, will they review each other, and if so, how will they be able to verify and incentivise the quality of the videos?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is well divided and contains all the needed information for its proper evaluation.

I think it is a good proposal, for many people the information written in Catalyst proposals is difficult to digest. Especially when voting, when a large amount of proposals should be evaluated. Having summaries in video form would be helpful. \n\nI believe this should be done with all proposals though, and not only 25% of them, as this will introduce a selection bias from the video creators. Therefore, I would prefer if they requested a larger budget so they could do this with 100% of Catalyst proposals before the voting period starts. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The video example provided shows that they can create a simple and easy to understand video explaining a proposal in 2 minutes. \n\nThe budget requested per video created seems low to me, which could affect the quality of the videos. For example, 2 dollars for editing per video, I don't know how feasible that is in the long term without affecting the quality.\n\nIt is good that the proposers are experienced in Catalyst, and reviewing proposals. The proposers seem committed and capable of following through on their promise to the community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have stated quite clearly what they will do with the funds, and how many video reviews they will create per funding round. This part of the project should be easy to assess for the community.\n\nThey have included some KPIs for watch time per video, I wish they also included some KPIs for how many viewers they hope to attract. And also elaborated further how they will make the videos accessible to more people, and let people know about them. There is little point in creating these videos if they have very few viewers.\n\nI believe it will also be difficult for the community to assess the quality of the videos, and whether they actually solve the problem of explaining proposals in a way that is easier to understand than the original proposal text.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_73", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 18, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposition could increase knowledge about our ecosystem alongside the perspective of wider adoption and participation, as it would make the process more inclusive. For example, people suffering from blindness would be able to be part of the community and be more involved in the decision-making process. The only flaw is that you can't do it for the majority of the good quality proposals, only a few, because there are just too many of them. This is why I can't give the perfect score !", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is known among the Catalyst community, they've already been funded once, during fund 6, one of them is running a stake pool [TIGER Pool] and being a community advisor for Catalyst. All of their social media channels and a Linkdn profile are set for more transparency, inspiring me confidence in the team.\n\nThe team have already made available a youtube video, as an example of their work, down the comment section: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yagm40Wny8). The video is easy to understand and well made, but the robotic voice could be annoying for many people, including me. I kindly suggest recording them with real voices.\n\nThe budget is well detailed inside the google doc, alongside the plan. Everything looks reasonable.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is ok, pretty well explained, and spread over the duration of fund 8 and 9.
