La solicitud actual $56400 fondo es en la parte superior de la inversi\u00f3n del grupo fundador de David Baxter https://www.linkedin.com/in/baxweb/. Aunque la mayor parte del riesgo se ha identificado, ya que es un negocio condicional superior, creo que su equipo debe poner de relieve los riesgos que pueden venir de los gobiernos locales en su caso en los EE.UU. y el riesgo para los estudiantes locales y en l\u00ednea. Por ejemplo, si la relaci\u00f3n entre sus instructores y los alumnos se estrecha en t\u00e9rminos de confianza, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se prevendr\u00eda el acceso de un instructor malintencionado o el acceso a la informaci\u00f3n de la cartera del alumno (parte de sus cursos introductorios enumerados) y cu\u00e1les son las garant\u00edas para los alumnos si tales eventos ocurren?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Dado que el equipo tiene experiencia en la educaci\u00f3n y la formaci\u00f3n de los destinatarios.

I also consider that we could have links not only to the website and social networks but also to the professional profiles of the team members.I cannot make a precise assessment of the budget's suitability because of the local context, which I believe greatly influences it. Furthermore, I believe it is positive that the details of the budget include all the elements which my experience as a project manager with an engineering background (mostly consulting) allows me to consider.
