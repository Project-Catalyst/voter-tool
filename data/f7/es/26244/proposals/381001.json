Aunque estos argumentos son v\u00e1lidos, pueden no ser aplicables en todas las situaciones. El equipo tiene previsto abordar esta cuesti\u00f3n creando una versi\u00f3n innovadora de \"hub\" con la caracter\u00edstica principal de la movilidad, en la que el foco estar\u00e1 en los procesos de incorporaci\u00f3n para las personas que son completamente nuevas en esta tecnolog\u00eda. Asimismo, considero que tanto el problema como la soluci\u00f3n son pertinentes, as\u00ed como las m\u00e9tricas de \u00e9xito que se proponen son adecuadas y est\u00e1n en consonancia con lo que busca este reto.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "La AMA ha aportado valor a la comunidad de forma constante y exitosa a lo largo de su historia. Josh es el l\u00edder de la organizaci\u00f3n. Se proporcionan referencias a su perfil de LinkedIn, pero no se ofrecen detalles sobre el equipo asignado a esta propuesta. Tambi\u00e9n hay una descripci\u00f3n detallada del plan de implementaci\u00f3n, que permite entender las acciones requeridas. A continuaci\u00f3n, el equipo desglosa el presupuesto en 5 componentes identificables. Sin embargo, debo admitir que, desde mi punto de vista, se podr\u00eda haber hecho un mayor esfuerzo. Por ejemplo, en lo que respecta a la partida \"coste del equipo\", la comunidad deber\u00e1 conocer el n\u00famero de personas asignadas al proyecto, la descripci\u00f3n de sus funciones y la tarifa horaria asignada a cada una. Un \u00e1rea en la que debo felicitar al equipo es la secci\u00f3n sobre la gesti\u00f3n de riesgos, que no s\u00f3lo identifica posibles obst\u00e1culos para el \u00e9xito, sino que tambi\u00e9n sugiere contramedidas que pueden adoptarse para mitigar el riesgo identificado.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Por \u00faltimo, el equipo ha proporcionado excelentes descripciones de las secciones que son relevantes para evaluar la auditabilidad de la propuesta.

En mi opini\u00f3n, esta secci\u00f3n es adecuada y coherente con lo que busca el equipo. En la siguiente secci\u00f3n, se eval\u00faan las m\u00e9tricas de \u00e9xito, y de nuevo se hace un gran trabajo, ya que las m\u00e9tricas est\u00e1n vinculadas a hitos en el tiempo. El \u00fanico aspecto que echo en falta es el establecimiento de objetivos para cada \"m\u00e9trica clave\".

This knowledge gives me the skills to assess proposals in this challenge. The proposal identifies an important problem within the challenge which by adressing it, will provide a perspective to people in regions with weak infrastructure and give them Accessibility to the Cardano network and other services, aiding in onboarding an entire new group of people and giving them novel perspectives.

Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan.

This seems like an effective solution to the problem stated which is the high cost of brick-and-mortar hubs and subsequent risk of abandonment i.e. inefficient use of human and material of resources. This fits perfectly within this challenge and, if implemented properly is highly scalable as multiple mobile hubs can be deployed across the world on demand and would significantly drive the adoption of users on the ground level. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The lead for this project is identified and demonstrates experience to manage the implementation of this project. We know that other members of WADA will assist on this project, but ideally more team members could have been specified, especially members of the design team and engineers, as their role seems critical to implementing this proposal. It is not clear what format these mobile hubs will take, is the intention to make use of existing local venues, or to deploy and actual full mobile vehicle unit or tent, or both ? This is important to know, at least for the first prototype you are designing, as the associated costs vary greatly depending on the options. It is also not clear were the first prototype will be deployed, somewhere in Southern Europe ? The proposal describes a detailed roadmap, with quite ambitious timelines (lunch of the first CMH within 60 days), but this seems feasible given the WADA team support.

I provide strong agreement for its impact and alignment and for thinking out of the box. Communities, especially in Africa may find it more difficult to gather at a stationary meeting point; distances may be too far to travel and may be costly, or worse yet, transport is non-existent. What an ingenious way to solve the problem but to bring Cardano to the people instead. That this was presented by the WADA Alliance to me raises their pursuit for innovation even  higher whether this proposal gets funded or not. Commonly and in a pandemic-ridden world, cynics would say, well why not do it online instead? But therein lies the conundrum which brings Cardano to the African continent and is the reason why World Mobile is gaining traction. The proposal's presentation seems polished and aside from the specific requirements in terms of mobility and engineering, which is part of the initial steps anyway, it clearly explains the goals, the rationale behind the solution and the way forward, past the funding requested in Fund 8. Polished. Congratulations. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned, the WADA Alliance have successfully established four community hubs already and this is essentially the basis for my strong agreement with regards to this proposals feasibility. There will have certainly been lessons learnt over those processes which gives the confidence that giving a hub legs, pivots the difficulty to its mobility, as opposed to the establishment of the hub itself. Since this is a WADA Alliance undertaking it comes with the growing resources in terms of personnel, knowledge and experience that their leader Josh can rely upon. And as serial Catalyst proposers, funding winners and deliverers of projects they have a proven track record for the feasibility of their projects. The plan presented seems to be well-thought of starting with a pilot CMH with engineers and designers to come up with the hub-on-wheels rubric. Their near-term roadmap contains goals which are very doable (although with the current logistical issues we're having globally for equipment this timeline may need to be extended) but what impresses are their plans after this pilot where the idea, once proven, is expanded to a level that is self-funding with no reliance on Catalyst in the future. What essentially is being proposed here is not simply a truck with antennas for internet connection where people can gather around but a way to traverse that last mile where Cardano ends (with World Mobile's help) and people live. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The strongest point for this proposals auditability is WADA Alliance's eagerness to update their websites about any projects they are undertaking whether within or without Catalyst. I am sure we will see the progress of this mobile hub on their socials. In terms of this proposal's six-month timeline, there is also a mention of a new website specific to the CMH and the development of tracking capabilities, which I presume will pinpoint locations where the hub is parked. Their target audience at the beginning consists of universities, government locations, other hubs and conferences. Overall, a good proposal. I wish you success and possibly growth of similar mobile hubs in other countries and continents proposed by other Catalyst participants.
