The team proposes to address this problem by creating a community space designed to promote the sharing of experiences, learning, networking, and referrals for work, among others. With this simple explanation of the solution, the community can assess its alignment with the challenge. However, the team provides the necessary details, such as the target audience, success metrics aligned with the challenge and how they expect to achieve financial sustainability. I therefore rate them a 5. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A brief description of the skills and experience of the leader of the proposal is provided, with previous experience developing events in Cardano, as well as reference to his LinkedIn profile. As well as reference to the Endubis website, where they describe the projects in Ethiopia that they are gathering so far. In addition, I visited the website where they will physically gather, as well as the Facebook page. There, I saw different types of events for more than a year, which from my perspective adds credibility. One thing I have noticed is that the leader and other members of the team have several proposals in this catalyst cycle. Each of these proposals has its own purposes, and I consider it totally valid, however, it should be described which role each person will have and if part of the budget will be destined to hire external personnel that are not part of the team members. That way it makes sense to me as I find a balance in the burdens. I would also have appreciated it if more effort had been put into the budget description, even though it was broken down into identifiable items, I found gaps that make it difficult to assess with precision. For example, it would be great to have a description of the hourly cost of professionals in sections such as \"Marketing\", \"Staff Salary\", \"Motivational Speakers and Trainers\"; it is also unclear to me what they mean by \"business meetups\" since according to their proposal they are not part of their target audience. Finally, I congratulate the team for an excellent description of the phases through which they believe this project must pass in order to be economically sustainable.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the auditability section of the proposal, the team makes commendable efforts. It describes a roadmap in 3 phases with the last one in April 2022 when they expect to be consolidated as a co-working space; it also describes the success metrics that the team expects to have. As far as I am concerned, they are appropriate and totally aligned with the challenge. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 10, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Building a local community hub in Ethiopia is a good idea.

The cardano hub can attract young students, developers, entrepreneurs etcc. that will come into the cardano ecosystem to build. Furthermore, the key metrics outlined by the proposer align perfectly with the spirit of the challenge.
