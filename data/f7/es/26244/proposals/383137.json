However, the legal jargon requirement always pertains and selecting the town in the USA as mentioned in the proposal would make big news. This would be a significant impact on the project direction.

Their whitepaper indicates the need to fund the development of their own 'ubuntu blockchain' for the issuance of the tokens needed to facilitate their idealized economy.  They propose to base their token, the Mite (or alternatively, the LOL (their name, not mine)) on the Cardano blockchain, until such time as they can migrate it to their own blockchain, which leads me to doubt they have any scalable long term interest in the Cardano ecosystem.  Add to this their reasoning for moving to their own blockchain:   \"to be as decentralized and independent as possible\", and one has to wonder if they understand the nature of Cardano at all, or decentralization, for that matter.  The onboarding of 200,000 plus smart DIDs in the first 12 months would indeed be a tremendous impact on Cardano, and it would be hoped that with reflection and research they might decide that the effort to bootstrap such an initiative would be better served to remain on chain, but otherwise I am not seeing the value to the Catalyst community to be a short term rental.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal doesn't seem to include any actual development side knowledge, and outside of a detailed tokenomics theory (independent of Cardano) in their whitepaper, does not appear to bringing the necessary knowledge of either the technology or of the unique nature of Cardano to the proposal.  The timeline and budget are very vague with only a 3 month or so resolution from event to event, and there is not enough details in the budget to determine if their allocations for development of these smartcards would be sufficient.  There are no included KPIs outside of a general statement to onboard 200,000members in 12mos and 1 million members in 24mos (though the proposal suggests a 'deliverable in the smartcard and possibly the smartcontracts) and the scope of the proposal leaves too many options to possibly infer any sort of development milestones.  For a project of this scope, perhaps a better first proposal for the team as it is currently composed would be a request for the funds to research the use of Cardano (Atala Prism, perhaps, or another of the Fund7 DID proposals) as the blockchain of choice, what specific development milestones would need to be achieved to roll out the DIDs, DAOs and tokens implied by the adoption of blockchain, and how these deliverables could be scaled.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The lack of a detailed roadmap, or the inclusion of specific, actionable milestones leaves doubt that this project could move much beyond the 'project started' status.  There are no proposed feedback mechanisms for the initial development part of the phase.  It may be a good idea to create some cross-community connections between Catalyst and OneSmallTown (OST, the proposal team), maybe by hosting a breakout room after a Townhall, and getting a network of supporters (and potential assessors and auditors) throughout Catalyst.  In the absence of more transparency, there is some doubt that the community would be able to feel adequately that this project would remain accountable to them.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 8, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "El contribucionismo, con su plan de implementaci\u00f3n One Small Town, necesita el ecosistema de Cardano para prosperar.
