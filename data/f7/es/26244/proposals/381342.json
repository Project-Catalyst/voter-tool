Los objetivos y el producto final de este proyecto tienen una profunda base humanitaria, con el objetivo de crear igualdad de oportunidades para las personas de todo el mundo que no tienen los mismos privilegios que muchos otros. Un concepto que est\u00e1 (seg\u00fan mi experiencia en la Comunidad Cardano) muy alineado con los valores centrales de Cardano. El planteamiento del problema se centra claramente en un conjunto de 400 personas marginadas y pretende darles educaci\u00f3n, proporcion\u00e1ndoles potencialmente un futuro mejor. Lo que esto implica es un poco confuso en la descripci\u00f3n de la propuesta, aunque algunas partes son muy tangibles. Por ejemplo, proporcionar Internet, material educativo, profesores y la creaci\u00f3n de un centro digital est\u00e1 muy claro. Pero el plan de estudios y lo que incluye esta educaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda especificarse m\u00e1s. Como profesor, me hubiera gustado ver un ejemplo de plan de estudios incluido en la descripci\u00f3n. Por el momento, no estoy seguro de si los objetivos de la educaci\u00f3n son ense\u00f1ar a los participantes a aprender programaci\u00f3n funcional o a escribir una serie de dibujos animados.

Lamentablemente, no hay pruebas que puedan verificar las afirmaciones de la propuesta. Al menos en lo que respecta a los miembros del equipo principal, estar\u00eda bien ver algunos enlaces proporcionados (perfiles de LinkedIn, proyectos afiliados anteriores, etc.) que pudieran verificar la competencia del equipo. En los archivos adjuntos se incluye una magn\u00edfica tabla de la asignaci\u00f3n presupuestaria, que es una de las mejores que he visto hasta ahora en los dos \u00faltimos fondos como consejero comunitario. Es razonable y detallado. Explicar los detalles del plan de estudios y la educaci\u00f3n real tambi\u00e9n aportar\u00eda la claridad necesaria (para que entendamos mejor el proyecto) en la propuesta (como se menciona en el apartado \"impacto\").

Hay varios KPI presentados de forma estructurada y cronol\u00f3gica, pero aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n ser\u00eda beneficioso proporcionar m\u00e1s detalles sobre cada KPI. Si se a\u00f1aden algunas cifras, posiblemente aumente la claridad de la propuesta. Por ejemplo, \u00bfel proyecto se dirige a las mismas 400 personas? En ese caso ser\u00eda m\u00e1s claro presentar cada medida de \u00e9xito como parte de los hitos de la hoja de ruta en lugar de bajo los KPI. Puede que est\u00e9 interpretando mal la informaci\u00f3n, pero para m\u00ed no est\u00e1 claro si el proyecto pretende encontrar 400 nuevos participantes despu\u00e9s de cada hito de los KPI. Si la propuesta incluyera tambi\u00e9n un breve texto sobre algunos de los posibles retos que podr\u00edan surgir durante el desarrollo de este proyecto, aumentar\u00eda la confianza que, como consejero comunitario, tengo en la credibilidad y la competencia de los equipos para llevar a cabo este proyecto.

The proposal leader is described briefly in terms of his or her skills and experience, but no references are provided to verify these statements. The team has attached the budget, and after evaluating the items included, I must admit that I believe most of them to be appropriate except perhaps for the Plutus programmer. It is stated that $2600 will be allocated, but I am not sure what the role of the person will be. Is the person responsible for training the girls directly? If so, how much does each hour of training cost? Another aspect that I have missed here is the description of the risks that may threaten the successful implementation of this proposal.

What worries me a little is that the theory is perfect, but I don't really understand how that would be done in practice. It is not detailed in the proposal things like: what content of these workshops; in which schools (or universities, but I believe schools - which would also be a problem, because this type of teaching is a little difficult and advanced for those in elementary and high school. who are already dependent on the world of technologies, at least ); who would give these classes, how would the training of professionals be carried out; how often these classes would take place; how success would be measured, that is, how common taught women get inserted into the Cardano ecosystem, so as to measure the proposed benefits for the blockchain... Too many details. I'm also a little worried because it's such an ambitious idea to introduce the blockchain into a community that, unfortunately, gives so few opportunities to study and work for women. Maybe it would be more important to guarantee primary education to then invest in something more specific, you know? It worries me if this idea, despite being wonderful in theory, in practice is viable for the current situation in which these women find themselves. It is indisputable how we need to invest in their education, but I don't know if that would be the way at the moment.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, we have almost no information on this research topic. Starting with the team, we don't know who they are, what they do, what their relationship is with the Cardano ecosystem, a small curriculum of what they did before, because they would be qualified to execute this project, in particular. It would be important to present them individually, to say their names, maybe their social media profiles and all that information I mentioned. Nor is anything said about how the financing money would be used. Why 30k? It would be necessary to understand what kind of expenses this would cover: teachers' salaries, their qualifications? Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this. We have a very superficial notion of what would happen based on the expected results: the organization of classes, teacher training, contact with students and so on.

Many KPIs are enumerated so we have plenty of information to understand what is being expected and details of possible outcomes. This makes the proposal easily auditable because there is content to be monitored. It would be even better if there were a detailed roadmap here (that way we could analyze the process, not just the end) and also a budget breakdown so that we could monitor whether the money was being used as promised. I believe it would be essential for the team to partially present the results to the community. I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once. Here we do not have a temporal notion of how long this project would take to develop as a whole, but we could think, for example, of a monthly follow-up from the community to the project, together with the team. It would also be interesting if, for example, the results of these teachings in the lives of young women were evaluated. Did they get opportunities from the project? How was the impact? This information could be organized and reported to the rest of the community, through Town Hall, for example. If successful, this project would be achieving many of the Cardano ecosystem's objectives: it would bring people together around the subject (forming a hub), bring new members to the community (which relates to the challenge of f6 \"value on boarding\") and also would benefit Africa (meeting the challenge of f5 and f6 \"grow Africa, grow Cardano).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This seems to be a meaningful idea to the world community in general, and the blockchain community in particular.
