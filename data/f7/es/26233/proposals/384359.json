What's more, they're running a fresh stakepool, too (https://incrypture-ada.com/).\r\n\r\nThe plan has a good basis but it falls short in detailing a roadmap. \"Identify promissing Lending Protocols\" is now planned to be carried out AFTER funding is received (Month 1). It would be easier to get the funding if that was done already. Month 2 on the roadmap mentions \"Apply for grants from lending protocols\". What if you would first identify the ideal lending protocols* and applied to funding from them first - and then only applied for Catalyst funding with a more detailed plan?\r\n\r\nReserving only one month for \"Code Development for MVP\" is probably not enough.

However, it is important that DeFi projects have good accessability and also enable to bank the unbanked instead of just beeing an elitist project. I have done some personal research on both DeFi and microlending especially with a focus on Global and social justice and hope to bring in a valuable perspective on accessability for poorer people with my reviews in this challenge. The proposal identifies a problem within the challenge, however they come up with a solution that defeats the purpose of DeFi by bringing in larger investors and thus counteracting the decentralisation idea of Cardano. Apart from this, the product presented relates to DeFi platforms on the Ethereum blockchain, so it is hard for me to grasp how this should be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem. Hence, the goals of the proposal do not align with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nCardano specific scalability is not adressed well enough.
