Real state buyers are usually so only one-time, or years apart.

I'll consider this to be necessary and impactful. \r\n\r\nThe proposal seems to be a centralized solution, as the issuance of tokens is done by the proposer company. DeFi should be about trustless transactions, but in this case, it seems trust just shifts from an entity to another. \r\n\r\nThere might be potential on using DiDs for the buyer/seller qualification phase (and submitting to a different challenge), but according to the description, that's not part of the plan. In fact, they might be \"reinventing the wheel\", according to the following sentence: \"Artifact [...] encrypt Buyer data [...] and issues [...] Token that serves as a real time \"green light\" indicating a qualified state\".
