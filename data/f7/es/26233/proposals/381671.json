But actually, if we think more deeply, we will see that paying higher rewards for stakingers for longer is just in line with the way banks operate. Because the bank needs to use your money for the time you commit to leave the money in their bank. As a result, the bank will encourage you to deposit longer by increasing your APY if you deposit for a long time so they can use your money to lend. As for Cardano's Ouroboros mechanism that works under the Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, using a smart contract to lock your ADA for a period of 6 months or 1 year does not bring any benefit to the system. chief. Besides, encouraging people to staking for such a long time may affect other Defi activities such as borrowing and lending because users will consider whether to put ADA in Defi or staking.
