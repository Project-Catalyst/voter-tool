It says that it would take 3 months to complete the documentation and train the team, but it also says that this auditing process would be applied already in Fund 8, so for me it was not clear if they were referring to their own team or the proposing teams.  They mentioned that they would come up with a website and prepare a process where funded proposers would have to upload ther documentation according to a system called GAAP. The proposer doesn't explain if this same process would apply for different kinds of entities and services. It doesn't mention how the volatility of ADA would be taken into consideration, and how the team would prove that they are holding ADA or a stablecoin. That said, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge as it allows the financial audit of funded proposers, and although, as mentioned, its budget is not enough to audit all the proposal in a single Fund, it would be enough for a test with 40 proposals, which is aligned with the spirit of experimentation in Catalyst. On the other side, since proposal mentions that continuous fund is required to scale up this initiative, it might be very limited in the future if it doesn't get funded again, or if the 'Grow Auditability' Challenges is not chosen again for some reason, for example. If not funded this time, the proposer should also include some KPIs to help measuring the impact and success of this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposing team has provided background experience in management (Jeff) and IT (Steve). It also states that Steve has 20 to 30 accounting students, which was not clear to me since he is a retired manager of IT and no further information was provided. The plan of implementation of this proposal is just very superficially mentioned here, it doesn't have a clear roadmap, milestones or example of documentation that will be required from the funded proposers. It also doesn't mention some risks such as ADA price volatility, difficulties on how to work with different kinds of projects and services (it mentions a system called GAAP but doesn't extend much on that), how to choose which proposals to review in a fair way. It is also not clear if the plan is to implement this procedure durind Fund 8 or 9, since it says it would take 3 months to train the team and prepare the documentation, but at the same time it says it would start in Fund 8. The budget seems ok, although it's also unclear if its sized for 3 or 6 months. As an advice for a future fund, if not funded in the present round, would be to provide more information about the team, include a detailed roadmap, more information about possible risks and challenges expected when auditing proposals in this environment. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The information presented in this proposal to enable its auditing is the number of proposals to be audited. Although, as mentioned in the previous criteria rationale, it's not clear if the timeline is 3 or 6 months.

This is within the scope of the challenge, and will benefit the ecosystem. I don't see any vision of developing smart contract audits or something that will be easier using blockchain technology, which is mentioned in the challenge brief. I believe we should try and make the process easier and simpler than the old ways of auditing. It might cost more in the beginning to develop, but in the long run will have huge savings.
