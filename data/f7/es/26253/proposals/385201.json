La idea es crear un portal en el que la comunidad pueda seguir el progreso de los proyectos; en este portal, tambi\u00e9n habr\u00eda \"paquetes de trabajo\", que son b\u00e1sicamente partes del proyecto por hacer, una vez que el equipo presentara resultados de las respectivas partes, la financiaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda, poco a poco, liberada, y as\u00ed los paquetes avanzar\u00edan y el dinero estar\u00eda disponible. Lo que me pareci\u00f3 estupendo fue que se organizaron las cosas de una manera muy sistem\u00e1tica y pre-estandarizada. Creo que cada proyecto tiene sus especificidades, pero sin duda es posible prever un calendario de acciones para cada uno de ellos y dividirlos en paquetes. Creo que la navegaci\u00f3n necesaria aqu\u00ed es un punto crucial para el \u00e9xito de la idea. Porque habr\u00eda muchos proyectos categorizados, divididos y especificados. Hay que estudiar el dise\u00f1o UI/UX para crear una plataforma lo m\u00e1s sencilla posible. Una duda que ten\u00eda era precisamente d\u00f3nde estar\u00eda este portal. \u00bfUna p\u00e1gina web, una app? Ser\u00eda interesante que el autor aclarara d\u00f3nde estar\u00eda alojado. Aparte de eso, me encant\u00f3 la idea en s\u00ed, creo que har\u00eda mucho m\u00e1s accesible el seguimiento de los proyectos (\u00a1es muy complicado seguir cientos de proyectos financiados, reflejados en los m\u00e1s diversos rincones de internet!)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "En cuanto a la capacidad del autor para ejecutar el proyecto con \u00e9xito, me gustar\u00eda tener m\u00e1s detalles sobre qui\u00e9n es. Nos da muy poca informaci\u00f3n sobre s\u00ed mismo, lo \u00fanico que sabemos es que es ingeniero, empresario y que tiene experiencia en la distribuci\u00f3n de financiaci\u00f3n. Pero ser\u00eda importante tener un curr\u00edculum m\u00e1s detallado, ejemplos de trabajos anteriores, c\u00f3mo es esta experiencia con la distribuci\u00f3n de la financiaci\u00f3n, c\u00f3mo ser\u00eda el m\u00e9todo tradicional. Ser\u00eda muy beneficioso que adjuntara un perfil de linkedin o alguna otra plataforma donde pudi\u00e9ramos conocerlo m\u00e1s de cerca. Ser\u00eda muy importante para este proyecto contar con la experiencia de un dise\u00f1ador UI/UX para construir una plataforma intuitiva y f\u00e1cil para cualquier miembro de la comunidad que quiera ejercer la auditabilidad. Tampoco queda claro si el propio autor ser\u00eda el programador, no dice si piensa contratar un equipo de marketing para dar a conocer la idea, etc. En cuanto al gui\u00f3n, esta parte est\u00e1 muy bien detallada, y se suma a la divisi\u00f3n de los gastos. Si bien el autor se\u00f1ala lo que se har\u00eda, dice cu\u00e1ntos fondos se utilizar\u00edan para una parte determinada. Y los pasos est\u00e1n bastante bien desgranados, por lo que tenemos una idea s\u00f3lida de lo que va a pasar en cada parte. Por lo tanto, lo que creo que hay que mejorar es la presentaci\u00f3n del propio autor y la explicaci\u00f3n de la formaci\u00f3n de un futuro equipo, sobre todo porque no es posible que un proyecto de tal complejidad lo haga una sola persona. Y al presentarnos un equipo y lo que har\u00eda cada profesional, tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00edamos mayor fundamento para determinar si el dinero que se pide en la financiaci\u00f3n es justificable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "El autor se preocupa por trazar definiciones de \u00e9xito en funci\u00f3n del paso del tiempo, de forma directa para ejercer la auditabilidad; yo tambi\u00e9n creo que esto podr\u00eda hacerse en dos pasos. Primero, por supuesto, sigamos la construcci\u00f3n de la propia plataforma. Esto podr\u00eda hacerse a trav\u00e9s de reuniones, en las que el autor muestre los avances, qu\u00e9 partes se hicieron en determinados per\u00edodos de tiempo. Es posible saber qu\u00e9 cobrar a trav\u00e9s de la divisi\u00f3n de fases que establece, y como es muy detallada, sabemos exactamente qu\u00e9 esperar de cada una. Y una vez finalizado este proceso de creaci\u00f3n, habr\u00eda que observar si la plataforma funciona correctamente, si la auditabilidad de los proyectos \"alojados\" ha mejorado realmente, si la comunidad est\u00e1 teniendo acceso, qu\u00e9 piensa la comunidad al navegar por el portal, posibles errores a corregir. En otras palabras, es posible controlar el progreso del proyecto a trav\u00e9s de la informaci\u00f3n proporcionada durante la descripci\u00f3n de la propuesta, adem\u00e1s de las mencionadas m\u00e9tricas de \u00e9xito.

I also like the idea of the fundings being released by work packages as it evolves, according to its schedule, completition and depencencies and have a system manage this \"stage-gate\" would be awesome.

It seems to me that the idea is to keep this management in idea scale but that brings the question of this place is really the best for this kind management and if the solutions proposed would be available from ideascale.
