Esta propuesta, en resumen, ofrece la creaci\u00f3n de un canal de youtube para informar sobre los proyectos relacionados con la AMA con v\u00eddeos que se subir\u00e1n semanalmente. Esto se alinea con los objetivos del desaf\u00edo, ya que proporcionar\u00e1 visibilidad a la comunidad.  El planteamiento del problema habla de proporcionar una \"supervisi\u00f3n integral completa\". Sin embargo, la propuesta no explica realmente lo que esto significa, por lo que la puntuaci\u00f3n es de 4. Una adici\u00f3n \u00fatil a esta propuesta habr\u00eda sido definir los par\u00e1metros en torno a los cuales est\u00e1n trabajando (por ejemplo, \u00bflos v\u00eddeos ser\u00e1n charlas generales con los proponentes o se centrar\u00e1n en la entrega del proyecto o los resultados o el impacto o todo lo anterior?)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "La viabilidad de esta propuesta es bastante dif\u00edcil de descifrar a partir de la informaci\u00f3n proporcionada.\nSe menciona una lista de 8 recursos nombrados, pero no sabemos realmente qui\u00e9n va a realizar el trabajo.\nNo hay pruebas de que ninguno de ellos tenga experiencia en la producci\u00f3n de v\u00eddeo o en la gesti\u00f3n de un canal de youtube. Esto no me preocupa demasiado ya que, por experiencia, se puede aprender con bastante facilidad.\nNo hay un plan real de actividades o de hitos en el que se detallen las actividades de los pr\u00f3ximos 6 meses. El plan parece ser tan simple como crear plantillas, entrevistar a los proponentes y subir los v\u00eddeos. Esto est\u00e1 bien, pero podr\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s claro con los hitos intermedios, por ejemplo, un MVP con un bucle de retroalimentaci\u00f3n.\nEl presupuesto tiene 4 partidas que me resulta dif\u00edcil relacionar con el plan y los recursos. 3.000 d\u00f3lares para viajes, 1.000 d\u00f3lares para formaci\u00f3n, 1.000 d\u00f3lares para marketing. La secci\u00f3n del presupuesto es el \u00fanico lugar donde se mencionan estas actividades.\n\nComo el presupuesto es relativamente peque\u00f1o y por experiencia la creaci\u00f3n de un canal de YouTube no es una gran tarea ya que la puntuaci\u00f3n de 3 se da en base a la confianza y la reputaci\u00f3n que wada ha construido en la comunidad.\n\nPara futuras propuestas, los proponentes deber\u00edan trabajar en la alineaci\u00f3n del plan con el presupuesto y los resultados con los hitos. Esta es una tarea bastante sencilla y hay algunos buenos ejemplos en el Fondo 7. Tambi\u00e9n pueden pedir ayuda a los mentores o a la comunidad.

Una medida espec\u00edfica habr\u00eda sido que para todos los (\u00bf10?) proyectos de wada financiados hasta el fondo 6 se produjera un v\u00eddeo semanal.\nEn resumen, una gran idea. El detalle de la entrega necesita ser trabajado, sin embargo los votantes deber\u00edan sopesar esto contra el proyecto relativamente simple, la reputaci\u00f3n de wada y el modesto presupuesto.

It would be helpful to include information about the parameters that you wish to report on and how this reporting will take place, for example the use of graphs to display projected sales against current sales.\nThe lack of key metrics and goals means I am unable to assess how well the proposal aligns with the outlined challenge settings as none of the key metrics are referred to.\nIn my opinion, proposal would be unable to successfully scale without sound fundamentals required to enable it to address future challenges.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer does not demonstrate sufficient knowledge of auditing or how they wish to measure the performance of the catalyst proposal, nor is there any evidence of any persons with such knowledge relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal on their team.\nThe budget is not outlined clearly, nor broken down into identifiable items.

Considering the size and demographic of the area it would not be possible or feasible to conduct such an operation on such a small budget.

Generally this is done by plain documentation and video would certainly bring a more \"human component\" to this process at the same time it allows funded proposers to proper explain all the development done, in words and images.\nHowever, the documentation part still would be essential as it is really proof of what was done. The proposer here understands this and offers, together with the video, a place to keep this documents. Having everything in a dedicated platform, and with a standard template, would defintely make things easier and help community.\nI also see this proposal very aligned with challenge as it would increase the \"Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts\".\n\nThe only reason I didnt give 5 start here is because it is still unclear how much work would have to be put on to make these videos. Usually, this kind of media demand much more effort (and specific knowledge of tools and design) to be ellaborated, even with a template, than a regular documentation (word documents, spreadsheets, powerpoints). My concern is that funded proposers might not want to make the videos (either because of time it takes or because they dont know how to do them) and this project ends up being not very broadly adopted. To overcome this, it could be included in the scope of the project some support/training on creating the videos, besides providing the template, a possible way to outsource the creation of these videos (even if with a small fee) or other ways to facilitate the creation of this content. It could also be mentioned how was the impact, in a quantitative manner, of their previous funded proposal (Wada Media Funnel for Proposers), that involved video creation as well. It would clarify how prone proposers are to create these medias.\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As this this team has already developed a similar project in past funds, initially I'd say this proposal is generally feasible but it lacks some key information, that I describe in the sequence, that makes me give only a 3 score/star. First, more information on the team experience, person by person (it is mentioned mostly their area of expertise), and links to verify the information, as linkedin links, would be necessary. \n\nSecond, budget breakdown could better explained. For instance, it says \"Travel and security logistics \" but it could explain somewhere why these trips are necessary. \"Team costs\" could also be better ellaborated (is it just to pay the team or involve other kind of costs? how much will be paid per hour or per peson?).\n\nLast, There's a simple roadmap but it is not time-framed and only some vague actitivites are described. This roadmap could be better organized in months/weeks, with more straightfoward tasks, deliverables and main milestones per period. \n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are good time-framed milestones but no KPIs. It would be imporant to measure and follow up with how many audit videos are being made by funded proposers, how much time they are spending on it, how many people are watching and assess if this is really a better way to audit projects. Maybe it would be hard to set target on all them initially but their experience with past funded proposals could be used to give some sense on these targets (even if within a range)\nThe first bullets in the auditability part seems more related to engagement between proposers and community than the proposal itself.\n\n\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 10, "ng": 14, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This follow-up proposal builds on work that has been started in Fund5.
