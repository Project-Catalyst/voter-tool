You must explain to me why there is an op and why the problem exists\nIn the problem, the value proposition, you should give an example of when you launched a product or a solution and how you saw it as a possible solution to the problem.\nWhile reading the proposal, I had another question: How developing a Python package which would facilitate DIDs verification for the Flask, Django web frameworks? And Why? I understand why and the benefits but that should be crystal clear from the proposal as well to the rest of the readers.\nPlease do not mistake my position because I am in support of this idea, but the idea is still a bit abstract and abstract about these are the problems and this is how you solve them.\nI suggest a more concrete approach to understanding the problem, not a complex deep one, but one rooted in reality. I would like to hear examples of what is good about a Python package which would facilitate DIDs verification for the Flask, Django web frameworks. Include more details about what the Python package will do with some high-level concepts of the key parameters, functions and overall commands.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It's recommendable a more understandable view of the proposed metrics and how the value can bring ROI and value to the entire Cardano ecosystem.

However, I wish the proponent had explained his idea in a simpler way, so that people (like me) who have no programming knowledge could fully understand it. What I understand here is that a package would be developed in the Python programming language, the purpose of which would be to facilitate checking DIDs in different web applications. But some questions are: what would be \"Flask and Django web frameworks\"? These packages would check DIDs that already exist, right? That is, would it increase the reach of Atala Prism, but wouldn't it necessarily promote the adoption of new users? What would be the \"top web application programming frameworks\"? Despite so many doubts, the final objective is clear, which is to make Python developers able to better use DIDs, thus facilitating their use and increasing the reach of Atala Prism. And, as the proponent points out, Python is a very famous language, so the proposal would be aimed at a very large audience that is already in the technology field. Maybe even those who don't have DIDs are still motivated to create them, but as I pointed out earlier as one of my doubts, this project seems to be more geared towards improvement than creating new decentralized identities. It would be interesting if, for example, in creating this new product, the proponent included some content aimed at briefly explaining what Atala Prism is and why developers should create a decentralized identity. That way I think the project would be even more complete. I will give it 4 stars because I believe in the potential of the idea, although this explanation was very technical and caused me some questions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "First I will talk about financing, because it is simpler. The money would go entirely towards the developer's salary, being charged USD 50 per hour. It is possible to fully understand how the funding would be used, but I have one question: wouldn't it take a designer to create the UI/UX of these tools? Or would the author himself do it, as he points out that the domain and design would cost nothing? And how would the disclosure happen? No part of the funding is for marketing. How would Python programmers find out about this project? About the script: we don't have a well-defined script here, we don't know how long the proponent would work on it, how the 200 hours of work would be distributed, after how much time there would already be some partial result to be presented to the Cardano community... Unfortunately , there is no way to understand about the process. As much as it is a project that does not involve several people doing numerous activities, as is the case with several proposals, it is still important to draw a timeline that explains what would be done, in what order, by whom and why; without such data, we cannot visualize the process. And as for the proposer: we basically know nothing about him. We don't know his name, what languages \u200b\u200bhe programs, examples of previous work, what his relationship with the Cardano ecosystem is, if he has any previous work with our blockchain and how he gives his knowledge about Atala Prism and DIDs. It's all very uncertain, it's not enough to say that I have more than 20 years of experience with software development. It would be necessary to add a more detailed presentation here, including all the topics I mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, this part of the proposal leaves many gaps: absence of a roadmap, lack of knowledge of the car and funding that is quite understandable but that is limited to the work of only one person and does not include a marketing plan.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent has included very little here about auditability. All we know are 3 ultimate goals, which would point to the success or failure of the project. From what I understand, this performance would be measured by the adoption of different programmers of the tool in question. About third objective (\"will be chosen to implement 100 production pilots or launches in 2022\"), what does that mean? This is one of the parts that gets a little confusing for non-programmers - what are production pilots? Unfortunately, I believe that the proposal is not highly auditable, the author needs to elaborate more KPIs and also qualitative KPIs, that is, that measure beyond numbers if the use of your tool is being positive for users, if it is really making a difference , making life easier for Python programmers who have DID and even attracting new people to the decentralized identity system. It would be important for the author to meet with the community, sporadically, that is, every certain period of time, to present results. A meeting could be held as soon as the project was concluded, while another could be held after a few months of use, in order to point out results in the medium/long term. It would also be interesting to carry out a satisfaction survey with users, to understand if their needs were met and possible improvements to be made.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 11, "ng": 11, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Desarrollar un paquete de Python que facilite la verificaci\u00f3n de DIDs para los frameworks web Flask, Django", "experience": "M\u00e1s de 20 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el desarrollo de software utilizando varios lenguajes de programaci\u00f3n."}
