This is indirectly solved in Blockchain platforms (including Cardano) by setting of incentive structures. The proposer wants to complement this with a more direct (and human controlled) form of trust by introducing trust tokens and creation of a web of trust. If well implemented it would led to countless applications and use cases. This aligns with the challenge as it integrate one's wallet address with one's identity (via trust and relationships)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on his CV and the way the proposal is written the proposer (Yuri) seems experienced enough to lead this proposal, but this would require a team of experienced developers for successful implementation. The proposer acknowledges this throughout, but it seems that there's no team yet in place, just contacts for which the skills we cannot verify. In this scenario it would have been more useful for the proposer to identify which skills sets he requires for his team. The proposal presents a realistic timeline and a detailed plan on what will be done and when. The budget breakdown is lacking, just mentions that payment of 500 USD/month per team member, which isn't much and we don't know the number of team members.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There's a roadmap with timings presented, but the milestones are a bit vague in places. For example, a \"testnet usable by the community\" is mentioned a few times, but when do you aim to lunch the testnet ?

Some KPI's could be number of trust tokens minted or growth of trust network 3 months after lunch.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_125", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 6, "ng": 14, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is aligned with the challenge since it's focusing on developing a system that will allow to build trustworthy relationships among peers, by integrating a  web of trust based on NFTs and smart contracts to create relationships between addresses.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The work time frame is well detailed for the entire duration of the project, and the proposer's objectives well defined.\r\nHowever, I would like to see some collaboration the proposer would undertake with other similar projects out there in order to improve what may already be existing.

Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a valid approach to building trust in a pretty anonymous network. This can be a good addition to the Cardano ecosystem and DID if implemented correctly and matches the Key Metrics of the challenge well. Scalability should be provided considering the makup of the system, that will scale faster and be more legitimate the more people are using it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides some verifiable personal information that makes it seem credible he is generally qualified for the challenge. The proposer does not explicitly mention the type and number of team members that are exactly going to be used to implement the proposal, but only some categories of people he's in contact with. \r\nThe budget is explained by a monthly rate per person, however neither the amount of people nor the developing hours are estimated, so it is difficult to tell whether the budget is reasonable. In this respect, the proposal should also consider risks regarding the requirement for further funds and general challenges. A detailed timetable/roadmap is presented and technical background is explained, which adds some credibility to this proposal. However  general things like team assembly and budget should be more concrete in order to assess feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "No explicit metrics/KPIs are presented. The roadmap is auditable.

", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer appears to be a very smart and experienced mathematician. His LinkedIn profile references machine learning work, and the proposal provides links to interesting articles about the nature of trust in the digital era. It is shame that he did not heed the advice provided in the comments section to join the Atala PRISM course and connect the ideas described in the proposal with using Cardano's technology. While there are vague references to plutus scripts and Haskell development, it is not clear how the concepts described would be implemented using those tools. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "While the proposal raises some interesting ideas and concepts, it is far too vague to allow for any meaningful auditability.  For example, the first task is to \"create ways to mint tokens of trust and create plutus scripts that associate these tokens with trusted addresses.\" That task is so broad that it could be a huge project by itself. There is no method identified of providing KPIs or other methods of demonstrating that the project is on track and progressing. The proposal would pay 500 USD per month for one year for everyone in the project. But it is not clear who the people in the project will be, how they will be recruited, what skills they will have, or how their work will be assessed. In conclusion, I find the ideas fascinating. The proposer needs to do more work to turn these abstract concepts into a concrete request for funding that would provide value to the Cardano ecosystem.
