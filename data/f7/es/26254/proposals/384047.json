Debido a que el IOG no est\u00e1 desplegando Atala PRISM como una iniciativa de arriba hacia abajo, sino m\u00e1s bien empoderando a los individuos para crear soluciones que mejor se adapten a sus propias comunidades y necesidades, muchos proponentes est\u00e1n creando y desarrollando soluciones Atala PRISM que est\u00e1n hechas a la medida de las comunidades que habitan y conocen mejor. Aunque una amplia encuesta de la comunidad de Cardano podr\u00eda ser muy valiosa, no estoy seguro de que sea esencial para el proceso de desarrollo de soluciones de Atala PRISM.
