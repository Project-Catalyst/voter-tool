Many components are in the proposal that are important for its success. We have an African team, an African fintech company with experience in financial and digital inclusion and we also have a general plan to onboard farmers through partnerships that that work with half a million small-scale farmers in Ethiopia. Futhermore, the approach is good - to start with a pilot. The team indicated that it wants to begin issuing digital IDs and also that it is leveraging Atala Prism. And that's it. So many questions go unanwered. How will the team leverage Atala Prism exactly? Why $150000? WHo are the Atala PRISM developers that will work on this? Does the team have Atala Prism Pioneer Program members? The idea is still good and promising, however we need a plan - what will be done exactly. The proposing team is not known as a contributing developer group to the Cardano ecosystem - so they need to prove their credentials at least through a strong plan. The idea is good, the details are not present. So, I would advise the proposers to include some project metrics and goals for implementation, aside from the aspirational desire to commence the pilot. How specifically do you intend to go about integrating Atala Prism? There is no one listed who has that kind of development experience in your proposal..\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The general plan is good and has a very good vision of what it wishes to achieve - in general terms. We need specifics if this proposal is to deliver successful implementation. The problem is that we can't see experience with Atala Prism in the team. If it isn't present - where will you find the know-how? Have you approached Atala Prism pioneers? How good are your own programmers and developers? How will you utilize the $150,000 budget - in real life? The budget is not broken down into identifiable items and seems like a lump sum was designated - without including backing it up with a point-by-point rationale. This might be relatively forgivable if the team was a very high profile team from the Cardano developer ecosystem that has proven know-how with the proposed technology - but in this case, the proposing team should provide more details. We know what you want to do, we know generally how you intend to approach the project - but we do not know specifically what you are planning to do ... with milestones, KPIs, challenges and risks.

Without specific metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal it will be really tough to follow its implementation, especially as the team does not demonstrate that it is highly proficient with Haskell, Atala Prism, Plutus. I could foresee a lot of potential problems that could ocurr, however the team hasn't listed them. The team does have an understandable description of the problem, but the proposed practical path to the solution is missing. It will be difficult to audit progress without specific milestones. It is not enough to simply state that the pilot will commence in Q2 of 2022 with the issuing of digital IDs - as we want to know about the integration with Atala Prism that needs to ocurr. How do you define success? The team mentions that once successfully completed the solution will be scaled for the 500,000 farmers.
