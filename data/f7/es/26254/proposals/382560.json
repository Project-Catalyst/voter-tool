Desgraciadamente, no pude llegar a una conclusi\u00f3n definitiva, de ah\u00ed la puntuaci\u00f3n de 3. Aunque puedo ver c\u00f3mo la traducci\u00f3n de los recursos de ATALA Prism del ingl\u00e9s al japon\u00e9s conducir\u00e1 indirectamente a una aceleraci\u00f3n del desarrollo de DID, est\u00e1 un paso por detr\u00e1s de la directiva del desaf\u00edo de desarrollar e implementar soluciones con ATALA Prism. Esto significa una relaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s directa con el propio Prisma ATALA, no el paso educativo que podr\u00eda llevar al desarrollo e implementaci\u00f3n de soluciones. Cuanto m\u00e1s leo la propuesta, m\u00e1s convencido estoy de que deber\u00eda presentarse en el marco del desaf\u00edo de los recursos multiling\u00fces.

Han presentado su experiencia y trayectoria, aunque no se puede confirmar con enlaces a un perfil profesional. Habr\u00e1 que aceptarlos al pie de la letra. El plan presentado, desde la recogida de materiales hasta la formaci\u00f3n de desarrolladores e ingenieros, es claro en el plazo de seis meses. Sin embargo, la cantidad de 50000 d\u00f3lares solicitada deja un gran signo de interrogaci\u00f3n en cuanto a la relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio. Distribuir parte de la cantidad como ingresos mensuales de 5000 y 3000 d\u00f3lares para 7 y 3 personas, respectivamente, no tiene l\u00f3gica. No estoy seguro de si traducir servicios al japon\u00e9s atrae un salario m\u00e1s alto en Jap\u00f3n, pero, quitando mi ignorancia, cuestiono la necesidad de siete personas antes de la recogida de los materiales.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "La traducci\u00f3n de recursos de un idioma a otro siempre ser\u00e1 un proyecto auditable, ya que el trabajo y el resultado est\u00e1n estrechamente relacionados, especialmente en el caso de los materiales educativos.

In this way, new professionals would understand what, after all, the ecosystem is and what its decentralized identity system is, and with that, new members would certainly be added to the community. It's also very positive how proponents put current problems into context - so we're more focused on what they need to solve. This proposal solves the objectives of two challenges: the present challenge, by Atala Prism, since, as I said, new users would be joined, and it would also directly benefit Japan, disseminating our blockchain technologies there, as the specific challenge about Japan search. It is possible to understand 100% of what is intended to be done through the list of activities found in \"detailed plan\", and I assure you, this is one of the most positive proposals for the Cardano ecosystem that I have evaluated so far at f7: introducing the Japanese market Atala Prism , NFT and various technologies relevant to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the detailed plan, we have the main activities that have just been developed, such as commenting on impact. Proponents also provide a roadmap that temporally organizes the activities. However, this script should be more detailed, in my opinion. For example: \"5~6th month: Engagement expansion\". How would this expansion take place, what marketing strategies would be developed here? About the team, I think this part is perfect. We have the names, main roles and linkedin profiles of those involved. In this way, we get to know the team well and understand its specificities, and they are certainly capable of successfully executing the project, since the professional activities of those involved are well diversified and include specialists in Cardano (ambassadors and SPOs). Finally, the budget is also explained in a very satisfactory way, we know how the amount of 50k, which despite being high, makes sense for this proposal, will be used. How it will be divided and why each part corresponds to each percentage of the final amount. Ultimately, the only improvement I can identify here would be an increase in script details. Otherwise, it's all very good!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Through the detailed plan, current issues and KPIs we were able to audit this proposal very well. Current problems would serve as a guide for us to monitor whether the situations previously encountered have been remedied, if the project was able to meet the needs of the context. With the detailed plan, it is possible to monitor if the activities that were promised are actually being done by the team members, and how they are being done, that is, if everything that was planned became reality. The KPIs serve to analyze the reflection of this proposal in Japan - there are two, as the proponents point out: the amount of translated materials and the audience reached with the \"learn to win\" program. This last part is something that the team itself should analyze, collect data and present to the rest of the community. As it is a project aimed at the Japanese target audience, it would be very interesting for some member of the community from the country to accompany this proposal and establish continuous contact with the rest of the community. He could have a closer view of what was happening, and, knowing the specifics of the country, would better understand the results achieved than someone outside Japan.

This proposal perfectly fits the challenge and will lead to increaced decentralization and asymetrical growth. It will be a great value added for the cardano ecosystem to bring along more japanese people into the crypto space and cardano in particular. The KPIs and goals align with the challenge settings as mentioned. The team seams prepared to face any challenges and a couple of those challenges like obtaining the documents is being worked on already.  This proposal will add something missing in the ecosystem and that's localization in a native language. I think there should be more translations to bring the whole world along quicker. As a developer myself, I'm no expert in these matters but I don't see any logical roadblocks at this point. Overall a great proposal that's worth doing.

In my humble oppinion this brings credibility to the whole project because the voters can see the team is legit. The budget could have been broken down better, because it's nott clear exactly how the funds will be dispersed, but I can appreciate the effort put in. Having said that I'd like to see a better break down with rationale given behind the hourly rates, because that would make them comparible and verifiable. As I said I'm no expert in this field but even so the timetable seems reasonable for the work that will be done, given they manage to aquire the documentation that needs translation. There's a sensible plan for implementation and there are a lot of details on how every step will be taken and implemented. The resources necessary to implement the proposal are listed and valid.  Consideration of risk is one of the reason I believe the project will be implemented successfully because it shows foresight and consistency.  I think it's a feasible proposal that has a high chance of being implemented. Good luck to all the team members! ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The learn to earn programe is the thing that makes this project tracable and it's success auditable.
