However the plan boils down to find someone who does KYC already and then  build a system to deliver that. KYC is complex and every country has their own requirements on what documents will be accepted. \r\nThere is no clear plan on how this will be done other than 100hrs dev time. What is the economics going forward? What will it cost per user to verify, who will pay that? Is the KYC to be attached to a wallet address? This proposal need clear details on a system that will be provided rather than funding for 100 hours of dev time to try an build something. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There is no clear plan on how working product will be delivered here. It is more of a proposal to pay for research into how to do it. This may be reasonable, however its not clear the proposers have the expertise in the KYC space to deliver this. \r\nIn terms of experience and capability, none of the proposers claim experience in this space. The second listed proposer QUASAR has submitted numerous vague proposals across this and previous funding rounds which various experience listed each time changing based on the proposal but without evidence to back them up. I cannot give high confidence in that proposers ability. Rodo seems to have good technical experience, but this area really needs legal/compliance experience which is not presented by the candidates.

Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a that needs to be adressed regarding DID. The solution seems mostly beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, specifically DID, however possible layers of anonymity should already be discussed in the proposal, as there are numerous privacy maximalists in the community. It is explained comprehensibly and matches the Key Metrics of the challenge well. Scalability should be provided considering there are a lot of good, feasible KYC standards.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers are well-known and networked in the community and are sure up for the challenge.

This may help in instances where KYC is needed, but it is not addressing how we drive adoption through DID's.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Two of their team members seem to have sufficient experience, but the plan only goes into the first steps of making a deal with companies and. not so much how they will implement it with atala prism.

The legacy system requires financial institutions to perform in-depth and complex processes to \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC). For many DeFi projects, compliance with these requirements is technically impossible, or philosophically incompatible. Verifiable Credentials provide an opportunity to solve this problem, and thus the proposal has identified a problem and is providing an interesting solution. Using Cardano's Atala PRISM technology to solve this problem would add value to the ecosystem. The reason for the four-star rating rather than five star is due to the requirement that the proposal \"clearly articulate\" how it will add value. The proposal outlines the beginnings of a very interesting and promising idea, but additional detail about what exactly KYC is and how exactly PRISM DID are needed to strengthen the proposal. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "KYC is a complicated process. Since it is mandated by regulators, companies must get compliance right or risk fines or even worse consequences. While the team acknowledges that they will need to contract with an established KYC provider, the team's own apparent lack of expertise in this field raises questions regarding their ability to effectively screen, identify, and contract with an appropriate partner. Only one team member, Patrick Rivenbank, seems to have had any experience in Fintech. From looking at his LinkedIn profile, it does not appear he has experience with KYC, or with any aspect of financial regulatory compliance. Using community funds to work on a project with a KYC partner company who might do damage due to their lack of experience or credibility would do the ecosystem more harm than good.  Similarly, there is no indication that the team has the required experience to successfully negotiate a service agreement and develop a governance model. While there is some detail around the budget, the line item of USD 500 for 500 licenses seems unrealistic, and no evidence is provided to substantiate this number. The team demonstrates more evidence of their technology skill, and it is important that Rodolfo Miranda is participating in the Atala PRISM program. It would have strengthened the proposal if it has been noted that the PRISM SDK is not yet public, and this could present a risk for the project's successful implementation. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The roadmap provided is too vague, possibly representing the team's lack of understanding of the details of the KYC requirements. There is only one line item for \"Develop a governance model.\" The details of governance models are incredible complex, detailed, and important. The team has also missed a huge group of stake holders \u2013 while a KYC company could provide KYC services, the governance model will ultimately need to be agreed with the end-user. For example, if the KYC company is contracting with a bank or a DeFi provider, the bank or the DeFi provider will need to be deeply involved in the details of developing the governance model. The KYC company can't take this action in isolation. The team has not identified any particular end-user, groups of end-users or target industry. The have only vaguely referred to \"projects that need to comply with Know Your Customer regulations.\" There is no evidence that the team has the ability to negotiate with the many stakeholders involved \u2013 the technical resources coding the Atala PRISM tool, the KYC company providing the KYC process, their customer who will be utilising the KYC tool, and the customer's customer who is ultimately the subject of the KYC process. As there are no metrics or KPIs around this critical part of the process, determining progress would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. While it represents the beginnings of an innovative and exciting idea, the proposal lacks a clear understandable solution that would address of the problem of providing regulatory compliance to KYC requirements.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_662", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Implementar un agente que entregue una credencial verificable a una identidad validada de un recurso de confianza", "experience": "El equipo tiene experiencia relevante en fintech, cr\u00e9dito, tecnolog\u00eda y desarrollo humano, con un historial de contribuciones a la comunidad de Catalyst."}
