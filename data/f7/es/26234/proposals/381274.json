To be an effective proposal it needs to tie in the conference to the Challenge Goals - ie build awareness and participation in Catalyst and Catalyst projects. It is true that No Code is one way of coding . But the challenge goals specify that these should be events about Catalyst. OTherwise we could organize a conference on various other methods of coding as well. This is not directly related to catalyst but is indirectly related.\r\n \r\nNo metrics are stated\r\n \r\nDo the key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge\r\n Since no metrics are included in the proposal I cannot assess this.\r\n \r\nNothing has been proposed  as a solution beyond organizing a conference to teach about No Code\r\n\r\n \r\nI can say that this project  addresses the challenge but its not a strong recommendation  hence i have given it a 3  star rating. But it does tie in to a component of building projects for Catalyst which is why I have given it a 3 rating and not a 1\r\n \r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.  I also have run a web development company from 1997 and have been the author of many ground breaking projects in web and Flash related projects in my country.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\r\nThe proposers have provided   no evidence  of themselves  The Linkedin Profiles have not been provided.   \r\n   \r\n The links are  not sufficient  \r\n   \r\nIts unknown if the proposer is competent to do these online classes. \r\n \r\nDoes proposer know, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal?\r\n\r\nNumber of team members required to complete proposal is not known. \r\n\r\nHas he rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown?\r\n \r\nA sum of 4300 has been given as budget but no indications as to what it would be used for to solve the challenge. It is stated that it would be used for Zoom License, paying the speakers and marketing but a proposal should be more comprehensive than this. \r\n \r\n  \r\nThe budget is just one figure.

If the No-Code intended in this proposal is to provide non-coders a drag and drop capability to build apps, in the case of Cardano, dApps, this would be great in terms of mass adoption of Cardano. The proposer intends to introduce No-Code further by creating a conference though it may be not effective for 2 (two) reasons; the current situation on Cardano's coding front, is still very much attempting to onboard developers due to the unfamiliarity around the use of Haskell. Although the proposer mention there are proposals attempting No-Code on Cardano, none are publicly available, which is the second reason. There is though a group called Joget that is publicly available but other than that, none. With that said above, the possibility of having a conference that is engaging, becomes questionable. This has not taken account that the conference is more geared to introducing No-Code rather than Project Catalyst, which is one of the metrics on this Challenge setting. Perhaps if the proposer where to do a slight shift such as; 'Creating conferences to onboard developers to Cardano by the introduction of the largest blockchain based funding series called, Project Catalyst. With break out rooms on the topic of starting the Cardano No-Code movement through funding by Project Catalyst.', this would more align with the Challenge setting yet still achieving the intended idea of the proposer.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Assessing the data available, the proposer seems to lack experience in hosting a conference. This is due to that there are no mentions of other team members, which a conference will most likely need. Those team members can be moderators, KOL coordinators and marketers. The budget though does in-directly mention the need of those posts above through funds allocation for speakers and marketing. Perhaps if the budget were to be fleshed out in detail, it will become clear what the funds are for and whether or not the proposer understand the needs of hosting a conference. Timeline provided is also generalist, there is no mentioning of preparation period for example; coordinating with KOL on their availability which will reflect on the planned timeline. There is still very much to be developed in this proposal but at it's current state, it will mostly at best, have minimum impact.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are KPI's, though they are not specifically mentioned in their own section. Besides that, there are no other metrics provided. Auditing based on the KPI's provided can be done, but unfortunately it would need more metrics than currently available for this proposal to be successful in achieving their goals.
