And no indication or mention of the proposers involvement after three months. Building a team to do beach cleanup sounds like a local community benefit not a Cardano benefit. How to be sure that people interested in Cardano are interested in pubic service (cleaning beaches). Seems like two different goals. Most communities grow out of enthusiasm, not thru paid services ($20k). If the motivation is money, I doubt the conviction. Most local hubs are self financing (attendance fee). Keys to success are invited speakers worth listening to. No mention of the type of meetings that would be held. Perhaps some link up with another club in Los Angeles would help getting started, to learn from their experience. Invite some members from another hub to join to get started.

He does not talk at all about his skills regarding blockchain and Cardano, so it is unsure whether he will be up to the challenge of supporting members of a Cardano meetup in that area.  In this context, it can also be said that the proposer does not identify other team members that might support him with this.\r\nThe budget only is very coarse-grained and does not give a more detailed rationale for the two positions that are presented there. That being said, the two posts presented do not seem reasonable. 5000$ for member perks and 15000$ for work hours and events which are not even defined yet seem unreasonable. During my political work, I have organized very sophisticated events on much less money hence I also know that a simple meetup can be made on much less money. The events that are presented do not give any information about their contents, which should be at least done in order to justify the budget. No plan is presented for the case that additional funds will be required, which should be done in a more sophisticatedproposal, but since the funds demanded so far have not even been properly justified, it seems the proposer simply has not thought deeply about allocation of funds.\r\nThe proposer offers a brief timetable for the first three months, but does not go beyond that, which does not meet the proposal requirements as normally milestones up to 12 months are required. Feedback: Generally give more thought into the details of what you want to do, when and how you want to do it ahead of proposing.\r\nIn its current form, the proposal does not provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation since a lot of the whats and hows are not explained.\r\nChallenges, resources required and all the deeper details are not considered in the proposal, so it does not seem feasible at the moment.

This proposal does clearly articulate how it will add new members to the ecosystem but it is unclear whether those new members will add value to Cardano or just be new members. At this current moment Cardano needs effective onboarding and adoption, and although a hybrid approach is needed, a balance between social and educational event is essential.

It is very much a general overview with out or very minimal details. Being detailed in budget formatting and roadmaps is a foundation of a good program which unfortunately this proposal is still lacking. Since it is an offline event one would expect some form of marketing on it which is not mentioned. If the goal is just to have an event then this proposal might suffice, but Cardano's goal is more than that, it is about voter participation, new member integration, increase collaboration in Project Catalyst etc. This proposal unfortunately will most likely not be successful in achieving the metrics Cardano intends to reach.
