The problem is clearly stated and the proposed solution is consistent and provides all the needed information to resolve it.  The delivered solution looks very promising to attract more people to the Catalyst community and Cardano ecosystem by facilitating information sharing which is normally hidden within lengthy video content.  The proposal also adds some suggestions to make it sustainable in the long run by training and onboarding more community members. I strongly believe it covers all points of this challenge and it will have a very positive impact to expand the project Catalyst community. Therefore I rate it with a score of 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proof of concept provided in the proposal is an excellent evidence that the delivered services are feasible and the quality achieved will meet the expectations. The work to be undertaken is planned accurately although the supporting process to execute the work is not so clearly specified. For example, the process describes the software to create transcriptions but it does not go through the tasks and workflows on how to edit them or how the summaries and timestamps are created.\r\nThe team experience looks adequate to support the execution of this project. However, the team consists only of two persons and it is questionable if the resources are enough to deliver the promised number of transcripts especially if there is no backup in case of unforeseen issues. Any other risks are well identified and the corresponding mitigation actions are well described. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and specified with a high degree of accuracy. It is further analyzed into more detailed steps and according to the proposed execution plan. \r\nI agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully so I rate with a score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal looks very sufficient to audit its execution phase by providing a time plan with identifiable milestones and KPIs. The success of this project will be based on metrics and feedback from the community in such way that increases transparency.

Without measured metrics or accountable data, progress can not be measured, action to rectify problems can be incorrect, new solutions for upcoming challenges may miss the target. The proposers seeks to provide discussions tangible structures that acts as foundations for future discussions and/or actions. With this in mind, this proposal -perhaps- unbeknownst to the proposers themselves, very effectively addresses all points in the challenge. How is one to identify increased voter-proposer interaction when you have no database to work from? How is one to calculate increase collaboration through workshops when you do not know the current level of the collaboration? This proposal applies to any form of discussions. The simplest form of this proposal, is Minutes of Meeting. MoM binds people to their words and it is unquestionable and unbiased.

Their budget is simple but clear. There is logical interconnection between the intended action and the budget needed. Timeline is accompanied by numerical KPI's, although the timeline is not detailed, it does correlate well the type of work this proposal seeks to do. Meaning, more emphasize on delivering a lump sum of targets during a certain duration. Proposers have also included addressing risk and challenges that this proposal might face. From what is expressed, there is actually one aspect from the risk and challenge checklist that was initially wanted to be pointed out but has already been addressed, which is informing the community of this service.

The budget is clear and fair considering the level of skill and detail involved, and the impact this will have on the Cardano ecosystem.
