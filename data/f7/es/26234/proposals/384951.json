The needed funcionalities that dont exist and the disadvantages need to be clear in the problem statement.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it could be outlined here what services the platform will provide and how it could benefits both employers and employees (look automatically for matches, profile data analysis, suggestions to improve resume, communication of courses). Some brainstorm/ideation sessions could be made with stakeholders (key potential users, proposers, companies, etc) to ellaborate more on that. Its good to have clear how it would differ from linkedin and what are the specifics advantages to the crypto/blockchain world.\r\n\r\nIt's also nice to bring what business model it would be adopted. The standards for this kind of platforms is the \"freemium\" but others could be tried.\r\n\r\nLast, as it is already stated in proposal the main objective here is not get funded but to learn how to ellaborate the proposal (for future actual funds) I dont see it is already ready to become a catalyst project. However, its in the right path, as the idea is good! This project looks very adequate to apply an agile metholody and develop the tool with the stakeholders, creating the new funcionalities in each sprint and validating with them. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Very vague experience and only one person apparently committed. It would be nice to se how the proposer is active in cardano community to validate its knowledge in this world and what is his graduation background to see where he needs to complement the team (if its a dev background he'll probably need a person with business experience and vice-versa). Linkedin links or any other reference to verify team information are always appreciated!\r\n\r\nIn regard to the plan, it exists and is time-framed but its too poor in details. Its necessary to see all the steps in development of the tool/platform, its validation/test in a pilot and its roll out plan, linked to the communication and business plan.\r\n\r\nThe budget breakdown is simple but as it seems to pay only for working hours of 3 weeks its fine.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are some milestones that could be taken from the plan its too little.
