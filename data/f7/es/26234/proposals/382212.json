The proposer mentioned that they will bring on cardano proposers to introduce their projects to the community, but will this bring in new community members? It seems that this project would appeal mostly to existing cardano community members who are interested in hearing about the Chinese perspective.

For example, why is Chinese market news (seemingly unrelated to cardano or even cryptocurrency) included as one of the big selling points of this proposal? I don't see how Chinese news would encourage the formation of new catalyst teams. Another concern I have is that the budget of this proposal seems to be pretty high given the content being produced.
