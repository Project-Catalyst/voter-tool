Desde el principio, el planteamiento del problema no es tal, lo que ya establece el tono negativo. Hay numerosas menciones sobre la ca\u00edda de este evento, la transmisi\u00f3n en vivo del evento, el uso de una agencia de marketing de resultados, un equipo de compromiso con la comunidad, una asociaci\u00f3n de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n de renombre, etc., pero todas estas son acciones realizadas por la Direcci\u00f3n de Eventos. No hay un objetivo claro por parte del proponente sobre lo que su participaci\u00f3n en este evento se traducir\u00e1, por ejemplo, la cobertura de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, las menciones de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, los visitantes proyectados para el stand, la conversi\u00f3n de clientes potenciales, la participaci\u00f3n en las redes sociales, etc., y c\u00f3mo todo eso se vincular\u00eda a los objetivos del desaf\u00edo. Me habr\u00eda encantado ayudar a formular esta propuesta y me habr\u00eda gustado conocerla antes, pero desgraciadamente no puedo justificar mi sesgo personal para dar una calificaci\u00f3n superior a 3 estrellas. 3 estrellas puede parecer mucho, pero por experiencia personal, formar parte de una exposici\u00f3n importante puede aumentar considerablemente el conocimiento de la marca, en este caso la marca del Ecosistema de Juego de Cardano, pero se necesitar\u00e1n muchas herramientas de compromiso para conseguirlo. Se recomienda consultar con Catalyst School sobre c\u00f3mo formular una propuesta impactante la pr\u00f3xima vez.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A partir de los breves datos aportados por el proponente sobre su experiencia y credenciales, sabiendo qui\u00e9nes son antes, no hay duda de que pueden cumplir con el desarrollo de un juego. Esto quiz\u00e1 no se corresponda con lo que proponen ahora, que es celebrar un evento en una gran exposici\u00f3n. No se menciona qui\u00e9n se encargar\u00e1 de las operaciones del stand. Tampoco hay un plan claro de lo que ocurrir\u00e1 durante la duraci\u00f3n del stand, cu\u00e1l es su plan de compromiso, qu\u00e9 materiales de marketing se utilizar\u00e1n para presentar el Ecosistema de Juego Cardano, qui\u00e9n cubrir\u00e1 el coste del compromiso y el plan de marketing, etc. Aunque se menciona el presupuesto necesario, los detalles sobre el uso de ese presupuesto, por alguna raz\u00f3n, se colocan en la secci\u00f3n de comentarios. Seg\u00fan las cifras disponibles, la mayor parte del presupuesto se destina a la producci\u00f3n del stand. Desgraciadamente, no hay un calendario claro de cu\u00e1ndo deben empezar a ejecutarse las cosas, por ejemplo, empezando por las acciones m\u00e1s sencillas, como la impresi\u00f3n del material de marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Si se pone fuera de contexto, y se centra en el uso del presupuesto para la producci\u00f3n del stand, esta propuesta es muy auditable, pero hay objetivos de este Desaf\u00edo que deben cumplirse y, en el mejor de los casos, suele ser muy dif\u00edcil auditar una participaci\u00f3n en cualquier exposici\u00f3n. Y mucho menos en el caso de que no haya planes de acci\u00f3n claros durante la duraci\u00f3n de la participaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, esto puede evitarse en el futuro si se coordina con la Escuela Catalizadora la forma de formular una propuesta. Empezando por el planteamiento del problema y la soluci\u00f3n, que en esta propuesta tambi\u00e9n es deficiente.

This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs. It could then act as a pilot exhibition & proposers could then come back in a future fund with 'proof' and arrange a much larger event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides a decent outline of a plan but it is not easy to understand.\r\nA simple presentation would have helped showing how activities, resources and funds  are aligned.\r\nThe $15k is not broken down so it is impossible to work out how its going to be spent.\r\nThe proposers could really help themselves by adding their LinkedIn profiles or evidence of their experience in this area.\r\n\r\ni hope the proposer takes onboard these comments in a positive light and returns with a more coherent proposal or uses the comments section or ideafest to provide clarity on the questions answered.

Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.
