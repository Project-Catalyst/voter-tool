Desgraciadamente, no me sent\u00ed muy seguro de que el lugar elegido para promover estos encuentros -Ucrania- sea realmente un punto estrat\u00e9gico en el que invertir en ese momento. El autor afirma haber escuchado a algunas personas hablar sobre el mundo de la criptograf\u00eda en un bar, pero eso no es suficiente para argumentar que es un escenario clave para invertir una alta cuota de financiaci\u00f3n y tener un ambicioso plan para visitar 20 ciudades diferentes. Creo que fue demasiado, ser\u00eda interesante que el autor nos proporcionara m\u00e1s datos e investigaciones sobre Ucrania, si la gente all\u00ed tiene alg\u00fan tipo de apertura para la inversi\u00f3n en el mundo criptogr\u00e1fico, si es un lugar de tradici\u00f3n por parte de la tecnolog\u00eda, c\u00f3mo es la cultura local, ese tipo de cosas. En otras propuestas con objetivos similares, es decir, invertir espec\u00edficamente en un pa\u00eds, hab\u00eda este tipo de argumentos, que son muy importantes para que la gente de fuera del pa\u00eds en cuesti\u00f3n entienda y conf\u00ede en el valor real de trabajar all\u00ed. Otra cuesti\u00f3n que me pareci\u00f3 es que el autor no tiene muy bien definido c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan estas reuniones, es decir, si \u00e9l ser\u00eda el \u00fanico que presentar\u00eda, cu\u00e1l ser\u00eda el contenido exacto de cada reuni\u00f3n, a qu\u00e9 p\u00fablico se llegar\u00eda... Nos da una estimaci\u00f3n de entre 20 y 50 personas, pero no hay ninguna garant\u00eda de que esto sea as\u00ed, y \u00bfrealmente vale la pena la inversi\u00f3n de 650 d\u00f3lares para un grupo de 20 personas que ni siquiera sabemos si est\u00e1n dispuestas y preinteresadas en entrar en nuestra comunidad? En resumen, creo que s\u00ed, que hay posibilidades de que esta propuesta tenga un impacto positivo, pero falt\u00f3 m\u00e1s certeza de por qu\u00e9 es bueno invertir en Ucrania y una noci\u00f3n m\u00e1s s\u00f3lida de c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan estos encuentros.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "El autor de la propuesta nos proporciona poca informaci\u00f3n sobre s\u00ed mismo.

Si tuviera una propuesta financiada en el fondo 6, \u00bfcu\u00e1l? \u00bfQu\u00e9 empresa est\u00e1 desarrollando en nuestra blockchain?

Hay que pensar en varias cosas, creo que no es un trabajo para una sola persona.

Dice estar interesado en convocar a personas involucradas en la localidad para que den sus declaraciones y se sumen en las reuniones, pero ser\u00eda importante que nos presentara algunos nombres que pretende invitar, para que podamos empezar a visualizar c\u00f3mo se desarrollar\u00edan las cosas. En cuanto al reparto financiero, necesitar\u00eda profundizar en qu\u00e9 se utilizar\u00eda cada cuota de 650 d\u00f3lares. Cita algunas posibilidades, pero lo ideal es proporcionarnos un plan definitivo, no s\u00f3lo intenciones. Cu\u00e1nto se destinar\u00eda a la cosa dentro de estos plazos. Y adem\u00e1s, me parece un poco exagerado ya querer ir a 20 ciudades de golpe, ser\u00eda m\u00e1s plausible que promoviera estos eventos en un n\u00famero menor de ciudades, las principales, digamos, podr\u00edan ser unas 5, y dependiendo del feedback seguir\u00eda con su viaje.

Besides, I love offline events in cities like this. It is very easy to connect and interact with the participants to create positive results.\r\nI really like this idea, but the problem is that the proposal still doesn't have specific targets on how many people will participate in Cardano activities such as: number of new proposals, Number of registered wallets, Amount of registered ADA, Number of votes,.... to show how much impact the proposal has had on Cardano and its participants.\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"The proposer has 5 years experience in the blockchain.

There is no clear metric on how this planned community event increases proposal participation, voter education, CA/vCA introduction and how it will increase participation in the community event itself. It seems to hinge on the proposers capability of presentation with no clear syllabus, whether that be the presentation material, method of presenting, method on creating the event, method on marketing the event and if even offline events such as this can be conducted under covid situations.

Having no clarity in the use of budget can raise questions such as; Poltava and Kharkiv are only 2 hours apart, 'Would it not be more effective to cover those 2 cities in one day?'
