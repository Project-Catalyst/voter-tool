The proposal aims to educate about 2,000 tertiary and high school students in northern Ghana through conferences and workshop on Cardano and its benefits.  The proposal is well written and easy to understand by the voters.  This feels like  a good use of Treasury funds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is very likely to succeed as its backed by a highly experienced team. in addition, evidence of successfully holding similar events in the past has been provided. The proposal does not mention what the roles of the team members are and how the funds been allocated. This information would have elevated the proposal. \r\nThe cost seems excessive for a project of 3 months.  Also the price of $4,500 for t-shirts also seems excessive, having worked in merchandising with the Far East for 30+ years, $4,500 can buy you lots of stuff.  The proposer should be clear on how many t-shirts they will get.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics and success criteria are clear but some should be made more specific eg. Percentage of students that become active CAs.  A more specific metric would be for 1,000 students a 10%(?) conversion to CAs.\r\nKudos to the proposer for highlighting the risk of Covid by delivering online.  However, for completeness more information should be provided on what happens to the unused funds of around $15,000 that has been allocated for Transportation, feeding, accommodation of Resource persons, refreshments, conference space in this scenario.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_774", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is one of the better proposals I have come across so far.

The budget is broken down nicely and seems achievable to reach the set goals. He has a detailed implementation plan, road map and evaluation plan. He discusses challenges that might come up and possible solutions. It is clear to me that the proposer has a clear vision and knows that there might be challenges.
