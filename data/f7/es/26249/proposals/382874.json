There is bound to be substantial risks in implementation regarding the availability of the recycling industry and movement of waste to the recycling plant.

In addition to this, I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal presents an excellent approach to tackling several interconnected problems: Sustainability, waste and economy, and also concrete problematics like waste beeing illegaly shipped to Ghana. This proposal approaches these problems by generating a genuine approach that connects blockchain, the SDGs and a feasible solution. Really well done. It excellently matches the challenge. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.
