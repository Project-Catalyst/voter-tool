Aparte de eso, he sido un jugador toda mi vida y tambi\u00e9n he trabajado como probador de juegos, as\u00ed que s\u00e9 un poco sobre la industria.\nAunque el planteamiento del problema no identifica tanto un problema como se\u00f1ala algunas cosas que gustan a los jugadores, podemos entender que la propuesta pretende crear un juego Free to play y Play to earn que dar\u00eda a los jugadores mucho control sobre sus activos en el juego, les permitir\u00eda ganar NFT y tambi\u00e9n donar a la caridad. Como comentario para el proponente sobre esta parte: si utiliza acr\u00f3nimos en la declaraci\u00f3n inicial de la propuesta, explique lo que significan los t\u00e9rminos poco despu\u00e9s. No esperes que los votantes conozcan estos t\u00e9rminos, ya que muchos de ellos no ser\u00e1n jugadores y algunos no tendr\u00e1n, en general, muchos conocimientos de tecnolog\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s, m\u00e1s adelante en la propuesta, se menciona que los fondos aqu\u00ed son necesarios para crear el MVP del juego. En mi opini\u00f3n, esto deber\u00eda haberse mencionado en la soluci\u00f3n, para no confundir a la gente pensando que el resultado esperado es el juego completo.\nEl resumen del proyecto, tal y como se describe en la secci\u00f3n de descripci\u00f3n del juego, es que ser\u00e1 un juego de cartas de ajedrez de tipo battle royale (v\u00e9ase Might & Magic Chess Royale para comparar), en el que las personas juegan unas contra otras para ganar XP (no se detalla el uso de la XP), oro pirata (que se puede utilizar para comprar cofres en el juego, que, cuando se abren, te dan una combinaci\u00f3n de fichas WOPRace, cartas NFT u otros activos del juego). Por lo que tengo entendido, estos tokens ser\u00e1n utilizados por mis jugadores, junto con los tokens WOP (que s\u00f3lo se pueden comprar con ADA / fiat) para luego votar sobre la direcci\u00f3n del juego en el DAO que se establecer\u00e1 m\u00e1s adelante. Los desarrolladores tambi\u00e9n planean hacer este juego compatible con AR para ser jugado en el exterior con los tel\u00e9fonos.\nEstoy de acuerdo en que esta propuesta aborda efectivamente el desaf\u00edo, ya que lo que estamos buscando aqu\u00ed son buenos juegos para traer a la gente en el ecosistema Cardano. Sin embargo, no puedo dar 5 estrellas porque la propuesta no ha hablado de cu\u00e1les son las m\u00e9tricas de \u00e9xito, ni c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1 exactamente el MVP y cu\u00e1les son los planes para escalar en el futuro. Hay algunas palabras en el libro blanco sobre la sostenibilidad a largo plazo, pero se centran en el hecho de que el juego es Free to Play y son bastante vagas. Habr\u00eda esperado ver proyecciones concretas para los siguientes meses / a\u00f1os.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "El proponente ha proporcionado un enlace a la p\u00e1gina web del proyecto (https://worldofpirates.io), pero est\u00e1 algo vac\u00edo, la verdad. Los nombres y funciones de los 5 miembros del equipo se pueden ver en la secci\u00f3n de la tripulaci\u00f3n (/contacto), pero no proporcionan ninguna informaci\u00f3n que no se mencione ya en la propuesta (funci\u00f3n y experiencia anterior). Intenta a\u00f1adir algunos enlaces sociales en el futuro, por favor, para que cualquiera pueda verificar que son personas reales f\u00e1cilmente. Me entristece decir que personalmente denunci\u00e9 una propuesta diferente aqu\u00ed en Ideascale, porque afirmaba que algunas personas trabajaban para ellos y no era as\u00ed (me puse en contacto con ellos en LinkedIn y lo confirmaron).\nAparte de esto, otra parte importante que falta es la informaci\u00f3n sobre c\u00f3mo se completar\u00e1 este proyecto. No tenemos una hoja de ruta paso a paso, ni un calendario con los resultados esperados despu\u00e9s de 3-6-12 meses. Tenga en cuenta que la p\u00e1gina https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap que usted se\u00f1ala est\u00e1 en blanco. Tambi\u00e9n mencionas que has vendido algunos NFT y los has donado a una organizaci\u00f3n ben\u00e9fica, pero el enlace que se\u00f1alas para obtener detalles tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 en blanco: https://www.worldofpirates.io/potm.\nLa falta de toda esta informaci\u00f3n que he presentado anteriormente, as\u00ed como la ausencia de menci\u00f3n de posibles riesgos o impedimentos para el proyecto disminuye gravemente mi confianza en la viabilidad del proyecto.\nLa \u00fanica parte que tiene un poco m\u00e1s de detalles es el presupuesto, que est\u00e1 calculado para los siguientes 3 meses (el tiempo que los proponentes consideran que les llevar\u00e1 crear el MVP). Las cifras parecen bastante cre\u00edbles, aunque un poco elevadas (4.000 d\u00f3lares al mes por desarrollador y 3.000 al mes por vendedor, lo que supone un total de 53.000 d\u00f3lares en salarios, mientras que s\u00f3lo se estiman 1.200 d\u00f3lares en costes de publicidad). Despu\u00e9s de sumar tambi\u00e9n los costes con la infraestructura, el total asciende a 60.000 d\u00f3lares. De nuevo, son cifras cre\u00edbles, pero un poco elevadas en mi opini\u00f3n para un proyecto indie que quiere empezar. Entiendo que la gente del equipo tiene mucha experiencia, pero tal vez quieras considerar buscar fuentes de financiaci\u00f3n adicionales tambi\u00e9n, ya que no estoy seguro de que Catalyst por s\u00ed solo pueda cubrir todo lo que necesitas de fondo a fondo.\nPara recapitular la viabilidad, los proponentes no proporcionaron enlaces para verificar la experiencia del equipo, varios enlaces en su sitio al que se refieren son s\u00f3lo p\u00e1ginas en blanco, no hay hoja de ruta o plazos, excepto por la menci\u00f3n de que el MVP tomar\u00e1 3 meses para completar y me parece que el presupuesto es bastante alto para una cantidad tan corta de tiempo para un proyecto indie. Bas\u00e1ndome en los datos anteriores, no estoy de acuerdo en que esta propuesta tenga posibilidades de llevarse a cabo con \u00e9xito.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Como se ha descrito anteriormente, la propuesta es lo suficientemente clara en el sentido de que quiere crear un MVP para un juego de cartas de ajedrez de tipo battle royale Free to Play, pero le faltan muchos detalles sobre c\u00f3mo lo har\u00e1. En el futuro, por favor, a\u00f1ada detalles sobre cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 el enfoque y cu\u00e1les son los entregables en determinados intervalos (trate de pensar en una l\u00ednea de tiempo para su proyecto con hitos para las marcas de 3, 6 y 12 meses). Adem\u00e1s, para que los proyectos sean auditables, se necesitan indicadores clave de progreso m\u00e1s detallados. Por el momento, la propuesta s\u00f3lo menciona que despu\u00e9s de poner en marcha tus p\u00e1ginas sociales el 04.12.2021, conseguiste 300 miembros en Discord, 100 seguidores en Twitter, etc., pero Project Catalyst necesita poder seguir tu progreso en el futuro. Para ello, habr\u00eda sido \u00fatil establecer objetivos claros, como por ejemplo \"1000 seguidores en Twitter despu\u00e9s de un mes de la primera campa\u00f1a publicitaria, 60% de NFT's acu\u00f1ados vendidos despu\u00e9s del lanzamiento del MVP, un video de youtube por mes que siga la actualizaci\u00f3n del proyecto, etc\".\nEn resumen, esta propuesta tiene mucha ambici\u00f3n, parece bastante claro en el libro blanco que el equipo ha puesto mucho esfuerzo en esta idea y creo que si logran poner en marcha la bola de nieve tienen una oportunidad de \u00e9xito, pero faltan muchas piezas importantes de informaci\u00f3n que Catalyst necesita, como he se\u00f1alado anteriormente.\nPor el momento, no estoy ni de acuerdo ni en desacuerdo con que la informaci\u00f3n aqu\u00ed presente sea suficiente para auditar el \u00e9xito de la propuesta.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 15, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Overall, this proposal addresses the challenge posed.

About our website, we currently focus on the characters, universe and the NFT part, but the website is a creature itself and it will evolve in the next months once we will focus more on the game MVP and next versions this will be reflected in the website too."}, {"q0": "This proposal is very well presented both in ideascale and in the recent ideafest presentation. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the theme and gameplay through Free and Pay-2-earn scenarios, but also how best to utilise the blockchain functionality , incorporating NFT trading, NFT creation & an off chain DAO for artists. There are multiple avenues into this game so should appeal to a large demographic thus aligning with the key objectives of the challenge. More user, transitions, games on Cardano.\nInterest is already being shown. 100 twitter followers quite in the proposal, this is now pass 300.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap on the website is great and provides very high level view of the next two years. However for this specific proposal, which is developing an MVP, it is not particularly clear what the steps involved are to achieve the MVP. The proposal really needs a plan vs budget vs deliverables vs milestones to provide confidence in feasibility. At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date. This is a simple fix for the proposer, they need to due the due diligence on feasibility and i would suggest they reach out to a project manager/mentor to help with future proposals or presentations to a VC.\nA number of people are named in the proposal but it is not clear if these are actually going to be part of the delivery team. In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month. These are sensible assuming the named resource are simply taking this as their permanent salary and they do not need to engage contract resource which could cost significantly more.\nOn the basis of what i have seen from the ideafest video only have confidence to give this 3 stars.\nThere is a note about recruiting marketing and sales people. This is also a key risk to the project. Mitigation is either a very steep learning curve for the current team or a potential increase in costs if they need to engage a 3rd party organisation to help for example.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is difficult to assess as not key metrics or KPI's are given.

There's a clear way to add value to the cardano ecosystem through leveraging NFTs and the blockchain integration into the game. I love that this project has well through out KPIs and metrics. That's something I'm missing in some of the other proposals. The team has thought about possible future challenges and how to overcome them and is listening to what the community has to say. To be honest, I don't see anything missing from this proposal. I think it's a great idea with a great team behind it to back it up.  As a developer, I don't see any issues with the team credentials.

All resources linked in the proposal are relevant and further explain details like how the future process and charity work will be done. The idea is to have royalties from the NFT sales got to charity which is noble.

It is quite complete, both in terms of content and design. We have a lot of information about the project, and we can get to know it in an attractive way. Now talking about the idea itself: this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities. As a bonus, we could still meet one of Cardano's general objectives, which is to promote sustainability, through the donations made (the authors attach a link that is specifically about this, through which we can better understand this part of the donations).

This did not make me understand the real experience of the group, that is, how old each one is, and in which areas, etc. It is positive, however, that they already have their developers in Plutus, because from what I've noticed many proposals need these professionals but will still hire them. The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training. The linkedin profiles were also linked, in the end of the proposal. It is also positive how they leave open the possibility of hiring freelancers for design and storytelling areas. That is, in relation to the team, I believe that everything is in order (I was just confused by this story of 80 years of experience). The money asked for funding is also explained very adequately; we know what each small fraction would correspond to for the execution of the project, even though it is a high value (60k) it is quite understandable for the many people who would work here and also the various activities that would take place. It is a large and complex project. The roadmap is attached on a website (https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap), I loved the graphic way they organized the steps, really creative and gives us a good understanding of what would be done and in what order.
