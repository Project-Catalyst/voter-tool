The budget is reasonable and clearly shown, broken down into identifiable items and with that budget the project will be able to be realized. The team has developed a detailed implementable plan and details of actionable tasks and order of execution are clearly presented with real time within the work will be completed. In the proposal they didn't list the resources needed to carry out this project but we have a presentation of the technical aspects needed to implement the whole idea. It would be good to have an idea of the possible risks and how to overcome those risks.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is well presented in this proposal and KPIs make sense and can be used to quantify the success of the project.

The roadmap is well estimated in my opinion, the terms seem concrete, the team is well trained and multidisciplinary in the gaming area. The budget is clear and reasonable to achieve the objectives set, however it is not divided by areas (eg DevOps, Development, Design, Marketing, ..), doing this would certainly help to better outline the costs, perhaps even dividing them by phases.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Everything is concise and to the point. The need is clear, implementation is already promising. There's enough information about the team and metrics which would help the effective tracking of their progress by the Project Catalyst community.
