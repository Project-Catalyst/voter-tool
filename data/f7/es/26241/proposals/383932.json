Hence this challenge. The proposal has come up with an entertaining gaming idea with good business model and the detailed game phases  are very simple to understand, and has a good story line attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe game mechanics are further well explained that How play to earn will work for this game, and integrating NFT items is just about how any play to earn games are attracting more and more gamers.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience of the proposal team is very good and in sync with the implementation domain of the proposed idea. All the team members details are presented (with linked in profiles) and additionally the pictures and details can also be found on the game website.\r\n\r\nThe game website is already updated with latest updates and contact information, and being a senior developer myself I can confirm that team experience is very good to achieve implementation of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe budget allocation is done hourly basis and this makes it easier to justify the overall budget that is asked for. Each hourly rate is associated with the subdomain of this proposal e.g. art, design, development, animation etc.\r\n\r\nThe plan is very well outlined,  quarterly distribution of feature sets is point wise given. This is very easy to map to where proposer wants to take proposal in 3-6-9 months.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i fully agree that plan and experience presented makes it highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I like it very much that a separate section on audit-ability is given. Furthermore, this section is divided with where additional catalyst funding resources will be used for.\r\n\r\nThis clarifies a well thought out plan and community can be sure that the budget is well spent. This also gives an opportunity to the community that this project can be tracked well across different stages of this proposal implementation.\r\n\r\nThe risks associate with this proposal are also given in details, which most of the proposals forget or miss out on. This makes community well aware of what can be expected (if something does not happen as per timelines given). The team also has given good section as solution to the risks associated, and furthermore added good section of KPIs, that are giving a good impression on how the success of this proposal will be measured.

This game genre is simple-to-play but can be like a whirlpool that players can't escape when start to play with it.
