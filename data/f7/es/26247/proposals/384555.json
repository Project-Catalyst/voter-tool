The proposal aims to gather all this data in a data hub to make it easily accessible in one place. What is nearly unmentioned in the proposal, apart from making this data available to 'machine learning', is a link with SingularityNet. The presented plan is to store all this on an infrastructure of servers, which is a rather centralised solution. So if the solution were to utilise a protocol from the SingularityNet ecosystem (NuNet?) it would have fit the challenge better. So in short; great idea, wrong challenge or challenge link missing in the proposal. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Both proposers are very well placed to develop a data hub. The requested budget, although broken down by role, is not made clear through time. It covers the first 3 months of development and 6 months of infrqstructure cost, but it hasn't been made clear how long development would take in total and how the project would fund itsself when up and running. A roadmap would solve this issue and improve the proposal greatly.

It also doesn't hold some key elements that could make this proposal great with minimal effort. It needs a roadmap to determine the cost. It needs to point out where SingularityNet could come in and be applicable. It needs a risk assessment as the data would be stored on servers. For example; what would happen if the servers are down?

The GitHub repository provides some evidence that proposal team is familiar with what is required to implement this proposal.
