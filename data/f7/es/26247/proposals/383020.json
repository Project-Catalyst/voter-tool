The tokenomics aspect is a complex discussion, but in short, as in the inner layers of the AGIX token, agents communicate via metadata and reward job completion in micropayments. AI & ML exist throughout our SWARM, we train constantly to keep up with new scams (we actually did this all day today using OCR implementations with various funny results). We will also be integrating OpenAI shortly, as they have added a cool new live web search tool which is very useful for returning fast answers for communities, live. \nUnfortunately, most of our team didn't want to share private information but yes we have some people associated with \"the singularity\". One of whom wanted it known he was also handsome.\nFeasibility is one thing we are 110% absolutely proving to ourselves and in our test groups. We want to make chat groups a scammer-free environment, which of course is impossible given human nature.
