Lets make a new social media platform where people control what they get advertised by stated preferences. These could even include don't show me adds that are also marketed on divisive content. Awesome idea, would love to see it happen. \r\nThe proposal itself is much smaller however. It is to implement a ranking algorithm and test it in simulation. No details are given of the simulation. Therein lies the rub. Without testing on real world data, its hard to know if the algorithm achieves anything. Its relatively easy to solve for a desired outcome in a simulation you designed. I'd love to see this somehow applied to real world data. Even if its  a prototype application with a smaller set of real users interacting with it. Maybe it could be something that Singularity net uses to manage its interactions with the wider community in collaboration with (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Semi-public-collaboration-platform/383792-48088)\r\n\r\nIts an important problem, but 49k to implement an algorithm which the author states they already heave and test it in simulation and write up a report seems expensive.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has the experience and claims it is implementing works she has already done so there is no reason to doubt she would be able to deliver the roadmap outlined.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We can audit delivery of items which match the descriptions in the road map. However there are no details of the simulation environment within which the algorithms are to be tested. Thus measuring how successful these algorithms are, if to be deployed to the real world, which is what really matters, is not possible. \r\nThe definitions of success given, are more definitions of delivering something. I would like to see some metrics and goals stated which show what would be success and thus what would be failure, for the simulation of the algorithm. If we allow this to be defined after the experiment, we cannot really evaluate success.

In this particular case, the proposal implies heavy censorship on a social media platform, specifically designed to censor divisive material, which is subjective. Who would decide which content is classified as divisive and which is not? Current polarisation in society is a symptom, not a cause and as a blockchain aspiring to become full open source, it should remain as objective as possible. To that respect, the idea would be more compatible with this blockchain's philosophy if it were a social media platform without the censoring aspect. So an alternative could be a social media platform with an advertising filter that the user can define. As a social media user myself, that part could certainly have some future, but please uphold the internet's status as the last free medium. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The github implies a team of 6 people who contributed to the project's simulation. The proposal only lists 2 people, one which doesn't correspond with the names on the github. So it is not entirely clear who is in the team and what their function is. The github-content is elaborate and looks professional, so the technical capabilities seem to be adequate to develop this. There is mention of previous collaboration with the USDOD. What I am kind of missing to fully determine feasibility properly is how the platform would be marketed. Why would society opt for your platform and how would you 'sell' it to people? ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The plan is an elaborate description of the idea presented and the text is pretty well formatted. The github-attachment is a plus to get an idea of the team's capabilities.

In the solution, the proposer states he wants to build a social media platform but if you look at the plan itself he wants to build everything that involves a social media platform, such as market ad ranking system, social media algorithms, and an online monitor of information. Since blockchain technology is open source and decentralized how does this fit in this ideology? The proposer wants to build tools against polarization build reading through the proposal it feels like the tools he wants to build will be censoring a media platform which is not an incentive we want to bring forth. I'll leave this neutral because I might be in the wrong.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Concerning the team, we get a LinkedIn page of the proposer himself. What we are missing however is the rest of the team. When we look at the website provided (GitHub) we get 6 team members from which we get no information. I could find one correlation between GitHub and the Key Management on Rejuve in these team members. This still leaves 4 unknown members.

This is a good area for Cardano and SingularityNet to be exploring.\r\n\r\nHowever, this proposal is not clear about how AI will be used to do that. The initial description seems to suggest that the key approach is that advertising will be shown based upon stated preferences, which may not require AI. Later on, the proposal states that it will apply \"AI monitoring of blockchain's distributed ledger and AI monitoring of social media algorithms for social effects like social coherence and polarization\".\r\n\r\nGiven this lack of clarity as to means, I agree but do not strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal identifies three tasks, which are focused on the ad-ranking model rather than the broader AI tasks defined elsewhere. However, these tasks are not defined with much precision -- for example, how will the \"social simulation\" to test the model be built? One would think this would either need to occur on large human scale or involve a very sophisticated machine simulation. Accordingly, and related to the lack of clarity on means that is mentioned in the impact assessment above, it is difficult to assess whether it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n\r\nRelated, it appears clear from observing the social media market that the problem of polarization is largely drive by large social media platforms (especially FB/Meta) prioritizing engagement over all other metrics. We know how to fix that technically, but the financial incentives go against implementing the fix. Given that the challenge appears more economic than technical, my view is that we must be quite precise on proposed solutions before spending technical effort developing them.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I neither agree nor disagree that this plan is highly likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project defines clear deliverables for 3, 6 and 12 months, although these are subject to the limited specificity mentioned above.

The proposal describes the challenge in great detail and proposed a solution which integrates several pieces developed by the expert along decades of successful hard work. \r\n\r\nThere is one big caveat however - which is not clarified in the proposal - namely if the solution will be implemented on the Cardano blockchain or on the current infrastructure which SingularityNET uses for their platform, namely the Ethereum blockchain. \r\n\r\nIf successful this work has the potential to revolutionize social networks and make then useful for a series of high impact applications, such as in Government (homeland security, defense, etc) as well as in education and for personal social use.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have no doubt that given the extensive experience of the proposer, including in deploying systems with the Department of Defence, this proposal can be successfully implemented as planned.
