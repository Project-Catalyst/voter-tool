Regardless, we are missing some relevant skills regarding AI, the proposer does not state he has knowledge of AI. Does he still need to search for a team member or not?

It is also not realistic to teach \"AI service development from start to finish\" -- this is a huge topic, and more focus is needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, given the proposal to reserve $50K of the budget for prizes in the hackathon, one would expect a lot more detail about the hackathon -- e.g. goals, process, prize structure, etc.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer states that he is a teacher and hackathon participant, which is relevant to delivery.
