Incentivizing an algorithm when it gets thins right sounds like reinforcement learning, however this is not mentioned. Please present more detail on you algorithm. More importantly, even if it works, what is the output. Is it a trading strategy people can follow? A portfolio they can mimic?\r\n\r\nIt seems they want to produce something that will predict BTC and ETH future price movements, but they have no presented a concrete plan on how they intend to go about it.\r\n\r\nPrice predication in financial markets is the holy grail.

How would people use it. What are the outputs? How is the algorithm trained. Are you just running it slowly going forward, in which case you will never get convergence, or are you training on batches of historical data?\r\n\r\nThere is just not enough details on the algorithm or the product to be delivered from it. If you had an algorithm that worked already, why would you need $10k? You would quickly earn that much using it. \r\n\r\nI have a good understanding of what is required here having both been a trader at a large investment bank and having a PhD in machine learning.

The funding request is meant for the sole purpose of creating the algorithm to connect to Nami. As a SingularityDAO-investor, I can't help but ask myself why the proposer's GRISE-token would be a better option than the upcoming dynasets as activity in the token data seems to be quite low. So for this reason I can't see a potential impact exceeding a minimal status. Perhaps a collaboration could come into reality to create a partnership with Nami.

If it's an algorithm it can just run on a server - are the economics not profitable or by incentivisation do you mean it requires human inputs into the algorithm? In either scenario the incentives and model needs to be better explained so a community advisor can understand the impact of what you're trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe proposal needs refining to much more clearly define the problems, current market and their solution.
