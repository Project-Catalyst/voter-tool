The recent partnership with SingularityNet creates an opportunity to incorporate AI in these processes, potentially automating part of the current workload.

The proposer has made clear that thir will require some elaboration as the project evolves. Eventhough there is a lot written to explain what the plan is, it remains very open and somewhat vague. To improve this, there should be more concrete details on how the current processes might be improved by the use of AI and augmentation of current ecosystem roles.

This could mean a faster workflow, better development of Catalyst, overall a better structure. The proposer has no idea yet how this would come to fruition but is proposing to do the work that is asked of him.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because the proposer is focusing on Catalyst this assures him of work, we are a project that is constantly in development of improving itself. Look at the challenges in this fund, we have a channel about SN and a challenge about COTI, we are constantly evolving and the need for data analysis and AI is becoming apparent. What I fail to find in the proposal is how would the proposer announce his guidance? He states that there is interest from CA Tooling and Gimbalabs but further than that we see no evidence of transparency.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since this proposal is something entirely different than other proposals we don't really have a roadmap.

Therefore, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer seems to have relevant expertise and a strong desire to do work in the Catalyst community, so if this were funded (e.g. if unlike me others think this is a good idea) there is reason to believe that it would be delivered successfully.

This is highly measurable. However, there is no way to know in advance on what types of projects advice would be given, so further metrics are not available.
