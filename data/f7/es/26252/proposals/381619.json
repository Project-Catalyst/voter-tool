La diferencia es que en esta propuesta, esto se har\u00eda a trav\u00e9s de una entrevista, con un tiempo est\u00e1ndar de 3 a 5 minutos, lo cual es muy positivo porque no servir\u00eda de nada cambiar la lectura de una propuesta (que suele llevar tiempo) por un video largo . Tambi\u00e9n es interesante c\u00f3mo este proyecto \"igualar\u00eda\" el nivel de comunicaci\u00f3n entre los proponentes y los lectores, porque algunas propuestas est\u00e1n mejor escritas, son m\u00e1s detalladas y m\u00e1s sencillas de entender, mientras que otras son un poco confusas o demasiado t\u00e9cnicas. Por supuesto, la entrevista ser\u00eda diferente seg\u00fan el entrevistado, pero al menos las preguntas ser\u00edan similares, de acuerdo con lo que se propone, aportando as\u00ed una cierta estandarizaci\u00f3n de los v\u00eddeos. Me ha gustado mucho. S\u00f3lo me gustar\u00eda hacer una observaci\u00f3n: el autor repite algunos p\u00e1rrafos en la propuesta, en la parte de la introducci\u00f3n y en la parte del impacto, hay varias cosas similares, no s\u00e9 si fue intencional o por descuido. Y sobre el cumplimiento del reto, esto sucede desde el momento en que las entrevistas ser\u00edan traducidas a otros idiomas, contemplando el objetivo de llevar el contenido del ecosistema Cardano a los no angloparlantes. Espero sinceramente que esta propuesta sea financiada.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "La autora ya prepar\u00f3 un video haciendo lo que se har\u00eda en las otras propuestas, me pareci\u00f3 que tiene un gran nivel de comunicaci\u00f3n y logr\u00f3 transmitir lo que se prometi\u00f3 en el video, es decir, conocimiento general sobre la propuesta y tambi\u00e9n sobre la autora (muchas veces no podemos sentir que conocemos a la autora s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s del texto, \u00a1con un video ser\u00eda mejor!)

La autora afirma, en la \u00faltima parte de la propuesta, que necesitar\u00e1 formar un equipo para llevar a cabo el proyecto de forma positiva. Ser\u00eda mejor si ella ya tuviera algunas personas en mente, pienso en un editor, traductores para los idiomas seleccionados, alguien que se encargue de la promoci\u00f3n del canal en el momento previo a la votaci\u00f3n... Sobre un gui\u00f3n, no lo hay, creo que este proyecto es m\u00e1s sencillo en el sentido de no tener tantos pasos a desarrollar; aun as\u00ed ser\u00eda importante que ella los enumerara. Por ejemplo: 1) contactar con los proponentes 2) realizar la entrevista 3) edici\u00f3n del v\u00eddeo 4) subtitulado 5) difusi\u00f3n. En cuanto a la duraci\u00f3n de cada una, ech\u00e9 en falta un c\u00e1lculo m\u00e1s preciso del proceso. Y sobre la divisi\u00f3n financiera: existe y est\u00e1 muy detallada, pero algunos puntos me dejaron confundido. \u00bfQu\u00e9 ser\u00eda la Firma Doman? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la diferencia entre la suscripci\u00f3n a la editorial y la edici\u00f3n? En general: Creo que 1) el autor est\u00e1 bien preparado 2) ser\u00eda mejor si hubiera un equipo ya formado aqu\u00ed 3) el proyecto es sencillo de entender en parte del proceso, pero un gui\u00f3n siempre es bienvenido 4) algunos puntos de la divisi\u00f3n presupuestaria podr\u00edan ser mejor aclarados.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "La auditabilidad del proyecto es muy sencilla, s\u00f3lo hay que monitorizar el alcance de las entrevistas, siguiendo algunos KPIs que la autora establece, como n\u00famero de visualizaciones del v\u00eddeo, comentarios/interacciones, aumento de la participaci\u00f3n de los hablantes de las lenguas seleccionadas para su traducci\u00f3n en Catalyst, etc. . Creo que la propia autora podr\u00eda preparar una peque\u00f1a presentaci\u00f3n, en alg\u00fan ayuntamiento, a trav\u00e9s de la cual se pudieran mostrar estos resultados.

This enables greater acceptance and browsability of Catalyst. This would also enable more educated voters \r\n  Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  the number of videos, and the number of languges each will be translated into.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.\r\nProposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of interviews that are done and videos that are created. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and  among voters regarding various projects and give a benefit to proposers by enabling them to easily and effectively reach a larger audience than those who would be reading proposals.\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and do interviews , and put links to some of the videos/interviews  on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. Get some interviews published in local media of your country, whether social media or mass media, and share the published article or video link. That also adds lot of credibility\r\n \r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has   provided evidence  of herself  where her relevant skills and experience is clear since she is a moderator and Town Hall organizer.

Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as software and domain subscriptions, translators and  and other costs.   The budget is  very reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required.The timetable is realstic to carry out interviews and produce the videos. \r\nThe proposal  does  provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of steps needing to be completed for each finished video.\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.   \r\nThe proposal does not have technical aspects . The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal beyond the short time frame between submission of proposals to voting time.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.

There is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem . \r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have been identified by the proposer as the short time window available between the time the proposals are closed, and voting begins. The risk is that only a few videos would be completed which could give an unfair advantage to those who were interviewed. \r\n\r\n\r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe information provided is  somewhat sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence i have given a 4 star rating. \r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "GREAT IDEAS!

Having said all that however, there aren't any details regarding what are the team will consist of, other than telling us that the proposer 'will build a team after this'.
