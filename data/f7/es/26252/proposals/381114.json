La propuesta cumple muy bien el objetivo del reto de llevar contenidos del ecosistema Cardano a otros idiomas, y en este caso, al espa\u00f1ol, a trav\u00e9s de la traducci\u00f3n de varios contenidos de youtube, puestos a disposici\u00f3n en un canal que ya existe y que ya tiene un amplio alcance de p\u00fablico . Aqu\u00ed hay varios hechos positivos, empezando por el hecho de que el autor lleva mucho tiempo haciendo este trabajo y aportando beneficios a nuestra blockchain, tambi\u00e9n que el canal ya tiene mucha visibilidad, lo que acorta la etapa de promover una difusi\u00f3n intensa para que el dinero se financie, y tambi\u00e9n que el espa\u00f1ol es uno de los principales idiomas a trabajar para potenciar el alcance de Cardano.

Primero, porque ya tiene el canal de youtube con muchos v\u00eddeos, suscriptores y visualizaciones, como nos informa a trav\u00e9s de datos num\u00e9ricos. Luego, por el v\u00eddeo que adjunta, en el que demuestra que tiene mucha facilidad para comunicarse y un dominio total del idioma espa\u00f1ol.
