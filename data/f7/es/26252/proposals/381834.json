Me pareci\u00f3 una idea extremadamente buena, \u00a1en mi opini\u00f3n ser\u00eda perfecto que se hiciera en todos los idiomas! Porque como participante de dos fondos Catalyst, puedo asegurar que sufro de esta dolencia, no puedo seguir muy bien los Ayuntamientos, tanto porque suelo tener clases en la universidad a la hora que se emite (lo cual no es tanto problema , ya que se graban), pero sobre todo porque son en ingl\u00e9s. S\u00e9 leer, escribir y hablar ingl\u00e9s, pero entender una reuni\u00f3n entera en ese idioma, m\u00e1s el hecho de que la mayor\u00eda de los presentadores son nativos ingleses y por tanto tienen acento, hace muy dif\u00edcil seguir el contenido. Para los vietnamitas la situaci\u00f3n deber\u00eda ser similar, lo que hace que esta idea sea muy \u00fatil, mantenerse al d\u00eda de las principales actualizaciones del ecosistema es algo que todos los miembros de la comunidad deber\u00edan hacer, y sin duda esta propuesta har\u00e1 que esto sea m\u00e1s posible para los vietnamitas. Otro punto positivo que encontr\u00e9 aqu\u00ed fue que los autores ya tienen un proyecto financiado por f6, lo que demuestra que tienen competencia y experiencia con nuestro ecosistema y con Catalyst, y tambi\u00e9n es muy \u00fatil que ya tengan un sitio creado donde se podr\u00eda introducir este nuevo contenido.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "El equipo del proyecto demuestra estar muy bien preparado para llevarlo a cabo, ya que aportan una peque\u00f1a descripci\u00f3n individual de qui\u00e9nes son, que se resume en sus contactos en las redes sociales, haciendo real la posibilidad de contactar directamente y conocerlos mejor, y tambi\u00e9n el hecho de que ya tienen un proyecto que fue financiado en el f6. En cuanto al gui\u00f3n, presentan las fases que tendr\u00edan que completar para alcanzar sus objetivos, pero creo que estas fases podr\u00edan explorarse m\u00e1s. Por ejemplo, en la parte que presenta los res\u00famenes de los principales canales de comunicaci\u00f3n en Vietnam sobre Cardano: \u00bfc\u00f3mo se construir\u00eda este puente? \u00bfQu\u00e9 ser\u00eda el \"flujo de trabajo\" en la primera fase? Siempre es bueno explicar cada t\u00e9rmino en detalle, para que las personas que no est\u00e1n familiarizadas con \u00e9l entiendan bien la propuesta. En relaci\u00f3n con el presupuesto, creo que el nivel de detalle aqu\u00ed fue alto, y con ello, satisfactorio. Sabemos lo que costar\u00e1 cada parte del proyecto, y en cuanto a los costes variables, est\u00e1n muy bien calculados, desglosados y explicados para que podamos entender exactamente lo que ocurrir\u00eda aqu\u00ed. As\u00ed que creo que lo \u00fanico que sugerir\u00eda ser\u00eda un poco m\u00e1s de detalle en las fases.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Me pareci\u00f3 interesante la preocupaci\u00f3n del equipo por la auditabilidad. No s\u00f3lo se preocupan por transmitir informaci\u00f3n que ayude al resto de la comunidad a controlar el progreso del proyecto, sino que elaboraron un plan de aubitabilidad en el que controlar\u00edan el crecimiento del proyecto, seg\u00fan el n\u00famero de visitas al sitio. , oyentes del podcast, etc. De esta manera, lo \u00fanico que tendr\u00edamos que hacer es tener acceso a esa informaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n, que ellos generar\u00edan semanalmente, pero que podr\u00edan presentarnos mensualmente, o cada 2 meses, por ejemplo.

Another issue is that the meetings are held at a very inconvenient time of 1am (Vietnam Time). It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Vietnamese content for the people in Vietnam regarding Town Hall content.This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Vietnamese to understand everything about Cardano and the Town Hall content. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Town Hall meeting recordings. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Vietnamese. \r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have   provided evidence  of themselves where he is a managing the Eastern Town Hall activities  .

Clear costs have been given for the various hosting fees on platforms and marketing campaign costs as well as podcast apps.   The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 1500 USD to develop a website of this nature is too high. Text to speech convertors may not cost this much. The cost per video has been taken as 360-400 USD which is high for a video of this nature. Typically videos like this are not costed per word but per audio minute. As such a video like this may cost around 200 USD each.Labor cost has been taken as 60 USD per hour which is far too high even by Western standards, leave alone Vietnamese rates.  A Labor cost of 20 USD is more reasonable. \r\nThey have a massive reserve of 1700 USD which I feel is too high. The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required but has kept a massive contingency fund. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the site and related content.The proposal  provides  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of site production. The costs stated are too high in my professional opinion as one who runs a translation agency and does translation and audio production as well as have run a web development company for 10 years.\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. The proposal has technical aspects which have been addressed. The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal but has allocated a large contingency fund.
