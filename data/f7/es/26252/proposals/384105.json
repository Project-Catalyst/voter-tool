La idea es crear una sesi\u00f3n de preguntas y respuestas que explique qu\u00e9 es Cardano / Catalyst a un p\u00fablico que nunca ha tenido contacto con nuestra blockchain, y traducirlo a diferentes idiomas. En teor\u00eda, creo que es una iniciativa perfecta para lo que buscamos con este reto. S\u00f3lo me gustar\u00eda que hubiera m\u00e1s detalles en su conjunto, por ejemplo: algunos ejemplos de preguntas que se pueden hacer, adem\u00e1s de las m\u00e1s obvias como \"qu\u00e9 es blockchain\", \"qu\u00e9 son las criptomonedas\", etc. \u00bfEn qu\u00e9 idiomas estamos hablando en t\u00e9rminos de traducci\u00f3n? \u00bfC\u00f3mo podr\u00eda integrarse esta p\u00e1gina web con el trabajo del equipo de AIM, por ejemplo? Ser\u00eda una p\u00e1gina web, pero \u00bfpodr\u00eda AIM desarrollar una herramienta? Por lo tanto, habr\u00eda que explicar estos detalles, para que podamos tener una noci\u00f3n m\u00e1s s\u00f3lida del proyecto en s\u00ed, aunque la idea es muy buena. Debido a la falta de detalles, creo que el impacto es real, pero es necesario reforzarlo.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "La informaci\u00f3n que tenemos sobre el autor es escasa. Sabemos que estudia negocios en una instituci\u00f3n internacional en Francia.

De acuerdo, justific\u00f3 que blockchain es una tecnolog\u00eda que ser\u00e1 importante en el futuro y que Cardano destaca por ser sostenible y tener un objetivo de mejorar el mundo, pero me gustar\u00eda saber en relaci\u00f3n a \u00e9l mismo, \u00bfc\u00f3mo piensa aplicar la tecnolog\u00eda en su formaci\u00f3n/trabajo? Si tiene alguna experiencia laboral previa; cu\u00e1l es la nacionalidad de sus compa\u00f1eros, es decir, a qu\u00e9 idiomas se traducir\u00eda el curso. El paso a paso del proyecto est\u00e1 bien definido, creo que es una propuesta bien llevada en este aspecto, y tambi\u00e9n que no es tan compleja de implementar en el sentido de que un cronograma singular puede guiar bien lo que habr\u00e1 que hacer para obtener el \u00e9xito. El nivel de detalle de cada fase no es tan profundo, pero nos permite entender bien el proceso. Y por \u00faltimo, en relaci\u00f3n al presupuesto, tambi\u00e9n encontr\u00e9 que no es muy detallado, aunque el dinero que se pide es poco comparado con la mayor\u00eda de las otras propuestas, el autor podr\u00eda explicar mejor cada parte. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 cuesta 2000 d\u00f3lares crear la secci\u00f3n de preguntas y respuestas? \u00bfC\u00f3mo se desglosar\u00edan estos 2000 en peque\u00f1as actividades?

Algo que ser\u00eda interesante aqu\u00ed es, por ejemplo, si las personas que participaron en el proyecto pudieran dar alguna respuesta, \u00bflos estudiantes de las universidades objetivo se unieron a Catalyst, comenzaron a estudiar blockchain, adoptaron Cardano? El autor podr\u00eda darnos esas respuestas como una forma de auditabilidad, creo que el seguimiento en esta propuesta ser\u00eda m\u00e1s cualitativo que cuantitativo. Creo que esto se debe a que es m\u00e1s importante saber si las personas en las que se hizo la secci\u00f3n de preguntas y respuestas estaban interesadas en entrar en el ecosistema de Cardano que, necesariamente, a cu\u00e1ntas personas se lleg\u00f3. Por lo tanto, me gustar\u00eda que el autor promoviera un mayor contacto con la comunidad (incluso podr\u00eda unirse al grupo AIM, que ya tiene experiencias previas y sabe c\u00f3mo presentar los resultados).

Its much more straightfoward than courses and can impact much more languages with less effort.\r\nMy main considerations on the proposals are:\r\n\r\n1) How these students will contacted (using which filters and channels) and what does well informed mean? maybe it could include more details on what is going to be taught to them and how (will it follow a course model?) Also. how to guarantee these students will really be \"well informed\"? Maybe exams could be made, with different types of questions.\r\n2) will the students have a limited time to reply? I understand having fast reply is essential to guarantee a good user experience. At the same quality, it is necessary to ensure the quality/assertiveness of the information provided.\r\n3) Last, I'd highlight here in the proposal who the target audience is. Is the ovjective to mainly address new member already engaged questions or to attract still nont engaged people? This changes a lot the communication strategy.\r\n\r\nI like the idea to start small and see scale up aftewards and to have an open log with the Q&A, especially translating the most reputable one. Maybe some reward could be given to the best repliers. Also appreciated the idea of trying existing platforms and evaluating if creating a new one is better. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposer qualifications are a bit vague. Not clear if he alone has the contact to reach several countries or how active he is in cardano community to provide information to students recruted. Theres no way to verify the  personal information provided.\r\n\r\nRegarding the plan, it seems solid and is time-framed.\r\n\r\nBudget breakdown is ok, I'd just detail more the \" Answer the questions = $1500 (for 3 months)\". Is it to pay students or for other operational costs? are the students going to be paid by  number of replies of in a fixed way? All in all, its a cheap project with a good impact if scaled up.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Good and simple KPIs with target. They are sensible within project scope and seem to be aligned with expectations within project scope. Milestones can be extracted from the plan.\r\n\r\nLast, I really liked the challenge section but I'd add a mitigation strategy to these risks. How to overcome them?\r\none note: it says  as challenge \"We can not cover all the languages in the world\". I'd say this is nearly impossible, so maybe it would be better if this specific challenge was narrowed down by the number of languages aimed/desired at the end of the project.

It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by creating a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages.\r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would create a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages where they could ask questions and get real time answers from people, not bots. They would get answers in their preferred local language. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include contacting of students, teaching the students about Cardano, Creating the Q and A Rubric, in the form of a web page or a content repository of all possible questions which would grow. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is comprehensive and well laid out. It is a simple enough plan, easy to execute.  As questions grow the repository would also grow. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding languages and students to answer questions. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among non English speaking newcomes to DLT and Cardano\r\n\r\nI cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge but I also say it would be useful hence i have given it a 3 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have  not provided evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in building these sort of projects. The Linkedin Profiles of Core leadership has not been provided. They are students at a business school in France. While the concept is simple,no proof has been given that they are able to execute this plan.  The links are not sufficient. \r\nI have visited the links.but its to the corporate site of the school, not anything of the proposers themselves. I cannot assess if the proposer is competent to build this content since no information has been given as to prior experience in this area. \r\nThe proposal   has stated that the students of the school from 10 countries will work together and reach out to other students.  There is no guarantee if other students will join, or if they would be competent in providing this service in an efficient and timely manner.He has not provided the team structure of members and their capabilities and has mentioned other partners who he would work with such as web developer.\r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. They have allocated themselves 1200 USD for learning.  This should not be a cost factor per se since learning is a voluntary process and should not need to be paid for. They can charge for answering questions but learning itself should not be charged for. 2000 USD to create a simple web page by which questions can be added and a repository created is far too high, speaking in my professional opinion as a web and solutions developer for over 20 years. The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 2000 USD for a simple web site seems somewhat high to be reasonable. \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal  does not give a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has no plan stated with no detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of development. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have not been addressed \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal . Given experience and plan presented it is hard to say this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 1 star rating. Also I have rated it like this because the budget is too high for such a project.  \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\nGiven experience and plan presented and the other issues mentioned above, it is highly unlikely this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given a 1 star rating.

Having interaction with at least 3 languages and 1000 Q per month to be answered. \r\nThere is no basis to know how they plan to reach these 1000 people or persuade 20 of them to be active. There is no way to know how they plan to get 1000 questions per month  since that presumes everyone who is reached will have a question and keeping asking at least one question a month.
