De esta manera, se transmite una seguridad de por qu\u00e9 elegir ese pa\u00eds. La propuesta dialoga muy bien con los objetivos del desaf\u00edo, ya que busca diversificar el alcance de los contenidos relacionados con Cardano creando un centro de informaci\u00f3n en polaco. Tambi\u00e9n me pareci\u00f3 positivo que el autor demuestre preocupaci\u00f3n en crear contenidos que sean compatibles con personas con diferentes niveles de conocimiento sobre el mundo criptogr\u00e1fico, por lo que no s\u00f3lo beneficiar\u00eda a los que tienen mucha experiencia o a los que nunca han o\u00eddo hablar de \u00e9l. Aparte de eso, otro punto positivo es que el autor ya tiene algunos canales de comunicaci\u00f3n con la poblaci\u00f3n polaca sobre Cardano, por lo que no partir\u00eda de cero, y tambi\u00e9n demuestra un inter\u00e9s previo en la acci\u00f3n, que siempre es algo a tener en cuenta. El espacio a crear se dividir\u00eda en varias partes, como podcasts, una p\u00e1gina web con art\u00edculos de noticias sobre Cardano y ense\u00f1anzas sobre blockchain, etc. La diversidad de frentes a crear/invertir es una buena manera de llegar a diferentes personas, ya que algunos utilizan algunos medios y otros no. Por lo tanto, pens\u00e9 que este proyecto cumple muy bien con lo que queremos en el desaf\u00edo y tiene una buena oportunidad de producir un gran impacto.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "El equipo involucrado en el proyecto incluy\u00f3 una breve descripci\u00f3n sobre cada uno de ellos, con sus nombres, funciones y algunos proyectos que crearon antes (con enlaces en algunos casos); dos de ellos tambi\u00e9n ponen a disposici\u00f3n sus perfiles de linkedin, para que podamos conocerlos con m\u00e1s detalle. Estar\u00eda bien que Jakub tambi\u00e9n lo hiciera, pero quiz\u00e1 no tenga la red social. Creo que transmiten mucha confianza en su capacidad para ejecutar el proyecto con \u00e9xito, porque tienen mucha conexi\u00f3n con el blockchain y ya tienen algunos proyectos que cuentan como experiencia. Sin embargo, ser\u00eda mejor que tambi\u00e9n se incluyera en el equipo oficial a alguien responsable de marketing, no sabemos si alguno de ellos cubrir\u00eda esta funci\u00f3n, pero ser\u00eda m\u00e1s adecuado contratar a un profesional del \u00e1rea, ya que la difusi\u00f3n es sumamente esencial para el \u00e9xito del proyecto. Si la idea aqu\u00ed es llegar a la poblaci\u00f3n polaca con conocimientos sobre Cardano, se necesitan dos cosas: un buen contenido y una buena publicidad. El equipo no crea exactamente un gui\u00f3n a seguir. No tenemos una agrupaci\u00f3n de actividades, organizadas de forma lineal seg\u00fan el paso del tiempo, que ser\u00eda necesaria para la realizaci\u00f3n del conjunto. Sabemos que hay varias cosas por crear, algunas ya existen, pero ser\u00e1n mejoradas. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se desarrollar\u00eda todo este proceso? Ser\u00eda mejor que el equipo hubiera organizado estas actividades a lo largo de meses, para que pudi\u00e9ramos entender qu\u00e9 es lo primero, por qu\u00e9, qui\u00e9n lo har\u00e1, etc. Y sobre la divisi\u00f3n financiera, es ideal, sabemos c\u00f3mo se dividir\u00e1 el dinero y cada cuota tambi\u00e9n tiene una peque\u00f1a explicaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, en la parte de art\u00edculos sabemos cu\u00e1nto costar\u00eda traducir por palabra. As\u00ed que tenemos un conocimiento muy completo de c\u00f3mo se utilizar\u00eda la financiaci\u00f3n.

Empezando por los KPI, sabemos que los objetivos generales son producir/traducir contenidos sobre Cardano al polaco y llegar a un n\u00famero elevado de personas en el pa\u00eds. Tambi\u00e9n sabemos cu\u00e1l ser\u00eda la definici\u00f3n de \u00e9xito cada trimestre y al cabo de 1 a\u00f1o, de modo que se puede controlar exactamente si ha ocurrido lo que se pensaba. Por lo tanto, creo que es suficiente con que seleccionemos a un miembro de la comunidad que sepa hablar polaco (preferiblemente un nativo del pa\u00eds) para que supervise el progreso del proyecto y los resultados, con el fin de preparar una retroalimentaci\u00f3n general y llevarla al resto de la comunidad.

Amount of content originally created in Polish\r\n\r\n2. Amount of content translated into Polish\r\n\r\n3.

Sometimes   reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the article and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading, creation of local language programming with English and local language content.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe proposer has provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to complete the project. They have shown their experience on various media outlets, experience on educational series, various websites that they have founded, SPO experience, and creation of a community on social media channels.  These links are sufficient, but it would have been better to include the social media channels at all in order to verify the size and existence of the community.  I have visted links. The proposers appear competent, having experience in media publishing and content creation.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposer has identified the core team but has not quantified how many team members are needed to accomplish the content creation on various media.\r\n He has rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown in terms of the core leadership. \r\n The budget has been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items which includes server and domain costs, theme creation costs and is a flat rate per word to cover costs of translation,and release of press releases to various sites, mass and social media. This also includes costs of creating podcasts and merchandise. Also carrying out quizzes, kahoots and livestreams on various channels.They have also identified marketing and awareness building costs with ad costs, consultations and other promotional costs. The budget is very reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\n \r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation in terms of the materials to be translated as well as how output would be generated. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described. \r\nThe proposal clearly explains  technical aspects such as translation, website creation, theme creation,creation of podcasts,  editing, publishing which are steps needed in a localization project. The proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation . \r\n\r\n  \r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.
