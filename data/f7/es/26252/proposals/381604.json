Creo que esto se debe a que su objetivo es llevar informaci\u00f3n sobre el ecosistema Cardano a la poblaci\u00f3n de Indonesia, de una manera simplificada, a trav\u00e9s de clases de v\u00eddeo en youtube. De esta manera, habr\u00e1 muchas m\u00e1s posibilidades de interacci\u00f3n y participaci\u00f3n de la comunidad local indonesia con los proyectos y actividades del ecosistema. Puedo asegurar, por experiencia, que todo esto (todo lo que implica el ecosistema) es muy complejo y los que llegan tienden a perderse; una gu\u00eda sencilla y bien construida es la mejor manera de atraer a nuevos miembros al ecosistema y mantenerlos. Me parece interesante ya que el objetivo aqu\u00ed es llevar el contenido a los medios que ya usa el p\u00fablico objetivo (youtube e instagram) y no escatimar esfuerzos para que la gente que no tiene contacto con el ecosistema empiece a usar las nuevas plataformas y luego conozca la tem\u00e1tica. Tiene m\u00e1s sentido hacer llegar el contenido a la gente que hacer que la gente presente el contenido; el mayor esfuerzo tiene que ser nuestro (miembros actuales de la comunidad) para involucrar a nuevos participantes que luego se involucrar\u00e1n org\u00e1nicamente cada vez m\u00e1s. Adem\u00e1s de todos estos aspectos positivos, se argumenta por qu\u00e9 Indonesia es especialmente interesante para estas inversiones, lo que a\u00f1ade a\u00fan m\u00e1s valor al proyecto.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Se puede ver que el autor de la propuesta tiene una idea bien definida de c\u00f3mo lograr sus objetivos, que ser\u00edan recopilar informaci\u00f3n de varios canales de comunicaci\u00f3n sobre Cardano en Indonesia y a\u00f1adirla a la informaci\u00f3n sobre las reuniones del Ayuntamiento. Detalla los pasos que ser\u00edan necesarios para el \u00e9xito de esta idea, dividi\u00e9ndolos en grandes bloques de meses, que tambi\u00e9n se dividir\u00edan en porciones m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as. De este modo, es posible tener una idea precisa de lo que se har\u00e1 y en qu\u00e9 orden, lo que demuestra un dominio total de la parte pr\u00e1ctica del proyecto. La divisi\u00f3n monetaria es satisfactoria, aunque podr\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s detallada. Por ejemplo, en la parte de marketing, ser\u00eda interesante saber c\u00f3mo se llevar\u00eda a cabo la campa\u00f1a, qu\u00e9 estrategias se adoptar\u00edan y sus costes.

Por no hablar de que el proyecto cuenta con varias colaboraciones, y esta red es s\u00faper importante, ya que permite no s\u00f3lo difundir la idea (divulgarla) sino tambi\u00e9n mejorarla con gente que tiene un trabajo similar en Indonesia, aportando valor al unir experiencias .

En este espacio, el autor deja muy claro cu\u00e1l es la intenci\u00f3n de las subidas de v\u00eddeo, su duraci\u00f3n y la plataforma en la que se liberar\u00edan, lo que hace muy sencillo para la comunidad de Cardano (fuera del pa\u00eds de destino) el seguimiento de las acciones. Adem\u00e1s, \u00bfc\u00f3mo podr\u00edamos medir el \u00e9xito a trav\u00e9s del n\u00famero de personas alcanzadas? Sin embargo, todav\u00eda se podr\u00edan a\u00f1adir algunas ideas que elevar\u00edan el nivel de auditabilidad.

En cuanto a la integraci\u00f3n de los contenidos de las reuniones de los ayuntamientos, ser\u00eda importante trazar un puente entre esta parte del proyecto y los miembros del ecosistema, no todos, pero podr\u00edamos elegir a algunos que estuvieran m\u00e1s acostumbrados a tratar temas de este tipo (gubernamentales) para establecer esta conexi\u00f3n; esto ser\u00eda \u00fatil incluso para entender c\u00f3mo podemos llevar a Cardano a estas instancias, en otras localidades. Por lo tanto, creo que s\u00ed, es posible seguir el progreso del proyecto en base a los entregables, pero podr\u00edamos seguir a\u00fan m\u00e1s el progreso de las cosas a trav\u00e9s de diferentes iniciativas.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem is presented more as an observation than a problem \"Indonesians prefer simple visual infographics through YouTube and IG to learn about Cardano.\" \r\nThis preference is only a problem if NO content exists in such platforms like IG or Youtube.

This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable Indonesians to learn about Cardano and cryptos in general. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include rise in numbers of Cardano Indonesia Youtube, Instagram followers, workshop participants and bi-weekly participants of the Eastern Town Hall, and rise in proposals submission for Project Catalyst.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Indonesians who know about and are comfortable with Cardano. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. Simple infographics and videos will reach kids as well as adults and inculcate in kids the desire to use crypto more than fiat currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and infographics , and put links to some of the videos/infographics on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. For graphics you can use imgur or photobucket or send them to your instagram page itself. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has  not provided evidence  of the team whose relevant skills and experience are needed to complete the project.

Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as project management , marketing and other costs.   \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Their output is only one video or Instagram post a month.  The price of a video is exorbitantly high.

Being from a country which also has lower income levels than Indonesia, I can confidently say that these prices are too high to be reasonable. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to create one video or one Instagram post per month.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal  does not provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very high level broad plan but there is no detailed breakdown in the plan. Also as stated above the costs are in my opinion too high.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should also seek to include the teams FB profiles or Linkedin Profiles with links to their CV or work experience. If a company, then link to the corporate web page or Linkedin Profile . \r\n\r\nTeam members profiles should be included in as much detail as possible. You should also reconsider your budget and if it costs this much to produce, seek to get production done from lower priced providers in other countries. You can get the same quality job for far lower cost and thereby maximise your saving. Also seek to increase your offering from one Video or IG post per month to about 1-2 per week.

One video a week or two a week would be more realistic.\r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer. \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer. Try to create more content. Content is key.  Develop metrics that help you to track.   Make as many metrics which you can track easily.
