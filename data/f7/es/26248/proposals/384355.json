Also, I know the Cardano Ecosystem and its actors pretty well by now so I am sure I can confidetly evaluate this proposal. The proposal provides a great idea that will be of great benefit Project Catalyst and to the ecosystem in general; mapping and classifying blockchain ecosystems. It will be really important to have this serious scientific backing in order to help establish Cardano and blockchain in general. It will help a lot towards future scalability for sure.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DLT360 has so far shown (with their proposal from F6 they currently govern) that they are a serious and competent project partner for catalyst. I is highly likely that they are up for the challenge. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and present them transparently. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

The impact for the Cardano ecosystem could be great by creating an objective classification and study of all protocols and compere them based on rationales and research, but there is no analysis on what that impact could be or how to measure it.

So even though risks can materialize they can iterate the business model to adapt it as required in order to deliver.\nIn terms of budget the breakdown is clear and all the main costs were identified, the rates used for the different roles are aligned with the market, even the experts that will do the QA.\nThe only piece I'd add to the project is to better identify risks and its mitigation.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Progress KPIs are provided, are very detailed and clear, though Impact or Return on Intention KPIS could've been detailed or at list analyzed so.the expected impact could be quantified and understood.\nWith the detailed milestone and the progress KPIS, this project could be easily tracked and audited by the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_288", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 3, "ng": 17, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Queremos contribuir a objetivar el debate estableciendo un esquema de clasificaci\u00f3n para auditar y comparar los principales protocolos", "experience": "M\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os de experiencia en el sector junto con un equipo central flexible y una red de expertos de renombre"}
