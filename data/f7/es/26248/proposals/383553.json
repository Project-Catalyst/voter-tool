The proposal clearly presents what \"bug fixes\" and new features it wants to complete as well as a brief description on how to achieve each of these (the What and the How). The timings for completion seem realistic. No budget breakdown is presented and only 9k is requested which doesn't seem like much. This doesn't really affect my assessment of the feasibility of this proposal as the objectives and plans are well laid out, but it's always good to see a budget breakdown and to know if part of the proposal will be self-funded.
