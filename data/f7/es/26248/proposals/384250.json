This is a great and meaningful idea. The Catalyst Circle plays an important role the Cardano's Governance as a whole. The problem is clearly described, and explained in detail.

It has been known for a while now that it has been running at a deficit as it gets established, so funding and incentives are definitely required if community members are going to continue to step-up and put in the time and work to create cohesive perspectives of the overwhelming amount of information that composes Project Catalyst.  Whether one agrees with any particular iteration of CCvX, the purpose of this proposal is to better calibrate the incentives for the process, which is information that informs newer, more desirable or effective iterations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While this is a difficult proposal to assess metrics on, the team helpfully supplied KPIs (problems sensed/solved) that can help to build an effectiveness ratio for CCv3 and beyond.  The milestones provided, scheduled meetings and feedback sessions are clear enough, but the biggest issue facing CCv3 will be working through a backlog of problems already identified, even as more arise.  To this end the proposal budget seeks to incentivize approx 48hrs worth of  member time in executing CCv3 over the next 3 months.  This budget dilutes if further meetings or other facilitation  are required, or if other participants, such as secretaries are brought onboard.  Compared to the previous budget (which ran at a deficit) this one does not swing too far, and still looks to be targeting a \"minimum functional group\" approach.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Through the first part of this process the team reworked and recalibrated the community advisor process, including rewards, and it was done in an open, transparent way and its results communicated to several different platforms.  The scope of Catalyst, and the infancy of this particular aspect means information can slip through the cracks, but other funded Catalyst proposals, such as QA-DAO, are adding their value to the symphonic increase in persistent knowledge within the Catalyst project.  Since the main deliverable will be the bi-weekly meetings and any \"lessons learned\" documents they create, and since these will all be public, the community should be able to follow along closely as the CCv3 project unfolds.  A suggestion for clarity and transparency:  a dedicated channel of communication under the header of problems sensed/solutions pending(and/or delivered).  This could be a gitbook entry or a dedicated page, and would link to \"tip of the iceberg\" resources for discussion/understanding.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Financiaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de Catalyst para garantizar la participaci\u00f3n continua y aumentar la responsabilidad de los miembros del CC ante la comunidad.", "experience": "Somos miembros elegidos de la comunidad de Project Catalyst de sectores clave del ecosistema para identificar y resolver intereses mutuos."}
