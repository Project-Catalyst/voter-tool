The challenge this proposal is trying to solve is the MISC challenge and that is a challenge for proposals that do not fall under any other challenge fund. This proposal is by Nano Frames and I've researched them extensively! They are right to apply for this challenge because the product they make solves a problem that cardano nft's face and we do not have a challenge for solving cardano nft problems in fund 7. The problem is to give cardano nfts a place to display in the real world. This has been done on other blockchains in a very intrusive way by connecting the private keys of a wallet to a display frame. Nano solves this problem with out any security concerns by giving wallets a Nano digital nft that is connected to the real world display frame. By having the digital nano frame nft you can control what nfts appear on your real world frame. This means that you do not need to give any permissions from your wallet private keys to the frame to give it access to display your nft's. I think the other issue with cardano nft's is that the cardano wallets are just different than say your traditional meta mask wallets. Nano is a first mover in creating a cardano cnft digital display frame. You might ask why this is important. Nft's being displayed will bring awareness to cardano and this product will target long term holders interested in show casing their digital property. Of coarse that is one reason. Another reason is that eventually we may start putting credentials on the blockchain and need a way to display these credentials. For instance a real estate firm in many states is required to have the real estate licenses posted in the firm at all times. Most real estate firms end up having very sloppy photos of licenses covered with magnets or held by pins puncturing holes into the photos. This will be a product that will be essential for displaying neatly either records, digital art, or any other types of nft's. Check out how beautiful these look at the link below https://www.nano-frames.com/?lightbox=dataItem-kvypoxrn2 \r\nNot only will these help in bringing awareness to cardano and create many ways to monetize digital property but the team is also doing heavy r and d into what the cnft community is suggesting to them. They have deep connections to the cnft community and I know this because I do many twitter spaces with the cnft community and Nano is loved by the community by many people I respect. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because i have had the privlege to talk with the team and also research them extensively I do believe they will be successful in bringing their vision to reality. The team is experienced in business and \"it\" as we can see in there credentials here I have copy and pasted from the proposal -  \r\n\"Sipke Soorstra\r\n21+ years in the field as a full-stack software engineer\r\n\r\n- Contributor to the Orchard Project as of 2011.\r\n\r\n- Steering committee member & Benevolent Dictator of the Orchard Project.\r\n\r\n- Creator of Elsa Workflows, an open source .NET library.\r\n\r\n- C#, F#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, VB, C (plus plus) , HTML, CSS/SCSS/LESS\r\n\r\n- React, Angular, Vue, Alpine, StencilJS, Xamarin, Flutter, Antlr, Blazor, jQuery\r\n\r\n- WebPack, Vite, Gulp\r\n\r\n- ML.NET, Open ID Connect, EF Core, Windows Workflow Foundation, MassTransit\r\n\r\n- MongoDB, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ\r\n\r\n- REST APIs, GraphQL\r\n\r\n- .NET, Cloud computing, Cognitive Services,, Kubernetes, Docker\r\n\r\n- Raspberry PI, iOS & Android\r\n\r\n- Orchard, Orchard Core, Umbraco, Sitefinity\r\n\r\n- DevOps engineering\r\n\r\n- Architecture & design patterns\r\n\r\nSandeep Shelkehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepshelke/\r\n\r\nLocation: Stavanger, Norway\r\nExperience:\r\n- 15 years of experience in software engineering and product development\r\n\r\n- Plutus Pioneer 2\r\n\r\nWide range of experience in:\r\n- Robotic software solutions\r\n\r\n- Autonomous drone software stack\r\n\r\n- Enterprise level applications\r\n\r\n- Complex architectures\r\n\r\n- c (plus plus), c, python\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJorge Orozco\r\n\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgeorosan/\r\n\r\nLocation: Guatemala, Guatemala\r\nExperience:  \r\n14 years of experience in IT:\r\n- Data warehousing: etl, multidimensional modeling, aws redshift\r\n\r\n- SQL Databases: postgresql, oracle, mysql, sql server\r\n\r\n- Business intelligence: sap, power bi, pentaho, aws quicksight\r\n\r\n- Software development: angular, angular js, php, python, java, spring boot\r\n\r\n- Cloud architecture: aws certified solutions architect\r\n\r\n- DevOps: kubernetes, docker, jenkins\r\n\r\n- Ethereum: solidity, ganache, truffle, web3js\r\n\r\n- Cardano: plutus, cardano-cli\"\r\n\r\nNot only does the team's experience give me confidence but the fact that they are doing a pre sale and have already created products, and have developed a strong presence on twitter and a community on discord should be rewarded in my score as that's more than a lot of proposals can say. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We have been given direction of where they will allocate the funds. This means we can audit the usage of funds. My only additional thing I would like to see from the team is more timelines in the fund allocation section. I would like to see this so we could hold them accountable for both the ways the funds will be used and the time it will take to see a return on intention. In this proposal it would be for example a more transparent connection between the dates on the road map and the ways the allocation section would be linked to the roadmap. Maybe one example would be for a \" ui/ux designer \". Maybe instead of just saying we need 4k to for a ux/ui designer the proposer could say the following - \"we need a ux/ui designer hired by m/d/y and we need the ui/ux designer to get x part of our roadmap done by x date.  This will cost 4 k because we have gotten quotes from 3 different designers and that would be the amount they would require with a little extra in case of any human error\". something like that would make it a 5 of 5 for me.
