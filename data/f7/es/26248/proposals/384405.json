However, this proposal lacks in a few areas that might not effectively address the problem. One of the issues is the lack of experience in education.

You could make a case, and I'd like the proposers to consider this, that the core proposal in the DeFi challenge should be approved before this sort of outreach and education initiative should be approved. Otherwise you could wind up with a cart-before-the-horse scenario where you have an outreach budget but no core development budget.

But I can definitely speak on the communications aspects that are the focus of this specific proposal, however. I think it is pretty reasonable and all of this could be conducted successfully with the budget and success measures listed. It's very good that the proposers provided a presentation video that a more professionalized advertorial would be derived from, as well. It shows they're thinking ahead. It also sounds like the founder has a decent grasp on how to explain the concept to a non-technical audience, though the team should welcome the help that professional marketing professionals would provide should this proposal be approved.

A timeline, as well as an open plan for allocation of resources with a brief explanation for each should definitely be considered next time. Also, setting up a professional website can be quite an endeavor. Are there any professional web developers that are lined up for the website? These are some of the questions that come to mind that feel fairly fundamental to me that lead to a 2 star rating here.
