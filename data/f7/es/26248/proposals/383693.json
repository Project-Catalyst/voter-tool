It is also creating an impact on sustainability by enhancing non-meat options and share it as an open source project, incentivized by the blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is made of engeneers, the provided website provides proof of prior work and how the project is developing. The name of the potential new meat-alternative is connected to the Cardano protocol and I find this idea very fascinating. The team has a very good strategy, how to develop this project in a decentralized way - much like Cardano - by providing an open source solution of their non-animal bone alternative and incentivizing people that provide value by creating recepies and further develop the project. This will likely lead to an active and possibly even viral product that people might talk about, which would potentially even onboard new Cardano members. It is a great usecase for the Cardano blockchain and is very much in line with how Cardano operates and develops. Budget and milestones make sense and the team provided a good overview to understand their idea and vision.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones are clear and realistic tho it is a big project and it depends on the contributing community, how the project itself will turn out. budget is broken down and makes sense, progress will be auditable through their website.

The area looks niche however the benefits for the environment due to the low carbon footprint of non-meat products is a noble initiative. The use of Cardano Looks superficial, however, the technical innovations generally have spin-off benefits, with can be exploited by the Cardano community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is from a Ph.D. in Tissue engineering, a SpaceX engineer, and a Cardano SPO. I guess there can be no better team to experiment with this project. There might be highly technical and feasibility risks; however, with these established credentials, there is a good chance that the money will be well spent with these established credentials. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Out of the budget, $28,000 has been allotted to core developers. They plan to maintain IP with the developers. The rationale for this allotment and retaining the IP is difficult to understand. The proposal is reasonable and the rest of the road map seems justified in the breakdown of expenditure and time plan.

The proposal identifies an interesting topic and might have some positive impact on the adaption of sustainable meat alternatives. \r\n The proposal however struggles to articulate the relation to the Cardano ecosystem, as the connection between the actual product,  the stakepool and the community token is not defined clearly. It seems a bit as if the latter two were mainly introduced into the proposal in order to fulfill the requirements of a connection to Cardano, and one could think that if planned right, a reasonable connection to Cardano could be made, but the proposers do not succeed in providing a comprehensive and conductible plan to do this. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. That being said, it has the potential to meet the Metric of bringing up new topics and approaches and, if properly adopted, it might also be able to scale. Feedback: Explain your concept a bit better and also the connection between the different parts, so people can see where you are going. Also, with such a specific product like animal bones, maybe present some market research or a business case so people can be convinced that there is actually a market and potential for this.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers should be, according to their self-acclaimed qualifications, up to the task. They also present some pictures of work in this area they have already done, so this suggests they are already invested in the project.\r\nThe budget only is very coarse-grained and except for the breakdown of the material costs it  does not give a more detailed rationale for the three positions that are presented there. Since the proposal itself is ab bit unclear about the whole connection between the product produced and the stake pools worked with, it is a bit uncleat how the money for the developers and the marketing are going to be used. No plan is presented for the case that additional funding  will be required, which should be done in a more sophisticated proposal, especially considering that the success of this project will depend on a lot of factors, like the success of the staking initiative (especially considering the so far unsuccessful stakepool) and of the marketing of the product.\r\nThe timetable and the milestones are comprehensive and seem to be in order and offer, from my perspective, a conductible plan, apart from the very optimistic 12-month milestone perhaps.\r\nIn its current form, the proposal provides  a plan that can be sensible and conductible if some parts are clarified and more detailed.\r\nChallenges, resources required and all the deeper details are not considered very well in the proposal, so this part of the proposal definetely needs some more optimisation. General feedback: Try starting with 1 or 2 proposals next time and make them really sophisticated instead of starting up with seven proposals that are not properly planned. This particular proposal seems like something you have certain competencies for, so it's a shame that it is not planned properly, probably partially due to the fact that you proposed so many different projects.", "q1r": 3, "q2": " A credible roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented. At least for the product-related part, auditable Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are presented. As mentioned before, the topic of the community token and the stakepools is not defined sufficiently and what it is going to achieve is unclear, so this part of the proposal is unauditable.\r\nA clear, understandable description of the targeted problem is provided. The solution is only partially explained well, while the other part (tokenomics, SPs) remains unclear.\r\n Feedback: It can be seen that you have some knowledge on the product production part and that part is explained reasonabl and comprehensively in your proposal. Try to formulate your tokenomics and stakepool ideas also in this manner with concrete goals, than you will have a really auditable proposal", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_52", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 1, "ng": 16, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "In terms of the relation to the Cardano ecosystem, we are currently working with our FYTOBOROS stakepool delegators to vote and discuss on the tokenomics of the community token that we have minted, including the token allotment. Percent allotment is categorized based on project contribution (core team, pool delegators, advisor, chef, influencer, customer). The active and potentially viral bone product will potentially onboard new Cardano members. A Faucet for this community token is being finalized so the project chefs, influencers, and consumers will be rewarded with community token, giving Cardano and its network visability. Data of units ordered, shipping information, wallet addresses, contributor information, and the parameters of token allotment will be automatically gathered and used in conjunction with the faucet for redemption, distribution, and storage of tokens. Token and product data reporting will be published on our website. Personalized website accounts will be generated for private token and product data.
