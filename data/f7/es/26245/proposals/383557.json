Technical details provided looks good and as the proposer has mentioned they themselves are pool operator that would be giving some confidence with the capability to deliver this.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is mentioned in the proposal that the solution will be forever open source, so that would be easy to track the progress of the implementation.

It will clearly help SPO  to improve efficiency of the nodes but you have to specify the difference and optimization between your solution and the currents solutions.

You don't speak also about how your Dapp (or web app or both?) will work? Do users need to register? Who will you secure it? How do you plan to install on the node and server that will use your solution? Will you do a FAQ to explain how people can use your solution?\r\nHowever you should also had more information about how you will market your solution (advertisement, video etc\u2026) and how you will earn sufficient revenue to operate your solution on the long term\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This item need to be more developed because you don't really explain witch KPI will permit to follow the good use and operation of your project.

I would suggest it is better suited in  the Dapps and integrations challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer is an SPO and is already testing the app the repository can be found on their github link.  The team is made up of 4 experienced developers, from checking their github it looks like they are underway but it would be good to have links to their other development experience .

The benefit of this is for the node operator to be able to increase their awareness of potential issues, get remote access to status updates without accessing their local machine and to add custom alerts that may be relevant. The easier that it becomes for people to run their own stake pool the more decentralized the ecosystem can become with higher confidence levels of good node operation. If executed well this proposal could have a high impact for node operators.\r\n\r\nA useful service for SPOs also can turn into a re-occurring business model which aligns well with the challenge brief of creating new opportunities in the space that are economically viable.
