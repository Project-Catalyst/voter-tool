This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal identifies an important addition to the Cardano ecosystem, accurate mapping of it. This will not just benefit SPOs, but also be beneficial in many other areas. The project will, if implemented, have a lot of positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Even though the key metrics are not mentioned explicitly, the scope of the project is formulated in a structured comprehensive way that matches the overall mission statement.

What is also appreciated that the proposers already did a lot of work ahead.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan.

An interactive, searchable online tool that allows you to get headline details along with further links, definitely helps build the SFO opportunities.

It will take work to scale this but it has the bones to have wide impact, which is important and also very evident for voters. As someone with 10+ years experience in education resources in a Fortune500 company, interactive, self-serve resources are key to uptake.
