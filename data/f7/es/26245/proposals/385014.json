Furthermore, can't SPO's actually just start an ad campaign for their pool and then measure the number of new wallets delegating to them in the months following the campaign compared to the months prior to it?\r\nThe solution is too technical in my opinion to properly explain to a regular voter what exactly it is and how it would work. Unfortunately, this information cannot be found anywhere else in the proposal either. Staking is done via wallets right now and I fail to understand how an on-page script would fit in here. Airdrops are also mentioned but no detail is given at all about what the proposers meant here. Would the participating SPO award ADA to a wallet delegating to them?\r\nDue to this proposal attempting to increase the attractiveness of delegating to SPO's, it probably fits in this challenge, but the unanswered questions above and the lack of any type of KPI or concrete goal force me to strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "One of the proposers mentions that he is a Plutus student and the notes on the provided github do reflect this, but there does not seem to be much other activity there, especially in the fast few months.

Lastly, 14 years of experience of web analytics and managing large technical projects are mentioned, but no references are provided to verify this. It's a good idea to try to add at least a Linkedin page to back you up. The other proposer seems to be a stake pool, but there are no details about them, or about the operator here. Is it the proposer themselves? It would be good to have this information.\r\nI strongly disagree that this proposal can be implemented successfully, due to the lack of information on the team who would work on this, no details on how the budget would be used, no risk analysis and no plan outlining the technical approach and the usage of resources concretely.
