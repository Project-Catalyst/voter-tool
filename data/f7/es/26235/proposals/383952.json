The correct challenge for this would be 'Multilingual Resources'. It is not specified in the proposal what type of communications center is meant. What is unclear is why there should be new entities in place when there are already multiple means of communications. This proposal lays a heavy focus on multilinguality, but the lobbying sector is already inherently multilingual as they frequently need to communicate with people from different nations. The proposal needs to explain this more. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer is claiming to have relevant experience and has marked in the checklist that there is identifying information of the proposers included, but there is no way to confirm this by the information provided in the proposal. There is no explanation of how the requested funds is intended to be used. Specifying this would improve the proposal's feasibility. There has been made good use of the seek-tags, indicating that the proposer is looking for translators and writers to assemble a team. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The plan gives a rather vague impression as there is no specification. This proposal needs some work to bring it up to standard. It needs a roadmap explaining what is intended to be built along with the time each phase will take and what part of the budget is allocated to it so progress can be tracked.

This second one, if it were described in more detail, like how and why it would work better than the current system, then that would fit well into the challenge parameters.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As mentioned above, the proposal is too big and too broad. It doesn't contain any information regarding the countries the project would be implemented in or the time it would start being operational.

In theory, I think this idea has a certain fit for the challenge.
