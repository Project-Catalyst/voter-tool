Esta propuesta responde claramente a ese reto, ya que el proponente tiene un proyecto de ley bien elaborado y listo para entregar al legislador de California. La falta de un \"puerto seguro\" en los Estados Unidos para los proyectos DeFi es un problema grave que est\u00e1 paralizando la innovaci\u00f3n en los Estados Unidos e impidiendo que los consumidores e inversores estadounidenses participen en la innovaci\u00f3n de blockchain y se beneficien de ella. Toda la comunidad de Cardano, y de hecho, la comunidad global de criptomonedas se beneficiar\u00eda de esta legislaci\u00f3n propuesta. Si se promulga, proporcionar\u00eda una forma legal y reglamentaria para que los proyectos DeFi trabajen con los residentes de California. Cualquier desarrollador de DeFi interesado en construir un proyecto en el ecosistema de Cardano se beneficiar\u00eda enormemente de este proyecto.  En cuanto a la escalabilidad, como menciona la propuesta, la legislaci\u00f3n aprobada en California tendr\u00e1 un importante impacto en otros estados, e incluso a nivel mundial.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Como directora ejecutiva de la California Blockchain Advocacy Coalition, est\u00e1 claro que tiene la experiencia y los conocimientos necesarios para presionar a favor de la legislaci\u00f3n propuesta, como se indica en la propuesta. Adem\u00e1s, el hecho de que el IOG ya haya examinado la organizaci\u00f3n y se haya unido a ella como miembro proporciona un apoyo adicional a sus credenciales y habilidades. Ally grab\u00f3 un \"Fireside Chat\" con el director de producto de IOG Atala PRISM, Tony Rose, en el que demostr\u00f3 igualmente su experiencia en este campo.  Aunque ser\u00eda dif\u00edcil para cualquier persona ajena a la empresa saber si el presupuesto es razonable, est\u00e1 claro que, como profesional experimentada en este campo, Ally tiene una buena idea de los fondos necesarios, y es significativo que la cantidad solicitada a Catalyst sea s\u00f3lo el 10% del presupuesto previsto.

Esa educaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 enormemente \u00fatil independientemente del resultado del proyecto de ley. La idea de incluir un puesto en el comit\u00e9 de pol\u00edticas para el Proyecto Catalyst es una forma innovadora de garantizar la auditabilidad continua y de proporcionar v\u00ednculos estrechos y continuos entre los esfuerzos de cabildeo y la actividad dentro del Proyecto Catalyst.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_662", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This project plans on changing legislature in one US-state to bypass SEC-regulations and make this legal solution accessible from other states. This might actually work temporarily, but could also upset the SEC so they go looking for other ways to crackdown on DeFi products through taxable events. Therefore the idea is not good, not bad.

With this we're really funding specialists who can help to create a friendlier environment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of making California a Safe Harbor independent from SEC is great. Since US is a continental country with a diverse people with different beliefs, it would be easier to breakdown a little bit and implement some regulatory legislation to foment the industry and market using crypto in just one state, and if this state is CA, the visibility would be enormous \u2013 which will incentivize other states and countries.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems cohesive and since IOG is already onboard I do believe that this group is capable of deliver. \r\n\r\nOne of my concerns is about the budget asked. I've understood that USS 35K represents 10% of the total amount needed, however is the whole funding, therefore if this proposal does not finish in first place it would not be funded. Maybe reducing a little the amount solicitated would help.\r\n\r\nOther financial aspect of the proposal is that it says that to get this going it is fundamental to have more partnerships and receive more funds. And since you don't know exactly if you will receive this amount, I understand that this project will not start. Another point is that we do not control whether you'll receive the total fund (350K)  in time to get this going before the political cycle (if there is such a thing \u2013 the point is that the timeline could be altered). That said, it could be helpful to add some risk mapping.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to perceive the progress, the proposal says that it's going to be reported and the bills published.

", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project is pursued by the blockchain advocacy coalition and was handed in by Ally Medina, the Executive Director. They can be found on LinkedIn and seem legit. Still, there are a few things missing in this proposal. 1: the budget is not further defined. They need a total of 350k but only request 35k in Ideascale. Furthermore their interests are not entirely clear. As they are already pursuing the bill, who financed them so far? How much of the initial 350k is already financed?
