Due to the pool saturation mechanism (K factor) that forces the increase in the number of pools operating regularly in order to promote decentralization in the creation of blocks, a large number of \"seats\" are available and this encourages competition and the possibility of small SPOs to participate becomes more tangible than in other blockchains.\r\n\r\nAfter several months of testing the FISOs/ISOs/ISPOs concept, it has become clear that this fundraising model is a popular and extremely useful tool for pool owners and delegators alike. Although this tool is important, there are some problems it can bring, such as centralization of delegation and regulatory risks. This proposal intends to tackle the centralization problem, making the concept more sustainable for small SPOs and for Cardano's own decentralization and allow optional KYC integration through DIDs, which can help with regulatory issues.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is clarity on the problem to be tackled and the proposal describes a model that aims to leverage the use of ISOs through some improvements aimed at creating a model with better UI/UX for both delegates and SPOs. The integration of Stakepad into the Stakeboard platform would allow better communication between ISOs, SPOs and delegators, through marketing, curation, filtering(which would allow ISOs and delegators to select SPOs that meet desired criteria, such as SPOs that support different social causes) and reputation of SPOs for collaboration in fundraising programs, this would make ISOs and SPOs have more visibility and delegates can find them more easily.\r\n\r\nI believe that the proposal is perfectly aligned with the challenge, in fact the use of pools as a fundraising tool is already a reality and the idea would be to polish it so that it becomes more economically sustainable for SPOs and more practical for delegators.\r\n\r\nThe metrics/KPIs included are good indicators of success and impact for this challenge and for Cardano's ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has expertise in several areas important to the project's conduction, such as software develpment, product management, business management, communication management, IT, in addition some participated in Plutus Pioneers Program and operate pools. It is important to point out that this proposal is an arm of the Stakeboard and has been under development for several weeks, some stages have already been completed even before funding, which shows commitment and productivity.\r\n\r\nThere is a budget breakdown. The frontend+banked development workload rates are appropriate, but the other items could be more detailed as there is no clarity on the required workloads for UI/UX, DevOps, Project Management and Marketing.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap and milestones are realistic, clear and objective. Stakepad's plan is reasonable and contains enough detail to indicate feasibility.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Stakestarter was presented, which intends to create an alternative fundrasing model, it seems to me that the intention is to create an optional MVP but it was not clear if Stakestarter will be a deliverable of this proposal. Based on the roadmap it doesn't seem like it, but I would recommend making it clearer.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is clarity in the problem, solution and in their alignment with this challenge.\r\n\r\nThe metrics and KPIs described seem to be good indicators for auditing the performance and checking the success of the proposal.\r\n\r\nRoadmap and milestones are clear and objective, which makes checking deliverables and performance easier.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 14, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Very strong and thorough assessment.
