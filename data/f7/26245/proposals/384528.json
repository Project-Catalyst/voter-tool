The project requested $9500 to set up a self-operate SPO, and the initial purpose is to create some income to support his research and promote the Cardano ecosystem. It is a practical solution for those who require a stable income; however, the downside of the approach would be the delegators. You have a new block that needs a certain number of delegates users and certain transactions in and out every five days or an epoch. The proposed direction would help further researchers and academic staff who wish to run their own SPO to create a regular income stream and have more time to promote the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer should clarify how you will use $5000 for marketing and advertising since this is nearly more than half of the requested fund.
