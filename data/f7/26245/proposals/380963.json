Twitter is awash with questions of 'who to delegate to?' or 'which pool donates to XX?' There are a number of delegators who factor in pool missions into their decisions and the proposal could enable a pool to market support for a number of organisations and distribute funds based on personal preferences. This makes the proposal aligned with the challenge and can bring tremendous impact. Where I only agreed (as opposed to strongly agreed) is in the way this project is conveyed. I had to read the proposal twice before I realised its intentions. The brevity of descriptions may be too short to truly inform the reader to understand the project. If this proposal does not make it to the next stage, I strongly urge the proposers to resubmit a rewritten and improved version as this is something the community could really benefit from. Good luck", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I only scored this a four despite having the elements required in proposals for the same reasons I mentioned above, i.e. the descriptions are brief. The team members are identified with their respective skillsets and despite lacking direct links to their LinkedIn profiles, were confirmed by checking the website for the AZUL pool. You get the sense that these active participants of the Cardano Ecosystem are capable of seeing this project through but the summary-style of the proposal almost relies on trust that they can deliver, if a voter does not spend time to research their credentials deeper. Their roadmap or Definition of Success are single line items lacking any detail. It will benefit this proposal if each 3, 6 & 12 month milestone contained more information than it currently has. Furthermore, the budget breakdown is just as brief. I can understand that for the expertise of in-house development the team members are familiar with, this format is informative amongst themselves or to any other team who are familiar in DevOps or guerrilla coding. But for the general voting public, there is a greater expectation of not needing to read between the lines in order. Overall, this project is feasible but taking the voters' point of view into consideration, it can be improved hence the score.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately I cannot score this proposal higher than feasibility if the basis for my rating in the former is the brevity of the presentation. The summary format of the milestones and the budget breakdown do not provide granular points for auditing. That said, the AZUL team are active in twitter and in instagram so there are channels from where communication in terms of their progress can be established. These can hopefully be used to keep the community abreast as each of the milestones is achieved. Clearly, the team are seasoned developers and mentions the use of a 'public' repository for their code which presumably will be GitHub, since none was mentioned. And the promise to make the Smart Contract open aids with auditability, but at the end. Should this be re-written and re-submitted into a future funding round, I am almost certain it will gain higher ratings. The foundation of their solution to the distribution of donations to charity organisations is a promising feature for a pool to attract delegators and I am sure will be anticipated by many SPOs.

However, the proposal should have included some of the scenario's/requests from the delegators to show how important is the implementation of this proposal and also if some other SPO's are also interested in such kind of implementation, Since the implementation requires an update in the Cardano protocol, it would be better to include any briefs of conversation happened with other SPO's or IOHK.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal states that plan is to implement a voting system to distribute the rewards, whereas the proposal should have also included architectural aspects(ateast an overview) of the implementation, experiences of the proposers mentioned in the proposal, would have been nice to have some links to verify the identities, would love to see them in future proposals. Also, details of the implementation should have been more clearer, instead of telling implementing tokens and a voting system, maybe divide the whole process in phases, phase 1 to discuss with other SPO's to understand the importance of this proposal and discussing with core developers or researching how to go about changing the protocol parameters. And phase 2 might be implementing the solution obtained in phase 1, also can divide the proposal into two and request funds into separate funding rounds.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Definition of success is mentioned in the proposal but it should also include some key aspects so how can the community understand the success of the proposal.

The challenge however, is aiming to come up with new business models/opportunities for SPOs. How does it drive more decentralisation of the Cardano? It might drive decentralisation of reward allocation but not of the SPOs. It could have been great to have more info about the problem and solution as more explanation will make your solution clearer for CA and voters.
