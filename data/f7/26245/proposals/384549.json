You could ad the hourly rate and intended hours required for this job for an even better break down of the budget. They aim to establish partnerships with at least 5 businesses in Q1 2022. It seems doable, but more likely if you already have the marketing team on board. They explain the intended benefits of their product, but don't really provide any details on how this will be built/achieved. For example they claim \"Consumers would love to see their holdings grow / rewarded and get discounts on their purchases\" Will there be an application for this? How do they track and calculate this discount? Explaining these details will show the voter your approach and could potentially boost voter confidence in your abilities to make this project succeed.

In order to track the performance of your project it would help a lot to ad user based KPIs, like how many businesses onboarded at different points in time.

This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal identifies a problem which actually is not really a problem since it is a pretty straightforward step-by-step process to set up a stakepool. You don't really need to hire experts for that. Also, in my opinion a service that offers just anyone to emit their own tokens is neither beneficial for the credibility of Cardano nor of the Crypto sector as a whole. Hence, I am not sure how this proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\r\nThis proposal is less adressed to SPOs than to businesses, so the key metrics and goals of the proposal only align partially with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nThe proposer adresses sclalability, which seems legitimate.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer does not provide sufficient information about themselves and does not provide proof for any relevant qualifications. Feedback: For future proposals, maybe consider linking some verifiable personal information about yourself or some of the work you have already done. The proposer does not seem to know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal, as they want to hire two people for a job that could probably, at least in the startup phase, by themselves. Feedback: There are several tutorials and guides on the internet on how to set up a stakepool I suggest, if you are serious about this idea, you use all these resources to teach yourself to set up a stakepool yourself and than start this business idea without hiring several people. It's always good to start small until you have built yourself up a stable customer base.\r\nThe budget is not outlined clearly nor broken down into identifiable items. The proposer only mentions a lump sum and some points for which it is used. Feedback. A budget broken down by items should be used next time.\r\nSince the budget is not broken down and a large proportion of the proposal could be done without extra hired people by just going through freely available guides, the budget does not seem reasonable.\r\nThe proposal does not offer a timetable to complete the work.\r\nThe overall implementation plan lacks sophistication and technical detail, which gives the impression the proposer does not exactly know the technical backgrounds of their own proposal, which should be a prerequisite for posting a proposal. The plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal other than some people they want to hire.\r\n The proposer has not done a general assessment of challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While a roadmap with milestones exists, they don't have a time horizon which will make it difficult to audit them.
