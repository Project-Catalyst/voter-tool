It is also one of the major and important stakeholder in the ecosystem-if not the most.  The better livelihood they have the better it will be for Cardano community as a whole. The sidechain of Cardano ideally needs to be as decentralized as the main chain. With all many new staking incentives (token, NFTs airdrop, etc) we have the past months in form of ISPO, many smaller and less popular pools are struggling to maintain their delegated ADAs. Taking part in running the sidechain of Cardano will probably be the answer they need to keep their loyalty to our blockchain while still fulfilling all involved parties' objectives with some incentives. Therefore, I agree we need to put more resources into this topic in general and this proposal will be a great start.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Combined knowledge, skills, and experience in dcSpark team will likely speak for themselves. However, I cannot deny that some details are still lacking. Maybe we can start with knowing further things such as gauging how many SPOs are interested with the prospect, the qualifications of the SPOs, required pool parameters, etc.  With the beta of Milkomeda's mainnet will be released imminently, it will be safe to say that the proposal will be delivered promptly and aligning with the blockchain development timeline.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Though still lacking the mention of metrics to accurately measure this proposal implementation result, I think this can be figured out and easily be proven later when things mentioned in Feasibility section are implemented. However, it will be nicer if we have any brief attached with the proposal. The Github of the Milkomeda itself is cool enough to indicate the quality of the work the team will produce. Hopefully, the coming weeks we can see more positive announcement in form of live beta.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_943", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Connecting Cardano to EVM is a great solution to scale and connect Cardano with other blockchain platforms, especially Ethereum.

But, the proposal doesn't mention the training schedules, modules, and the detailed budget plan breakdown. How many stake pool operators are eligible for the subsequent training sessions?

", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although the proposal has its official website, it should have other social media channels to update the training progress or documentation.

The Milkomedia sidechain brings EVM support to the Cardano blockchain. As the ROI of ADA decreases for staking rewards over time as less inflation is offered by the protocol SPOs will need to have more income from other sources such as transaction fees or other validators and nodes. The Milkomeda validator node provides on of these business opportunities for SPOs and making it easy to learn and start using those validators presents an impactful opportunity and business model that can help the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team have a history working within IOG and Emurgo. The team now operators their own company dcSpark and have completed a number of Catalyst proposal that have shown they can execute the proposals they get funded for. The proposal team created the Milkomeda sidechain so are naturally also the right people to train others to start running the validator nodes required by the sidechain to operate.\r\n\r\nIdeally the proposal team would have broken down the budget more and given a better itemised list of exactly what the documentation would include and how they are training the SPOs in december.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal team gave an outline of starting work in December training the validators. No success objectives or KPIs were provided. It would have been good to understand what a successfully trained validator would look like. Perhaps they have covered some specific amount of content or have demonstrated a certain understanding. Or potentially it could be looking at the metrics for their validator and that they meet the thresholds for what would be considered a node that is being run correctly.
