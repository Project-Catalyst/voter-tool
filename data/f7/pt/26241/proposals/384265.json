Al\u00e9m disso, tenho sido um jogador durante toda a minha vida e tamb\u00e9m trabalhei como testador de jogos, por isso sei um pouco sobre a ind\u00fastria.\nEmbora a declara\u00e7\u00e3o do problema n\u00e3o identifique tanto um problema, como aponta algumas coisas que os jogadores gostam, podemos entender que a proposta visa criar um Free to play e Play para ganhar um jogo que daria aos jogadores muito controle sobre seus bens dentro do jogo, permitiria que eles ganhassem NFT's e tamb\u00e9m doassem para caridade. Como feedback ao proponente sobre esta parte: se voc\u00ea usar acr\u00f4nimos na declara\u00e7\u00e3o de abertura da proposta, explique o que os termos significam logo em seguida. N\u00e3o espere que os eleitores conhe\u00e7am estes termos, pois muitos deles n\u00e3o ser\u00e3o jogadores e alguns geralmente n\u00e3o ter\u00e3o muito conhecimento t\u00e9cnico. Tamb\u00e9m, mais tarde na proposta, \u00e9 mencionado que os fundos aqui s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para criar o MVP para o jogo. Isto deveria ter sido mencionado na solu\u00e7\u00e3o, na minha opini\u00e3o, para n\u00e3o confundir as pessoas a pensar que o resultado esperado aqui \u00e9 o jogo completo.\nO curto per\u00edodo de execu\u00e7\u00e3o do projeto, conforme descrito na se\u00e7\u00e3o Vis\u00e3o Geral do Jogo, \u00e9 que ser\u00e1 um jogo de cartas de xadrez royale de batalha (veja Might & Magic Chess Royale para uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o), onde as pessoas jogam umas contra as outras para ganhar EXP (o uso de EXP n\u00e3o \u00e9 detalhado), ouro pirata (que pode ser usado para comprar ba\u00fas dentro do jogo, o que, quando aberto, lhe d\u00e1 uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de fichas WOPRace, cart\u00f5es NFT ou outros ativos dentro do jogo). At\u00e9 onde eu entendo, estes tokens ser\u00e3o usados por meus jogadores, juntamente com os tokens WOP (que s\u00f3 podem ser comprados com ADA / fiat) para ent\u00e3o votar na dire\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo no DAO que ser\u00e1 estabelecido mais tarde. Os desenvolvedores tamb\u00e9m planejam tornar este jogo AR compat\u00edvel para ser jogado ao ar livre com telefones.\nConcordo que esta proposta trata efetivamente do desafio, uma vez que o que estamos procurando aqui s\u00e3o bons jogos para trazer pessoas para o ecossistema Cardano. Entretanto, n\u00e3o posso dar 5 estrelas, porque a proposta n\u00e3o falou sobre o que s\u00e3o as m\u00e9tricas de sucesso, nem como ser\u00e1 exatamente o MVP e quais s\u00e3o os planos para escalar no futuro. H\u00e1 algumas palavras no livro branco sobre sustentabilidade a longo prazo, mas estas se concentram no fato de que o jogo \u00e9 Livre para Jogar e s\u00e3o bastante vagas. Eu teria esperado ver proje\u00e7\u00f5es concretas para os pr\u00f3ximos meses / anos.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "O proponente forneceu um link para o site do projeto (https://worldofpirates.io), mas est\u00e1 meio vazio, para ser honesto. Os nomes e pap\u00e9is dos 5 membros da equipe podem ser vistos na se\u00e7\u00e3o crew (/contacto), mas estes n\u00e3o fornecem nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o que ainda n\u00e3o esteja mencionada na proposta (papel e experi\u00eancia passada). Tente acrescentar alguns v\u00ednculos sociais no futuro, por favor, para que qualquer um possa verificar facilmente que s\u00e3o pessoas reais. Lamento dizer que eu pessoalmente relatei uma proposta diferente aqui no Ideascale, porque afirmava que algumas pessoas trabalhavam para eles que n\u00e3o trabalhavam (cheguei at\u00e9 eles no LinkedIn e eles confirmaram isso).\nAl\u00e9m disso, outra parte importante que est\u00e1 faltando \u00e9 informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre como este projeto ser\u00e1 conclu\u00eddo. N\u00e3o temos um roteiro passo a passo, nem um cronograma com os resultados esperados ap\u00f3s 3-6-12 meses. Observe que a p\u00e1gina https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap para a qual voc\u00ea aponta est\u00e1 em branco. Voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m menciona que vendeu alguns NFT's e os doou a uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o de caridade, mas o link que voc\u00ea aponta para obter detalhes tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 em branco: https://www.worldofpirates.io/potm.\nA falta de todas estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es que apresentei acima, assim como nenhuma men\u00e7\u00e3o de poss\u00edveis riscos ou impedimentos ao projeto, diminui gravemente minha confian\u00e7a na viabilidade do projeto.\nA \u00fanica parte que tem um pouco mais de detalhes \u00e9 o or\u00e7amento, que \u00e9 calculado para os 3 meses seguintes (quanto tempo os proponentes consideram que levar\u00e1 para que eles criem o MVP). Os n\u00fameros aqui parecem confi\u00e1veis o suficiente, se um pouco altos ($4000 por m\u00eas por desenvolvedor e 3000 por m\u00eas por vendedor, para um total de $53000 em sal\u00e1rios, enquanto apenas $1200 \u00e9 estimado para custos de an\u00fancios). Ap\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m somar os custos com a infra-estrutura, o total soma at\u00e9 $60000. Mais uma vez, estes n\u00fameros s\u00e3o confi\u00e1veis, mas um pouco altos na minha opini\u00e3o para um projeto indie que est\u00e1 procurando come\u00e7ar. Entendo que as pessoas da equipe t\u00eam muita experi\u00eancia, mas talvez voc\u00ea queira considerar a possibilidade de procurar fontes de financiamento adicionais tamb\u00e9m, uma vez que n\u00e3o tenho certeza se o Catalyst sozinho pode cobrir tudo o que voc\u00ea precisa, de fundo em fundo.\nPara recapitular a viabilidade, os proponentes n\u00e3o forneceram links para verificar a experi\u00eancia da equipe, v\u00e1rios links em seu site aos quais se referem s\u00e3o apenas p\u00e1ginas em branco, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 roteiro ou cronograma, exceto pela men\u00e7\u00e3o de que o MVP levar\u00e1 3 meses para ser conclu\u00eddo e eu sinto que o or\u00e7amento \u00e9 bastante alto para um tempo t\u00e3o curto para um projeto indie. Com base nos dados acima, discordo que esta proposta possa ser implementada com sucesso.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Como descrito acima, a proposta \u00e9 clara o suficiente, pois quer criar um MVP para um jogo de cartas de xadrez royale de batalha livre, mas faltam muitos detalhes sobre como ele far\u00e1 isso. No futuro, favor acrescentar detalhes sobre qual ser\u00e1 a abordagem e quais ser\u00e3o os resultados em determinados intervalos (tente pensar em uma linha de tempo para seu projeto com marcos para os marcos de 3, 6 e 12 meses). Al\u00e9m disso, para que os projetos sejam audit\u00e1veis, voc\u00ea precisa de Indicadores Chave de Progresso mais detalhados. No momento, a proposta menciona apenas que ap\u00f3s entrar em contato com suas p\u00e1ginas sociais em 04.12.2021, voc\u00ea tem 300 membros no Discord, 100 seguidores no Twitter etc, mas o Project Catalyst precisa ser capaz de acompanhar seu progresso no futuro.

About our website, we currently focus on the characters, universe and the NFT part, but the website is a creature itself and it will evolve in the next months once we will focus more on the game MVP and next versions this will be reflected in the website too."}, {"q0": "This proposal is very well presented both in ideascale and in the recent ideafest presentation.

However for this specific proposal, which is developing an MVP, it is not particularly clear what the steps involved are to achieve the MVP. The proposal really needs a plan vs budget vs deliverables vs milestones to provide confidence in feasibility. At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date. This is a simple fix for the proposer, they need to due the due diligence on feasibility and i would suggest they reach out to a project manager/mentor to help with future proposals or presentations to a VC.\nA number of people are named in the proposal but it is not clear if these are actually going to be part of the delivery team. In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month. These are sensible assuming the named resource are simply taking this as their permanent salary and they do not need to engage contract resource which could cost significantly more.\nOn the basis of what i have seen from the ideafest video only have confidence to give this 3 stars.\nThere is a note about recruiting marketing and sales people. This is also a key risk to the project.

It is quite complete, both in terms of content and design. We have a lot of information about the project, and we can get to know it in an attractive way. Now talking about the idea itself: this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities. As a bonus, we could still meet one of Cardano's general objectives, which is to promote sustainability, through the donations made (the authors attach a link that is specifically about this, through which we can better understand this part of the donations).

The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training. The linkedin profiles were also linked, in the end of the proposal. It is also positive how they leave open the possibility of hiring freelancers for design and storytelling areas. That is, in relation to the team, I believe that everything is in order (I was just confused by this story of 80 years of experience). The money asked for funding is also explained very adequately; we know what each small fraction would correspond to for the execution of the project, even though it is a high value (60k) it is quite understandable for the many people who would work here and also the various activities that would take place.
