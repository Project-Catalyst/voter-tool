This surely fits the challenge settings since a game is based on this API.  I've read through the team and I have no doubt they will scale with challenges without an issue. This is one of the few proposals that I can't find anything missing. It really can be used as a template for other proposals.

These developers have been around and are active plutus pioneers and have proven the ability to get work done. I have no negative comments about the budget, which is a weak point in quite a few other proposals. There's a realistic timetable segregated by 2 week sprints, so be sure they know their work and are profecionals. There's a suitable plan for implementation and as a developer I'm itching to know more about the technical part of things.   Challenges and risks are considered and planed for. The project is in sync with what's already out there and is planning to help a lot of future development through this API.
