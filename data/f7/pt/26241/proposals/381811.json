Desta forma, o jogador faria uma esp\u00e9cie de investimento em si mesmo, e o prop\u00f3sito do jogo, como eu o entendo, \u00e9 que ele deveria estar em RPG e ter uma esp\u00e9cie de vibra\u00e7\u00e3o medieval. Isto pode funcionar porque uma parte consider\u00e1vel dos jogadores gostam de RPG e tamb\u00e9m se interessam por este tipo de universo. O jogo cumpre bem os objetivos do desafio de aumentar o n\u00famero de NFT pendentes em nossa cadeia de bloqueio, promovendo transa\u00e7\u00f5es em ada j\u00e1 que m\u00faltiplas vendas seriam feitas por contratos inteligentes, e atraindo novos usu\u00e1rios para o ecossistema j\u00e1 que as pessoas ficariam bem seduzidas com a proposta de lucrar literalmente jogando. Voc\u00ea pode entender melhor como esta quest\u00e3o de constru\u00e7\u00e3o mundial funcionaria no t\u00f3pico \"Construir / crescer juntos\". Os autores tamb\u00e9m fornecem um exemplo do que aconteceria na pr\u00e1tica durante o jogo, para que possamos entender mais firmemente o que est\u00e1 sendo descrito.

Os autores tamb\u00e9m se valem muito do que seria realizado no jogo, mas n\u00e3o falam sobre as atividades por tr\u00e1s dele. Por exemplo, no primeiro trimestre eles construiriam o mapa, para que os jogadores come\u00e7assem a ter algum tipo de contato com aquele universo. Certamente, para isso, seriam necess\u00e1rios desenvolvedores, animadores, designers e roteiristas. Eu gostaria de entender como seria seu trabalho di\u00e1rio, que pequenas tarefas eles poderiam fazer individualmente para construir este produto final juntos. Esta l\u00f3gica se estende a todos os marcos - qual \u00e9 o trabalho por tr\u00e1s de cada avan\u00e7o nas tecnologias de jogos? No entanto, estes marcos s\u00e3o muito interessantes at\u00e9 mesmo para realizar a auditabilidade, como detalharei no t\u00f3pico abaixo. Nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 invalidada. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao compartilhamento de custos, os autores pedem um alto montante de financiamento, 80k, que \u00e9 detalhado em alguns t\u00f3picos. Mas estes t\u00f3picos poderiam ser melhor explicados, por exemplo, 16k marketing: como isso seria feito? Que tipo de campanha eles pretendem realizar? Como atingir o p\u00fablico-alvo? 27k para a programa\u00e7\u00e3o da plataforma - esta \u00e9 uma grande quantidade e precisaria ser ainda mais dividida a fim de promover um entendimento mais s\u00f3lido. Acho que esta parte da proposta poderia ter incrementos. Eu adoraria entender como seria o projeto e a modelagem 3d (acho que este ramo \u00e9 muito interessante). Como isto seria feito, em etapas, por quem, por quanto tempo e etc.? Falando agora da equipe, nos s\u00e3o dados seus nomes, pap\u00e9is e perfis interligados. Na proposta, temos uma vis\u00e3o superficial do que eles fariam, mas atrav\u00e9s das redes sociais poder\u00edamos conhec\u00ea-los com mais precis\u00e3o, de modo que parte da proposta seja satisfat\u00f3ria.

There is a link of great website in the proposal, but I was a little suspicious by the fact that the games posted on the page are misleading because they pointed out that they are finished and can be downloaded from the apple store, but unfortunately these games do not exist. The team is transparent which is a great thing. The budget is clearly defined but I personally don't prefere a proponent of large sums. In my opinion, it would be better if the requested amount of $ 80,000 was halved and half of the funds were requested in this Catalyst F7 and half in the Catalyst F8. Maybe the budget is realistic for the realization of such a project. It would be good to see within the budget allocation how many hours it takes to build certain parts of the project. Detailed implementable plan is excellently presented and details of actionable tasks and order of execution also exist. Any project that has a time frame of a year is quite risky in my opinion because we never know what can happen. So I advocate shorter time frames. The proposal states a time frame of as much as 18 months, which sounds quite unrealistic for a project like this in terms of the speed of project implementation.
