Por exemplo, uma m\u00e9trica \u00e9 que mais de 10 DAOs seriam atra\u00eddos pelo projeto para Cardano. Como isto seria julgado?

Presumably we can infer that this person will not necessarily build the prototype, but rather \"consult\" on design, stack, etc.  I also assume that the Budget item called \"Technical Architecture\" is intended for paying that consultant, though this is not clear from the proposal.  With the benefit of doubt and given that the Budget is only for the first three months and it is clear that further fundraising and recruiting will be required beyond that, I feel more comfortable that the proposers can feasibly execute on the proposed project's first three months.

Furthermore, I think the proposers could make the case that the deliverables can be documented for accountability and transparency.

Furthermore, those KPIs are stated rather vaguely, with little discussion of how they can be measured or what measured values would be considered \"success\".

Two months at $2,500 / month for an outside technical resource to develop the architecture would seem to me to be a major barrier to success.  Personally, I would rate the likelyhood of success as perhaps a four or a five if it had a higher proposal amount that reflected what would seem to be a more realistic estimate of the technical aspects.
