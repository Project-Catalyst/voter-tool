Acho que isto se encaixa perfeitamente no objetivo do desafio de desenvolver ferramentas para o gerenciamento de DAOs.  Estou dando a mais alta classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de impacto porque acredito que o desenvolvimento bem sucedido deste projeto pode melhorar muito a comunidade Cardano, tanto melhorando o processo Catalyst, resultando em melhores e mais eficazes decis\u00f5es, como tamb\u00e9m estabelecendo ferramentas que ser\u00e3o valiosas para mais projetos em Cardano.

Dito isto, penso que um plano para uma eventual integra\u00e7\u00e3o com os contratos inteligentes da Cardano pode afetar as decis\u00f5es da UI/UX, por isso sugiro que isto seja considerado pelo menos desde cedo, trazendo algu\u00e9m com a experi\u00eancia necess\u00e1ria no caso de a equipe n\u00e3o a ter.

O ponto para o primeiro trimestre de 2022 \u00e9 ousado e enfatizado, mas n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro o que isso indica.  Eu poderia interpretar isto para indicar que este ponto \u00e9 todo o escopo do financiamento proposto, o que parece ser mais ou menos consistente com as quebras de custo (exceto que estas incluem aplica\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00f3veis enquanto o ponto menciona apenas \"aplica\u00e7\u00e3o web\").  Com esta interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o, parece que as fases subsequentes, incluindo Gamification, Delegation e Smart Contract Integration, estariam fora do escopo desta proposta, e presumivelmente seriam cobertas por propostas futuras.

As principais m\u00e9tricas me parecem razo\u00e1veis em geral, mas menos claramente \u00fateis para a presta\u00e7\u00e3o de contas desta proposta em particular.

Dito isto, eles s\u00e3o razoavelmente espec\u00edficos e mensur\u00e1veis, e razoavelmente interpret\u00e1veis a prazos razo\u00e1veis.
