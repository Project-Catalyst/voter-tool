It is still unknown whether a team of people will work on this project. It would be good to have some information about the team. As shown in the proposal, the budget seems acceptable and the goal could be achieved. The proposal does not require additional funding for this project. The feasible plan exists but is not detailed and it would be good if there was more information on the feasibility of the plan. In this way, they would have more certainty in the feasibility of the project itself. It would be good to have details of actionable tasks and order of execution so we would get extra confidence in the project. The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work but I am not sure how the project will be financed and finished because they lack data.
