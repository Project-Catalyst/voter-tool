It is true that Meta, Google, Twitch and other such giants are a gate through which content creators need to pass, if they want their content to get out into the world.\r\nThe solution however, mentions a smart contract called Looking-Glass, which would supposedly enforce distribution rights and royalties as configured by the creators, but there is no explanation of how this smart contract works, how it would be integrated with the media giants, what configuration options the content creators have etc. This is all crucial data that is missing from the proposal. \r\nThis project sounds like an integration solution (of a media platform and a Cardano smart contract), so it fits in the DApps & Integration challenge, but the proposal fails to describe how it would accomplish this. In order for it to be more clear, it would have to add details about how it would convince the media giants to be a part of this, as well as define KPI's clearly and specify a concrete, well described goal.

Lastly, 14 years of experience of web analytics and managing large technical projects are mentioned, but no references are provided to verify this. It's a good idea to try to add at least a Linkedin page to back you up.\r\nI strongly disagree that this proposal can be implemented successfully, due to the lack of information on the team who would work on this, no details on how the very large budget of 45000 USD would be used, no risk analysis and no plan outlining the technical approach and the usage of resources concretely.
