Yes it is an integration of sorts and eventually a Dapp perhaps, but the problem that is being addressed is sort of counter productive because it focuses on using Fiat. Yes you need to exchange your ADA to pay for things in Fiat, but that could be one transaction a month. The same goes for the other way around. Fiat to ADA. One transaction a month. It's weird that the title is Local Charity Fundraising Platform when the main focus is on saving on transaction fees from exchanging ADA and Fiat. You can create 2 pools. Let people fund the Fiat pool and let people Fund the ADA pool. You might never have to exchange ADA for Fiat ever again on any exchange because you have 2 big pools. Problem solved. The initial plan isn't well thought through or communicated correctly so it's hard to see how this will ad value to the Cardano system. There is no metrics aligned with the Challenge and I don't think this project will scale well as the plan needs some work.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "A link has been provided to a newly created Github page with info about the project. No proof of skills or team has been provided. The budget will be used to pay for on chain transaction fees. $10000. This makes no sense at all. I firmly believe a better model can be created that saves on reducing unnecessary transactions. The whole proposal revolves around building a token to fiat bridge to save on transaction costs. Reading the proposal you forget that it is a Charity fundraising platform. Maybe getting more team members on board will help you solve this transaction fee problem and shift your focus back to the Charity fundraising platform. No risks have been considered, the challenge presented again focuses on the high transaction fees. Refining the initial plan and showing that you are aware and prepared for future risks will develop trust on your project.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Roadmap with milestones for Fund 7 and Fund 8 has been created. All mostly focusing on the token to fiat bridge. KPIs include finishing some parts of the project and collecting data on transaction fees. They identify the problem of high transaction fees when paying with a credit card to fund charities and they try to solve this by creating an open source token to fiat batch processing service. The problem and solution doesn't have to exist, it almost feels as if both are created and not necessarily real. The problem doesn't have to be a problem. You don't have to walk through a rock, you can walk around it. Maybe I am misinterpreting  this proposal and it just needs someone to better explain the problem and solution here.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_140", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 10, "ng": 14, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal identifies a clear existing challenge and provides a solution to funds getting lost through charities.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a lot of experience regarding software engineering, they run a stakepool which means they are imbedded in the cardano community. Since this is a big project it also helps that there are 3 partner companies working on the product. They provided a clear Dev roadmap and their budget is reasonable for what they are asking and will be enough to cover on-chain transaction fees in modelling and testing best methods to store native token transactions across the 3 stakeholder groups.

This application matches the challenge settings as it's a dapp that will increase cardano adoption and utility. There's a clear in how exactly will value will be added to the cardano ecosystem. Unlike many other proposals this one has not only KPIs, but KPIs that are related to the challenge. One thing not mentioned in the proposal is future challenges that can be faced, related to the implementation or adoption of the project. IMHO it's an important part of every proposal, so the authors might want to add a few lines concerning the unknown future. This project adds promise and hope to the ecosystem which is always needed. As a developer I don't have any major concerns with the proposal. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are some links and reference links that seem valid as far as project credability goes. I would have been a lot happier if this about to be plutus developer had a name to him so I could verify, but that's not to say I don't trust them, just just like to connect a face to a project. There's a mention of three partner companies developing version one, but no names or referals again, which is a bit disappointing. Even so a comprehensive roadmap with specific milestones is provided and it's clear and understandable enough. The only thing not clear is how many people are going to work on this roadmap, because as a developer I would be able to tell if the timetable is relevant or not, because one person can do only so much work for a given time.  Other than that, the plan seem sensible for the required implementation. There are iterative steps taken to meet the end goal. There are some mentioned resources necessary to implement the proposal, but I would always ask for more specifics to be able to verify what's promised in the proposal. The technical aspects are mentioned enogh to be understandable and they make sense.   Overall I think this project is feasible. If implemented it will bring cardano adoption.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project will be open source so I see no problem with tracability for anyone interested. There's a github repo link which anyone can use to have a peek at the progress and the implementation. Metrics and KPIs are relevant and most important present in the proposal. This is very important for me, as I dabble in optimization and a process that is not monitored can not be optimized. There's a roadmap with milestones and a yet to be seen sensible time horizon.
