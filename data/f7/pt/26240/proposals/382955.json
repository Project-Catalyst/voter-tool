Usar contratos inteligentes e tecnologia Blockchain nos mercados \u00e9 definitivamente uma \u00e1rea relativamente inexplorada e subdesenvolvida, e seria revolucion\u00e1ria se o projeto correto fosse desenvolvido. Se tal projeto (como esta proposta, por exemplo) fosse desenvolvido em Cardano, ele n\u00e3o s\u00f3 revolucionaria o mercado imobili\u00e1rio em geral, mas tamb\u00e9m atrairia uma das ind\u00fastrias mais rent\u00e1veis do mundo.

Seria um uso muito bom do tesouro Catalyst (mesmo pedindo cerca de 20% do total dos fundos para o desafio), mas eu gostaria de ter visto detalhes mais espec\u00edficos ligados ao desenvolvimento do projeto. A id\u00e9ia central e o conceito \u00e9 surpreendente, mas para que eu (como um consultor comunit\u00e1rio experiente) pudesse avaliar a proposta, precisaria ter mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es inclu\u00eddas nela.

A fim de avaliar a viabilidade desta proposta, a proposta precisa descrever quem estar\u00e1 trabalhando no projeto, e como. H\u00e1 uma men\u00e7\u00e3o de contrata\u00e7\u00e3o de desenvolvedores experientes e uma data estimada de lan\u00e7amento da plataforma de 2024, mas seria valioso saber se esses desenvolvedores j\u00e1 est\u00e3o contratados, quantas horas por semana eles trabalhariam e qual a grande parte do or\u00e7amento que ser\u00e1 alocada a eles.

Uma sugest\u00e3o poderia ser expandir o roteiro do projeto, adicionar alguns marcos (onde estar\u00e1 o projeto em 3 meses, 6 meses, 12 meses?) e algumas medidas de sucesso (KPIs).
