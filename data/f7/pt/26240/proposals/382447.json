Se os proponentes quiserem fazer uma ferramenta para an\u00e1lise de NFTs, eles est\u00e3o na configura\u00e7\u00e3o de desafio correta.

Minha sugest\u00e3o para propostas futuras seria ler toda a proposta como um eleitor para sua proposta e procurar em todos os links \u00e0 esquerda para ter certeza de que eles funcionam antes de finalizar uma proposta.
