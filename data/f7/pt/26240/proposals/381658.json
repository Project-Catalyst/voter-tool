The proposer describes briefly what steps are required but there are really no details on the How to achieve these or on any of the technical and logistics aspects. This would be a huge project, and each of the 4 steps you describe could have their own proposal. I would suggest creating a proposal focused on the first step - \"Build a decentralized ID system for governance and delivery reputation management\".

In addition to this, I learned some programming during my university studies, so I can comprehend the basic ideas behind a lot of the technical details.
