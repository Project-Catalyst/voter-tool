It's supposed to make logins easier through the ownership of a specific NFT. This is an interesting idea as the proposers states that it would bring less attack vectors for hacking accounts. As it's stated it's a B2B solution mainly but has many other applications as well. The proposal doesn't state exactly how does it plan to add value to the cardano ecosystem, it's more implicity implied value by multiple busineses using the solution.  I didn't see any key metrics or measure mentioned in the proposal or resource links. The proposal currently lacks clear explanation. I see a lot of ideas that are flying around without having a common explanation and a roadmap that put things into perspective. I've read proposals that offer NFT authentication and it would be interesting to see the competition play out. As a developer I'm a bit worried about pasting a javascript in anywhere, because this would be a significant attack vector for businesses that do that to enable Naptcha. Overall I think it's a good proposal, but the proposal content lacks structure and effort.

There are no specific types or number of team members mentioned so that doesn't bring trust to me as a voter. I've listened through the video which is just a discussion of how a project should be build and not a solution plan. After reading through all the resources the presentations slides I was left wandering is this a proposal for Naptcha Dropnir or both? Further more I struggled to understand all the architecture pictures that lacked a decent explanation for someone just getting to know the project (i suppose they could make sense if you're involved in the project The budget was not broken down or mentioned in the proposal which worries me. I'm still unsure about the project timeline as it's not mentioned anywhere in the proposal or the video. I see no sensible plan for implementation, just a lot of very good ideas that are being discussed. I don't see the exact resources that would be necessary to implement the proposal. There are glimpses of technical aspects of the proposal like providing a javascript snippet to be pasted on the user site, which seems absurd to me as a developer and it introduces plenty of attack vectors to worry about. I just think the proposal is in its very very early stages of development and is not yet ready for implementation. I'd encourage the authors to see what other projects are doing and see if any form of collaboration can't be formed. https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/NFT-based-authentication/384854-48088 this is an example of one simmilar project that wants to do an NFT authentication and I hope the proposers reach out to this project.

Good luck!", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Talking about auditability the project catalyst already has a system in place to check on progress, but aside from that I found no mention of channels that would keep in touch with the community and let them know about the projects progress. No relevant metrics or KPIs were mentioned in the resources. There was no clear roadmap with milestones and a set time frame to execute.  I didn't understand the problem this solution is trying to solve so the problem statement could have been articulated better. I would suggest for the benefit of future proposers for the author to put themselves in the shoes of a voter and think about what's expected as well as check out a few other proposals from previous funds to checkout how an excellent proposal looks like.

I apologize if I'm wrong, but it seems to be the exact opposite to me, first you should figure out the utility of your system and then mint the token. I'd be interested to hear counter-arguments to this.\r\nThe solution does not help me out much either, as it very generally describes a service (called Naptcha) that would somehow link native tokens to actions (users?) would perform on sites and this would combine into \"unique business models\". It would be useful to hear a practical use case here, or a detailed description of what the end product would look like, what type of business would want it and what they could do with it. There is a youtube video added here, which seems to discuss this service, but frankly, it is 1 hour long and a proposal should be able to distill the information for the people reading it. I do not think voters would watch 10 minute videos on each proposal, much less 1 hour ones. \r\nThis project wants to develop a sort of integration service, so it fits in the DApps & Integration challenge I think, but the proposal fails to describe how this would be done.

It's a good idea to try to add at least a Linkedin page to back you up. Lastly, the proposer has not mentioned what his affiliation with Naptcha and the team discussing it in the youtube video is.
