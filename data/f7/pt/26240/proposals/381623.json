There were a lot of  abbreviations I didn't understand like: \"peps\", \"atm\", \"bsc\" \"cNFTS\". I searched for them, but I'm still unsure about some of them. Since the proposal wants to build a dapp or some kind of a decentralized platform, it should fit the challenge it's in. The proposal has some issue with clearly articulating what problem does it solve and how will it bring value to the cardano ecosystem. For me there were glimpses but the overall picture eludes me. The metrics are related to the platform growth which is reasonable and in line with the growth measurement. I'm not sure about the proposal being able to scale, but I'll touch on that in the feasability section. Compared to other proposals this one is missing a couple of key items like: the team standing behind the proposal, skillsets, challenges that the project is expecting to fail along with a couple of minor ones. I'm sure this proposal will bring something to the table, because the idea to mix games and an nft marketplace is very intriguing to me. As a developer I'm a bit woried about the implementation, since no specific people or needed skillset is mentioned. Overall I believe this project could have some impact for the cardano community if it's better structured and a couple of key elements are added in.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Unfortunately the authors of the proposal haven't left any links or references to team members or skillset necessary for the proposals implementation. This is really a bummer for me, because a known team standing with their names behind an idea brings more credability to a proposal in the eyes of the voter. Maybe the proposer has forgotten to include team members or just hasn't gotten the clear idea of the skillset necessary to finish the implementation. The budget is just an outline without any specific breakdown. I would suggest to the authors to check out other proposals and I believe it could be greatly beneficial for them to do so to improve their own proposal for the next funding rounds.  I saw a lot of interesting ideas in this proposal, but none of them felt like a well formulated plan yet. So there's no clarity for the implementation as well. As I mentioned I'm not sure if the proposal will be able to scale since the team members or possible team members are not mentioned and neither are future challenges or a specific roadmap with concrete milestones. The technical aspects of the proposal are not mentioned.   I encourage the proposers to work on this and give a new and improved version that has all the suggestions from myself and the comments implemented in the next funding round. Good luck!

I've found that a discord or a telegram channel does wanders for forming a community arround an idea. There are some relevant metrics concerningg adoption and possible user count for the platform, which is great, because no process can be optimized if it's not measured first.  The description of the whole proposal can be more clear so that anyone can understand it. It will help if not so many abbreviations are used. The problem statement as well as the solution needs some work. My suggestion would be to put yourselves in the shoes of the voter that sees your project for the first time and should understand what it's all about by a glancing read.
