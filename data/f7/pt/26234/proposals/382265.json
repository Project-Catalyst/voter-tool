A integra\u00e7\u00e3o da cultura, filosofia e artes tem sido um processo osm\u00f3tico dentro do Catalyst at\u00e9 hoje - no fundo, sem cultivo - e esta proposta procura trazer o papel destas \u00e1reas para o primeiro plano com espa\u00e7o dedicado e membros respons\u00e1veis da comunidade para conduzir a discuss\u00e3o.  Como a filosofia e as artes s\u00e3o ferramentas para descobrir e imbuir significado, faz sentido incentivar o desenvolvimento dessas ferramentas ao lado das NFTs e interc\u00e2mbios, guiando uns aos outros de maneiras cuidadosamente pensadas.  Resta ver como a comunidade est\u00e1 ansiosa para que esta avenida reivindique alguma da limitada largura de banda de aten\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria para navegar em espa\u00e7os j\u00e1 vastos de Catalyst (os esfor\u00e7os iniciais das equipes de proposta indicaram a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de 30 pessoas), mas isso poderia ser apenas o come\u00e7o.  Al\u00e9m de encorajar um di\u00e1logo sobre o papel dos criativos no ecossistema Cardano, esta proposta n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito espec\u00edfica sobre o que poderia ser o resultado desta campanha.

Embora n\u00e3o seja explicitamente declarado, o roteiro (sess\u00f5es de enxame criativo, idea\u00e7\u00e3o voltada para o estabelecimento de quest\u00f5es e objetivos criativos fundamentais para Cardano, e prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de novos membros para os processos Catalisador e de proposta) parece levar \u00e0 cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma equipe de desafio do Fundo8 baseada em torno dos criativos.  Para este fim, o roteiro lista objetivos concretos, como o estabelecimento de sess\u00f5es de enxameamento confi\u00e1veis ao longo de 3 meses, mantendo e apresentando seus canais de m\u00eddia dentro do Catalyst.  Embora o cronograma do roteiro seja um tanto vago, os marcos s\u00e3o espec\u00edficos e realiz\u00e1veis.  A capacidade de apoiar-se nas equipes e protocolos de enxame existentes d\u00e1 a esta proposta uma alta probabilidade de sucesso.

Outra medida que eles deveriam considerar, especialmente se acreditarem que poderiam patrocinar uma equipe de desafio no Fundo8, seria uma s\u00e9rie de cen\u00e1rios de desafio muito espec\u00edficos a serem curados durante os primeiros meses e reuni\u00f5es.  Um exemplo poderia ser um conceito como \"valor\", que tem ra\u00edzes profundas na filosofia e na arte, e dedicar sess\u00f5es de rumina\u00e7\u00e3o em enxame para criar um cen\u00e1rio de desafio detalhado e concreto em torno dele.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 12, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This will be a beautiful inclusion to the Cardano ecosystem. For I see this as an embryo towards the creation of Cardano art community, which is very important, the reason being will come later. General public might dismiss art due to the over-saturation of NFT projects which by it's nature to some extent is being exploited by individuals or entities, whether that be giving value to NFT through hype or market manipulation. Both practices has occurred in major NFT marketplaces and NFT issued by brands or influencers. Art's value is slowly being redefined by this practice and by the misconception of associating the current NFT with art. When there is a strong community of artists, curators, collectors, historians and educators talking to each other from around the world discussing blockchain and it's interaction with art in one forum, only then can NFT have value that is rooted in history, in art education, in techniques, in differentiation and not in hype. NFT is here to stay but NFT will evolve. Although this proposal articulates well it's intent, it's effectiveness in growing Cardano through the metrics of the Challenge setting, is a visionary sell. Meaning, only those who have the knowledge, understands the value of this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team involved and whom are in the proposal, on the basis of what is stated, correlates well the intent, knowledge and the implementation plan inside this proposal. There is also a mentioning of a co-proposer, though details regarding their background is limited. I can only wish there were links to the proposers but to a certain extent I can understand the nature of individuals from the art field. This though is counter-balanced by their timetable which is very detailed and also the intent to collaborate with Catalyst Swarm, a reputable community within Cardano. Proposer has also considered the challenge and risk they will face, which although is an obligation, not many take effort into explaining them such as what the proposer has done. This must be valued as upholding the standards of a good proposal. The small budget provided is also sufficient in comparison to the timeline determined and goals to be achieved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Again there is a detailed roadmap, although not attached with numerical targets, situations correlating with art is valued not by numbers but by the quality of engagement.
