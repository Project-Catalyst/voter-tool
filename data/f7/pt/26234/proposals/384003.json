They include Number of attendees, Percentage who become CAs, Percentage who become referrers, Number of brilliant proposals to solve local problems, Percentage who become proposers, Number of students who create native cardano wallets, no of new voters, local Haskell Developers, Number of schools who participate, Number of corporates who participate. \r\n \r\nThe key metrics and goals   fall within the scope of the challenge\r\n   \r\nProposal can possibly scale up by bringing in new schools and universities, corporates and organizations. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by enabling ease of seeing events going on as well as listing yhour own event\r\n\r\nI can say that this proposal  adequately addresses the challenge   hence i have given it a 5 star rating.\r\n \r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.  I also have run a web development company from 1997 and have been the author of many ground breaking projects in web and Flash related projects in my country.I have done live event with guests in studio, discussing various topics on the State Broadcasting Channels for both National and International audiences.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe proposers  has  provided some evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in  conference management.

So with just one event I cannot call a person experienced but can say he has experience of organizing one event. \r\n\r\nDoes proposer know, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal?\r\n The type and number of team members required to implement the proposal is not fully known\r\n \r\n \r\nThe team structure is listed as the two leaders but other team members are not listed.  \r\n \r\n \r\n The budget has  been given in detail. It is somewhat high in my professional opinion as a CEO of a web development company for over 10 years and organizer of various events.\r\nMost of the money has been allocated for conference venue, incentivizing organizers and beer and apertivo which are unnecessary expenses in my opinion. \r\nAlso travel expenses of resources persons is another expense. In this case a better option is to have an online conference. Another large cost component is refreshements and gadgets\r\n \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals.   \r\n \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required \r\n\r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\n \r\n \r\nTheres a realistic timetable  to complete the work\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how?\r\n \r\nThe proposal gives  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.  .\r\n \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are  described.   \r\n  \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have  been addressed \r\n\r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal  \r\n \r\nGiven experience and plan presented it is possible this proposal will be implemented successfully\r\n This proposal is detailed but budget is much higher than it could be if considered a little more, hence I have given it a 3 star rating.   \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

Since I am also Participating in catalyst since several funds I am competent to determine what kind of community events could be beneficial. The proposal identifies a valid place where a community event could have an impact and will, if executed correctly, add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

There is no fault in that, but the Challenge setting does continuously mention Project Catalyst. This also continues into the metric to be measured, which the majority are related to components in Project Catalyst, such as; CA's, voters and proposals.
