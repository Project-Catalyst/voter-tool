", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience of the WADA in the Cardano community cannot be overestimated hence their track record makes them the ideal team for this project. More importantly, the target audience is well captured and there is a well-developed timeline for the proposal. Also, there are well outlined events scheduled within specific timeline for the project and a work breakdown structure is also incorporated within the proposal. The events scheduled for the proposal will definitely increase the cardano presence in the north of Ghana and also increase the number of ADA holders. Additional, the proposal also provides a detailed breakdown of the budgetary allocation for each activity the team seeks to undertake. Therefore, with the inclusion of a well-developed timelines for each event and a proper budgetary allocation, it will be very easy implementing the project successfully", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project provides a metric to monitor and track the progress and success of the project.
