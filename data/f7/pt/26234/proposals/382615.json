Achei interessante como os autores pensaram sobre este projeto de forma circular, ou seja, eles n\u00e3o pretendem apenas introduzir e desenvolver o conte\u00fado com estes estudantes, mas acompanh\u00e1-los e orient\u00e1-los durante o processo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o e apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de propostas. Desta forma, haveria um acompanhamento mais completo com os jovens, pois n\u00e3o s\u00f3 lhes seria ensinado o que \u00e9 Cardano, mas como lan\u00e7ar e executar projetos na cadeia de bloqueio, atrav\u00e9s do financiamento do Catalyst.

Sobre essa parte, \u00e9 excelente. \u00c9 transmitida muita confian\u00e7a na capacidade dos autores de executar o projeto com sucesso, principalmente porque todos eles s\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de tecnologia.
