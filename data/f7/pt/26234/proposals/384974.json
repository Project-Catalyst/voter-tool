Therefore, it would be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem to promote classes/courses that teach these students to work with their technologies. In this way, \"events\" would be carried out with the purpose of instructing them. It is positive that the author already has in mind a place (Colorado) and even better, some universities, where he can start to apply the work. This demonstrates that he thought about the practice of the project, beyond just a theoretical and abstract plan. He also has a very specific target audience, which would be computing and design students with more than three years of training, which is another way to demonstrate how he already took care of the pragmatic details of the thing. I believe that, even though it is not a traditional event, it is an action that will promote the union of people in favor of learning (can you call it a hub?), and the products that would result from such meetings would be very impactful for the ecosystem. Therefore, I believe that the proposal is very relevant and positive for this topic of analysis.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately at this point I will have some observations of aspects that are worrisome. Starting with the author's preparation: he gives us very little about himself, we don't know what his background was; how many years he worked in the drop shipping field (I didn't even know this term and I had to do some research to understand); his area of \u200b\u200bprofessional activity has nothing to do with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem (at least I didn't see any relationship, if there is, it would be necessary for the author to clarify); it does not define the formation of a team, we do not know which other professionals would be involved in the project (many would be needed: marketing, professors, designers...); in general, the author seems to me unprepared to carry out this proposal. Nothing here gives me the feeling that he has the technical knowledge to turn the project into reality, despite having given some practical details, as I mentioned in the topic above. About a script: it doesn't exist. The author does not determine which activities would be carried out to achieve the final product, in which order, how long each would take, etc., that is, we do not have any information on how the process of carrying out this proposal would take place. And finally, the budget division even exists, but it is very lacking in detail, when he talks about transport, for example. Take who where? Hours of work: who would work for how many hours and at what hourly rate? Anyway, there is an almost complete absence of the items analyzed in this topic, I suggest that the author reformulate the proposal including the necessary information.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "In terms of auditability, it is better than the topic analyzed above, but there is still a lot to be improved. The author provides information on what success would look like, but this is done in a very superficial way. For example, he sets 3 months to enter into contact with universities. Why would it take so long just to establish initial communication? He says that in 6 months, 2 university clubs should be up and running, but he doesn't specify what that would be like. For example, how often would they be taking class? How many students are expected, on average, per class? And the success metrics are existent but they are also very shallow, I didn't understand the \"web traffic\" part, because this event seemed to be in person, what would you need to monitor online, exactly? The other metrics are based on measuring how many students/universities were mobilized by the project, which I believe is the most basic data of the proposal. I think it would be necessary for the author to elaborate some more specific, more numerous and detailed data that would be able to give us a solid notion of how the project was being developed. It would also be great if there was some contact with the students, to understand if they decided to work with Cardano, to hear about their experiences, the quality of the teachings passed on, etc. This part could be done directly by the community. I think there is even information to monitor the project, but not enough.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasibility:\nThe team behind the this proposal is NFT-DAO which is stated in the proposer document as well as highlighted in blue below the title of the proposal.\n\nThe relevant experience section is small, which doesn't leave room to elaborate on oneself and you can't insert a link to portfolios, Linkedin, etc. This is a consistent feature through other proposals as well.
