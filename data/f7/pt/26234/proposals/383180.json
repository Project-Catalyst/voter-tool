Desde o in\u00edcio, a declara\u00e7\u00e3o de problema n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma declara\u00e7\u00e3o de problema, o que j\u00e1 estabelece o tom negativo.

O 3-star pode parecer alto, mas por experi\u00eancia pessoal, fazer parte de uma grande exposi\u00e7\u00e3o pode aumentar a consci\u00eancia da marca, neste caso a marca Cardano's Gaming Ecosystem, mas voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 de muitas ferramentas de engajamento para alcan\u00e7ar isto.

Isto talvez n\u00e3o se correlacione bem com o que eles est\u00e3o propondo agora, que \u00e9 ter um evento em uma grande exposi\u00e7\u00e3o.

This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs. It could then act as a pilot exhibition & proposers could then come back in a future fund with 'proof' and arrange a much larger event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides a decent outline of a plan but it is not easy to understand.\r\nA simple presentation would have helped showing how activities, resources and funds  are aligned.\r\nThe $15k is not broken down so it is impossible to work out how its going to be spent.\r\nThe proposers could really help themselves by adding their LinkedIn profiles or evidence of their experience in this area.\r\n\r\ni hope the proposer takes onboard these comments in a positive light and returns with a more coherent proposal or uses the comments section or ideafest to provide clarity on the questions answered.

Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.
