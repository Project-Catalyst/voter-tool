Eles poderiam nos informar em que m\u00eas cada um deles ocorreria, onde seria sua localiza\u00e7\u00e3o exata, quem os apresentaria, seu p\u00fablico estimado e assim por diante. Observa-se que os autores t\u00eam fortes parcerias, incluindo o grupo WADA, que j\u00e1 \u00e9 bem conhecido no Catalyst por lan\u00e7ar projetos que afetam positivamente o continente africano. Tais conex\u00f5es s\u00e3o essenciais para garantir uma boa bagagem e apoio de qualidade para o projeto, certamente com esta equipe geral os workshops teriam um alto padr\u00e3o; entretanto, gostaria que os autores tivessem informado, como disse acima, quem os apresentaria.

Por exemplo, de onde viriam os palestrantes para justificar tal valor? Entretanto, penso que mesmo sem um detalhe profundo, temos uma no\u00e7\u00e3o muito clara de como o dinheiro seria investido.
