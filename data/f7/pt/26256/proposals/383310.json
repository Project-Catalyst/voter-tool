Tamb\u00e9m tenho algumas d\u00favidas sobre o problema que esta proposta tenta resolver, bem como sobre a solu\u00e7\u00e3o proposta.  Ela sugere que o crowdfunding est\u00e1 ausente da \u00c1frica, mas o crowdfunding em toda a \u00c1frica foi estabelecido e cresceu rapidamente desde que explodiu em 2016, com op\u00e7\u00f5es apoiadas pela BTC na maioria dos principais jogadores como Thundafund.  Enquanto uma plataforma de crowdfunding da ADA seria um embaixador bem-vindo da comunidade Cardano/Africa (na medida em que se destaca do... Projeto Catalyst), esta proposta mal visita a id\u00e9ia.  Ao inv\u00e9s disso, os primeiros 6 meses de financiamento se concentram na finaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um piloto de c\u00e2mbio ADA/moeda local existente e de uma campanha de m\u00eddia social para impulsionar a ado\u00e7\u00e3o da mesma.  Estima-se que o lan\u00e7amento e teste subseq\u00fcente de uma plataforma de crowdfunding \u00e9 planejado para entregar seu primeiro projeto financiado totalmente um ano ap\u00f3s o in\u00edcio do financiamento, com a maioria dos KPI relacionados ao sucesso do Exchange subjacente.  Esta proposta tem um objetivo ambicioso para seu crowdfunding:  100 projetos financiados a 100 milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares no segundo ano da proposta.  Ela sugere ainda mais escalas, particularmente para a troca, de modo que se deve assumir que o lado do crowdfunding se beneficiaria tamb\u00e9m desse crescimento, embora nada mais seja mencionado.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Esta proposta ambiciosa carece de uma s\u00e9rie de indicadores-chave que aumentariam em muito a confian\u00e7a em sua execu\u00e7\u00e3o.  O escopo do projeto \u00e9 desvinculado do financiamento em seu or\u00e7amento e dos recursos propostos, particularmente do pessoal.  \u00c9 dif\u00edcil imaginar a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma bolsa de divisas, o desenvolvimento e o lan\u00e7amento de uma incubadora de incubadoras financiada por uma multid\u00e3o, enquanto impulsiona os n\u00fameros de ado\u00e7\u00e3o visados com uma equipe de duas pessoas.  Al\u00e9m disso, n\u00e3o houve nenhuma liga\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica ou evid\u00eancia dada para as qualifica\u00e7\u00f5es da equipe de desenvolvimento e marketing, emprestando d\u00favida sobre sua capacidade de executar at\u00e9 mesmo uma vers\u00e3o despojada das fases iniciais do plano.  O or\u00e7amento foi descrito claramente, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o pareceu suficientemente vinculado a um roteiro para fornecer um caminho claro para a proposta, como quais componentes precisariam ser desenvolvidos, quais recursos fora do espa\u00e7o de escrit\u00f3rios e hospedagem precisariam ser assegurados, nem como certos objetivos como reuni\u00f5es sociais deveriam ser financiados e executados.  Al\u00e9m disso, o processo de estabelecer at\u00e9 mesmo um interc\u00e2mbio local b\u00e1sico est\u00e1 repleto de responsabilidade e risco, e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma sugest\u00e3o nesta proposta de que estas id\u00e9ias sejam compreendidas.  Ao lado de um roteiro detalhado para os primeiros 3-6 meses de financiamento, seria \u00fatil ver uma an\u00e1lise de risco convincente dos pares criptogr\u00e1ficos de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o na moeda et\u00edope local, e a estabilidade que o ETB de uma pessoa poderia adquirir atrav\u00e9s de tal plataforma.

Apenas concentrando-se nos primeiros 6 meses de desenvolvimento, antes do objetivo declarado de estabelecer uma plataforma de financiamento de multid\u00f5es, seria aconselh\u00e1vel declarar certas m\u00e9tricas que poderiam ajudar a estabelecer a confian\u00e7a no projeto: usu\u00e1rios semanais ou quinzenais que se espera que estejam a bordo do dex, m\u00e9tricas de engajamento nas m\u00eddias sociais, indicadores do que faria com que os desenvolvedores se encontrassem para dar o pontap\u00e9 inicial do projeto.  Deveria haver mais, mas isto seria um bom come\u00e7o.  Finalmente, um roteiro mais granular forneceria datas de entrega para eventos e ativos com melhor resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do que as janelas de 90-180 dias existentes.
