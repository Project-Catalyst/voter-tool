For example, how much user friendly the solution will be or how easy it will be to integrate with e-commerce platforms is not deeply discussed. Also, I felt that some key metrics were missing. The number of platforms that can be integrated, the ratio of transactions completed to total transactions and the total reach of the product are not mentioned and are very important to assess the impact of the project.

The problem statement clearly describes the need for having an app that wraps up the integration with AdaPay and provides merchants on ecommerce platforms to simply use this app via typical integration mechanisms that are available on platforms such as shopfiy.\r\n\r\nHowever, for non technical voters/community members, it would have been better if the problem statement and solution is structured on a step by step basis, covering from a simplistic standpoint. e.g. a user of plugin does not really care if tech is node js or .net or java, what matters is if it works and easy to integrate. Similarly, for voters and community what matters is that they understand clearly why this solution is better than other proposed solutions to similar plugin development challenge ? \r\n\r\nNevertheless, As a senior developer myself i like the idea of using a backend application (which they propose to do in Nodejs) to keep up for the scalability issues that might arise as wide adoption happens in the future.\r\n\r\nAn overall well written proposal but because some improvements are possible, i think one point less from my side.
