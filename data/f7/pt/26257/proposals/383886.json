Without specificly defined use cases struggling the most from the current model of voting, it is hard to say which specific skills, resources, or research can be needed. Moreover, it is not clear if those problems can be solved in the near future at all.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposed metrics (proposals, frameworks, research) can help track some activity within the initiative. However, they are insufficient to track progress towards the underlying objective (community progressing towards its mission at its maximum speed).\r\n\r\nTo make the proposal stronger, I'd suggest to consider metrics helping to evaluate the progress of Cardano towards the desired outcome - the fulfillment of the mission of Cardano. For example, assuming the definition of Carano's mission as to \"provide a financial and social operating system to the world\", the following metrics could be valuable to consider:\r\n1) the % of the world's population that relies on cardano for financial use cases (need a list of use cases).\r\n2) the % of the world's population that relies on cardano for social use cases (need a list of use cases).\r\n3) the use satisfaction (by use case) of with Cardano's solution vs those of competitors/alternatives.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating the relative impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics evaluating user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 5, "ng": 9, "nfo": 8, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Unfortunately this challenge looks to be incomplete with its \"TBC\" in the challenge brief.
