Despite that, this proposal does not clearly support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8: grow the number of contributors, turn cardano into open source project, grow the dev and app ecosystem. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the proposal would be stronger if it:\r\n1) provided an overview of the most needed banking use cases for implementation and the readiness of the regulatory environment.\r\n2) provided a justification why it is a higher-ROI task for the community to develop banking use cases outside of the broader challenge of growing apps and integrations.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points for not directly supporting any of the Fund8 strategic objectives.\r\n- 1 point for not explaining why constraining the impact to a subset of use cases will have a higher ROI for the community.\r\nMy rating is 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Catalyst community has definitely people experience with developing innovative blockchain applications.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, solving the problem of access to banking services is not only a technological but also a regulatory problem: the banking industry is often strictly regulated. So, small teams of developers are not well positioned for success.\r\n\r\nThis proposal would be much stronger, if it provided an analysis of regulatory jurisdictions, which are favourable to rapid adoption of blockchain services. Without such analysis, it's not clear if any noticeable impact can achieved in the short term..\r\n\r\nIn addition, the budget of $500k seems inadequeate given the massive size of the problem. To increase the feasiblity of the ideas, it can be worth to reformulate it as a challenge to regulatory justisdictions and create compliance checklists to help development teams in future to make better decisions.\r\n\r\nOut of my experience as someone who worked on GovTech projects in Germany, solving compliance and regulatory acceptance problems takes years, so it's not something that can be overlooked.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of overview of regulatory blockers.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of explanation why the requsted funding can lead to a noticeable progress with the set problem.\r\n- 1 point for the proposer/challenge team out of just one person, limiting the advice and support for participants in this challeging area.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed metrics than can capture some progress towards its solution (the number of users affected, the number of partnering cases).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, those metrics do not provide a clear understranding of the progress and impact, such as:\r\n1) the % of people without access to banking system who use the Cardano-based solution.\r\n2) The satisfaction of users with the solutions in comparison with alternatives.\r\n3) The number of regulatory environments (countries) that have officially welcomed/recognized the proposed solutions.\r\n4) The share of transactions in Cardano coming from banking use cases.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of full tracking of the impact on cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of metrics to evaluate the user satisfaction and the competitiveness of the created solutions.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge focuses on bringing poor people to Cardano ecosystem however it could improve on how poor people can contribute to the Cardano ecosystem to fully align with the Cardano mission.
