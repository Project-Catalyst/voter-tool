We can ascertain community willingness in putting forward creative proposals addressing  human activity and climate.  Furthermore, community interest in proposing Climate themed solutions will enable a diverse evolution of developer and open source app ecosystem with global impact. We have seen already in past funds an array of proposals  related to waste management, circular economies, sustainable housing, animal conservation, farming and so on.
