In my opinion, the proposal does not address the challenge because the proposal does not clearly show a path to an end product useable by end users with in 90days.

Hence, can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research and university education in programming but not personal professional experience in the field of IT, hence this part of my assesments in this categeory will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done in mind. The proposal identifies a general everyday problem that however does not really have aanything to do with the challenge, and while they refer to PoS blockchains several times they do not really bring across what the connection to their proposal is. The proposal does not really articulate how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. As far as I understand it will mainly add value to businesses wanting to fish for consumer data.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal only partialy adress the outlined challenge settings.\r\nThe proposal does not really adress scalability, but might be able to  scale to address future challenges. If done right", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer does not provide sufficient information about themselves and does not provide proof for any relevant qualifications. Feedback: For future proposals, maybe consider linking some verifiable personal information about yourself or some of the work you have already done. The proposer does not seem to know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal, as they want to hire one Dev for a task that would take a long time (e.G. designing an AI data analysis tool for obtaining marketing information out of receipts + the several other points they mentioned. Feedback: Try to define you goals more clearly and breaking them down in differentiated points for each of which you define the requirements. The budget is not outlined clearly nor broken down into identifiable items. The proposer only mentions a lump sum and some points for which it is used. Feedback: A budget broken down by items should be used next time. For such complex projects with so many points that need to be adressed I'd also advise you to present a plan for the case that you need additional funding, which would most definetely be the case if you want to fulfill this proposal completely.\r\nIn this case, the budget does not seem reasonable because far too much things are proposed to fit in this budget. The proposal does not offer a timetable to complete the work.\r\nThe overall implementation plan lacks sophistication and technical detail, which gives the impression the proposer has not thought about the details of technical implementation, which should be a prerequisite for posting a proposal. The plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal other than some people they want to hire.\r\n The proposer has not done a general assessment of challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No roadmap with milestones or a time horizon exists, which will make it difficult to audit the proposal.  Metrics and KPIs that define the success of the proposal are not presented in a concrete, quantitative manner, but only some not very defined, partially inconcrete points of what should be achieved.\r\n While the d escription of the targeted problem is sufficiently comprehensible,\r\nThe description of the solution that addresses the problem is a bit confusing as it throws together the actual solution (an app that stores receipts) together with SPOs, Data collection and AI without going furthrt into them. Feedback: Keep it simple. This is after all a mini proposal challenge. Go for one concrete goal, but define this one very well and consider everything as detailed as possible instead of proposing an overcomplex solution that throws different things together while not explaining and defining everything properly.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_52", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 6, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is well placed within the challenge and has a strong idea however It is unclear how the proposal will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem as aa whole at this stage as it does not mention integration until later rollouts.
