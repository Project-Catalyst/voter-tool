It is in the final lines of the proposal that it becomes clear what the proponent's purpose is: to conduct a study of the possibilities of Blockchain technology in the management of infrastructure projects.  \n\nIt is clear to all of us involved in the quest for a decentralized world that puts an end to many of the centralized practices that bring out the worst in human society that much of the blockchain infrastructure to be implemented in the many areas of human life is in the process of being built.  It is no secret that the current era, the present in which we live, is a period of exploration of the potential of decentralized technology.   \n\nIt is precisely in this exploratory scenario that the type of studies proposed in this proposal are necessary.

The word document attached to the proposal talks about developing an approach (\"The approach to creating a planned developed approach to infrastructure development using...\").  While the general description of the problem environment and the role that blockchain technology would play in implementing a possible solution is clear and compelling, the scarce of detail and lack of depth of information in the description of the technical process of implementing the proposal, makes the specific purpose of the proposal unclear and forces the reader to make many assumptions.   Lack of information about of the proposing team, budget, roadmap, possible risks that could hinder or prevent the implementation of the proposal, among other aspects, accentuate the difficulty that interferes in creating a clear picture of the proposal and its scope.\n\nQuestion: what is the specific role of Motr\u00e9 Co.
