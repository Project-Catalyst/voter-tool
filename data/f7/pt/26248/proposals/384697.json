They claim to be in the midst of this project, but they do not provide references or proof of prior work or repositories to check the progress of the project/ film. They are in the process of securing 2 - 2.5 million dollars to make this movie, so it is not clear what happens, if the team is not successful in receiving enough funding, the proposing team should elaborate on this risk. Roadmap for the funding period is missing, budget breakdown is only connected to pre-production of the movie.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability of their measures of success is only possible, if the movie will be fully funded with over 2 million dollars, so at the  moment it would not be clear, how auditability of the pre production part of the project would look like. The proposing team has a couple interesting ideas how they would like to communicate with the community as well as raise awareness through movies, but it is at this moment all relatively loosely connected. It would be great if the team provided a github, a website and other social media that they might use to promote the project, so that it becomes more clear to the community, how this project develops and interacts with members inside and outside of the Cardano community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 4, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The Miscellaneous Challenge is important as it can allow a space for projects that do not fit into other established Challenge categories, allowing for unique and wide-ranging ideas to proliferate. This project definitely addresses the issues presented in the Miscellaneous Challenge Brief, firstly, it is an 'interesting and valuable project that does not currently fit into other challenges', for sure. And, secondly, it does have to do with Cardano, and could show in a potentially widely distributed form, a 'story' about how blockchain tech can be used in a lived experience with positive effects, as well as pioneer a way to use the Cardano blockchain to innovate within the moving image business structures.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Here I have to be honest and say that I can neither agree nor disagree that the team can carry out the project successfully.  I would like to see more about the creatives involved: the writer, DP, etc. I know that the 'story' is coveted IP, but, show us that you can 'tell a story'!  I would love to see this film!  Paint us a picture in the opening of the pitch.  \r\nI can also say that the proposal needs revision in terms of the ideas presented.  It is a bit confusing for me, with many ideas flowing out at once. One thing is to set out to make a 'studio' for many films to be made within, Cardano Studios, etc.  Another, is to make a specific film about the characters named in the proposed film 'Barracuda', which is great.  The use of cNFTs to market the production, etc. is great and I love the idea of showcasing the talent of an artist in the community of (what I call) First Peoples of America. Long term, something to do with music creation, etc. It is a lot to take in! To me, streamlining the project description into concrete 'do-ables' or deliverables, tied to the suggested budget, which is a reasonable ask at 18-19% of the Challenge total, and aligning KPIs to these- how will we as a community be able to assess progress in the timeline presented that are tied to specific goals, etc.- would make it a for sure 5 star evaluation. In my opinion, it is not there yet.  But, it will be with a few more passes and careful strategic attention.
