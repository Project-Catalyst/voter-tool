All key metrics are aligned with the coresponding challenge settings. The main challenge that mr and mrs Ramus have pointed out relate to the users becomming sceptical of the proposal and the research being done. I can see the authors stated several challenges. However they are not concrete and detailed enough. I belive the proposal is well structured and the authors managed to focus on a concrete sphere of the mental health topic. This is a great addition to the cardano ecosystem, because the system is used by people and it's important in this digital age to keep in mind the mental health of other human beings and heif possible. If we can use ADA and popularaize it while doing good, that a definition of win-win situation. My suggestion for this proposal would be a classic mentorship program.
