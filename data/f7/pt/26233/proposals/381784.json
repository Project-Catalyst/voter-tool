The proposal anyways does not take in consideration the potential directions suggested in the challenge brief, suggesting an alternative road: using a CeFi platform as a way to lead new users to DeFi. This idea could lead them to stay into the CeFi world, as the effort to get an extra interest could not be worth the extra effort to switch to a DeFi environment. Plus, potentially this is adding an extra step: why the users would not go directly into a DeFi platform ?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal could be implemented as the CeFi platform is already active with a fair amount of users, and the proposers seems to have the right skill to lead the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided is clear and concise.

KPIs in the proposal match the ones indicated in the challenge and it's able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A link has been placed in the proposal that leads us to a well-designed website where we can clearly see the team behind this project. There is transparency of each team member and they have a link to LinkendIn which is great. But the whole team has more experience in corporate terms than in blockchain although they claim that developers from Wiringbits who participated in Prism for IOHK are helping them. It would be good if the that part is also transparent, because this raises doubts whether the project will be realized. It would be good to have more information of relevant skills and experience needed to realize the project. It is not clear how many developers will work on this project and who are the developers also watching Twitter acc it is strange how someone with 25,700 users has only one or no comments on Twitter but of course it should not mean anything in a negative way. It would have been much better to split the requested amount of $ 96,400 into two Catalyst rounds that would have been reasonable. They could ask for half of the amount in Catalyst F7 and half in Catalyst F8. The budget is clearly presented with a precise allocation of funds, how it will be distributed and an additional funds are not required. A more detailed implementable plan is missing. Realistic timetable is on the website with whom the work will be completed, but that time frame exists regardless of this proposal and is an integral part of the roadmap. More detailed dates are lacking for this project. There are details of actionable tasks and orders of execution, but if they were even deeper and clearer, that would be the right thing. Plan doesn't describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal. This proposal can hardly clearly explain technical aspects such as architecture, language and technologies, because as far as it is visible, there is no experience for such things.
