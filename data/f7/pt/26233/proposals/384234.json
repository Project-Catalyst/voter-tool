Adding Ada pay to a non-existing platform makes it impossible to determine if the platform itself or this proposal will bring any value to the Cardano ecosystem or if there truly is a need for Ada payments to this specific platform. Wouldn't it be better to wait for the Realtok marketplace to launch and see if it has any success and how well it has been built and only then submit this proposal?\r\nAfter reviewing this proposal I have found another one called \"Real Estate Dao\", that is almost identical to this one, but in another challenge, Boosting Cardano's DeFi. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There is no proof behind the claims of team members regarding their prior experience in web3 development, marketing etc. They mention they have a detailed business plan in execution, yet they do not provide any links to it. While their cultural values are attractive, the proposal needs to be as transparent and detailed as possible in order to be properly evaluated. And since the marketplace they intend to build on is not yet launched, the success and progress of this whole endeavour depends on an outside, unrealised project.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The first point mentioned in their timeline, which is also one of the most important ones, is defining the architecture for incorporating Cardano blockchain into Realtok's, as of yet undefined, architecture.

What the proposer is proposing is crypto payment for ONE platform(Realtok DAO). \r\n\r\nI think the proposal would benefit from more details on Realtok. The website is lacking details and I found no social media profiles. This information would clearly express how Realtok will impact the Cardano ecosystem. \r\n\r\nA question I have is why the need for RETOK if payments can be done with ADA? Will the ADA be converted into RETOK on the back-end?\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, RealTok will launch in a few days, while marketplace compatibility with ADA pay will be deployed in 12 months. What is the predicted outcome of this deployment? How will it drive new investors into RealTok, if investors already have access to RETOK?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "More information on Realtok, the community \"DAO Educacio y TEC\", and the team would benefit voters. \r\n\r\nThe budget seems a little unclear. What will each team member contribute towards the deployment of ADA pay on RealTok? For month 3-6, the developers are paid 5k/month. But for month 6-12, only 10k is allocated which amounts to 1k+/month. Do these team members have different workloads? The proposal would be much clearer if some time is spent on explaining the budget allocation.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would also benefit by spending some time at explaining the action plan. Something that lets the community know the team is working on something difficult(requiring 12 months to deploy), that it deserves the amount of money it is asking for, and so progress of the team members can be tracked.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has KPI metrics that track the deployment of ADA Pay on RealTok. However, it is lacking KPI metrics that track its impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The challenge is also interested in tracking the number of users/ unique wallets/ TVL/ listed pairs/listed assets. I think it would help the proposer greatly if he/she shares an implementable plan for tracking and improving these success metrics for the platform Realtok.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_948", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 8, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Adaptar a plataforma desenvolvida pela Realtok DAO para incluir o ADA pay.", "experience": "Somos uma equipe de 4 empresas latino-americanas com experi\u00eancia em Web 3, marketing e aspectos regulat\u00f3rios."}
