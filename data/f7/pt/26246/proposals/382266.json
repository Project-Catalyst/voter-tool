And can hence competently evaluate sutainability criteria in proposals in this category The proposal matches the challenge well and it is clear the proposer has properly read the challenge and knows their way around the topic. Their proposal has the potential to add quite some value to the Cardano ecosystem.\r\nThe proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem, notably by supporting decentralisation and consciencious staking decisions\r\n While the key-metrics are only formulated implicitly, they are aligning very well with the challenge settings KPIs. From ist makeup, the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is transparent about his background and seems competent and up to the task. He providesproof that he is up to technical tasks regarding stakepools. The proposer does not define the number of team members required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget set for this proposal does not have diversified items but just sums up an estimation of developing costs without a rationale. Feedback: For future proposals, try to draft an accurate plan on what each item of your proposal will cost and rationable calculations on how you justify those costs. Hence it is difficult to define whether the budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposer has not provided a plan for the case if they need additional funds. Feedback: Consider defining an MVP that might even be possible to be made with less funds or explainig where you would get additional funds if needed. The proposal only has a brief timetable that however seems reasonable to complete the work.\r\nThe proposal only provides a coarse-grained plan for implementation that does not exactly show how it will be implemented.\r\nThe proposal clearly explains the important aspects on the functioning of the DAO in a comprehensible manner.\r\nThe proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, e.G. how to deal with bad actors and unproductive stakepools.", "q1r": 3, "q2": " A roadmap with only brief milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented.\r\nMetrics/KPIs are not presented explicitly, but the implicitly formulated metrics should be quite auditable.\r\nThe proposer presents a clear and understandable description of the targeted problem.\r\nAnd a clear and understandable solution to it.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_52", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "RE Feasability: we explicity mention the team and name them in person, We also explain where the funds will go and to anyone working in the field it should be clear that we are asking for a very small amount of compensation for the tasks we are doing based on building this product over 3 months. We also have been building the projecct and didnt realise we mght have to explain where to get more fund, we think tha asking funding was the minimum payment for the work we were undertaking based on the time and effort it will take to build such a new projecct within the ecosystem (ie there is nothing like this right now on Cardano or anywhere else) we wish to be known for the project not to get rich off it and so we have opted for less money in funding so we can justify spending our time on it and still having a chance to get funded for it, which is something Catalyst challenge heads suggested we do to improve the likelihood of getting funding. we did not explain technical doccumentation because we were speaking to the pblic through our proposal and didnt want to confuse or alienate potential voters by overcomplicating the conepts of the proposal. We have been interviewed on several YouTubers platforms to discuss the proposal in more technical terms to share this with people who may wish to grasp those concepts better, as well as releasing the given information through our website. We definitely have considered as many potential attack vectors and methods people may try to manipulate the DAO again we have spoken about that through our interviews and discord community and didnt realise that was relevant enough to fill up our proposal with more technical information.

Adding more information about the team would have been helpful thou. You have a string team, why not share more info? Also for the roadmap, milestones and budget more information will be helpful and especially focusing on the first 3 months road map and deliverables (as from the context the budget will be for 3 months). Success factors are mentioned, but what about specific KPIs. I.e. what is the roadmap to get to 1b ada and 1000 SPOs in 12 months. One idea is also to finance to future progress by taking a small charge by the SPOs/rewards so you can demonstrate that overtime not much funding will be required by the community. You do mention that \u201cOnce the initial development period of 3 months has passed the DAO will look to the community and token launch to build a treasury for the DAO.\u201d but will be good to explain in more details as I believe it is a key element for this proposal", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Overtime it will be possible to audit the project based on number of SPOs and amount staked.
