You shouldn't expect voters (or community advisors) to know this or to read the whitepaper. It becomes difficult to understand the problem statement when this is not introduced early in the proposal.  The idea of having a blockchain of 1 person = 1 vote, rather 1 token = 1 vote is interesting as is the idea of using Cardano's voting capability  o achieve this in your own platform. Although this aligns with challenge i don't think it will bring much value to the ADA community as the $DTPT project is not well known or developed.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As the creator of the DTPT token it's clear that the proposer will have some experience with Cardano, but besides this not much is known of the experience of the proposer and that of the team.

It is better to convince the CA (in the case of Project Catalyst) and Private Investor on how the current Cardano ecosystem can be a road or pathway for your project to run on it.

Physical harm to other parties will be handled civilly. Other citizens will be allowed to assist without police interference.\" - page 11 of Whitepaper.

Self KYC can be generated without the actual owner acknowledgment? etc. \r\n\r\nc) Whitepaper page 41: \"STOP LIFETIME IMPRISONMENT FOR NON-VIOLENT CRIMES:\" idea is perfectly fit for purpose but need to cover the large percentage of other deadly non-violent crimes such as online bully, or social trial.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in impact, the scope of impact is a massive scale on human liberty and should address some fundamentals from project strategy before calling for funding.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is not much information on how Project Catalyst and the community will see/monitor the project progress once it gets funded and the human resource factor for the project to be listed.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_661", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal appears entirely unrelated the challenge brief.
