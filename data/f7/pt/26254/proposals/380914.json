A very detailed and understandable list of milestones, deliverables illustrates competence and professionalism.  One strength to highlight is the Q & A format in the proposal.

I love the research first strategy!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a detailed Milestones and deliverable section which is reasonable and thoughtful.  They explain \"how\" and not just \"what\".  For instance, the what is \"Get 20 potential research partners\" and the how is \"generate a list of 100 companies in the scope of the project, reach out with a questionnaire to screen down to 20\".

The proposal clearly states the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. The team professionally developed a budget that is reasonable and it's broken down into identifiable items. The detailed elaborated plan was elaborated by the team and the details of the actionable tasks and the order of execution are clearly presented. The proposal presents a realistic timetable to complete the work and lists the necessary resources as well as all technical aspects required for the implementation of this project.

They also have some experience with Education Technology, which is important given the focus of their proposal on credentials for STEM courses. One aspect missing from the implementation plan is any mention of the governance framework for the project, or a trust registry. As was pointed out in one of the comments, a trusty registry might be required to understand the validity of the entities issuing the credentials. Especially since the project concludes with a proof-of-concept that will issues VCs to students, this governance framework would be necessary to describe those interactions. It was also mentioned in the comments that particular care will need to be taken when issuing credentials to children, given privacy concerns and the need for guardianship. The proposers seem to want to avoid these issues by reducing the scope of the proposal and relying on other partners to provide the wallet that will hold the credentials. Nevertheless, some data about the credential holder will need to be handled in order to issue credentials, and more discussion on this point would strengthen the proposal.
