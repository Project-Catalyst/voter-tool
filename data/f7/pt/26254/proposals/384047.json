Entretanto, o proponente parece novo para a comunidade Cardano (apenas um palpite) e, portanto, desconhece muitas das iniciativas existentes nesta \u00e1rea.  Como a IOG n\u00e3o est\u00e1 implementando o Atala PRISM como uma iniciativa de cima para baixo, mas sim capacitando os indiv\u00edduos a criar solu\u00e7\u00f5es que melhor se adaptem a suas pr\u00f3prias comunidades e necessidades, muitos proponentes est\u00e3o criando e desenvolvendo solu\u00e7\u00f5es Atala PRISM que s\u00e3o feitas sob medida para as comunidades que eles habitam e conhecem melhor. Embora uma ampla pesquisa sobre a comunidade Cardano possa ser extremamente valiosa, n\u00e3o tenho certeza se ela \u00e9 essencial para o processo de desenvolvimento de solu\u00e7\u00f5es Atala PRISM.
