Construir uma carteira de identidade de c\u00f3digo aberto que seja operacional com Atala Prism IDs descentralizados e credenciais verific\u00e1veis seria uma maneira surpreendente de acelerar a identidade descentralizada na cadeia de bloqueios Cardano. O fato de a equipe incluir quatro membros da primeira coorte do Programa Atala Prism Pioneer torna-o ainda melhor. O que s\u00e3o os pioneiros do Atala Prism Prism prontos para - se n\u00e3o para projetos comunit\u00e1rios como este.

To make this proposal more relevant to the Cardano community, please consider the following suggestions: I suggest changing the idea description because it is essentially not clear and adds too much value to readers who are attempting to grasp its scope and purpose. It is not meant to be taken the wrong way, but clarifying the applicable use cases or giving more practical examples of what is the main value of an open-source credential wallet to different industries or to the overall Cardano community will be beneficial.

In 5 years there may be a better deal in terms of power and performance than the current one.
