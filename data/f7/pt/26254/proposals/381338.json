A identidade digital ser\u00e1 fundamental nas futuras transa\u00e7\u00f5es econ\u00f4micas e as solu\u00e7\u00f5es que enfatizem a propriedade pessoal dos dados ser\u00e3o provavelmente o aspecto mais desejado para uma ado\u00e7\u00e3o bem sucedida.

H\u00e1 \"resumos\" de objetivos e benef\u00edcios que s\u00e3o muito descritos em alto n\u00edvel e em forma de pontos. Embora isto seja bom para um breve resumo, n\u00e3o se apresenta bem em uma proposta em que $93.000 est\u00e3o sendo solicitados. A fim de aumentar a viabilidade, sugiro que esta proposta seja reescrita com uma linha de tempo clara de um plano execut\u00e1vel.

A proposta listou resultados e benef\u00edcios para um indiv\u00edduo, o estado (Gana) e o ecossistema, mas se adiantou demais a si mesma sem nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o substancial sobre como chegar\u00e1 l\u00e1.

Al\u00e9m disso, n\u00e3o havia nenhum plano estabelecido para explicar como a equipe iniciar\u00e1 as atividades, quem e quais pap\u00e9is participar\u00e3o e onde/quando termina.

Estou quase insultado com esta proposta dado o status que o IAMX foi dado pelo pr\u00f3prio IOHK, sendo 1/3 das equipes listadas na se\u00e7\u00e3o do Ecossistema de Identidade do IOG. O pessoal do IAMX s\u00e3o pessoas credenciadas, mas nenhum esfor\u00e7o parece ter sido feito na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o desta proposta, j\u00e1 que a maior parte do conte\u00fado foi retirada de seu website.

Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a very important problem regarding DID: the lack off accessibility of identity itself and the cosequencies from it. It approaches this problem with a valid solution that will both benefit the Cardano ecosystem and the people that suffer from a lack of identity. The solution provided is very detailed and well-made. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they and their project partners will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

The idea can be defined by the following passage: \"provide free and solid biometric identity, owned and controlled by the holder\". In theory this is great, but where does Cardano come in, where does Atala Prism fit in? Unfortunately, during the description of this project, the proponents focused on explaining the product but not on making us understand how it would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. At no point is it said that the decentralized identity would be stored on our blockchain. There's not much else to say, unfortunately. There is no point in offering so many advantages to the final customer, who would have these services free of charge, from what can be inferred, and not benefit those who would be financially supporting the idea... I suggest that the proponents clarify this issue better, because I have read the proposal completely and it is still not clear to me how this bridge would take place.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "We have and do not have information about the team here. I'm gonna explain. Are some companies mentioned that would be part of the project (IAMX AG, Zug, CH), would the executive board be the leaders of these organizations? Would a total of 25 people be involved in the project? It would be essential to know who they are, individually. Names, positions, how they would work on the project, professional training, who would be responsible for the development in Cardano... It is positive that they clarify the industry sector and the business model, but at the same time, some information is somewhat loose, such as for example, we only have contact information for these companies (IAMX). It is very positive that they anticipate the risk of so many different aspects, such as software risk, product risk and so on. This demonstrates a lot of experience in the development of this project. However, it is essential, in my opinion, that we know the characteristics of the members individually, this is what builds greater trust in the team: a more humanized notion about who we are dealing with. About the script: totally absent. The team provides us with a lot of relevant information about the project, such as benefits for customers, risks, objectives, etc., but at no time are phases and activities to be carried out to achieve the goals determined. It is not possible to understand how the development process of this project would take place. And finally, in terms of funding, nothing is said about how the 93k orders would be used! It is essential to share the money, how much would go for each thing and because, it is a very high value and without any explanation that justifies it, it is very difficult for the community to judge if it is a fair or exaggerated amount...", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The best part of the proposal. The team is willing to provide some very relevant information that would serve as a way of auditing the project, even though they have not traced a roadmap (through which we could monitor whether the activities were being carried out as promised) and KPIs. This information is: the objectives (indirectly, I would say they are the KPIs of the proposal); the results (they could also be called KPIs!); the benefits (through them, we can monitor if what was planned for the client was actually carried out, in addition to conducting a direct survey with the public to understand their degree of satisfaction) and risk analysis (here we have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe problems that would be faced and you can monitor whether they were avoided and/or resolved). It's the part that became clearest in my view, both the team could gather such data and wash it to the rest of the community; how much a local resident who was already part of the Cardano community could make contact with the team and take the information to the rest of us.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 11, "ng": 13, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal includes some technical jargon but is severely lacking in real substance. Too few specific details are provided to judge the impact. Of course, we are all excited about the possibilities of digital identity, but this this proposal doesn't really offer a detailed solution to any problem and does not communicate any technical nuance.
