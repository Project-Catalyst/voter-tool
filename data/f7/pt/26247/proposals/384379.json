For those interested, it can cause an influx of community members on both ecosystems along with an increased number of transactions.

All factors have been covered and there was an elaborate risk analysis included, which is quite rare to encounter in funding proposals. \r\nHowever lengthy, the proposal did not specify to what extent this field is actual hardcore science and what is pseudo-scientific mindfulness.

This proposal is expected to result in the following within a year: (1) an increase in Cardano transactions (2) 750-1000 users of the application. Last, but not least, I wish to congratulate the team on bringing Catalyst and the Cardano community this remarkable proposal that combines the requirements for world-class wellbeing practices with the benefits of SingularityNET and the strength of the Cardano community. I will give the proposal a score of 4 because I believe that reaching 1000 users in a range of one year seems to me to be a very conservative estimate considering that they are asking for 18% of the total budget for this challenge. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is my belief that they have an experienced team with the necessary skills and experience to implement the proposal, as well as the necessary references to validate it.

It is hard to imagine a project that has a better fit to the challenge than this one. It provides a solid link between Cardano and SingularityNET, and articulates a clear role for AI. \r\n\r\nExploring consciousness is a worthy endeavor, and the Pathform approach of micro-interventions super-interesting, and with a strong basis in both science and spiritual / meditative practice. It is certainly uncertain where this exploration will lead, but that is inherent to this type of endeavor! Using AI to recognize the effectiveness of consciousness interventions is also a good idea, and using AI developers as an initial user base is clever.\r\n\r\nA random connection -- I wrote a novel that proposes (as a plot device) an app that has a lot of similarity to Pathform.
