After 7 months we will have examples running, an academic article submitted to a peer reviewed journal comparing distributed vs central simulation (to convince researchers the decentralised solution is viable) and smart contracts, tokenomics and a whitepaper on moving this forward as viable project for physics simulations. All for $35k. If this can be done its both a bargain and definitely meets the challenge and would be awesome for SingularityNet, NuNet and Cardano going forward with a useful real world use case bringing many researchers onto these platforms.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has great experience on the physics side and a clear plan of what he wants to do. My main worry is the blockchain side. He needs to hire the resource there and whilst he can price his time however he wants, its hard to know if he will get the expertise he needs on the blockchain side for the numbers proposed. Thus why I only gave a 4 out of 5. I would guess he is motivated enough that he could probably do it all himself if required, but timelines would slip. No mention is made of compute cost. How will the NuNet compute time be paid for?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has clear deliverables and time lines which can be audited. Getting a paper published in a peer reviewed journal is one objective success metric. Whilst not mentioned, obviously another would be successfully showing that the decentralised simulations can compete with centralised options. Measuring relative costs should also come into it. In the end real success is in the period after 12 months if this project gets traction.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 9, "ng": 18, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks, I appreciate the nice comments. Some notes regarding compute costs. Most development can be done either on testnet,  or on software that can simulate heterogenous hardware (phones, desktop, servers)  or build device agnostic testing code. Both of which are possible, but all the details have not been fleshed out yet. "}, {"q0": "A virtual machine protocol that outsources computational power to companies or institutions that can buy that power and compensate private providers could certainly create a significant impact for scientific discoveries in the near future. Deploying it on the Cardano-blockchain in combination with Nunet could benefit both as it would generate a large number of transactions. This proposal aims to create such a protocol, much like the already existing BOINC. What is new in this proposal and hasn't been done before is tokenised compensation to the provider. This is exactly what Nunet is made for and as someone who currently outsources computational power (uncompensated), there is a need for something like this and it will be created sooner or later. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given that the proposer is a researcher himself, the need for the proposed protocol becomes apparent. The proposer is well placed to perform development except for the plutus engineering. There is mention that the proposing team is hiring such engineers on their website, yet there is also mention of a plutus engineering salary in the budget allocation. This raises the question; is there a plutus engineer already present in the team or not? Furthermore, the team seems to exist out of 3 people, but there is only mention of 2 salaries. So is the team 2 or 3 people strong and what exactly are their function? ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author(s) has identified himself, the budget has been broken down and the there are clear set KPIs. On the website there isn't much information to define where this project is at. I'd have expected at least a rudimentary design of the tokenomics as the proposed project is so heavily dependant on compensation. So that would definitely be an improvement to determine the auditability. I also feel that working out the FAQ-section is advised as voters who are not so fa;iliar with this matter are now left with a lot of questions.

For instance, we are looking for plutus developers, but we currently do not have the money to pay for one as we are running purely out of our own money for now. Thus, with the funds from Catalyst, we hope to incentive higher-end plutus developers to join the team. Second, although we do have three individuals supporting the project currently, only one is taking an active role. The other two are part-time and advisory roles and are not factored into the costs therefore. Their feasibility score seems to be a result of thinking I am not going to be partaking in the activities, which is quite confusing why they would ever think this. \nIn terms of auditability,  the assessor again mentions important criticism. We have not made public the tokenomics, as we hope to verify it before the whitepaper release, as to not publish inaccurate designs and misinformation. Also, the FAQ is not relevant to auditability at this point in time. As the primary objective of the fund is to determine feasability and develop prototypes. Both of which are prerequisites of a protocol that needs FAQ and precise tokenomics protocols.\nTheir criticism seems more aligned at the website than at the proposal in the auditability section, making no clear claim about what metrics, KPIs, or other auditable measure could be taken to improve the metrics, or why our current definitions are substandard. "}, {"q0": "Using computational power and contributed data to evolve different sectors is a great way to use AI and blockchain technology. By providing tokenization you create an incentive for users to contribute. This protocol could help SingularityNet and ADA because this would create a large sum of transactions on the blockchain. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind the proposal is a solo AI researcher in physics which is the relevant skills he needs. For this, to work the team needs a Plutus engineer which the proposer is already searching for. The budget is talking about salaries for two engineers, which brings me to the conclusion that the proposer is not asking for funds himself to continue his research. This begs the question is the proposer doing this in his free time or will he cooperate?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding auditability, we get quite a bit of information. We get a budget breakdown which is reasonable. The roadmap is presented and gives us a clear view of what to expect.

Depending on financial situations, we will either hire a plutus and phyics developer. Or preferably, I  will take a leave of absence from my PhD to pursue this idea. "}, {"q0": "What an idea! I was thinking about the same - simulating a super computer using a blockchain can cause so much difference.
