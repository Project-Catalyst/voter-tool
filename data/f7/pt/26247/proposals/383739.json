That data could then be used for all types of AI, so in that sense it meet the challenge brief. \r\nHowever I am whole heartedly against the entire premise of this project. I see not one single reference to preserving privacy. I could think of nothing worse than have a single global public repository of everyone's data. \r\nHow does collecting everyone's data onto a block chain give people control over their data, it is the exact opposite. You are giving up complete control.\r\nThe start of the project talks about individuals and their data and a game presumable individuals would play, however the KPI's don't mention data or individuals, its all about commercial partners, professionals, investors etc. Who is your target market, who are your users? What do they get from this product?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has an outline of an idea, and as I have stated I am against the idea. Regardless, the project plan apears not to be for the proposers to do this, but to use the funds to try and get others to do it. Take the first point in the game, \"Hire Game Development Studios\". This in not a plan. The proposer has an idea, but needs someone else to do it. Maybe they will be able to get it done as they want for the budget they have proposed, but I can't give that a high probability of success. Part of $30k is unlikely to get you much in the way of Game Development Studios for 6 months. I would like to see a budget broken down by line item so we can see if the number make sense and whether the proposer has thought through the cost of each component.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The poser has some simple deliverables, but this project is really about the data and none of the KPI's mention the data or the number of individual users. I really am not sure how we could asses if the proposer has delivered as the deliverables are not that well defined. Some KPI's about success have been mentioned, but to succeed you need to say you met a goal.

The more data that can be gathered, the more accurate future predictions can become. Therefore it is paramount to have a AI-gathering service in place early on. This will increase both community influx and innovation velocity for the blockchain significantly, as well as increase the amount of transactions (data needs to be sent). On a sidenote, the potential in personal growth of the individual is not to be underestimated as it will provide a guideline to develop oneself to greater heights and increased quality of life. SingularityNet's spinoff 'Rejuve' might be a good partner to explore and develop this idea further as there is a focus on personal health. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The ambition of this project is of massive proportions. Likewise is the presented project. The team seems to currently exist out of just one person. What are the steps that are being taken to help lighten this workload? A suggestion might be to use the seek-tags to find the right people. \r\nThe gamified approach is positive. People are reluctant to provide data if it is viewed as a task, if it is presented in a fun way there is bound to be much more participation. The project size might be a hurdle in terms of feasibility. There is a whole lot going on in the proposal, so it might be advisable to break up the proposal in smaller parts so the voterbase has the option of approving which parts they see fit. Furthermore, the requested funds doesn't seem to cover the upkeep of the ADA hubs that are intended to pop up all over the planet. How would this cost be covered? I'd also like to add that the name 'ADA hubs' might not be the best option as it is prone to cause confusion with Cardano Community Hubs.

The first thing that comes to mind for me is why not make a proposal for each individual stage. This proposal is asking for 20% of the challenge funds which is a lot. The project itself is also ambitious and would certainly need this amount. But by asking all of it in one go this might scare certain voters. Another thing that I did not find is information about the team members needed for this project. The proposer is solo as far as we know and explains he want to hire developing studios but does not go into details about this.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The information needed for auditability is present in the proposal.
