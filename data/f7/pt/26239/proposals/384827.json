A website containing the identified scams, frauds, FUDs, cyber-attacks etc would be extremely useful to help anyone assess if that content they have come across is true or not. Besides that, the idea of having a single page that categorize the types of scams is really helpful for newcomers. Also, the goals of the proposal are strongly aligned with the outlined challenge settings. The proposer clearly articulates that the solution will build a repository of scam attempts, it will make easier for truth about Cardano to be established because the cyber-attacks will be debunked, and transparency will be enhanced because individuals will be able to find the necessary references in the platform. However, it is not clear from the proposal how they intend to scale the solution in the future once it grows beyond what is manageable for the initial team.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "No evidence was provided to support the claim of the author of having 7 years of experience as a full-stack web developer.

However, there is no plan in case additional funding is required. Also, the timetable is realistic but could have been divided into more milestones. Some of the stages of the project could have been better explained in terms of how things will happen. For instance, how communities will form around identifying scams and how they intend to expand their userbase were not much explored. Finally, the proposer does not consider the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation and there are many. For example, scalability might be a big issue, maybe they will face technical problems during the development of the platform or even have difficulty in attracting people to adopt the new tool.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap provided has too few milestones, it could have been further explored.

One idea to enhance auditability is a periodic report, at least monthly that could be released to better follow the progress of the project. Regarding the four metrics described (two direct and two indirect) only the first seems aligned with the proposal. It is not clear from the solution how it is supposed to impact the other three metrics. Instead, some metrics that could have been defined were number of end-users of the platform, number of scam attempts exhibited on the website and a measure of trust in the Cardano environment to assess if it was eroded by any cyber-attack (maybe even compare a decline of trust from an attack before the platform was active and after it was published).

In my view the proposal deal mainly with the technical aspect of building the solution and not the full solution which includes populating, promoting, and managing such a platform.
