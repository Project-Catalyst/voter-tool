By focusing on an extremely difficult and important topic for the country, and for the region, and by approaching the topic from the perspective of the utility that Cardano's blockchain technology could bring to the issue, the proposal offers to create an image of the different means by which Cardano's blockchain technology could contribute to a positive transformative process for the country (and for the region). A well produced report could motivate and guide serious engagement and adoption of Cardano for positive change in the country and the region, advancing the recognition and implementation of Cardano's use cases under a positive perception.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The goal of the proposal being to produce a document, it seems that the experience and plan presented suggest the success of the proposal is likely. The risk lies in the size and the complexity of the blockchain use cases to be identified and discussed given, their potential application related to peace in Colombia (see for example: https://www.cbinsights.com/research/industries-disrupted-blockchain/). To increase the probability of success and the impact of their product, I suggest, that the team be conscious and clear regarding the initial stage of their investigation and focus adequately describing and explaining the most obvious cases (e.g.: cadastre, but also DAO treasuries, etc.). A satisfactory conclusion of a first report could be the required demonstration to gain the confidence to produce many more, more detailed reports. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided should be sufficient to audit the progress of the proposal. However, I perceive a relative weakness on the blockchain expertise in the proposal. Ideally, this apparent weakness will ultimately be resolved with the access provided by Catalyst to Cardano expertise from so many applications. The authors should make efforts to take the most advantage of this possibility through their own \"systems engineer\". On a final note, To increase the positive impact of the proposal it is important that the proponents commit them selves to the publication of their report, ideally in Spanish and in English and with the participation of a recognized actor in the region (a major newspaper, publisher, a major university, or a major non-governmental organization). This should guarantee the visibility and accessibility that is necessary for the project to actually materialize its contribution.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_183", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 8, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Project starts from a very vague problem statement and the final outcome is not clear - apparently its not even clear if there's any impactful possible outcome.\r\nIt seems a technology driven exploratory idea (we have the technology, lets see what we can do with it) that will consume resources without stating clearly what possible impacts it could have on the proposed application. The proposer could possibly narrow down/define better a bit the scope as it is too generic.\r\n\r\nMaybe some examples on the proposer mind could be provided here to see what possible application it has on the \"peace\". Some initial mapping or research could be done before to better explain it to voters. An alternative would be to bring an example of a similar project, that analysis the possible benefits of blockhain to an agreement, to illustrate the bigger picutre here.\r\n\r\nReinforcing this, the impact session has some really vague terms/phrases, specially for those not familiarly with the \"peace\" agreement. As example, it is possible to mention \"This study will be the gateway to new proposals, new members, new contacts, new stakeholders in Cardano\". Why is it? how exactly this study will make this happen? Other would be \"With a multidisciplinary analysis of the peace agreements and the role that the Blockchain could play in each one of its elements.\" What possible roles blockhain could play here?\r\n\r\nAll in all, possible impact of this proposal is not clear and more information/examples could be provided, specially considering a lot of people dont know about this specific agreement (or know which role a blockchain can play in one).\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There's an already committed team with multidisciplinary capabilities, specially in the agreement hereby presented, with references.

Moreover, success in past project, although might give credibility, doesnt guarantee success in the next ones. Each project is unique.\r\n\r\nThere's a time-framed roadmap/plan but its not so well sctrucutured and a bit vague in some activities.
