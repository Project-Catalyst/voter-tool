Aceitar o pagamento em ADA e t\u00ea-lo convertido automaticamente para a moeda local seria muito pr\u00e1tico para os vendedores locais latino-americanos. Por outro lado, vejo aqui algumas quest\u00f5es: come\u00e7ando pelo fato de que converter ADA em outras moedas n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo que envolva muito \"tempo e dinheiro\" a ser feito, como diz o autor da proposta. Fa\u00e7o isso rapidamente atrav\u00e9s da carteira Yoroi e da corretora Binance, o processo total entre o envio do meu ADA para Binance da corretora para o meu banco me custa cerca de 2 unidades de minha moeda local. E n\u00e3o demoro mais do que 20 minutos para faz\u00ea-lo. Portanto, acredito que o cerne desta proposta n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o fundamental quanto o autor afirma. Temos tamb\u00e9m o fato de que \u00e0s vezes \u00e9 mais vantajoso esperar que o ADA seja valorizado para converter do que para converter no momento exato em que recebemos a moeda criptogr\u00e1fica. N\u00e3o estou dizendo meses de espera, pois isto n\u00e3o \u00e9 vi\u00e1vel para os comerciantes. Mas em uma quest\u00e3o de uma semana, a moeda poderia apreciar muito. E acredito que aqueles que escolhem trabalhar com a ADA est\u00e3o cientes de seus eleitores e procuram fazer o melhor uso poss\u00edvel da moeda. O autor nos d\u00e1 muito boas explica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre sua dApp, para que possamos entender bem como suas atividades funcionariam na pr\u00e1tica. Reconhe\u00e7o que seria um projeto que poderia beneficiar muito o ecossistema Cardano, mas devido ao seu alto pre\u00e7o de 156k em financiamento e a possibilidade de fazer as mesmas coisas sem criar um dApp espec\u00edfico, al\u00e9m dos fatores que analisei acima, acredito que o mesmo dinheiro poderia ser usado em diferentes projetos com id\u00e9ias mais v\u00e1lidas.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "O roteiro \u00e9 dividido em fases, sendo cada fase muito bem explicada atrav\u00e9s de subt\u00f3picos.

Sobre a equipe, o autor nos informa quais profissionais seriam necess\u00e1rios, mas pelo que entendi, ele ainda n\u00e3o definiu quem seriam os outros membros da equipe. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 detalhes sobre ningu\u00e9m a n\u00e3o ser o autor. Isto \u00e9 complicado, porque n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como construir confian\u00e7a em pessoas que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o conhece. Seria importante para o autor definir uma equipe, ou pelo menos 80% dela, e apresentar adequadamente cada membro: nomes, fun\u00e7\u00f5es, trabalhos anteriores, etc. Desta forma, a confian\u00e7a em sua capacidade de executar o projeto com sucesso seria transmitida. E quanto ao financiamento, o autor nos explica com base em t\u00f3picos como o dinheiro seria utilizado. Entretanto, acredito que precisar\u00edamos de mais detalhes aqui. Por exemplo, $6400 por 6 meses de servidor de aplicativos. Por que isso custa tanto? Quanto custaria o servidor? Mais de 28k para o gerente de projeto/l\u00edder de desenvolvimento: por que este papel \u00e9 t\u00e3o caro, o que esta pessoa faria na pr\u00e1tica, como seria seu trabalho cotidiano?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "O autor estabelece m\u00e9tricas a serem alcan\u00e7adas 6 meses ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento. Desta forma, ter\u00edamos algo a monitorar \u00e0 medida que o semestre avan\u00e7asse: os resultados prometidos foram realmente alcan\u00e7ados? Entretanto, como este \u00e9 um projeto caro e complexo, eu teria gostado que as metas mensais fossem seguidas. Desta forma, poder\u00edamos realizar um monitoramento mais pr\u00f3ximo e em intervalos mais curtos, aumentando o n\u00edvel de qualidade desta auditabilidade. Tamb\u00e9m podemos acompanhar o processo atrav\u00e9s das informa\u00e7\u00f5es fornecidas no roteiro. Acho que o pr\u00f3prio autor poderia estar encarregado de reunir estes dados localizados na m\u00e9trica e apresent\u00e1-los \u00e0 comunidade (como eu disse, mensalmente seria melhor). Tamb\u00e9m, dois ou tr\u00eas profissionais poderiam ser escolhidos para monitorar o processo, pessoas do ecossistema Cardano que tenham uma base t\u00e9cnica suficiente para entender o funcionamento das tecnologias desenvolvidas aqui.

This project, with the training of a team for its implementation, would also allow the integration of new people into the community. This coordinates with the objectives described in the metrics. However, the reflection of this project in terms of its impact on the Catalyst ecosystem is missing, and some explanations would have helped to certify the participant's awareness of this process.
