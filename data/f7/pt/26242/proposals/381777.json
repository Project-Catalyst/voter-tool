Desta forma, certamente beneficiaria muito o ecossistema, pois traria a bordo v\u00e1rios membros novos e capazes (sabemos que o Brasil \u00e9 a maior pot\u00eancia sul-americana e que h\u00e1 muito a ser feito l\u00e1, mas o que falta \u00e9 precisamente isso, uma instru\u00e7\u00e3o apropriada). E tamb\u00e9m, obviamente, o pa\u00eds, pois poderia gerar muitas ofertas de emprego para v\u00e1rios profissionais que sofrem com a crise financeira do pa\u00eds, que se intensificou principalmente ap\u00f3s a pandemia - v\u00e1rios profissionais qualificados t\u00eam sido empregados e t\u00eam muita dificuldade em encontrar oportunidades. \u00c9 muito positivo como o autor determina exatamente quem seria o p\u00fablico-alvo do projeto, o que demonstra um senso de realidade muito importante, ele sabe o que vai fazer e para quem vai faz\u00ea-lo, isto gera uma diretriz essencial, que comentarei melhor nos pr\u00f3ximos t\u00f3picos. Ele tamb\u00e9m delineia alguns t\u00f3picos que seriam abordados no curso para que possamos ter uma previs\u00e3o exata do que estaria funcionando aqui. Ele tamb\u00e9m determina a dura\u00e7\u00e3o total do curso, gerando um bom senso de tempo para n\u00f3s. E o mais relevante de tudo \u00e9 que o curso seria gratuito, ou seja, todos n\u00f3s podemos participar, o que quebra as barreiras sociais e beneficia plenamente a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o latino-americana. Em geral, acho que n\u00e3o tenho nada a criticar sobre o impacto da proposta, \u00e9 algo que atende perfeitamente ao que estamos procurando neste desafio.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Falando em equipes, acredito que o projeto inteiro seria realizado por uma \u00fanica pessoa. Gostei muito desta id\u00e9ia, mas acho que seria melhor se tiv\u00e9ssemos um grupo aqui. O autor, que daria o curso, \u00e9 sem d\u00favida muito capaz, sendo doutor em f\u00edsica, professor em uma Universidade Federal no Brasil, e assim por diante. Mas seria interessante entender melhor a rela\u00e7\u00e3o direta entre ele e a corrente de bloqueio Cardano. Como ele conheceu o projeto? H\u00e1 quanto tempo voc\u00ea faz parte da comunidade? O que, exatamente, ele desenvolve por aqui? Eu gostaria que tais d\u00favidas fossem resolvidas. Penso que seria importante contratar aqui dois profissionais: um designer, para preparar o conte\u00fado visual do curso e tamb\u00e9m as pe\u00e7as promocionais gr\u00e1ficas, e algu\u00e9m de marketing, a fim de tecer estrat\u00e9gias de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o que tornassem o curso de grande alcance de p\u00fablico. No que diz respeito ao roteiro, esta parte \u00e9 perfeita. O autor divide as atividades com base em cada m\u00eas, de 1 a 6, e cada m\u00eas \u00e9 bem explicado em t\u00f3picos. O que aconteceria e quem ordenaria, para que tenhamos uma compreens\u00e3o completa do processo, sem deixar lacunas. As explica\u00e7\u00f5es mensais tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o acompanhadas pelo custo da queima a cada m\u00eas, o que tamb\u00e9m torna o or\u00e7amento muito plaus\u00edvel. Portanto, a \u00fanica parte que eu acho que poderia ser melhorada \u00e9 esclarecer a conex\u00e3o do autor com o ecossistema Cardano.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Acredito que \u00e9 uma proposta facilmente audit\u00e1vel, e eu lhes direi por qu\u00ea. O autor nos fornece um roteiro muito bem trabalhado, extremamente preciso e cheio de detalhes. Atrav\u00e9s disto, podemos monitorar exatamente, a cada m\u00eas, se o que foi prometido est\u00e1 sendo feito. Aconselho que seja feito por membros da comunidade Cardano nativos do Brasil; desta forma, poderia haver um di\u00e1logo direto entre a comunidade e o autor, e um acompanhamento progressivo, a fim de monitorar o processo e n\u00e3o apenas os resultados. Mas, falando sobre eles, \u00e9 importante enfatizar o impacto deste curso sobre a popula\u00e7\u00e3o local. Esta parte, em minha opini\u00e3o, deveria ser feita pelo pr\u00f3prio autor. Uma esp\u00e9cie de levantamento de dados p\u00f3s-curso, no qual ele entraria em contato direto com alguns dos alunos, para receber feedback tanto sobre a qualidade do curso quanto sobre seu impacto em sua vida pr\u00e1tica. Ser\u00e1 que estes ensinamentos abriram portas? Em caso afirmativo, quais? Os envolvidos pretendem ser membros ativos da comunidade Cardano, seja atrav\u00e9s do Catalyst ou trabalhando como desenvolvedores de correntes de bloqueio em v\u00e1rias propostas? Este tipo de dados poderia ser coletado e passado para a comunidade.

I'd add here some focus on trying to attarct low income students as much as possible; It will be in line with UN SDG 1, 4, 8 and 10 and increase proposals appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One already commited person with educational experience and knowledge in blockchain seems to be enough to run this project, with no need to extra hirigings.

In the detailed CV we can't find the necessary experience, skills and knowledge that the lecturer should have. The budget is clearly presented but it would be much better if it was divided differently. Maybe to require half the budget in this Catalys F7 and half in the Catalsy F8. Holding a lecture for 6 months is a challenging job and is not a safe investment. But if they had a 3-month lecture, it would be easier to follow the development of the project and influence the improvements. There is a detailed implementable plan and it is very well developed as well as details of actionable tasks and order of execution are presented. The proposal offered a timetable to complete the work but in my opinion it is not realistically presented. As I already said there could be a much better brake down budget but also a time frame from 6 months to 3 months of lectures. We can find in the proposal a clear explanation of technical aspects and technologies for implementation but there is a lack of insight into possible risks and they could be especially in online workshops. What if the students don't come? It would be good to address the possible risks.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not have a clearly defined roadmap in terms of date or for exmaple (Q1, Q2, Q3) when the course will take place.

By moving cryptocurrencies in general and Cardano in particular out of the realm of a tool for speculation and into the curriculum for higher learning, the continent's view of Cardano will indeed grow.
