No entanto, se fosse pessoalmente, uma comunidade/rede brasileira mais forte poderia ser constru\u00edda entre o professor e os alunos. Eu consideraria ter pelo menos algumas sess\u00f5es online.

De qualquer forma, eu dedicaria pelo menos algumas vagas a estudantes de baixa renda/pobres, especialmente nas regi\u00f5es de favelas. Isto estaria de acordo com as Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas #04 e 10 SDG, que est\u00e3o sendo muito apreciadas atualmente em projetos e organiza\u00e7\u00f5es para ajudar a diminuir a desigualdade.\r\n3) Id tamb\u00e9m desenvolve mais na proposta o plano de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o.

The proposal seems to fit in the challenge, making Brazilian students, which are very creative, aware of Cardano. However, I have some points to add: 1) I've seen that you are a professor in UFPE. Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation. Therefore, if it is overpriced you won't have a great number of people attending it; 3) I imagine that, in order to keep this project going, you will charge for these classes and make it running, however I would like to see it more explicit;", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is well written and I have no doubt that a Professor with such curriculum willing to pass this knowledge beyond will be capable of conducting this proposal.

The perfect vessel to further the word of Cardano. Initially I had questions regarding how will this proposer acquire the materials on Cardano for it seems the proposer is quite new to the community. Sure enough though, the LATAM Cardano community came in numbers to support the proposer with all the materials they needed. These interactions are recorded in the comments section.

The knowledge, skills and knowledge of Cardano blockachain do not stand out on both links that are placed in the proposal. Perhaps the lecturer himself will learn through the lecture what is the best school for both the one who teaches and the one who listens to the lecture. The budget is clearly presented but in my opinion $2500 per presentation with preparation of the presentation is unreasonable. These are too high costs per presentation. The plan is well developed but no risks are covered or mentioned. What if students do not come to the lecture or a small number come or the lecturer does not have the necessary skills to deliver the knowledge?
