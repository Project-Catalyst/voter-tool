Seria ben\u00e9fico se os proponentes explicassem em detalhes o que \u00e9 bootcamp, eu n\u00e3o conhecia o conceito antes e tinha que pesquis\u00e1-lo, mas ainda assim era um pouco confuso. Em teoria isto \u00e9 uma coisa muito boa, porque beneficiaria 3 t\u00f3picos muito importantes: 1) gera\u00e7\u00e3o de oportunidades de emprego para as mulheres latino-americanas, respondendo diretamente aos objetivos do desafio. 2) novas pessoas para trabalhar e difundir o ecossistema Cardano. 3) ajudaria a preencher a lacuna das mulheres no ecossistema, o que \u00e9 facilmente percept\u00edvel. Entretanto, alguns detalhes deixaram algo a desejar nesta proposta. Os proponentes prometem algumas coisas, mas n\u00e3o explicam realmente como elas seriam. Por exemplo, de que pa\u00eds seriam estas mulheres? Em que l\u00edngua estes ensinamentos seriam ensinados? Como aconteceria o processo de sele\u00e7\u00e3o? O curso seria completamente gratuito? Quem seria esta especialista em psicologia e como ela acompanharia as 30 mulheres selecionadas? Como aconteceria este apoio comunit\u00e1rio? Em minha opini\u00e3o, algumas quest\u00f5es muito importantes s\u00e3o deixadas em aberto, minando nossa compreens\u00e3o e confian\u00e7a no impacto do projeto.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Os concorrentes s\u00e3o um casal que tem algumas informa\u00e7\u00f5es importantes sobre quem eles s\u00e3o. Os detalhes sobre Daniel s\u00e3o extremamente completos, pois n\u00e3o conseguimos conhecer Maria do Carmo t\u00e3o bem, no que diz respeito \u00e0s informa\u00e7\u00f5es dadas na proposta. Entretanto, este projeto necessita de uma s\u00e9rie de outros profissionais envolvidos. Embora eles afirmassem que fariam parceria com a ONG Laboratoria, n\u00e3o sabemos quem da ONG trabalharia no projeto e em que fun\u00e7\u00f5es. Seria necess\u00e1rio termos mais certeza sobre, por exemplo, se haveria pessoas especializadas em ensinar aqui? Quem seria o psic\u00f3logo, quem faria o marketing, o projeto? Seria necess\u00e1ria uma melhor compreens\u00e3o dos outros participantes, os proponentes eram. Nenhum roteiro \u00e9 dado, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o sabemos quanto tempo este projeto seria desenvolvido, atrav\u00e9s de quais fases, quanto tempo cada coisa levaria, em que ordem elas aconteceriam e por que, etc. etc. N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel ter uma pr\u00e9via do processo. E quanto ao financiamento: \u00e9 uma quantia muito alta, 70k para ensinar 30 mulheres! Embora haja uma explica\u00e7\u00e3o de como este dinheiro seria utilizado, ele \u00e9 muito superficial. Por exemplo, o dinheiro \u00e9 muito superficial: 5k para anunciar o bootcamp. Por que este valor? E como seria feito esse an\u00fancio? Outros 5k para selar. Novamente: por que tanto? Que tipo de sele\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 esta e por que requer tanto dinheiro envolvido? Da mesma forma, os outros t\u00f3picos deveriam ter sido melhor detalhados. Em geral, tanto a equipe, o roteiro e a divis\u00e3o de or\u00e7amento deixam algo a desejar.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Alguns KPIs s\u00e3o fornecidos que ajudariam a monitorar os resultados, ou seja, se o que foi prometido foi realmente entregue. O primeiro KPI n\u00e3o faz sentido para mim: \"conhecimento: de 0 a 5.000 mulheres talentosas em tecnologia, conscientes do Cardano Bootcamp\". Como isso seria medido? \u00c9 uma estat\u00edstica muito complicada de se definir. As outras fazem sentido e s\u00e3o boas. Entretanto, como n\u00e3o h\u00e1 um roteiro, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o h\u00e1 uma maneira mais profunda de acompanhar o desenvolvimento real do projeto. Se soub\u00e9ssemos os passos a serem dados, seria poss\u00edvel estabelecer um contato espor\u00e1dico com os proponentes e monitorar se estas atividades estavam realmente sendo realizadas dentro do prazo e da maneira planejada. Portanto, penso que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel estabelecer uma auditabilidade, mas somente em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao produto final e n\u00e3o ao processo, o que \u00e9 igualmente importante.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 17, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Women are under-represented in the Ecosystem, and the proposal aims to improve that. I believe this is relevant for the community because diversity in any organization promotes factors such as creativity, better decision making, flexibility, respect, and improved brand image. From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates. Will they become part of the educational staff in the future? Mentoring could also be provided for the development of future proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal does a great job describing the characteristics of the two leaders of the project. Daniel and Maria manage to combine skills and experiences that combined with a partner like LABORATORIA, make a very strong team. For this project it is essential to have a deep knowledge of Haskell or Plutus, which from what I understand will be the mentors they are planning to hire. So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate. As a result, it would have been beneficial if the team had included in the proposal actions to reduce or counteract this risk.  \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With regard to auditability, the team has provided a successful description. There is a roadmap in 5 phases, which I consider to be well explained, and enables the community to understand what will happen at each stage of the implementation process. Also described are five indicators of success that can be used to evaluate whether the project is having a positive impact at every stage of implementation.

The proposal is well aligned with the challenge objective. It could have been good to show and explain how it will scale over time, maybe include a potential revenue model (investing in students becomes more and more popular from other projects I am working on), and show how the graduates will be integrated into the Cardano ecosystem (how many of the 800 companies mentioned are related to Cardano?).

While I haven\u2019t come up with answers yet, I see your proposal as paving the way to a possible one.
