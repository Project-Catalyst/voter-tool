The proposal was made by the DLT360 team which includes active contributors to the Cardano community. The group also divides the work according to the capacity of each person to implement the proposal. It's great that the team provides the full LinkedIn profile of each individual participating in the proposal.\r\nThis is part of a large approved project.

Which still requires an authorization to access, but which can be understood. It would have been nice to have an explanation of how to access it. \r\nEven if the risks are not clearly stated, this proposal shows in many ways its sustainability.
