Penso isto porque: a id\u00e9ia aqui \u00e9 renovar a terra, ou seja, trabalhar na terra devolvendo suas qualidades, terra que foi adquirida atrav\u00e9s de um token em Cardano. O que beneficiaria o ecossistema na parte de criar novos ativos na cadeia de bloqueio, contratos inteligentes e etc., mas a quantidade de financiamento \u00e9 muito alta para que somente estas atividades possam ser feitas no ecossistema. Na minha opini\u00e3o, o projeto precisaria investir mais para dar um retorno \u00e0 Cardano. Acredito que este projeto beneficiaria muito a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o latino-americana, n\u00e3o apenas pelo ato de renova\u00e7\u00e3o da terra, mas tamb\u00e9m pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o de empregos com o projeto (muitos funcion\u00e1rios aqui viriam da Am\u00e9rica Latina, especialmente aqueles que fazem atividades no local). A este respeito, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 d\u00favida. Mas, como eu disse, seria necess\u00e1rio medir melhor o retorno a Cardano, n\u00e3o sabemos exatamente quantos tokens seriam gerados, quantas pessoas, em m\u00e9dia, seriam atra\u00eddas para o ecossistema e tais detalhes. \u00c9 por isso que eu acho que n\u00e3o \u00e9 um projeto que atenda muito bem ao que foi pedido neste desafio.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Nenhuma informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a equipe \u00e9 dada. \u00c9 um fato que v\u00e1rios profissionais trabalhariam aqui, como podemos ver na parte da divis\u00e3o de despesas. Mas quem s\u00e3o eles? Precisar\u00edamos conhecer cada membro da equipe individualmente, nomes, pap\u00e9is, rela\u00e7\u00f5es com a cadeia de bloqueio Cardano, e assim por diante. Quanto mais detalhes melhor, infelizmente n\u00e3o temos nenhum detalhe sobre isso aqui. Sobre o roteiro, acredito que seja m\u00e9dio, alguns dos passos s\u00e3o melhor explicados, como Q1 - 2022, enquanto outros, como Q4 - 2022 s\u00e3o resumidos em apenas uma frase. Sabemos que existe um plano de a\u00e7\u00e3o aqui, o que nos faz entender muito bem o que seria feito. Mas seria interessante se esta informa\u00e7\u00e3o estivesse bem relacionada a um cronograma, ou seja, que cada pequena parte se encaixasse em uma etapa do processo, de forma temporal e organizada, para que tiv\u00e9ssemos uma compreens\u00e3o mais s\u00f3lida do todo. E sobre a divis\u00e3o financeira, esta foi a parte que mais deixou a desejar, porque o pre\u00e7o pedido \u00e9 muito alto e as partes n\u00e3o s\u00e3o explicadas. Por exemplo, eles pedem 50k para uma campanha promocional, mas n\u00e3o explicam nada sobre isso. Eles n\u00e3o dizem que tipo de campanha seria, que meios seria lan\u00e7ada, que p\u00fablico alvo, que profissionais trabalhariam... 50k \u00e9 muitas vezes o pre\u00e7o pedido por uma proposta inteira, portanto, se eles pedissem isso apenas para uma parte do projeto, seria necess\u00e1rio um monte de detalhes.

Seria ideal que, a cada visita, fosse elaborado um relat\u00f3rio e apresentado diretamente \u00e0 comunidade Cardano.

The proposal involves tokenizing land in order to enable regrowth of land using proven ecological methods. This will address the issue of farmers not being able to ensure a healthy regeneration of land between harvest seasons. This proposal is very relevant to LATAM as food exports to developed countries represent one of many countries' main sources of income. In addition, I understand how this proposal can encourage new users to join the community. However, I must say that it was not possible to evaluate the alignment of the metrics since they were not included.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team describes in detail the skills and experiences in their web page that was provided as a reference. They have also described achievements with their \"land-management and forest regeneration\" method in previous years, although references would have been helpful to verify these results. An action plan is presented; however, I find it to be very general, which makes it difficult to evaluate its feasibility. Another aspect that could be improved in the proposal is the description of the associated tokenomics. Although there is a brief description of the token utility, it is crucial to provide a detailed description of the logic behind the generation of these tokens for a proposal like this one, which is based on the generation of this economy to contribute to the purchase and regeneration of land. Regarding the budget, I believe it is also imperative that for future Catalyst cycles, the team concentrates its efforts on improving this section. Although it is very positive that the topic has been broken down into identifiable areas, some of them need to be better explained. An example is the line item for \"Developers to launch the token\" which is estimated at $60,000 but does not explain the cost per hour, the number of developers needed, or for how long the developers are needed. Another example could be, the item for \"Promotion campaign\" would be estimated at $50,000, in which case you would have to provide answers to questions such as: How many professionals are you planning to hire? Which methods will be used for promotion? What is the expected result of this promotion? Unfortunately, no answers to these questions are provided. Lastly, I would like to mention another issue with the budget that I find is that actions are described to ensure auditability, but it is not clear whether or not these actions are considered as line items within the budget. Especially periodic audits by external agencies tend to be very costly. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally, we arrive at the section regarding auditability, which has its highs and lows.

Furthermore, the community will be able to access all the costs associated with the project, including contracts on chain, external audits, and images of what is happening in the farms. There is another aspect of this proposal that can be improved: the description of the success metrics. Although some of the metrics presented can be analyzed, it is necessary to make much more effort in this regard, especially considering that 37% of the budget allocated for this challenge is being requested.
