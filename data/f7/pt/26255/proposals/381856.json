O problema parece existir, pois a quantidade de novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1 aumentando expotencialmente. Ter uma plataforma para conectar experi\u00eancias/conhecimentos/expertises com as demandas existentes beneficiaria quem est\u00e1 se juntando \u00e0 comunidade e \u00e0s equipes do projeto.\r\nMeu principal ponto de aten\u00e7\u00e3o aqui seria o tamb\u00e9m crescente n\u00famero de plataformas diferentes, para objetivos diferentes (mas \u00e0s vezes semelhantes), dentro da comunidade Cardano. Por exemplo, no \u00faltimo fundo, foi poss\u00edvel ver v\u00e1rias propostas para criar uma plataforma que reunisse mentores e proponentes. Seria bom ver estas diferentes iniciativas de alguma forma integradas, ent\u00e3o eu recomendaria passar por propostas financiadas pela F6 (ou mesmo pela F5) e ver quais delas pretendem criar uma nova plataforma para verificar sinergias e possivelmente se fundir.\r\nO ideal seria ter uma ou duas plataformas robustas que conectassem todos estes tipos de necessidades na comunidade. Evitaria ainda mais informa\u00e7\u00e3o difundida e ajudaria os rec\u00e9m-chegados a navegar (\u00e0s vezes eles ainda n\u00e3o sabem o que est\u00e3o procurando).  No entanto, \u00e9 bom ler o compromisso com estas outras plataformas!\r\n\r\nAl\u00e9m disso, eu sugeriria tamb\u00e9m a inclus\u00e3o na plataformaf: vers\u00f5es de aplicativos para web e celular, tarefas padronizadas e expertises (com campos de padr\u00f5es, por exemplo) e uma forma de verificar a per\u00edcia (feita pela plataforma)\r\nMas estes s\u00e3o apenas pequenos detalhes (mais operacionais) e faz sentido n\u00e3o constar da proposta\r\n\r\nAl\u00e9m disso, seria bom ter aqui como a plataforma pretende se autofinanciar no futuro. se os membros teriam que pagar uma ades\u00e3o, se isso incluiria adi\u00e7\u00f5es e assim por diante. De custear isto \u00e9 provavelmente um resultado de um estudo de mercado durante a fase de projeto, mas seria bom ver o que os proponentes est\u00e3o pensando desde agora para dar alguma vis\u00e3o sobre o atual modelo de neg\u00f3cios de pensamento.\r\n\r\nPor \u00faltimo, um plano de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o a partir desta plataforma dentro da comunidade cardano seria muito apreciado. Como a plataforma planeja se conectar, engajar e reter os rec\u00e9m-chegados e os proponentes financiados? Quais canais ser\u00e3o utilizados?\r\n\r\nEm suma, uma proposta muito v\u00e1lida e bem escrita", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A equipe j\u00e1 est\u00e1 comprometida e experiente em m\u00faltiplas \u00e1reas de conhecimento, o que \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio e ajudar\u00e1 o projeto a avan\u00e7ar. Existem links para verificar as informa\u00e7\u00f5es (links Likedin, por exemplo).\r\n\r\nh\u00e1 um s\u00f3lido plano calendarizado, o que \u00e9 muito bom. Uma alta especial que, embora o projeto pretenda desenvolver uma plataforma a partir do zero, n\u00e3o levar\u00e1 muito tempo para que o PoC seja feito, portanto, o valor para a comunidade ser\u00e1 levado rapidamente (se n\u00e3o houver atrasos).\r\n\r\nH\u00e1 uma reparti\u00e7\u00e3o or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria sensata, mas que poderia ser mais detalhada. Por exemplo, o que est\u00e1 inclu\u00eddo em \"Custos de infra-estrutura e outras plataformas\"? por que \"comunidade e novos membros/aceleradores\" teriam uma linha or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria separada, eles obteriam algum deste fundo? N\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro o que se entende aqui.\r\nEntretanto, eu n\u00e3o penalizaria muito por isto e, pela festa como um todo, acho que ainda merecia uma pontua\u00e7\u00e3o de 5 estrelas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "H\u00e1 excelentes KPIs com prazos de validade, nas se\u00e7\u00f5es kpis e bons marcos na se\u00e7\u00e3o \"Como se mede o sucesso\".
