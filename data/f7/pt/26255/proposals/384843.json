However providing access to cloud computing credits is not an accelerator or business incubator. It does not fit within this challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "This is a proposal to try to negotiate with cloud provider to give Catalyst $1 million in credits. The business plan to deliver this is just a set number of hours at $250/hr and relies entirely on the proposers ability to negotiate this. Evidence of the proposers ability is given by educational achievement and that he is the CEO of his won firm that has negotiated a private amount of free credits with a cloud provider. No evidence is given to back this up however. A brief search on LinkedIn for the proposers Company finds the company has 5 employees and 8 followers. Its not clear that  getting free cloud compute for a company of 5 employees (AWS routinely hands out a few months of free credits to starts-up) is evidence this will be successful. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is relatively simple and thus easy to audit. Either the providers are brought online or not. $1 million of credit is a little nebulous. Is that going to be 100X$10,000 for 3 months? Or to be spilt over any tenor and number of companies. The point being that individual small value and tenor free trails are relatively easy to get and would not need this proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 0, "ng": 21, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "If successful, this woudl be a good add-on infrastructure service for Catalyst-funded teams. The proposer has not, however, answered the question raised in the comment section: \"Why decentralized projects should rely on centralized services?\" Without knowing the intricacies of this topic, I wonder if partnerships with e.g. Arweave or Filecoin would be more aligned with the Cardano ethos.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer gives a lengthy explanation of his ability to handle such negotiations. Also, apart from the \"initial disbursement of $5,000\" there is nothing to lose really since he has promised to only charge for results. The extent of his current networks and connections to the said Cloud service providers remain a little unclear. Also, downplaying another proposer/proposal is unnecessary.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is fairly straightforward and it is hard to set measurable milestones for something as simple as negotiation but, as it stands, we can only measure the attainment of the expected results.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "* The proposal identifies a problem that somehow aligns with the challenge setting. It assumes that the 'Catalyst accelerator' should provide cloud credits to the funded projects. What is remains open which projects can get how many credits for what timeframe in what region, why do we apply at 6 different hyper scalers, which ones are our teams using today and therefore I am not sure if additional services beyond infrastructure is part of it, which would be - from my point of view - equally beneficial in order to grow and scale out funded teams. I think it is highly attractive to get cloud credits for free and this proposal has a lot of potential, but needs to be worked out a bit more in order to articulate more clearly what the added value to the ecosystem really is.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "    * The proposal provides information about the negotiation capabilities. The proposer does not provide any information about already existing relationships, what 'startup packages' are industry standard from the hyper scalers (AWS, GCP,\u2026). We do not learn what is included in the final packages (just infrastructure consumption credits, or even entire teams who help our startups to build on top of it). We do not see a plan how to attack them, which cloud regions we want to cover and for which timeframe we plan to apply for how many credits. I am in the SaaS business f\u00fcr +10 years, having worked for one and would love to see the plan how to win them. The proposal provides no sensible and conductible plan about the way to the solution besides outlining negotiation skills and the justification for a pretty high hourly rate. To be honest not the highest in the proposals here but rank 2. What is more than fair is the fact that the proposer does not take money in case of not being successful. The KPIs are mentioned but we do not get any information about the size of it. How many projects, what is the targeted amount? 1 mio, or was this just an example? It would be highly desired to elaborate more on the plan and the measurability.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Clear is that we do not have to pay in case of not bing successful. Unclear is how the proposer achieves the solution, how many (requested) cloud credits the funded proposals get, how we select the teams in favour and what has to be done in order to achieve them. Not mentioned are standard market metrics and how we can see and audit the progress of this proposal.
