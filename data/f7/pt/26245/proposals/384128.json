This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal identifies a  problem that does not really match into the challenge. The solution however will bring some actual benefits regarding the topic of the challenge. Hence, the key metrics and goals of the proposal still align well with the outlined challenge settings, at least as far is it can be determined.

The proposer has not accounted for uncertainities, neither in the budget nor regarding other challenges and risks during implementation.
