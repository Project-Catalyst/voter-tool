Consider this project is not based on periods like Catalyst and each member has their own community's activities already (in addition to their daily main jobs).

For example, Catalyst Swarm, CC Admin Team, Bridge Builders are three out of all your community members that may have a lot of ADA members or followers, which means they possibly have a lot more delegators. So, your implementation module should at least provide design upfront to see whether it is feasible to join in or withdraw from the Ryuuki network.
