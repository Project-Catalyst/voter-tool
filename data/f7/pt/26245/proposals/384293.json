If this is meant to provide additional revenue, or reduce overhead for SPOs acting as power distribution centers, then it would indeed be a tremendous impact on Cardano, but... \r\n\r\nLook.  Can I be perfectly blunt?  New Revolutionary Technology, which provides free or \"close to free energy\", for which no description or evidence is provided, the installation costs of which total almost half of this challenge settings total budget, is a suspect claim, and that is being charitable.  As the foundation of this proposal, NRT just seems to be Not Really There.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Without any idea of what constitutes their free energy solution for SPOs it is really hard to gauge how serious they are about any of this.  Are they referring to classic offgird systems like solar farms?  There are no specific clues, either in the proposal or their whitepaper.  They also don't seem to have much of an understanding of the technology involved in the SPOs themselves, and propose a budget for installing and operating an SPO that they found on a forum.  It is also worth noting that the whitepaper specifically mentions migrating their proposed system off of Cardano and onto their own blockchain at some point in the future, presumably transferring their Catalyst funded SPO infrastructure into a new proof of stake blockchain.  Given that they haven't included any details of the buildout of either the NRT or the SPO, it is highly unlikely that they understand all of the risks and requirements such an endeavor would involve.

You have to provide metrics and KPIs for them to make sense.  Will this proposal team be accountable to the community?

Having read it over twice, I'm still not exactly sure what this team is seeking to do, other than initiate new SPOs around this particular marketing strategy oriented towards some high ideals. Some of these ideals sound quite nice but from my perspective the proposer really needs to \"get down to brass tacks\" and deal with important details. How many of these communities already exist, and where precisely are they? Are they actual whole towns or much smaller communities in neighborhoods? How precisely does operating a stake pool harmonize with existing such communities? Without answers to questions like these, it's hard to see how the challenge's metrics are met.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There's mention of concepts like \"contributionism\" and \"free energy city council\" but not much provided in the way of examples or evidence for these things in practice.
