This survey of Japanese law is therefore needed to gain a starting position by identifying threats and opportunities within the law. The proposal aims to use this starting position to start lobbying activities influencing towards favorable changes within the law. The potential impact should not be underestimated as Japan holds a large portion of long term holders. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers claim to have relevant experience in law and accounting, so they should have knowledge of the current law concerning cryptographic currencies in Japanese society. The requested budget, although set very modestly, has been broken down and accounted for in the proposal. This proposal is part of a series of proposals in Fund 7. So it is part of a larger whole, yet I would say that legality is an important part from all proposals originating from Japan to provide a framework to operate in. The team is looking to expand in the near future. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal holds the basics in terms of auditability.

The Proposal does very effectively address the challenge by mapping out the current situation regarding laws and legal aspects in Japan, the country where Cardano started to take form and shape.

The proposer explains in his proposal that he is dedicated to execute the proposal even if the proposal won't be funded which again underlines his commitment and dedication.

It is very likely that the study will be carried out successfully and that some well thought out proposals will be introduced to the Japanese community.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The detailed plan in google docs, timeline and budget are all reasonable. They will work on the study even without funding. Very commendable for their effort!
