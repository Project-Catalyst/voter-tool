Esta proposta responde claramente a esse desafio, pois o proponente tem um projeto de lei bem elaborado e pronto para ser entregue ao legislador da Calif\u00f3rnia. A falta de um \"porto seguro\" nos EUA para projetos DeFi \u00e9 um problema s\u00e9rio que est\u00e1 paralisando a inova\u00e7\u00e3o nos EUA e impedindo que consumidores e investidores americanos participem e se beneficiem da inova\u00e7\u00e3o em cadeia de bloqueio. Toda a comunidade Cardano e, de fato, a comunidade mundial de criptografia se beneficiaria desta legisla\u00e7\u00e3o proposta. Se promulgada, ela proporcionaria uma forma legal e regulamentar para os projetos de DeFi trabalharem com os residentes da Calif\u00f3rnia. Qualquer desenvolvedor DeFi interessado em construir um projeto sobre o ecossistema Cardano se beneficiaria enormemente com este projeto.

Al\u00e9m disso, desde que a IOG j\u00e1 examinou a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e se associou como membro, oferece mais apoio para suas credenciais e habilidades. Ally gravou um \"Fireside Chat\" com o gerente de produto da IOG Atala PRISM, Tony Rose, no qual ela tamb\u00e9m demonstrou sua experi\u00eancia neste campo.

With this we're really funding specialists who can help to create a friendlier environment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of making California a Safe Harbor independent from SEC is great. Since US is a continental country with a diverse people with different beliefs, it would be easier to breakdown a little bit and implement some regulatory legislation to foment the industry and market using crypto in just one state, and if this state is CA, the visibility would be enormous \u2013 which will incentivize other states and countries.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems cohesive and since IOG is already onboard I do believe that this group is capable of deliver. \r\n\r\nOne of my concerns is about the budget asked. I've understood that USS 35K represents 10% of the total amount needed, however is the whole funding, therefore if this proposal does not finish in first place it would not be funded. Maybe reducing a little the amount solicitated would help.\r\n\r\nOther financial aspect of the proposal is that it says that to get this going it is fundamental to have more partnerships and receive more funds. And since you don't know exactly if you will receive this amount, I understand that this project will not start. Another point is that we do not control whether you'll receive the total fund (350K)  in time to get this going before the political cycle (if there is such a thing \u2013 the point is that the timeline could be altered). That said, it could be helpful to add some risk mapping.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to perceive the progress, the proposal says that it's going to be reported and the bills published.

Still, there are a few things missing in this proposal. 1: the budget is not further defined. They need a total of 350k but only request 35k in Ideascale. Furthermore their interests are not entirely clear. As they are already pursuing the bill, who financed them so far? How much of the initial 350k is already financed?
