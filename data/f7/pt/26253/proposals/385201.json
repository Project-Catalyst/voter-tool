A id\u00e9ia \u00e9 criar um portal onde a comunidade possa acompanhar o andamento dos projetos; neste portal, haveria tamb\u00e9m \"pacotes de trabalho\", que s\u00e3o basicamente pe\u00e7as do projeto a serem feitas, uma vez que a equipe apresentasse os resultados das respectivas pe\u00e7as, o financiamento seria, pouco a pouco, liberado, e assim os pacotes avan\u00e7ariam e o dinheiro estaria dispon\u00edvel. O que achei \u00f3timo aqui foi que ela organizou as coisas de forma muito sistem\u00e1tica e pr\u00e9-padronizada. Acredito que cada projeto tem suas especificidades, mas certamente \u00e9 poss\u00edvel prever um cronograma de a\u00e7\u00f5es para cada um deles e dividi-los em pacotes. Acredito que a navega\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria aqui \u00e9 um ponto crucial para o sucesso da id\u00e9ia. Porque haveria muitos projetos categorizados, divididos e especificados. O projeto da UI/UX precisa ser estudado a fim de criar a plataforma mais simples poss\u00edvel. Uma pergunta que eu tinha era exatamente onde este portal estaria. Uma p\u00e1gina web, um aplicativo? Seria interessante para o autor esclarecer onde ele seria hospedado. Fora isso, adorei a id\u00e9ia em si, acho que tornaria o monitoramento de projetos muito mais acess\u00edvel (\u00e9 muito complicado acompanhar centenas de projetos financiados, espelhados pelos mais diversos cantos da Internet!)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 capacidade do autor de executar o projeto com sucesso, gostaria de obter mais detalhes sobre quem ele \u00e9. Ele nos d\u00e1 muito pouca informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre si mesmo, tudo o que sabemos \u00e9 que \u00e9 um engenheiro, um empres\u00e1rio e tem experi\u00eancia na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de financiamentos. Mas seria importante ter um curr\u00edculo mais detalhado, exemplos de trabalhos anteriores, como \u00e9 esta experi\u00eancia com a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de financiamento, como seria o m\u00e9todo tradicional? Seria muito ben\u00e9fico se ele anexasse um perfil vinculado ou alguma outra plataforma onde pud\u00e9ssemos conhec\u00ea-lo mais de perto. Seria muito importante para este projeto ter uma experi\u00eancia de designer UI/UX a fim de construir uma plataforma intuitiva e f\u00e1cil para qualquer membro da comunidade que deseje exercer a auditabilidade. Tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se o pr\u00f3prio autor seria o programador, ele n\u00e3o diz se pretende contratar uma equipe de marketing para divulgar a id\u00e9ia, etc. Sobre o roteiro, esta parte \u00e9 muito bem detalhada, e \u00e9 acrescentada com a divis\u00e3o das despesas. Enquanto o autor aponta o que seria feito, ele diz quanto financiamento seria usado para uma determinada pe\u00e7a. E os passos est\u00e3o muito bem desdobrados, portanto temos uma s\u00f3lida no\u00e7\u00e3o do que vai acontecer em cada parte. Portanto, o que eu acho que precisa ser melhorado \u00e9 a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do pr\u00f3prio autor e a explica\u00e7\u00e3o da forma\u00e7\u00e3o de uma equipe futura, principalmente porque n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que um projeto de tal complexidade seja feito por uma \u00fanica pessoa. E como fomos apresentados a uma equipe e o que seria feito por cada profissional, tamb\u00e9m ter\u00edamos maior base para determinar se o dinheiro solicitado no financiamento \u00e9 justific\u00e1vel.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "O autor se preocupa em desenhar defini\u00e7\u00f5es de sucesso de acordo com a passagem do tempo, de forma direta para exercer a auditabilidade; tamb\u00e9m acho que isto poderia ser feito em duas etapas. Primeiro, \u00e9 claro, vamos acompanhar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da pr\u00f3pria plataforma. Isto poderia ser feito atrav\u00e9s de reuni\u00f5es, nas quais o autor mostra os avan\u00e7os, que partes foram feitas em determinados per\u00edodos de tempo. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel saber o que cobrar atrav\u00e9s da divis\u00e3o de fases que ele estabelece, e como \u00e9 muito detalhado, sabemos exatamente o que esperar de cada uma delas. E ap\u00f3s completar este processo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o, seria necess\u00e1rio observar se a plataforma estava funcionando corretamente, se a auditabilidade dos projetos \"hospedados\" realmente melhorou, se a comunidade est\u00e1 tendo acesso, o que a comunidade est\u00e1 pensando sobre a navega\u00e7\u00e3o no portal, poss\u00edveis erros a serem corrigidos.

I also like the idea of the fundings being released by work packages as it evolves, according to its schedule, completition and depencencies and have a system manage this \"stage-gate\" would be awesome.
