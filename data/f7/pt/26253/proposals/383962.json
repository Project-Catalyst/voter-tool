It can be guessed that there would be significant demand for this, judging by the growth in Eastern Town Hall and related efforts, as well as the interest shown for similar community hubs in the LatAm Fund7 challenge.  No specific metrics to this end were included in this proposal, so that demand will have to be assumed. If successful, this proposal could continue to build out language platforms as needed, leaving lots of room for growth of the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is short and sweet --add an automated AI/machine learning translator to the existing API rollout that this team was funded for in Fund6.  The team, like the budget, is lean, but their references are solid and they have support from both the PACE and AIM toolmakers in the Catalyst community.  For adding one step to an already existing roadmap the budget seems perfectly adequate, and the Fund6 demo they supplied reveals a familiar format and the addition of accurate translations, so the human oversight and proofing of the AI appears to be adequately resourced, though it is the leanest part of an already lean budget.  There aren't a lot of details in the proposal, and the timeline is rather homogenous, but it should be understood that this proposal is about adding a feature to an already funded proposal in situ, and thus, its success is dependent on the success of executing the previous proposal, of which we have only the Fund6 demo to examine.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The included roadmap lacks actionable granularity, and is not clear on where in the existing projects timeline this new feature will be rolled out.  If it is to be done in parallel, it would help to transfer some of the existing projects roadmap over to assess the milestones to be reached over the next 1-4 months.  The scale of the timeline -months- does little to indicate any natural audit points that might present themselves for this feature, but perhaps notifying the community about total percentage of proofed proposals (944 in Fund7, with anywhere from 150-300 to be funded) in a given language.  These could be announced in all the relevant Town Halls and breakout rooms.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 7, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Making Catalyst proposal data available in other languages is a good idea, but I have concerns about this proposal:\n1) It is not clear why this is in the Improve and Grow Auditability challenge. It seems to belong more in the Multilingual resources challenge. Translation of a Catalyst proposal into another language has very little to do with auditing it, including because the audit is of proposal delivery rather than the proposal itself and because auditing is largely handled by the IOG / Catalyst community in English (although this might change over time).\n2) The proposal does not specify how automated translation will be implemented. There are various solutions available to do this, but they should be identified.\n\nThe proposers should consider clarifying these points and re-submitting.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is no plan for how translation will be implemented. There are various solutions available (e.g. AWS provides one solution, although a centralized one), and the team seems to have the skills to figure these out. But one cannot have high confidence in delivery without an explanation of how it will be done.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal seems to have a target of making translation into Japanese and Spanish available within 3 months, but this is not stated in the roadmap and there are no explicit KPIs.

I would recommend that the team think about choosing a clearer problem definition in the future as this snippet will be visible in the voting app.\n\nIn the course of the proposal it is possible to understand the problems and the solution presented makes sense. The idea of \u200b\u200bimproving auditability in Catalyst is to increase eyes and scrutiny on the projects being developed and including non-English speaking communities is a good way to increase auditability, so I understand that there is a potential for relevant impact in the challenge.\n\nThe absence of metrics and KPIs in this proposal compromises the impact assessment, as it makes the assessment more subjective and inconclusive, so I would recommend that the team include indicators that allow a clearer view of the expected impact. What is the potential of people that this proposal intends to serve? If the idea is to expand access to information, it is important that data related to this are observed and that the team establishes goals/indicators.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Lidonation team has already received funding and is developing solutions related to improvements in the auditability of proposals in Catalyst. There is little information on how the machine learning translation system will work and how humans will validate this data (there is no mention in the resource budget for machine translation validators/reviewers).\n\nThe roadmap does not contain much information, I understand that the proposal is not very complex, but there is no mention of the translation review process in the roadmap and the plan in general does not present much information that allows a detailed evaluation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The problem statement does not clearly indicate the problem to be addressed, but it is possible to understand by reading the proposal. The solution makes sense and is in line with the challenge, but due to the little information presented regarding the plan, metrics and KPIs, it is difficult to audit the proposal efficiently. A positive point is that Lidonation is developing APIs to be used by the community in an open and collaborative way, which facilitates performance checking, but as the objective here is translation, i believe it is essential that the proposal manages to establish good auditability items related to translated information in the japanese and spanish communities. How can we assess whether this proposal has reached the Spanish and Japanese communities? It would be important to establish indicators to capture the outcome.\n\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 9, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Adicionar um passo \u00e0 proposta atual api para traduzir dados usando o aprendizado por m\u00e1quina.
