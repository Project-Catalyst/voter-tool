Um conceito que est\u00e1 (na minha experi\u00eancia da Comunidade Cardano) muito alinhado com os valores centrais do Cardano. A declara\u00e7\u00e3o do problema se concentra claramente em um conjunto de 400 indiv\u00edduos marginalizados e visa dar-lhes educa\u00e7\u00e3o, potencialmente proporcionando-lhes um futuro melhor. O que isso implica \u00e9 um pouco obscuro na descri\u00e7\u00e3o da proposta, apesar de algumas partes serem muito tang\u00edveis. Por exemplo, fornecendo internet, material educacional, professores, a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um centro digital \u00e9 cristalina. Mas o curr\u00edculo e o que esta educa\u00e7\u00e3o inclui poderia ser mais bem especificado. Como professor, eu adoraria ter visto um exemplo de curr\u00edculo inclu\u00eddo na descri\u00e7\u00e3o. No momento, n\u00e3o tenho certeza se os objetivos da educa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o ensinar aos participantes como aprender programa\u00e7\u00e3o funcional, ou como escrever uma s\u00e9rie de desenhos animados.

H\u00e1 v\u00e1rios KPIs apresentados de forma estruturada e cronol\u00f3gica, mas aqui tamb\u00e9m seria ben\u00e9fico fornecer mais detalhes sobre cada KPI. Ao acrescentar alguns n\u00fameros, possivelmente aumentaria a clareza da proposta. Por exemplo, o projeto est\u00e1 visando as mesmas 400 pessoas? Nesse caso, seria mais claro apresentar cada medida de sucesso como parte dos marcos do roteiro, em vez de sob os KPIs. Posso estar interpretando mal as informa\u00e7\u00f5es, mas para mim n\u00e3o est\u00e1 claro se o projeto visa encontrar 400 novos participantes ap\u00f3s cada marco do KPI.

The team has attached the budget, and after evaluating the items included, I must admit that I believe most of them to be appropriate except perhaps for the Plutus programmer. It is stated that $2600 will be allocated, but I am not sure what the role of the person will be. Is the person responsible for training the girls directly? If so, how much does each hour of training cost? Another aspect that I have missed here is the description of the risks that may threaten the successful implementation of this proposal.

What worries me a little is that the theory is perfect, but I don't really understand how that would be done in practice. It is not detailed in the proposal things like: what content of these workshops; in which schools (or universities, but I believe schools - which would also be a problem, because this type of teaching is a little difficult and advanced for those in elementary and high school. who are already dependent on the world of technologies, at least ); who would give these classes, how would the training of professionals be carried out; how often these classes would take place; how success would be measured, that is, how common taught women get inserted into the Cardano ecosystem, so as to measure the proposed benefits for the blockchain... Too many details. I'm also a little worried because it's such an ambitious idea to introduce the blockchain into a community that, unfortunately, gives so few opportunities to study and work for women. Maybe it would be more important to guarantee primary education to then invest in something more specific, you know? It worries me if this idea, despite being wonderful in theory, in practice is viable for the current situation in which these women find themselves. It is indisputable how we need to invest in their education, but I don't know if that would be the way at the moment.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, we have almost no information on this research topic. Starting with the team, we don't know who they are, what they do, what their relationship is with the Cardano ecosystem, a small curriculum of what they did before, because they would be qualified to execute this project, in particular. It would be important to present them individually, to say their names, maybe their social media profiles and all that information I mentioned. Nor is anything said about how the financing money would be used. Why 30k? It would be necessary to understand what kind of expenses this would cover: teachers' salaries, their qualifications? Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this. We have a very superficial notion of what would happen based on the expected results: the organization of classes, teacher training, contact with students and so on.

Many KPIs are enumerated so we have plenty of information to understand what is being expected and details of possible outcomes. This makes the proposal easily auditable because there is content to be monitored. It would be even better if there were a detailed roadmap here (that way we could analyze the process, not just the end) and also a budget breakdown so that we could monitor whether the money was being used as promised. I believe it would be essential for the team to partially present the results to the community. I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once. Here we do not have a temporal notion of how long this project would take to develop as a whole, but we could think, for example, of a monthly follow-up from the community to the project, together with the team. It would also be interesting if, for example, the results of these teachings in the lives of young women were evaluated. Did they get opportunities from the project? How was the impact? This information could be organized and reported to the rest of the community, through Town Hall, for example. If successful, this project would be achieving many of the Cardano ecosystem's objectives: it would bring people together around the subject (forming a hub), bring new members to the community (which relates to the challenge of f6 \"value on boarding\") and also would benefit Africa (meeting the challenge of f5 and f6 \"grow Africa, grow Cardano).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This seems to be a meaningful idea to the world community in general, and the blockchain community in particular.
