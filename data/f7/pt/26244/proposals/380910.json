They define that they want to hold 24 meetings and say that they will upload the support for people to view which is great. But It is still lacking other details for us to guage the progress and success. Things like how many people they would like the have attending these would go a long way. Holding two meetings a month is good and can be measured against, but Would love to see them comment on how many members attending these events would be considered a success.
