These DAOs offer an exciting opportunity to engage more individuals by incentivizing their participation in communities and networks they are affiliated with, or hope to be affiliated with. While the DAO is generally a new concept in the public consciousness, creating a network of DAOs that are interlinked yet autonomous to achieve mutual and individual goals will be huge. The exciting part about this proposal is that it seeks to leverage the multitude of community DAOs being created and linking them through a community DAO that can be used to support different communities. This type of networking and capitalization on the minds of the masses is very exciting and likely would help drive mass adoption for the Cardano ecosystem, particularly for hard to reach or special interest groups. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the plan and experience provided it is extremely likely that this project would be implemented successfully. The reason why I feel voters can have extra confidence in the feasibility is due to the fact that the proposers are not simply creating a DAO for one project but instead are creating a broader community network where a collection of DAOs interact and collaborate towards our shared objectives. This means that when one DAO may be struggling or need assistance, they will be able to tap into the network effect for help. The proposers also demonstrate their ability to conduct such a project and provide links to back up their statements. It is also clear that the proposers are well versed in the space, having explicitly identified their key risks and provided comprehensive solutions for their resolution. As a community, Cardano is at the forefront of this type of collective thinking and action, I would love to see a project like this add that extra layer of connectivity to the ecosystem. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the proposal can easily be audited by the Cardano Community. The proposers are seeking to link the numerous DAOs across the ecosystem into a larger network, which will allow a variety of opportunities for community input and development. By capitalizing on the wisdom of crowds (individual DAO projects) the proposers are opening themselves to an iterative and constructive process. Moreover, the layout of the plan and it's milestones, KPIs are very measurable which could then be checked by the community. Finally, since the proposers explicitly state that they will open source this initiative for others who may want to follow a similar pattern. This means that any community members can take what is learned, apply it to their own context, and adapt it accordingly. Overall outstanding job and very exciting stuff.

In my opinion the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges, with the goals aligning well with the challenge settings. The solution is unique and an excellent use of DAO infrastructure to drive Cardano adoption within the community", "q0r": 5, "q1": "After carefully considering the proposal, its interrelation to other/multiple proposals submitted and the proposers arguments for submitting multiple proposals, I am of the opinion that the submission of multiple project proposals creates confusion and uncertainty with the certain project achievable being reliant on the successful funding of other proposals submitted.\nIt is for this reason that a single project submission is preferred, but rather than requiring a large amount of funding from the beginning, the proposer should suggest funding release in stages based of the achievement of agreed project deliverables. In this manner the project would expand at a manageable rate as the lack of additional resource could result in delays if all aspects of project funded at once. But as mentioned the risk associated to one or more of the proposals not being funded and the potential impact on the overall project does not appear to have been adequately assessed, hence preference to single submission, as this also improves the auditability.\n\nRisk & Challenges\nWhilst a very necessary addition to any to any proposal, I feel the this segment to be poorly presented. The challenges / risks section reads more like a story and it is not immediately evident how the risk and impacts and controls correlate. It would be my recommendation, as business management system professional, to use a version of the following to assess risks. Using this may help to focus otherwise wordy explanations\n(1)\tdescription of the needs / expectations \n(2)\tClearly state Objectives \n(3)\tRisk description\n(4)\tAssess the probability of the risk occurring by assessing \na.\tthe likelihood.
