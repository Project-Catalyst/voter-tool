A justifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos autores para a necessidade de tal projeto \u00e9 que h\u00e1 muitas, muitas propostas, as pessoas geralmente n\u00e3o t\u00eam tempo para acompanhar tudo e ter tais resumos de conte\u00fado aumentaria a participa\u00e7\u00e3o no Catalyst, pois as pessoas teriam uma maneira mais pr\u00e1tica de conhec\u00ea-las. Pelo menos uma parte, do que \u00e9 feito aqui. Concordo com este pensamento e acho que ele pode ser muito ben\u00e9fico e pode corresponder a alguns dos objetivos do desafio, como trazer novos participantes para a comunidade Cardano, novos desenvolvedores, etc., formando novos p\u00f3los, mas n\u00e3o acho que ele contemple o objetivo de democratizar o acesso para quem n\u00e3o fala ingl\u00eas. Acho que democratizariam o acesso a Cardano para um p\u00fablico de l\u00edngua inglesa mais geral, desde os iniciantes da cadeia de bloqueio at\u00e9 os mais experientes, pois tal conte\u00fado se tornaria acess\u00edvel. Portanto, acredito no impacto parcial do que foi pedido no desafio. Seria muito incr\u00edvel se esta mesma id\u00e9ia fosse levada a outros idiomas, ou seja, criar um conte\u00fado audiovisual curto que resumisse/explique algumas propostas dos fundos de financiamento, em portugu\u00eas, espanhol, italiano, japon\u00eas, vietnamita... Dessa forma, sim, acredito que isso daria um golpe na cabe\u00e7a com o que estamos objetivando aqui.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A equipe envolvida no projeto transmite muita seguran\u00e7a; eles dedicam uma boa parte do projeto para explicar quem s\u00e3o, individualmente, seus nomes, fun\u00e7\u00f5es, um pouco do que fizeram at\u00e9 hoje, e tamb\u00e9m fornecem links para suas p\u00e1ginas pessoais, onde podemos conhec\u00ea-los mais intimamente. Acho que a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos membros foi perfeita, para mim esta \u00e9 a melhor maneira de explicar quem est\u00e1 envolvido. O roteiro tamb\u00e9m foi elaborado de forma exemplar, sabemos quais s\u00e3o as tarefas a serem cumpridas para resultar em um todo (em muito detalhe, incluem v\u00e1rios dados num\u00e9ricos que facilitam a compreens\u00e3o dos passos) e tamb\u00e9m quais s\u00e3o os objetivos, novamente usando n\u00fameros de uso para especificar sem margem de erro o que pretendem alcan\u00e7ar. Al\u00e9m disso, a equipe estava preocupada em desenhar, como conclus\u00e3o, qual seria o impacto esperado e a viabilidade do projeto. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao or\u00e7amento, eles anexaram uma tabela detalhando o que seria feito, em que quantidade e tamb\u00e9m por quanto seria feito, deixando novamente um entendimento bem estabelecido e as informa\u00e7\u00f5es fornecidas de forma completa e precisa.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Como os mesmos autores explicam, o projeto \u00e9 altamente f\u00e1cil de monitorar porque eles t\u00eam objetivos muito espec\u00edficos, o or\u00e7amento \u00e9 extremamente detalhado atrav\u00e9s da tabela anexa, o conte\u00fado pode ser monitorado atrav\u00e9s do youtube e o trabalho j\u00e1 come\u00e7aria nos pr\u00f3ximos fundos. Portanto, acredito que agora o trabalho seria da parte da comunidade para fazer esta auditabilidade. Poder\u00edamos eleger alguns membros para monitorar o progresso do projeto e trazer feedback \u00e0 comunidade, atrav\u00e9s de um de nossos v\u00e1rios canais de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o (prefeitura, disc\u00f3rdia, etc.).

The proposal presents a very real problem that a lot of people are interested in Cardano but do not have the time to learn, making it difficult to grasp the increasing number of proposals, affecting the development of Cardano. Cardano community\r\nThe solution was to produce short-term videos and podcasts in English containing analyzed information for the proposed 25% in each Catalyst Fund. A clear and understandable solution was provided as per the proposal to clearly describe the problem targeted.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We can easily check the group information based on the links the recommendation has provided. The proposed team consists of 3 members with experience in the Blockchain field and also accompanies Catalyst projects from Fund 4. At the same time, Duc Tiger is also the founder of Tiger View team, one of the core groups of the company. . Vietnam in the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, the team has also been funded in Fund 6, so I have full confidence that they can complete this proposal.\r\nWithout a doubt, the team of proponents has the right skill set, is highly motivated and is strongly committed to the Cardano ecosystem. With the experience of the CA and VCA teams, they easily realize the difficulty when voters have to absorb too many petitions while not having much time to evaluate them all. Take this suggestion as a matter of course. It saves voters a lot of time filtering out unworkable proposals. I believe that with the experience and planning presented here, it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented\r\nInterestingly, the proposal's authors explain the idea by presenting the obstacles they will face next.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the properties of this proposal, no timeline is broken down. As stated, the proposed team will start work from the start of the Fund 8 and Fund 9 proposal. It takes about 2 months for them to complete 250 videos in Fund 8 and 2 months to complete 250 videos in Fund 9. .\r\nThe proposal is feasible because it has very specific goals, has key indicators, KPIs and timelines, and is easy to track and evaluate. The given budget of $12,000 is reasonable enough and it makes me completely agree that the team is competent enough to tackle the challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I think this proposal makes a lot of sense, but not in this exact shape. Even as a CA, I find it impossible to stay up-to-date with most of the proposals in Project Catalyst. Having 2 minute videos, if properly done, would be of great benefit to the Cardano voters and community. Yet, at this iteration, I feel like the proposal could be very detrimental to the Catalyst experiment, due to the fact that it will make a selection of 250 proposals to be reviewed. That in itself is an influence on the voters and could become problematic for the entire eco-system. The only way to solve this would be to have either all proposals reviewed, or none. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team\u2019s experience confirms their aptitude towards delivering such a great task, the video for their proposal has also demonstrated the quality that we are to expect from each video. Yet what I didn\u2019t find in their plan, is how will all those videos and articles be reviewed before publishing? Will there be a core team who will be reviewing them, will they review each other, and if so, how will they be able to verify and incentivise the quality of the videos?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is well divided and contains all the needed information for its proper evaluation. The budget is well detailed, the KPIs are well explained, the roadmap is sound and comprehensive,  as such I can safely say that the proposal has clearly verifiable goals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 3, "ng": 17, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "In my opinion, the proposal is not well aligned with the challenge setting of onboarding new people and community hubs to the global Cardano ecosystem, particularly in the non-English speaking world. \n\nThat does not mean that I think this proposal will not have an impact. I think it is a good proposal, for many people the information written in Catalyst proposals is difficult to digest. Especially when voting, when a large amount of proposals should be evaluated. Having summaries in video form would be helpful. \n\nI believe this should be done with all proposals though, and not only 25% of them, as this will introduce a selection bias from the video creators. Therefore, I would prefer if they requested a larger budget so they could do this with 100% of Catalyst proposals before the voting period starts. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The video example provided shows that they can create a simple and easy to understand video explaining a proposal in 2 minutes. \n\nThe budget requested per video created seems low to me, which could affect the quality of the videos. For example, 2 dollars for editing per video, I don't know how feasible that is in the long term without affecting the quality.\n\nIt is good that the proposers are experienced in Catalyst, and reviewing proposals. The proposers seem committed and capable of following through on their promise to the community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have stated quite clearly what they will do with the funds, and how many video reviews they will create per funding round. This part of the project should be easy to assess for the community.\n\nThey have included some KPIs for watch time per video, I wish they also included some KPIs for how many viewers they hope to attract. And also elaborated further how they will make the videos accessible to more people, and let people know about them. There is little point in creating these videos if they have very few viewers.\n\nI believe it will also be difficult for the community to assess the quality of the videos, and whether they actually solve the problem of explaining proposals in a way that is easier to understand than the original proposal text.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_73", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 18, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposition could increase knowledge about our ecosystem alongside the perspective of wider adoption and participation, as it would make the process more inclusive. For example, people suffering from blindness would be able to be part of the community and be more involved in the decision-making process. The only flaw is that you can't do it for the majority of the good quality proposals, only a few, because there are just too many of them. This is why I can't give the perfect score !", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is known among the Catalyst community, they've already been funded once, during fund 6, one of them is running a stake pool [TIGER Pool] and being a community advisor for Catalyst. All of their social media channels and a Linkdn profile are set for more transparency, inspiring me confidence in the team.\n\nThe team have already made available a youtube video, as an example of their work, down the comment section: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yagm40Wny8). The video is easy to understand and well made, but the robotic voice could be annoying for many people, including me. I kindly suggest recording them with real voices.\n\nThe budget is well detailed inside the google doc, alongside the plan. Everything looks reasonable.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is ok, pretty well explained, and spread over the duration of fund 8 and 9. Key metrics and KPIs are easy to track: Average view duration; New Subscribers...\nThey acknowledged some risks to the challenge, although there are not many of those.\n\nThe milestones could have been more detailed, accompanied by dates, but I'm not sure that it is essential for this kind of proposal, anyway.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_146", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 3, "ng": 20, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Produ\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00eddeos curtos em ingl\u00eas e podcasts de 2 minutos contendo informa\u00e7\u00f5es analisadas para 25% das propostas em cada Fundo Catalisador", "experience": "A equipe 2Min Review consiste em CA, vCA, construtores comunit\u00e1rios, pesquisadores e produtores de v\u00eddeo."}
