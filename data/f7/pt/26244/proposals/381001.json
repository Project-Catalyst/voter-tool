Embora estes argumentos sejam v\u00e1lidos, eles podem n\u00e3o ser aplic\u00e1veis em todas as situa\u00e7\u00f5es. A equipe planeja abordar esta quest\u00e3o criando uma vers\u00e3o inovadora do \"hub\" com a principal caracter\u00edstica da mobilidade, onde o foco ser\u00e1 os processos de onboarding para indiv\u00edduos que s\u00e3o completamente novos nesta tecnologia. Da mesma forma, considero tanto o problema como a solu\u00e7\u00e3o pertinente, assim como as m\u00e9tricas de sucesso que est\u00e3o sendo propostas como adequadas e em linha com o que este desafio est\u00e1 buscando.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A WADA tem fornecido valor \u00e0 comunidade de forma consistente e bem sucedida ao longo de sua hist\u00f3ria.

A equipe ent\u00e3o divide o or\u00e7amento em 5 componentes identific\u00e1veis. No entanto, devo admitir que, de minha perspectiva, poderia ter sido feito um esfor\u00e7o maior. Como exemplo, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao item \"custo da equipe\", a comunidade precisar\u00e1 saber o n\u00famero de pessoas designadas para o projeto, a descri\u00e7\u00e3o de suas fun\u00e7\u00f5es e a tarifa hor\u00e1ria atribu\u00edda a cada uma delas.

This seems like an effective solution to the problem stated which is the high cost of brick-and-mortar hubs and subsequent risk of abandonment i.e. inefficient use of human and material of resources.

We know that other members of WADA will assist on this project, but ideally more team members could have been specified, especially members of the design team and engineers, as their role seems critical to implementing this proposal. It is not clear what format these mobile hubs will take, is the intention to make use of existing local venues, or to deploy and actual full mobile vehicle unit or tent, or both ? This is important to know, at least for the first prototype you are designing, as the associated costs vary greatly depending on the options. It is also not clear were the first prototype will be deployed, somewhere in Southern Europe ? The proposal describes a detailed roadmap, with quite ambitious timelines (lunch of the first CMH within 60 days), but this seems feasible given the WADA team support.

I provide strong agreement for its impact and alignment and for thinking out of the box. Communities, especially in Africa may find it more difficult to gather at a stationary meeting point; distances may be too far to travel and may be costly, or worse yet, transport is non-existent. What an ingenious way to solve the problem but to bring Cardano to the people instead. That this was presented by the WADA Alliance to me raises their pursuit for innovation even  higher whether this proposal gets funded or not. Commonly and in a pandemic-ridden world, cynics would say, well why not do it online instead? But therein lies the conundrum which brings Cardano to the African continent and is the reason why World Mobile is gaining traction. The proposal's presentation seems polished and aside from the specific requirements in terms of mobility and engineering, which is part of the initial steps anyway, it clearly explains the goals, the rationale behind the solution and the way forward, past the funding requested in Fund 8. Polished. Congratulations. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned, the WADA Alliance have successfully established four community hubs already and this is essentially the basis for my strong agreement with regards to this proposals feasibility. There will have certainly been lessons learnt over those processes which gives the confidence that giving a hub legs, pivots the difficulty to its mobility, as opposed to the establishment of the hub itself. Since this is a WADA Alliance undertaking it comes with the growing resources in terms of personnel, knowledge and experience that their leader Josh can rely upon. And as serial Catalyst proposers, funding winners and deliverers of projects they have a proven track record for the feasibility of their projects. The plan presented seems to be well-thought of starting with a pilot CMH with engineers and designers to come up with the hub-on-wheels rubric. Their near-term roadmap contains goals which are very doable (although with the current logistical issues we're having globally for equipment this timeline may need to be extended) but what impresses are their plans after this pilot where the idea, once proven, is expanded to a level that is self-funding with no reliance on Catalyst in the future. What essentially is being proposed here is not simply a truck with antennas for internet connection where people can gather around but a way to traverse that last mile where Cardano ends (with World Mobile's help) and people live. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The strongest point for this proposals auditability is WADA Alliance's eagerness to update their websites about any projects they are undertaking whether within or without Catalyst. I am sure we will see the progress of this mobile hub on their socials. In terms of this proposal's six-month timeline, there is also a mention of a new website specific to the CMH and the development of tracking capabilities, which I presume will pinpoint locations where the hub is parked. Their target audience at the beginning consists of universities, government locations, other hubs and conferences. Overall, a good proposal. I wish you success and possibly growth of similar mobile hubs in other countries and continents proposed by other Catalyst participants.
