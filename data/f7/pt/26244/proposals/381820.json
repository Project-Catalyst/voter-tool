A equipe est\u00e1 planejando participar da Blockchain Expo, que reunir\u00e1 participantes de muitas \u00e1reas diferentes, tais como Manufatura, Finan\u00e7as, Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Varejista, Energia e Sa\u00fade.

There are many ADA holders in Japan, and in order to get them involved in the community, it is necessary to increase the adoption cases of Cardano in Japan. Exhibiting at domestic EXPO events is the most effective way to reach other companies. Furthermore, at EXPO events, many companies from industries other than blockchain will also participate, so we can expect greater scalability than expected.

If there is a Blockchain Expo in Japan (I checked and it is occurring Tokyo May 2022), then Cardano should certainly feature, and this represents a good solution to the problem. This would have fitted better within the Connecting Japan community, as there is no mention here of improving or creating hubs but there are synergies with the Scale-up Cardano\u2019s CH, as new users and organizations could be onboarded via this event. As it stands this proposal would culminate in a one-off event that will always be of limited reach, the proposal could scale this by sharing it\u2019s learning with other community hubs (to set-up their own boots in different expos) or even expand it\u2019s presence to other expo\u2019s outside Japan  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A sizeable team is described, with some verifiable links presented on the website.

The team leader also a few YouTube videos, that even though don\u2019t have much engagement (low views and comments), shows his dedication and interest in Cardano (I don\u2019t speak Japanese so can\u2019t comment on the content). The proposer states that they participated in the previous the 2021 Expo and attracted 3000 visitors, this is a great demonstration of experience so would have been beneficial if the proposer could have shown proof of this for voter re-assurance. The plan of engagement within the expo is well laid out, with different teams tasked with achieving minimum goals. Besides mention of Plutus Pioneer Program, and Atala, it would be good to know what other topics would be introduced e.g. staking, upcoming DeFi projects, Project Catalyst, etc. The Timelines presented look reasonable. The requested budget also looks reasonable and is itemized, although would be beneficial to explain what the $55k for booth exactly means, are these the fees you need to pay the expo organizers? and given you have already secured a booth has any payment already been performed?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap with relevant milestones and timings is presented. A number of hard KPI\u2019s are provided such as number of brochures distributed, but also some related to the impact of your booth such as number of stakepools created, and inquiries into the Plutus Pioneer program. I assume the actual indicators would be published on your website ? would be good to confirm this as for example I couldn\u2019t find any metrics from your previous expo presence. Some KPI\u2019s regarding your preparation for the expo could also have been provided e.g. could you provide the community with the flyers/brochures you intent to distribute when these are finished ?
