This off course means that a significant amount of ADA might be held by Japanese individuals and so the use of Hardware wallets would be of high interest. As the solution is to provide a resource i.e. Japanese instructions for Hardware wallets this would have fitted better in the Multilingual resources challenge. Saying that there is also a mention of holding 10 meetups to help people set up wallets which does align with the Challenge, although it would only reach out to existing ADA holders and not onboard new people into Cardano. In summary this proposal would add value to the existing ADA community I Japan but unlikely to onboard new users.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer mentions some relevant experience, in particular the \u201cCreation of staking explanatory materials\u201d, it would have been beneficial if the proposer had shared examples of this previous work as proof of experience. The proposer also mentions he will hire a part-time helper, what will be the function of this helper and what experience is required? There is no mention on which Hardware wallets the proposer intends to cover. It\u2019s not entirely clear how the comprehensive document will be distributed, will this be handed out to people in the meetups or made available for any Japanese speaking person. There is a brief mention that a \u201chardware wallet site\u201d will be created, does the proposer mean a \u201cwebsite\u201d and does the proposer have experience in creating websites? There isn\u2019t much of a timeline or roadmap presented and although the objectives of the proposal are relatively simple (create document + hold meetups) it would have been good to provide a timeline for each of those steps e.g. document ready 2 months after funding + 1 meetup every 2 weeks. The budget requested is modest although the breakdown is not clear, why is $30 required for each person?  With a few more tweaks and clarifications as suggested above the feasibility score for this proposal can be greatly improved.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As mentioned before there isn\u2019t a roadmap or milestones presented, so it\u2019s not clear how the community could follow progress of this proposal. The proposer sets a clear metric of reaching 50 people, that\u2019s 5 people per meetup, which seems a reasonable target for a team of 2. If the proposer is creating a website, what would be the expected reach of this ?

The amount of impact is debatable as the proposal only addresses 50 people to adopt a HW wallet, but there are 10 meetups planned to promote the idea and knowledge, so I think some potentially interesting level of impact will be reached.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team provided some information on their experience that seems to be fitted for purpose, though not external link was supplied to be able to assess more.\nThe time frame and scope of the work to reach the stated goals are reasonable, as well as the budget requested.\nIt is not that clear though what is the relationship between the part time assistant and the 50 people introduction budget allocation, but I think it is a wording issue.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs and milestones provided will allow the community to perfectly audit the project and the outcomes.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_288", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 2, "ng": 16, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Given that Japan was one of the first locations where ADA was bought on mass in 2017, it is important that the Japanese community have clear and precise information in their own language. The use of cold wallets (ledger, trezor) have become the beacon of security for crypto holders and ensuring that the Japanese community can use and manage these devices would bring a large impact to the safety and security for this population. The reason why I am giving this a 4/5 and not full marks is that it is unclear how the group will deem they have been a success and how they reduce gaps in weakness in their four identified areas: legal tax law, security, FUD, and Defi expansion. Nonetheless, providing more information to the Japanese community in their own language is laudable and definitely would have a positive impact on the ecosystem. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, I find it difficult to assess the feasibility of this project with the plan provided. While the overall goal of the proposal is definitely exciting and seems manageable, there is no real plan on how this will be completed. There is no clear path for voters to know which steps will occur when and in what order. The proposal also takes a bit of a turn here as the proposer changes their objective from simply creating a site with info in Japanese but instead will not train and support 50 people to use a hardware wallet. To me, there are several assumptions that are present here but not explained: how will you choose the people? Will the need their own wallets first? What does the help you are providing look like? \nI value the experience of the proposer but this is also unclear whether they are up to the task, other than having been a Cardano user and ambassador. Do you have the skills to build a website? It's mentioned that they have created other training guides but there is no supporting documentation. Therefore, I cannot agree or disagree that this could be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I do not agree that there is ample information to audit this proposal. There are some clear milestones and checkpoints listed that could be measured against (was the site built, did you onboard 50 members) but there is little room for the community to provide oversight on the material developed and whether the information is correct. I value the that the proposer has provided a direct email for contact should people have questions, but the KPIs and Budget are not well enough defined (or organized within the proposal) to be confident the community could adequately audit. As you will continue to work on the project with or without funding, I strongly encourage you to return in fund8 (if unsuccessful) with the issues highlighted herein better developed, and you will likely have a very good chance of success.
