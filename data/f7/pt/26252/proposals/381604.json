This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable Indonesians to learn about Cardano and cryptos in general. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include rise in numbers of Cardano Indonesia Youtube, Instagram followers, workshop participants and bi-weekly participants of the Eastern Town Hall, and rise in proposals submission for Project Catalyst.\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Indonesians who know about and are comfortable with Cardano. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust among school kids for Cardano who will grow up to use Cardano system in many other ways. Simple infographics and videos will reach kids as well as adults and inculcate in kids the desire to use crypto more than fiat currency.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build videos and infographics , and put links to some of the videos/infographics on the proposal itself, rather than sending the person to the YT channel. Sometimes , reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the video and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project.

Clear costs have been given for content creation as well as project management , marketing and other costs.   \r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the set goals. Their output is only one video or Instagram post a month.  The price of a video is exorbitantly high.

If a company, then link to the corporate web page or Linkedin Profile . \r\n\r\nTeam members profiles should be included in as much detail as possible. You should also reconsider your budget and if it costs this much to produce, seek to get production done from lower priced providers in other countries. You can get the same quality job for far lower cost and thereby maximise your saving. Also seek to increase your offering from one Video or IG post per month to about 1-2 per week.

One video a week or two a week would be more realistic.\r\nPossible hurdles, challenges and difficulties have not been identified by the proposer. \r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer. Try to create more content. Content is key.  Develop metrics that help you to track.   Make as many metrics which you can track easily.
