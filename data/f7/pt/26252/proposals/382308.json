A equipe afirma j\u00e1 ter um canal no youtube onde publica v\u00eddeos com esta proposta de simplificar, ou seja, fazer v\u00eddeos em anima\u00e7\u00e3o e em uma linguagem mais acess\u00edvel, para evitar que se tornem \"chatos e dif\u00edceis\", pois eles mesmos afirmam que a maior parte do conte\u00fado sobre o assunto \u00e9. Entretanto, se quisermos perceber, este canal foi criado agora, no momento em que escrevo esta resenha o primeiro v\u00eddeo foi postado h\u00e1 apenas 4 dias. Desta forma, n\u00e3o creio que se possa dizer que a equipe tenha experi\u00eancia com a atividade que pretende desenvolver. Tamb\u00e9m estou preocupado com o fato de que os v\u00eddeos de anima\u00e7\u00e3o seriam gerados por software, VideoScribe, e n\u00e3o pelos pr\u00f3prios animadores; n\u00e3o sei se a qualidade e a sutileza dos v\u00eddeos feitos por um software seria a mesma de algu\u00e9m que trabalha com ele. Acredito que j\u00e1 existem v\u00e1rios v\u00eddeos no youtube sobre Cardano, Blockchain, etc. em ingl\u00eas; ent\u00e3o acho que talvez fosse mais \u00fatil focar no conte\u00fado para o p\u00fablico do Vietn\u00e3, especialmente dado o que este desafio busca, e talvez inserir legendas em ingl\u00eas em tais v\u00eddeos tamb\u00e9m. Em resumo, a proposta pode trazer os resultados que esperamos para o fundo, mas precisa ser pensada cuidadosamente sobre como cada v\u00eddeo ser\u00e1 constru\u00eddo, se for realmente necess\u00e1rio fazer meio ingl\u00eas/meia vietnamita (minha opini\u00e3o: foco no conte\u00fado em vietnamita), bem como uma forma de divulgar este trabalho para a comunidade vietnamita.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Esta parte da proposta \u00e9 muito bem detalhada. A equipe est\u00e1 preocupada em dar uma breve descri\u00e7\u00e3o de cada membro da equipe, e tamb\u00e9m o que cada vez antes deste projeto, em que \u00e1rea eles trabalharam e como, bem como os contatos por telegrama de todos os ouvidos. Eles tamb\u00e9m nos d\u00e3o quais seriam os assuntos abordados nos v\u00eddeos, embora na minha opini\u00e3o 104 v\u00eddeos seja uma quantidade muito alta para iniciar o projeto. Eles poderiam ter um objetivo um pouco menor, afinal, eles nos deram assuntos para apenas 15 v\u00eddeos, se fosse um em ingl\u00eas e um em vietnamita, seriam 30. Sobre o que seriam os outros 74? Creio que seria mais apropriado pedir o dinheiro para financiar menos v\u00eddeos, e renovar o pedido na f8 se a proposta for bem sucedida como planejado. \u00c9 muito positivo como eles nos d\u00e3o a freq\u00fc\u00eancia com que pretendem lan\u00e7ar os v\u00eddeos (2 por semana) e qual seria a tarefa de cada membro da equipe para tornar este projeto uma realidade, o que nos d\u00e1 um sentido do roteiro a ser seguido. Sobre o plano de marketing, acho que esta parte deixou algo a desejar. O que nos dizem \u00e9 que \"a Sra. Hannah compartilhar\u00e1 estes v\u00eddeos com a comunidade\", o que levaria aqueles 1500 telegramas a saberem sobre o projeto, mas fora deste grupo, como os autores pretendem atingir o p\u00fablico vietnamita? Seria necess\u00e1rio que eles reservassem uma parte do financiamento para cuidar da publicidade, contratassem algu\u00e9m para fazer uma forte campanha publicit\u00e1ria que atingisse exatamente o p\u00fablico alvo que pretendem atingir. Eles mesmos dizem como \u00e9 dif\u00edcil encontrar conte\u00fado bloqueado online, porque a maioria das coisas que envolvem o mundo criptogr\u00e1fico \u00e9 de natureza \"ficar muito rico\", porque quer atrair novos investidores com a possibilidade de altos lucros, o que pode, de fato, acontecer, mas as tecnologias do ecossistema Cardano v\u00e3o al\u00e9m dessa promessa. Como as pessoas no Vietn\u00e3 que n\u00e3o t\u00eam contato com a comunidade podem saber sobre a exist\u00eancia deste canal? Sobre a divis\u00e3o do dinheiro do financiamento, descobri que tudo est\u00e1 bem, eles dividem quem faria o qu\u00ea, por quantas horas, qual \u00e9 o custo da hora de trabalho, resultando em um total de 345$ gastos por semana. Nesta parte, acredito que tudo est\u00e1 como deveria estar. S\u00f3 \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio recuperar 1) a quantidade de v\u00eddeos (muito ambicioso, na minha opini\u00e3o) 2) como seria o marketing desta campanha, al\u00e9m do grupo no telegrama.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A equipe est\u00e1 preocupada em nos dar conte\u00fado para monitorar durante a auditabilidade, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito extensa.

Tamb\u00e9m seria interessante se a pr\u00f3pria equipe nos desse feedback sobre como os v\u00eddeos est\u00e3o chegando ao p\u00fablico-alvo, quantos envios est\u00e3o l\u00e1, e se essas pessoas pretendem participar ativamente do ecossistema, seja atrav\u00e9s do Catalyst ou trabalhando em outro lugar. A auditabilidade \u00e9 um pouco superficial, especialmente se a compararmos com o item analisado anteriormente, que tinha muitos detalhes.

Only if videos are succesful in Vietnam, I'd consider providing them in eglish as well, but with subtitles in order not to have record audio again.\r\n\r\nAnother point that could've been highlighted here is how many people in vietnam use cardano and how many they intend to reach and engage, to give a more insightful perspective on the total potential impact.
