Desta forma, \u00e9 passada uma garantia do porqu\u00ea de escolher aquele pa\u00eds. A proposta dialoga muito bem com os objetivos do desafio, pois procura diversificar o alcance do conte\u00fado relacionado a Cardano atrav\u00e9s da cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um centro de informa\u00e7\u00e3o em polon\u00eas. Tamb\u00e9m achei positivo que o autor demonstre preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o em criar conte\u00fado compat\u00edvel com pessoas com diferentes n\u00edveis de conhecimento sobre o mundo criptogr\u00e1fico, de modo que n\u00e3o beneficiaria apenas aqueles que s\u00e3o muito experientes ou aqueles que nunca ouviram falar dele. Fora isso, outro ponto positivo \u00e9 que o autor j\u00e1 possui alguns canais de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o com a popula\u00e7\u00e3o polonesa sobre Cardano, para que ele n\u00e3o parta do zero, e tamb\u00e9m demonstra um interesse pr\u00e9vio na a\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 sempre algo a ser levado em considera\u00e7\u00e3o. O espa\u00e7o a ser criado seria dividido em v\u00e1rias partes, tais como podcasts, uma p\u00e1gina web com artigos de not\u00edcias sobre Cardano e ensinamentos sobre a cadeia de bloqueio, etc. A diversidade de frentes a serem criadas/investidas \u00e9 uma boa maneira de alcan\u00e7ar pessoas diferentes, pois algumas utilizam alguns meios e n\u00e3o outras. Assim, eu pensei que este projeto atende muito bem ao que queremos no desafio e tem uma boa chance de produzir um grande impacto.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A equipe envolvida no projeto incluiu uma breve descri\u00e7\u00e3o sobre cada um deles, contendo seus nomes, pap\u00e9is e alguns projetos que criaram antes (com links em alguns casos); dois deles tamb\u00e9m disponibilizam seus perfis de linkedin, para que possamos conhec\u00ea-los com mais detalhes. Seria bom para Jakub fazer isso tamb\u00e9m, mas talvez ele n\u00e3o tenha a rede social. Acho que eles transmitem muita confian\u00e7a em sua capacidade de executar o projeto com sucesso, porque t\u00eam muita conex\u00e3o em cadeia de bloqueio e j\u00e1 t\u00eam alguns projetos para contar como experi\u00eancia. Entretanto, seria melhor se algu\u00e9m respons\u00e1vel pelo marketing tamb\u00e9m fosse inclu\u00eddo na equipe oficial, n\u00e3o sabemos se algum deles cobriria sequer esta fun\u00e7\u00e3o, mas seria mais apropriado contratar um profissional na \u00e1rea, j\u00e1 que a divulga\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 extremamente essencial para o sucesso do projeto. Se a id\u00e9ia aqui \u00e9 chegar \u00e0 popula\u00e7\u00e3o polonesa com conhecimento sobre Cardano, duas coisas s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rias: bom conte\u00fado e boa publicidade. A equipe n\u00e3o cria exatamente um roteiro a ser seguido. N\u00e3o temos um agrupamento de atividades, organizado de forma linear de acordo com a passagem do tempo, que seria necess\u00e1rio para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do conjunto. Sabemos que h\u00e1 v\u00e1rias coisas a serem criadas, algumas j\u00e1 existem, mas que ser\u00e3o melhoradas. Como todo este processo se realizaria? Seria melhor se a equipe tivesse organizado estas atividades ao longo dos meses, para que pud\u00e9ssemos entender o que veio primeiro, por qu\u00ea, quem o faria, e assim por diante. E sobre a divis\u00e3o financeira, \u00e9 ideal, sabemos como o dinheiro ser\u00e1 dividido e cada parcela tamb\u00e9m tem uma pequena explica\u00e7\u00e3o, por exemplo, na parte de artigos que sabemos quanto custaria traduzir por palavra. Portanto, temos um entendimento muito completo de como o financiamento seria utilizado. Portanto, a \u00fanica coisa que precisa ser melhorada em minha opini\u00e3o \u00e9 a defini\u00e7\u00e3o exata de um roteiro.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Os autores nos fornecem muitas informa\u00e7\u00f5es que podem ser utilizadas para a auditabilidade.

Tamb\u00e9m sabemos qual seria a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de sucesso a cada trimestre e ap\u00f3s 1 ano, para que voc\u00ea possa monitorar exatamente se o que voc\u00ea estava pensando aconteceu. Portanto, acredito que \u00e9 suficiente selecionarmos um membro da comunidade que possa falar polon\u00eas (de prefer\u00eancia um nativo do pa\u00eds) para monitorar o progresso do projeto e os resultados, a fim de preparar um feedback geral e traz\u00ea-lo para o resto da comunidade.

Amount of content originally created in Polish\r\n\r\n2. Amount of content translated into Polish\r\n\r\n3.

Sometimes   reducing that one step might motivate someone to view the article and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.

They have shown their experience on various media outlets, experience on educational series, various websites that they have founded, SPO experience, and creation of a community on social media channels.  These links are sufficient, but it would have been better to include the social media channels at all in order to verify the size and existence of the community.  I have visted links. The proposers appear competent, having experience in media publishing and content creation.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposer has identified the core team but has not quantified how many team members are needed to accomplish the content creation on various media.\r\n He has rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown in terms of the core leadership. \r\n The budget has been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items which includes server and domain costs, theme creation costs and is a flat rate per word to cover costs of translation,and release of press releases to various sites, mass and social media. This also includes costs of creating podcasts and merchandise. Also carrying out quizzes, kahoots and livestreams on various channels.They have also identified marketing and awareness building costs with ad costs, consultations and other promotional costs. The budget is very reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\n \r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation in terms of the materials to be translated as well as how output would be generated. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described. \r\nThe proposal clearly explains  technical aspects such as translation, website creation, theme creation,creation of podcasts,  editing, publishing which are steps needed in a localization project.
