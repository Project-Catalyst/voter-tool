Understanding that Milkomeda will facilitate the move of Ethereum/solidity developers to Cardano, that Ethereum/solidity is currently the major focus of DeFi and Blockchain developers, and that many of these developers will be native Spanish speakers, It is clear that making the documentation of Milkomeda available to Spanish speakers can contribute to onboard on to Cardano, a large population of Spanish speaking developers and users.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the experience demonstrated by the proponents through their contributions to the Cardano Ecosystem in Emurgo, IOHK and dcSpark strongly supports the possibility that this proposal is implemented successfully. The fact that the project is advanced, that the documentation to be translated is fairly advanced and available, and that developers in the team are fluent dual language speakers further supports this possibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, I believe that the information provided is sufficient. I understand that the nature of the project is flexible and dependent on the progress of the original English source to be translated. Nevertheless, a more structured schedule for the translations could have been provided. On a different topic, even though it is highly desirable to stretch resources as much as possible, and that I believe that the proponents can successfully execute the proposal, it is also very important that everyone's job, developers and translators, in English or Spanish speaking realms are adequately funded at least at current standard rates. My suggestion here is that in the future, the proponents may want to pursue more financial flexibility to execute the project by considering for example: professional translation rates and and economic assessment of uncertain execution.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_183", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 9, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The launch of the Milkomeda protocol is in itself a helpful tool for bringing in new developers into the Cardano ecosystem.

Their website contains all the information regarding the protocol they are building, and hiring 3 translators and one engineer to review the translated documents is a very sensible approach.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have given a brief timeline and an expected launch date that seem to be reasonable. The budget is not very detailed, yet the task at hand is quite simple, so as not to warrant a very comprehensive financial plan.

A plan was not presented to keep the project financially sustainable in the future.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer presented the website Milkomeda but did not identify the team members responsible for translating the documents. To assess whether the work will be carried out successfully, it would be important to know who are the people who will carry out the work and provide evidence of their experience/skills. The budget was not well detailed. How much does the translator cost? How much does the engineer cost? It was unclear how many documents will be translated, and it has not been said in how many languages will be translated. As well as a detailed plan showing everything that will be done at each stage was not presented. Therefore, it is not possible to assess whether the established period of 3 months will be adequate to complete the work. It would be important for a better assessment to clarify the number of documents that will be translated, establish quantitative targets for translations and say which languages the documents will be translated into.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The target problem and its solution were clearly presented. A roadmap with milestones was not presented and no KPIs or key metrics were provided. This information is important to make it possible to assess the progress and success of the work.

Namely those translations are for Japan (JP), Kanuri (KR) and Chinese (ZH). Although many countries in Europe and around the west of the globe speak English there are numerous countries where English isn't spoken or used as often. By covering languages like Japanese, Kanuri and Chinese the chance for increasing adoption of Milkomeda increases on a global scale which provides a high chance for creating impact within the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has a background working in Emurgo and closely with IOG. dcSpark was created as an organisation to help with Cardano infrastructure and has delivered on numerous previous Catalyst proposals. There is a large amount of evidence that this time will feasibly be able to execute this proposal based on their track record. The budget is low and more than reasonable enough for three translators at $1,333 each when considering the impact it could have in adoption of the Milkomeda sidechain. It would have been nice to know more about the translators they intend to use or the company that would be selected so that the advisors had full confidence that the translators are also to a high standard.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A basic timeline is provided stating 1 to 3 months to execute after the English documentation is finished. No KPIs or success metrics have been added. No detailed KPIs or success metrics are needed for this proposal due to its simplicity of what is trying to be achieved. However it still would have been an improvement to see a plan for the proposal team to verify any finished translations with the community to report and feedback and make alterations as part of the completion stages of the proposal.
