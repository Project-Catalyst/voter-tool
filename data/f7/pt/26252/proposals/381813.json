O autor nos d\u00e1 um breve relato de um projeto que ele j\u00e1 est\u00e1 colocando em pr\u00e1tica, como eu entendo, s\u00e3o reuni\u00f5es presenciais em um lugar chamado clubhouse, cuja principal agenda \u00e9 discutir Cardano e Blockchain. Isto \u00e9 muito interessante, pois mostra o envolvimento do autor com a causa, mesmo antes de receber o financiamento. No entanto, tenho algumas observa\u00e7\u00f5es a fazer. Primeiro, o autor diz desde o in\u00edcio da proposta que \"um dos projetos mais influentes do mundo, na verdade, um dos projetos emblem\u00e1ticos de Cardano ser\u00e1 realizado em parceria com a Eti\u00f3pia\". Est\u00e1 bem, mas que projeto \u00e9 este? Seria muito importante que o autor esclarecesse esta quest\u00e3o para que as pessoas de fora, que n\u00e3o t\u00eam contato com este projeto ou que s\u00e3o participantes locais no pa\u00eds, que t\u00eam mais chances de conhec\u00ea-lo, possam entender o que est\u00e1 sendo dito aqui. Outra coisa que notei foi na parte em que ele diz que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o et\u00edope tem mais probabilidade de acessar conte\u00fado de \u00e1udio do que conte\u00fado escrito em websites, que ele fez alguns estudos e pesquisas e chegou a esta conclus\u00e3o. Gostaria que ele argumentasse que, quais foram suas pesquisas, que dados ele coletou, como chegou a esta conclus\u00e3o, etc. Al\u00e9m de tais quest\u00f5es, acredito que sim, a proposta \u00e9 de alto valor e ter\u00e1 um impacto positivo na quest\u00e3o de levar conhecimento sobre Cardano a falantes de outros idiomas.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Aqui temos uma boa id\u00e9ia de quem faria o qu\u00ea atrav\u00e9s do t\u00f3pico \"pap\u00e9is e tarefas\". A forma como a equipe organiza estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9 muito direta e satisfat\u00f3ria, pois podemos visualizar claramente qual profissional seria respons\u00e1vel por qual parte do projeto. Entretanto, uma coisa extremamente importante n\u00e3o foi feita aqui, que seria a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe. N\u00e3o sabemos seus nomes, que \u00e1rea de atividade cada um deles tem, uma breve hist\u00f3ria de seu trabalho at\u00e9 o momento e como se relacionam com o ecossistema Cardano. Ter estas informa\u00e7\u00f5es seria essencial para transmitir maior certeza de que a equipe \u00e9 capaz de desenvolver este projeto. Penso que tamb\u00e9m faltavam algumas informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o processo em si, por exemplo: qual a dura\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia das grava\u00e7\u00f5es? Que assuntos, especificamente, seriam abordados, e em que ordem? Quem seriam esses profissionais que seriam convidados? Eu gostaria que ele tivesse mais detalhes sobre o conte\u00fado em si, al\u00e9m da necessidade de sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o e de como isso afetaria a comunidade et\u00edope. Quanto \u00e0s despesas, esta parte da proposta foi muito detalhada, sabemos como ser\u00e1 utilizado o valor de USD 3500 (um valor modesto em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o que a maioria das propostas pede financiamento). A divis\u00e3o \u00e9 muito justa e realista, mas eu perdi o pagamento das pessoas envolvidas. Por exemplo, quem apresentaria o podcast, o convidado especial, essas pessoas n\u00e3o seriam pagas? Por estas raz\u00f5es, acredito que a proposta carece de mais detalhes, a fim de entender mais sobre o processo de cria\u00e7\u00e3o do podcast, conhecer melhor os autores da proposta e mais detalhes sobre o conte\u00fado gerado.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "O autor define KPIs pelos quais podemos monitorar se os objetivos est\u00e3o sendo atingidos. Seria interessante se ele preparasse um relat\u00f3rio mensal evidenciando os dados citados nestes KPIs e os enviasse \u00e0 comunidade, exibindo durante uma prefeitura as conseq\u00fc\u00eancias de seu projeto, ou seja, deixar o resto da comunidade saber o que est\u00e1 acontecendo na localidade e o feedback que seu podcast est\u00e1 recebendo. Considero isto uma simples proposta de auditabilidade, o que realmente precisa ser feito \u00e9 manter contato com o autor, talvez algu\u00e9m que fale am\u00e1rico e j\u00e1 fa\u00e7a parte da comunidade Cardano possa ouvir o podcast e estabelecer uma ponte com o autor, dar sugest\u00f5es e tamb\u00e9m ser capaz de nos garantir (falantes n\u00e3o am\u00e1rios) que o conte\u00fado est\u00e1 sendo constru\u00eddo como prometido. Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio monitorar a campanha de marketing para este projeto, pois em minha opini\u00e3o \u00e9 a chave do sucesso, j\u00e1 que o objetivo principal seria envolver os habitantes do pa\u00eds com conhecimentos relevantes para Cardano e torn\u00e1-los mais preparados e interessados em aderir aos projetos que ali ser\u00e3o desenvolvidos no futuro. \u00c9 por isso que \u00e9 essencial garantir que o conte\u00fado chegue at\u00e9 eles, que cada podcast seja amplamente divulgado. Portanto, acredito que o autor nos forneceu o conte\u00fado a ser monitorado, sugiro que haja este tipo de feedback dele (mencionei id\u00e9ias como um relat\u00f3rio escrito ou a participa\u00e7\u00e3o na cidade), e tamb\u00e9m o monitoramento de algum membro da comunidade que \u00e9 falante do idioma em quest\u00e3o.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 11, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem of the Ethiopian community losing the opportunities that Cardano offers was described and as a solution, the creation of an Amharic audio content about Cardano was presented.

This proposal is in line with the challenge as it intends to attract non-English speakers to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer does not present evidence of his experiences, which would be important to check the project's viability. The budget has been detailed and appears to be reasonable for the work to be carried out.

It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Amharic audio content for the people in Ethiopia, explaining Cardano blockchain. \r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Ethiopians to understand everything about Cardano and the opportunities it presents. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community. \r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of engagementss, and abovementioned key metrics. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Ethiopians to listen to and participate in the podcast thereby increasing knowledge on Cardano.\r\n\r\nI have given this proposal a 4 star rating because it has gone into great detail and shown a realistic and reasonable understanding of the scope of work as well as a very reasonable budget.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has   provided evidence  of himself  where he is a managing the local Cardano Community on telegram and having Clubhouse discussions  .

Clear costs have been given for the various hosting fees on platforms and marketing campaign costs as well as podcast apps.   \r\n\r\nThe budget is  very reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required. \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the site and related publications.\r\nThe proposal  does  provide  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of site production. \r\n\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are well described.   \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have been addressed.
