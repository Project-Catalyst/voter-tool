It is vital for any business, in order to scale up to its maximum, enter in Chinese community. That said, I do think that this proposal addresses the challenge.\r\n\r\nOne point, though, is that I am thinking that maybe creating a material or a translation of the existing material together with this proposal would benefit to its maximum. I am imagining that in China the English language is not well adopted, therefore I imagining how a normal citizen will start to develop its curiosity towards ADA (it would be hard to start studying and understand everything since the majority of its material is in English). Maybe, the groups are a step after the lecturing material.\r\n ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "TELEGRAM:\r\nI believe that this is totally feasible since you're already doing it. Although, there are some points that caught my attention: Since the proposal is based in a 3 months budget, I was wondering 1) what is going to happen when the budget runs out after the 3 months? Will the project stop? 2) Since China has a huge growing potential, based on its community size, I am wondering if one moderator, working 1,5 h/d will be able to organize and answering everything in an effective manner \u2013 it is not scalable; 3) Gather community feedback on Telegram is quite easy since you have the opportunity to use robots there, that said, maybe this money could be associated with other activity.\r\n\r\nDISCORD:\r\nBasically, I have the same points that I've made before.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As explained in this proposal, the growth tracking of these platforms is a good metric to know if there are more people interested.

(There is a small mistake about this item in budget broken down list: 'Gather feedback about the moderator's work on Telegram' is available twice.
