Achei uma id\u00e9ia extremamente boa, na minha opini\u00e3o seria perfeito para ser feito em todos os idiomas! Porque como participante Catalyst de dois fundos, posso assegurar que sofro desta doen\u00e7a, n\u00e3o posso acompanhar muito bem as prefeituras, tanto porque normalmente tenho aulas universit\u00e1rias no momento da transmiss\u00e3o (o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 um grande problema, pois elas s\u00e3o gravadas), mas principalmente porque est\u00e3o em ingl\u00eas. Eu sei ler, escrever e falar ingl\u00eas, mas compreender uma reuni\u00e3o inteira no idioma, al\u00e9m do fato de que a maioria dos apresentadores s\u00e3o ingleses nativos, portanto t\u00eam um sotaque, torna muito dif\u00edcil acompanhar o conte\u00fado. Para os vietnamitas a situa\u00e7\u00e3o deve ser semelhante, o que torna esta id\u00e9ia muito \u00fatil, acompanhar as principais atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es dos ecossistemas \u00e9 algo que cada membro da comunidade deve fazer, e certamente esta proposta tornar\u00e1 isto mais poss\u00edvel para os vietnamitas. Outro ponto positivo que encontrei aqui foi que os autores j\u00e1 t\u00eam um projeto financiado pela f6, o que demonstra que eles t\u00eam compet\u00eancia e experi\u00eancia com nosso ecossistema e com o Catalyst, e tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito \u00fatil que eles j\u00e1 tenham um site criado onde este novo conte\u00fado poderia ser introduzido.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A equipe do projeto se mostra muito bem preparada para realiz\u00e1-lo, pois eles fornecem uma pequena descri\u00e7\u00e3o individual de quem s\u00e3o, que \u00e9 resumida por seus contatos em redes sociais, tornando real a possibilidade de fazer contato direto e de conhec\u00ea-los melhor, e tamb\u00e9m o fato de j\u00e1 terem um projeto que foi financiado na f6. Sobre o roteiro, eles apresentam quais fases precisariam ser conclu\u00eddas para atingir seus objetivos, mas acredito que estas fases poderiam ser mais exploradas. Por exemplo, na parte que fornece os resumos dos principais canais de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o no Vietn\u00e3 sobre Cardano: como esta ponte seria constru\u00edda? Qual seria o \"fluxo de trabalho\" na primeira fase? \u00c9 sempre bom explicar cada termo em detalhes, para que as pessoas que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o familiarizadas com ele entendam plenamente a proposta. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao or\u00e7amento, acredito que o n\u00edvel de detalhes aqui foi alto, e com isso, satisfat\u00f3rio. Sabemos quanto custar\u00e1 cada parte do projeto, e em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos custos vari\u00e1veis, eles s\u00e3o muito bem calculados, discriminados e explicados para que possamos entender exatamente o que aconteceria aqui. Portanto, acho que a \u00fanica coisa que eu sugeriria seria um pouco mais de detalhe nas fases.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Achei interessante como a equipe est\u00e1 preocupada com a auditabilidade. Eles n\u00e3o s\u00f3 t\u00eam o cuidado de transmitir informa\u00e7\u00f5es que ajudariam o resto da comunidade a monitorar o progresso do projeto, mas tamb\u00e9m elaboraram um plano de aubitabilidade no qual monitorariam o crescimento do projeto, de acordo com o n\u00famero de visitas ao local. O projeto foi desenvolvido com a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de ouvintes do podcast e assim por diante. Dessa forma, tudo o que precisar\u00edamos fazer era ter acesso a tais informa\u00e7\u00f5es tamb\u00e9m, que eles gerariam semanalmente, mas poderiam nos apresentar mensalmente, ou a cada 2 meses, por exemplo.

Another issue is that the meetings are held at a very inconvenient time of 1am (Vietnam Time). It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by providing Vietnamese content for the people in Vietnam regarding Town Hall content.This proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would enable  Vietnamese to understand everything about Cardano and the Town Hall content. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include  Number of Episodes, how many viewers, how much feedback from the community, how many subscriptions, how many comments, how many members of the community. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge.Proposal can scale to address future challenges by increasing the numbers of Town Hall meeting recordings. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and trust  among Vietnamese. \r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have   provided evidence  of themselves where he is a managing the Eastern Town Hall activities  .

Clear costs have been given for the various hosting fees on platforms and marketing campaign costs as well as podcast apps.   The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 1500 USD to develop a website of this nature is too high. Text to speech convertors may not cost this much. The cost per video has been taken as 360-400 USD which is high for a video of this nature. Typically videos like this are not costed per word but per audio minute. As such a video like this may cost around 200 USD each.Labor cost has been taken as 60 USD per hour which is far too high even by Western standards, leave alone Vietnamese rates.  A Labor cost of 20 USD is more reasonable. \r\nThey have a massive reserve of 1700 USD which I feel is too high. The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required but has kept a massive contingency fund. \r\n\r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the site and related content.The proposal  provides  a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has a very practical plan with detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of site production. The costs stated are too high in my professional opinion as one who runs a translation agency and does translation and audio production as well as have run a web development company for 10 years.\r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. The proposal has technical aspects which have been addressed. The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal but has allocated a large contingency fund.
