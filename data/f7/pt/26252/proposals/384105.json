Em teoria, acredito que seja uma iniciativa perfeita para o que estamos procurando com este desafio. S\u00f3 gostaria que houvesse mais detalhes como um todo, por exemplo: algumas perguntas de amostra que podem ser feitas, al\u00e9m das mais \u00f3bvias como \"o que \u00e9 cadeia de bloqueio\", \"o que s\u00e3o moedas criptogr\u00e1ficas\" e assim por diante. Que idiomas estamos falando aqui em termos de tradu\u00e7\u00e3o? Como esta p\u00e1gina web poderia se integrar com o trabalho da equipe AIM, por exemplo? Seria uma p\u00e1gina web, mas poderia a AIM desenvolver uma ferramenta? Portanto, tais detalhes precisariam ser explicados, para que possamos ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o mais s\u00f3lida do projeto em si, embora a id\u00e9ia seja muito boa.

Sabemos que ele estuda neg\u00f3cios em uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o internacional na Fran\u00e7a. Mas seria essencial para n\u00f3s saber detalhes como: que institui\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 esta; em que neg\u00f3cios ele pretende operar, como ele pensa que a cadeia de bloqueios se relaciona com sua forma\u00e7\u00e3o... Ok, ele justificou que a cadeia de bloqueio \u00e9 uma tecnologia que ser\u00e1 importante no futuro e Cardano se destaca em termos de ser sustent\u00e1vel e ter um objetivo de melhorar o mundo, mas eu gostaria de saber, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a si mesmo, como ele pretende aplicar a tecnologia em sua forma\u00e7\u00e3o/trabalho? Se ele tem alguma experi\u00eancia de trabalho anterior; qual \u00e9 a nacionalidade de seus colegas de classe, ou seja, para quais idiomas o curso seria traduzido. O passo-a-passo do projeto est\u00e1 bem definido, creio que \u00e9 uma proposta bem conduzida neste aspecto, e tamb\u00e9m que n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o complexo de implementar no sentido de que uma linha de tempo singular pode orientar bem o que ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio fazer para obter o sucesso. O n\u00edvel de detalhes para cada fase n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o profundo, mas nos d\u00e1 uma boa compreens\u00e3o do processo. E finalmente, em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao or\u00e7amento, tamb\u00e9m descobri que ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito detalhado, embora o dinheiro solicitado seja pouco comparado com a maioria das outras propostas, o autor poderia explicar melhor cada parte. Por que custa US$ 2.000 para criar a se\u00e7\u00e3o de perguntas e respostas? Como esses 2000 d\u00f3lares seriam divididos em pequenas atividades?

Mas seria essencial para n\u00f3s saber quais universidades ele pretende contatar, quais pa\u00edses, como ele entraria em contato com essas pessoas, para que pud\u00e9ssemos monitorar as atividades. Algo que seria interessante aqui \u00e9, por exemplo, se as pessoas que participaram do projeto pudessem dar algum feedback, os estudantes das universidades alvo se juntaram ao Catalyst, come\u00e7aram a estudar a cadeia de bloqueios, adotaram Cardano? O autor poderia nos dar tais respostas como uma forma de auditabilidade, acredito que o acompanhamento nesta proposta seria mais qualitativo do que quantitativo. Penso que isto \u00e9 porque \u00e9 mais importante saber se as pessoas nas quais a se\u00e7\u00e3o de perguntas e respostas foi feita estavam interessadas em entrar no ecossistema Cardano do que, necessariamente, quantas pessoas foram alcan\u00e7adas. Portanto, eu gostaria que o autor promovesse mais contatos com a comunidade (ele poderia at\u00e9 se juntar ao grupo AIM, que j\u00e1 tem experi\u00eancias anteriores e sabe como apresentar resultados).

Its much more straightfoward than courses and can impact much more languages with less effort.\r\nMy main considerations on the proposals are:\r\n\r\n1) How these students will contacted (using which filters and channels) and what does well informed mean? maybe it could include more details on what is going to be taught to them and how (will it follow a course model?) Also. how to guarantee these students will really be \"well informed\"? Maybe exams could be made, with different types of questions.\r\n2) will the students have a limited time to reply? I understand having fast reply is essential to guarantee a good user experience. At the same quality, it is necessary to ensure the quality/assertiveness of the information provided.\r\n3) Last, I'd highlight here in the proposal who the target audience is. Is the ovjective to mainly address new member already engaged questions or to attract still nont engaged people? This changes a lot the communication strategy.\r\n\r\nI like the idea to start small and see scale up aftewards and to have an open log with the Q&A, especially translating the most reputable one. Maybe some reward could be given to the best repliers. Also appreciated the idea of trying existing platforms and evaluating if creating a new one is better.

How to overcome them?\r\none note: it says  as challenge \"We can not cover all the languages in the world\". I'd say this is nearly impossible, so maybe it would be better if this specific challenge was narrowed down by the number of languages aimed/desired at the end of the project.

It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by creating a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages.\r\nThis proposal shows clearly how it adds value to the Cardano system as it would create a dynamic Q&A section for newcomers in multiple languages where they could ask questions and get real time answers from people, not bots. They would get answers in their preferred local language. Key metrics are clear, reasonable and realistic. THese include contacting of students, teaching the students about Cardano, Creating the Q and A Rubric, in the form of a web page or a content repository of all possible questions which would grow. The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. The list of metrics and KPIs is comprehensive and well laid out. It is a simple enough plan, easy to execute.  As questions grow the repository would also grow. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding languages and students to answer questions. \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among non English speaking newcomes to DLT and Cardano\r\n\r\nI cannot say that this project adequately addresses the challenge but I also say it would be useful hence i have given it a 3 star rating.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have  not provided evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in building these sort of projects. The Linkedin Profiles of Core leadership has not been provided. They are students at a business school in France. While the concept is simple,no proof has been given that they are able to execute this plan.  The links are not sufficient. \r\nI have visited the links.but its to the corporate site of the school, not anything of the proposers themselves. I cannot assess if the proposer is competent to build this content since no information has been given as to prior experience in this area. \r\nThe proposal   has stated that the students of the school from 10 countries will work together and reach out to other students.  There is no guarantee if other students will join, or if they would be competent in providing this service in an efficient and timely manner.He has not provided the team structure of members and their capabilities and has mentioned other partners who he would work with such as web developer.\r\n The budget has  been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. They have allocated themselves 1200 USD for learning.  This should not be a cost factor per se since learning is a voluntary process and should not need to be paid for. They can charge for answering questions but learning itself should not be charged for. 2000 USD to create a simple web page by which questions can be added and a repository created is far too high, speaking in my professional opinion as a web and solutions developer for over 20 years. The budget is  not reasonable to achieve the set goals.  The costs are higher than I feel are reasonable. For example 2000 USD for a simple web site seems somewhat high to be reasonable. \r\nThe proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required  \r\nThere is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. \r\nThe timetable is realstic to build the tools and related research.\r\nThe proposal  does not give a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. It has no plan stated with no detailed breakdown in terms of the various stages of development. \r\nResources  necessary to implement the proposal are described. \r\nThe proposal has technical aspects which have not been addressed \r\nThe proposer has not identified risks in this proposal . Given experience and plan presented it is hard to say this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given it a 1 star rating. Also I have rated it like this because the budget is too high for such a project.  \r\n\r\nA piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\nGiven experience and plan presented and the other issues mentioned above, it is highly unlikely this proposal will be implemented successfully hence I have given a 1 star rating.
