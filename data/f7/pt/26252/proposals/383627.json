It is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by creating Language Community Hubs with Publishing content on YouTube, TikTok & SoundCloud + Edu & news blog.\r\nThis proposal shows somewhat how it adds value to the Cardano system by creating Language Community Hubs. Publishing on YouTube, TikTok & SoundCloud + Educational content and news. Key metrics are  stated such as number of videos, blog posts, educational articles, news articles, podcasts.  The key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge. Proposal can scale to address future challenges by further adding more content and more platforms. This project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the awareness and knowledge among various language speakers.  I can say that this project adequately addresses the challenge  hence i have given it a 4 star rating.\r\n \r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have provided no evidence  of themselves with their skills and experience in content creation, video creation, translation or these sort of projects. They have already received funding in two previous proposals. No Linkedin profiles are given here. Ideally they should have been provided, together with work done in previous funds. If F6 work has been done, to an extent perhaps those could be shown. The links are not sufficient.   I feel the proposer is competent to do the blog.The proposal   has  indicated the core leadership. The Linkedin profiles are not given.  He has not provided the team structure of members and their capabilities  The budget has  been outlined clearly   Also the price is reasonable considering what the output is.The budget is   reasonable to achieve the set goals.The proposer has not provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required .  There is no plan for additional funding  if objectives are not met. Theres a detailed timetable  which is reasonable, but its not realistic to consider 6 new languages within 3 months if its a lot of content.The proposal gives a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.  .Resources  necessary to implement the proposal are described.   The proposal has technical aspects which have been addressed. The proposer has not identified risks in this proposal.  This proposal may  be implemented successfully and budget is reasonable though in some places hazy,  hence I have given it a 3 star rating.   \r\n A piece of advice... You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise. A proposer who has considered this, would be looked on more favorably since it shows that they are prepared for various situations and eventualities\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement . The Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal would be number of videos and how many views per video and in total, number of blog articles, news articles, educational articles, soundcloud audio files, number of languages published. A marketing budget has been allocated. But they have specified that marketing will come later. \r\nIt is not clear when they talk about translations as 60 USD per European translation and 120 USD per African/Asian translation.  What is it that they are translating? Is it one blog post, or 10 blog posts or the entire site?  This clarity is critical.  So on this basis the budget is hazy in my professional opinion as someone who has been doing translation and content creation for about 20 years.There is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem \r\nand there is a detailed solution. The proposer has not identified some possible hurdles, challenges and difficulties such as translation of technical terms.The information provided is  sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal hence I have given it a 4 star rating.\r\nNonetheless one piece of advice for the proposer.  Make as many metrics which you can track easily. Use Trello or Notion or some similar project management tool.\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_460", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal sets to encourage not engglish speaking users to learn about and adopt cardano by providing them with educational materials in their native language.

The website is given, but unless I am mistaken, does not bring more information on the members of the team. The budget is detailed and broken down into different items. It seems realistic. The fact that it is stated that this project has already been founded in F6 is rather positive, providing evidence of results, links or other would have been a plus to attest to the success of these early implementation phases. Risks are not addressed either, which would have indicated the ways in which the team has responded to them.
