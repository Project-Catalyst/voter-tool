Only downside to this is all that liquidity is locked away in the NFT itself. This proposal aims to mend that gap and help NFTs specifically blue chips with higher volume become liquid. This proposal is perfect for this challenge category.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the teams experience, I believe they have a high likeihood of success.

I agree with the problem statement about NFT being unreliable source of price due to its limited liquidity which in turn preventing the expansion of NFT usage in DeFi. In my opinion the team's idea has potential to solve the issue. The proposed Plutus-native NFT-FT pooling protocol, enable people to Have access to immediate liquidity for your NFTs, earn yield on NFTs, Use NFTs as collateral for loans, invest in indexes of NFT projects, Swap NFTs of the same type effortlessly and, Become fractional holders of NFT projects.

To improve, I would like to suggest the team to provide monthly report on the progress as well as budget spending in their website or cardano forum so it can be more accessible and transparent.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_643", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 5, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Os pools NFT-FT criam um mercado para a descoberta instant\u00e2nea de liquidez e pre\u00e7os NFT.
