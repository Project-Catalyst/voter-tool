The stated problem is the need to avoid third party applications because they're a potential security risk and can never be as safe as a node that can verify all transactions. The author could have done a better job explaining the implications of what he has done which is epic by itself. There are not key metrics to speak of. The proposal can scale very easily if what the proposer has done is made into an application that you can just install on your phone and have it work for you.

I understand people value their privacy, but that has to be measure agains the credability you get when you stand with your name behind your proposal. There's no mention of team members and I was left with the impression that this was a fun experiment, but not something they want to work on seriously. There is a budget but no breakdown of costs or hourly rates or any other breakdown. There is no timetable or deffinition of success to speak of. There is no plan for future implementation and integration, just the idea of publishing an android application that you can use. There are no resources described to bring the project to fruition.
