It would give them credit for prior work if they provided some information about how they are connected in the Cardano Community. I used deepl.com to translate the japanese part of the proposal into english and found out about how they allocate the budget. In general, the allocation of the budget seems fair, but as they do not provide actionable steps and possible ways to get the community to provide content and they do not explain their reward system for bounties, it is not quite clear, if the budget makes sense.\r\nSince the proposing team is US as well as Japan-based and the idea of the proposal is to bridge both English and Japanese, it would have been relevant to have the full proposal in both languages, as it would have bridged the information gap that was created in the proposal and it would have made it obvious that the team is able to and passionate about delivering information in both languages. The proposal is very broad in what content they want to put up on the website. Since there is for instance adatruth, it would maybe be interesting for the proposing teams to come together to see if they can support each other.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is not really covered in this proposal. Their measures of success is to create a website in 3 months and to add an unspecified amount of content in six months and an unspecified amount of meetings. So to increase auditability, it would be interesting for the proposing team to add how many zoom meetings they would want to hold and how many people they are planning on engaging with the zoom calls and the website. It would be great to provide us as a community with a discord or twitter handle as well as possibly a github as this would allow for auditability and transparency. It is difficult to estimate if the two proposers have a good marketing or networking system to attract community members.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Developing a website where content about Cardano can be viewed in both languages provided by a native speaker is a good way to produce accurate information. A lot of online translation bots are good at translating basic words and sentences but when it comes to a specific category they lack the knowledge to translate the meaning of it. By using native speakers to translate English to Japanese and vice versa you create a solid translation that is understandable and gives comprehensive content.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers claim to already conduct monthly zoom meetings in both languages but don't provide any evidence of this. Since they are planning on building a website we are missing some information. We are not presented with the information that the proposers are capable of making the website by themselves or if they need to hire new team members? Also, a basic plan is missing from the proposal. The proposers state that the website will be done in 3months but since they give no evidence that they can do this themselves, speaking from personal experience I find 3 months rather ambitious to search for team members and finish a website from scratch. As well as explaining how the plan to reward content creators for adding value to the hub.

This proposal is difficult to evaluate because it seems that the source of information about the proposal is not sufficient for us to assess the success of the proposal. This proposal seems to be more of an idea than a complete proposal, so if funding is not available in this fund, I recommend returning to the fund later with a more complete proposal.\r\nThere are no details regarding the author team. The team is one of the key factors in determining the success of the proposal, here, I cannot determine the relevant qualifications and experience.

The presentation roadmap will help create a clear view of the timestamps in the proposal that the team can review or push.

Need more detailed information on the actual destination of the requested budget and detailed roadmap for this\r\nI would love to see the team develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the project and connect the KPIs to milestones in the future project roadmap (timeline).

Is the website currently being built or do you know an associate who can do this on such short notice (3 months)?
