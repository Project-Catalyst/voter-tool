The proposal aims to include a Japanese translator who preferably is based in Japan to translate content to Japanese and create new content about the Japanese Community. The budget is reasonable for this project and well defined.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For auditability, the proposers provided enough information for the community to give a good audit.
