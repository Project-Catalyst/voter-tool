There is no roadmap that contains any information about actionable steps, so I find it not feasable, that this event would lead to a positive contribution. I would recommend the proposer does include how he would tackle risks, like internal corruption of voting between students and how he or she would be able to get 300 people to vote and how he or she would acquire the contestants. I\u00b4m not even saying the idea itself is terrible, but there is no content whatsoever that would provide a rationale on what kind of contest the team is planning and how it is planned.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability can only be done for the contest and the KPIs seem quite random because the proposer does not indicate his or her connection to participants and voters, so while the KPIs would be auditable, we would not be able to attest to accuracy and to success and content of the contest. It would be easier, if the proposer would provide relevant information about (1) where he would have the contest (2) in what position the team is to have access to students and how they would market the event (discord, twitter, telegram, github) (3) for transparency, it would be great if the proposer would set up a github or discord (4) how will the winning project be introduced to the community?", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 8, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "By providing a contest within the Japanese student community you are addressing a good way to engage the Japanese community into Catalyst. What I find odd is why to hold a contest in the student community for dApps if with a prize pool of 4000 if you have a better option to give them the ability to join project Catalyst and let them be the proposers. The proposal fits within the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The solution itself is good and certainly meets the objectives within the challenge because it engages the Japanese community within Catalyst. But we have a problem with the details of the plan, the proposer does not provide evidence of relevant information in regards to the proposal. The proposer states that the members have experience but provides no actual evidence to support this. It would also be helpful if there is information about this team since the proposer is solo presenting the proposal but gives a hint of a team behind him. It would also be interesting to explain how the proposal plans to hold this contest. Since no roadmap is presented and we only get a hint that the contest would be held 6months after the funding, this is not sufficient enough to make a good assessment. The budget is explained and seems reasonable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "For auditability, we don't get the adequate amount of information needed to give a good audit. The proposer describes he has the experience but provides no evidence on this matter. In addition, the plan is defined but is not outlined in any way. By providing a timeline we would get inside on how this proposal would come to fruition. Give a detailed plan on what steps are still needed and what you've done already to make sure this proposal will be successful if funded.

It's a good idea but I feel the proposal needs further development to ensure successful implementation\r\nThere are no details regarding the author team.
