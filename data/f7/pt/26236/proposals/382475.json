O objetivo deste desafio \u00e9 criar um mecanismo alternativo e mais r\u00e1pido para o pr\u00f3prio Catalyst, para acelerar a forma como os fundos s\u00e3o distribu\u00eddos. O mais pr\u00f3ximo que existe nesta proposta relacionada a isso \u00e9 o exemplo das campanhas 'GoFundMe', nas quais os fundos est\u00e3o imediatamente dispon\u00edveis para o criador da campanha, mas mesmo que isso n\u00e3o esteja utilizando fundos Catalyst. No entanto, tal projeto teria um bom impacto no ecossistema Cardano, e esta solu\u00e7\u00e3o, se devidamente desenvolvida, poderia ser ampliada com facilidade.
