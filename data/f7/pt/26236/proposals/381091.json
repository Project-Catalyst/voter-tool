In the detailed plan it states these would target blockchain more widely, I would say that if Catalyst is funding this, it should be Cardano focused, though could be bridge to other chains etc. The goals of the plan are a lot bigger than the initial funding requested. It's not clear the proposer has a plan to achieve this.

It would be good to see a more detailed plan on where the large sponsorship money will come from ($500,000 world finals?) and evidence the proposer has the agility to source this. The agility to pull off a plan like this really does rely on the proposers experience and network. He may have this, however evidence has not been provided.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The prosper has provided a simple timeline for the first hackathon which is what the budget covers. It is thus easy to audit if this hackathon is held. It would be good to have a goal on how many participants/teams will register and compete. Given this challenge is about funding projects, how is the impact of the products made during the hackathon to be measured. Will you track their further progress to becoming a commercial or open source project and the impacts it has on the community. \r\nthe later success at 6 and 12 months is defined again as holding the hackathon. It would be good to see some goals and metrics for measuring the impacts of the hackathons rather than just the fact that the occurred.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 10, "ng": 17, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Starting to build a project already within an hackatlon challenge will speed up idea generating and contribution to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has previous experience with this type of activity.

As the hackathon will be of 1 or 2 week duration, the delivery of funds would be faster than the actual funding mechanism. In that condition, this proposal fits within the challenge goal. However my concern is that hackathons are oriented to the dev community and may leave behind other types of projects. Anyway, the project includes metrics and states how scalability will be achieved.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal claims that as a Director of Engineering he ran multiple hackathons. Unfortunately he did not provide more references and he neither explained how he will form a team to develop all the tasks needed.

This should (at least in theory) allow for smart and motivated engineers to be enticed to join the Cardano ecosystem in a fun and engaging way bringing more talent into the Cardano (which can never be a bad thing :) )", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Firstly the claims of the experience cannot be verified a link to the proposers LinkedIn or websites would go a long way. Secondly, and more concerningly the budgeting for this project is inadequate there is a requested sum of $25,000. $3000 will be used to set up a website a bit high for a website but that's fine. $4000 for \"Tools and Materials\" please specify what this would entail as this could mean almost anything. $3000 for \"Regional 1 Venue hire & catering\" is this the ideal use of funds? Is the first hackathon not better to be completely online ? $15000 for the prize pool this is also understandable as more prize money would attract more competitors. However, what the budgeting does not entail is the payment of staff (marketers, help running the competitions ...etc), judges (perhaps this is free...?), legal cost/setting up the legal framework required such an event should not be hosted with personal liability ? What if someone is hurt during the hackathon then the organiser would be personally liable! Hence with more than half of the money being put aside for the prize pool, this would not be enough funds to cover everything else required.

Lastly in the proposal the questions \"How Accountable is this proposal?\" was raised where the proposer awnsered \"I have solicited the challenge team for some clarification on these questions\" implying the proposer did not understand how to show the proposals auditability, Fair enough however I must review the proposal as complete and thus I would recommend to reapply when these questions can be answered.
