The proposal identifies an approach that does just this. A tool to provide transparency about funs proceedings for both funders and funded will make an excellent addition to Project catalyst, and increase the credibility and auditability of future proposals.

Why would Wada keep pouring resources in this project if there's no return? What happens if the Catalyst doesn't get to a stage where they can support projects like this on a long term basis?
