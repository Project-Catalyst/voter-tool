It also acknowledges that there is a lack of awareness that these systems even exists, they provide a solution which aims to build an incubation centre for Cardanao's ecosystem with the talent from EMURGO India that looks to address this issue.\r\n\r\nBy building and growing that talent pool through incubation of crypto and Dapps development fundamentals, the Cardano ecosystem will be positively impacted since Dapps, Haskell and Plutus knowledge will be more readily available to industry partners or entrepreneurs. Since the proposal focuses on the talent pool from EMURGO India it is particularly pertinent for Cardano's mission for its global adoption and growth of its ecosystem. \r\n\r\nAs Konma Labz will be assessing performance close monitoring and bi-weekly reviews of code, bugs and vulnerabilities in the code base, it aligns well with the challenge brief. However additional metrics could be added in this instance, such as number of users participating in testnets, listings on DEX's and active users that the cohort is attracting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of scalability the proposal sets out plans beyond for a 24 week period, there would be benefit for mentioning plans for once the program is complete. For example will it be re-run or expanded into other areas of India. Or will perhaps Konma Labz look to apply for funding in Fund 8.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Konma labz is the research arm of https://www.konma.community/ which has a focus of developing and neutering communities. If the ethos of community creation can be applied to developing a Cardano cohort within India successfully then significant value will be to the ecosystem. \r\n\r\nFrom digging into the Konma organisation through Linkdin and job listing it's not apparent of the blockchain skills, however they do appear to have fielded a number of proposals from, Konma DAO, Konma Swap, ADA Pay and several others that show they have a fair understanding of the Cardano ecosystem. It's mentioned that they have attended many hackathons, the proposal would have benefited from publishing the hackathon results and findings and this would have demonstrated their skills to have a successful project in a tangible way. \r\n\r\nThe plan identifies skills required to implement the proposal from product development, project management block chain engineering skills, Web3 Development, and others. It would appear that Konma Labz is able to draw from its existing team to fulfill those skill requirements. Their current team consists of various levels of developers that have a working knowledge of Haskell, Plutus, Mithril, Oroborus and Atala Prism all of which would give the team solid fundamentals to execute on the plan. \r\n\r\nA clear and concise budget breakdown is provided outlining how capital will be spent, it makes it clear there will be a heavy focus on development cost. Aligning the spending plan with the roadmap it shows there has been rigour in planning out how development effort will take place. In addition to this the timeline isn't such a long period that it would be unachievable, it appears that there is a short enough iteration for the goals of the proposal to be achievable. There would be benefit in outlining what would happen in the case of overspend and they are no longer able to continue, for example would Konma Labz bank role the remaining program if there was no money left over. \r\n\r\nKonma in their proposal go someway to identify some challenges such as the first batch of the EMURGO India developers will lack hands on experience, however it would be useful to provide some mitigations for this risk. In addition to this risk of lack of hands on experienced pointed out in the proposal, there would be value in highlighting further risks to the project and how those would be overcome.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides a good time horizon and roadmap which could be use to audit progress of project.
