From the get go, the problem statement is not a problem statement, which sets the negative tone already. There are numerous mentions regarding the foot fall of this event, live streaming of the event, the use of performance marketing agency, a community engagement team, a reputable media partnership etc., but all these are actions done by the Events Management. There is no clear goal on behalf the proposer itself on what their involvement in this event will translate into, example; media coverage, media mentions, projected visitors to the booth, leads conversion, social media engagement etc. and how all that would tie into the Challenge setting goals. Would have love to assisted in formulating this proposal and wished came across about this proposal earlier but unfortunately I cannot justify my personal bias to give a rating higher than 3-star. 3-star might seem high, but from personal experience, being part of major expo can raise brand awareness sharply, in this case the Cardano's Gaming Ecosystem brand, but you will need a lot of engagement tools to reach this. Recommend to consult with Catalyst School on how to formulate an impactful proposal next time around.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "From the brief data provided by the proposer on their experience and credentials, knowing who they are prior, there is no doubt they can deliver on developing a game. This perhaps does not correlate well with what they are proposing now, which is having an event in a major expo. There is no mention on who will be handling the operations of the booth. There is also no clear plan what will happen during the booth's duration, what are their engagement plan, what marketing materials will be used to introduce the Cardano Gaming Ecosystem, who will cover the cost of engagement and marketing plan etc. Although there is a mentioning of the budget needed, the details in using that budget, for some reason, is placed in the comments section. From the available numbers, the majority of the budget goes to booth production. Unfortunately there is no clear timeline when things should start to be executed, example; starting from the simplest of actions such as printing marketing materials.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "If put in out-of-context, and focusing on the use of budget for booth production, this proposal is highly auditable, but there are goals of this Challenge that need to be adhere to and in the best case scenario, it is usually very hard to audit an involvement in any expo. Let alone in the case if there are no clear action plans during the duration of the participation. This perhaps though can be avoided in the future by coordinating with the Catalyst School on how to formulate a proposal. Starting from the problem statement and solution, which this proposal also finds itself wanting. Love this proposal soo much though, please do try again.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_635", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 10, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea of hosting a Cardano specific stand at a Gaming event is a really good idea. This proposal is however is quite confusing on what it is trying to achieve and how its going to achieve it. An ask of $15k for this proposal doesnt feel like goo value for money. I would have expected a lot more background work to be done at this stage with only 2 months to go  (eg engage all gaming related projects from previous funds, have more details of how the proposers see exhibition flowing over the 3 days). Having exhibited in many international venues around the globe it is essential each day is planned in detail with objectives and targets otherwise the days go by very quickly and nothing is achieved.\r\nAs it stands if this proposal was asking for $1 or $2k (to cover cost of exhibiting with some incidental costs. It could then act as a pilot exhibition & proposers could then come back in a future fund with 'proof' and arrange a much larger event.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provides a decent outline of a plan but it is not easy to understand.\r\nA simple presentation would have helped showing how activities, resources and funds  are aligned.\r\nThe $15k is not broken down so it is impossible to work out how its going to be spent.\r\nThe proposers could really help themselves by adding their LinkedIn profiles or evidence of their experience in this area.\r\n\r\ni hope the proposer takes onboard these comments in a positive light and returns with a more coherent proposal or uses the comments section or ideafest to provide clarity on the questions answered. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No metrics or KPI's have been provided that align to the challenge. eg is the proposer looking to encourage new gaming proposers in future funds?\r\nAlso the obvious risk of COVID has not been taken in to account, what is the mitigation (if any) and what will happen to unwed funds if the exhibition is cancelled?", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": " \r\nThe problem needing to be solved has been identified and articulated namely that a lot of Gaming tradeshows are out there, BUT not even one is promoted by Cardano\r\n. \r\nIt is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by   presenting the Cardano Catalyst Gamers On-Chained Challenge to the European Indie Games Community and Consumers in 2022\r\n \r\nThis proposal shows how it adds value to the Cardano system byproviding exposure of the Cardano based games to the overall gaming community and exposing the Cardano game developers to a real game expo environment where they could network and collaborate and make useful connections.\r\n\r\n \r\n  Key metrics  would be  number of participants,  number of events, number of stalls, number of games presented, number of new developers represented.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge\r\n  \r\n \r\nProposal can be scaled up to address future challenges by adding more game development companies to this event.  it could also setup facilities at other events for more Cardano game developers \r\n\r\nThis project will have a positive impact on Cardano system by increasing the collaboration between game developers, game reselling companies and brands and the overall gaming community\r\n\r\nI can say that this proposal adequately addresses the challenge  hence i have given it a 5 star rating.\r\n \r\n\r\nIf this does not receive funding for whatever reason, one way proposer can improve it is by continuing to build and send press releases to media of your country or social media relating to your subject. Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading. I have also been an event organizer in various capacities, both through my company and on a voluntary basis for youth groups and churches.

You can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.
