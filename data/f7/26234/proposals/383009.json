This proposal would also fit, in my view, in the \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" challenge, launched in the previous funding round. The local impact would certainly be very good, because in fact, Africa is a potential location for the development of Cardano, as the community itself recognizes when proposing a specific challenge for the continent at f6. But I would like the authors to say more about Ghana, why this country? In general, the proposal is in line with some of the challenge's objectives, focusing more on the part of bringing outsiders to the Cardano community, I would like more details in the proposal on why the country in question was chosen. Other than that, I liked the idea, I think it is of high value and can bring great benefits both for the chosen location and for our blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved in the project, Wada, already has a good reputation for Catalyst, I myself have evaluated several of their proposals (in the Africa challenge, from f6, there were several that they released). Because of this repertoire, a lot of confidence in their ability to successfully execute the project is conveyed. They also attach the website link, where you can see various content they produced and understand the magnitude of the group, for those who don't know them. However, I wish they had included a list with the names of the people who would work on this project, specifically, because as proponents we have Jeremiah and Wada, since Wada is a group, who in the group would act here? We would need to know their names, roles and past experience in order to convey a full understanding of this part of the proposal. What about Jeremiah, what does he do, what is his relationship with the Cardano ecosystem? There is no setting up a script here, we know that conferences would be held with the aim of exposing to students what Cardano is, how it can benefit their locality and give them work opportunities. A script is established, which could be more detailed, organized according to the passage of time (for example, in month 1 this would be done, in month 2 that would be done, and so on). We do not know in which cities, if the authors already have in mind some educational institutions to be contacted, what is the average number of students waiting for a meeting, what subjects (by topic) would be taught, who would be the professionals to pass on the contents... The financial division is also abstract; the budget is quite high, and the parts it was divided into are not detailed. For example: $7000 for transport, accommodation and food for people. How many people, which people, would go where to where, stay where? $2000 for advertising, how would this be done given that there are several marketing approaches? In general, it lacks detail in several parts, both in understanding who the team would be, what they would do to make the project happen, and how the money would be used.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This is the part that is best contemplated in the proposal, in my opinion. The authors provided us with a lot of information that can be used to monitor the project. Starting with the vision of success, we know exactly what scenario they're aiming for, so we know what to measure when the project starts to produce results. The question of how many simple dapps would emerge, Haskell programmers and other minute data would need to be constantly evaluated by someone (or some group) chosen for this, or even a member of Wada itself could organize this data and give feedback to the community. The authors also expose some risks and challenges that the project would deal with, allowing us to monitor, too, whether such barriers were broken. I believe we have enough information to perform a great auditability, just select person(s) prepared to gather such statistics and make them known to the rest of the Cardano community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 10, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "To me the project idea is a fantastic one. As the project objective seeks to be able to reach out to over two thousand students in tertiary and High Schools in Northern Ghana to educate them about the opportunities Cardano is bringing to the African continent and how they can participate through project catalyst, it therefore brings to bear that there will be some level of appreciation in terms of knowledge in Blockchain technology and most especially Cardano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI see that the proposer have clearly outined the problem they seek to address by providing steps to how they will be able to do it.\r\nOne of the striking goals outlined in this proposal is the adoption of cardano and participation of institutions in Ghana through project catalyst.\r\nSince this project will tackle mostly students in tertiary schools and senior high schools, I therefore believe that the education about Cardano will greatly impact the masses since it takes mostly the educated to influence the uneducated to understand basic life issues.\r\n\r\nOne issue I will want the proposers to try to clarify is to be specific with the schools they will be selecting, what criteria they will be using for those selections and what will be their motivation for that?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with the proposers on the problem they have identified and the solutions and plans they have come out with with hope that they will be able to do a great job when supported. I score them 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am optimistic that with the plan and experiences  presented in the proposal the implementation would eventually be a success.\r\n\r\nIt's obvious the proposers are made up of a team of skilled personnel with diverse experiences in development, education and active Cardano Community practitioners. If they are able to use their in-depth knowledge about Blockchain technology and most especially Cardona to educate their target group ie. Students from tertiary institutions and second cycle institutions it will go a long way to raise so many ambassadors of Cardona who can better spread out to other area within sand outside the country.\r\n\r\nThey have also demonstrated that they have experience in organising programs for students. This experience will help in their approach of getting the various schools to accept this project hence it's smooth implementation.\r\n\r\nOn the plan, I see a well coordinated timeline which is realistic and achievable.\r\n\r\nOn the activity, convening conferences and workshops. It would be good to state clearly which level of students are you going to hold conferences for and which ones are you hosting workshops for since the two are different in approach.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the the means of publicity, I suggest you add TV and Radio broadcast. This is one of the most dominant ways to reach out to people with a message that can benefit them.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the challenges they envision to face, I think the consideration of virtual meetings could be key here since the pandemic is still not over.\r\nThey could also consider seeking permission from the Ghana Education Service to have access to reach out to the schools they are targeting. This could help them being resisted from having access to the students for their programs. \r\n\r\nI'm conclusion, the plans shared in this proposal were well articulated except the few observations I made. I score them 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer has done a good job by providing information on how the project will be audited and the budgetary allocations for their activities. I however would have wished they had added more information on their activities. Thus, providing specifics in terms of number of resource person's to be used for the project, how many banners, posters they anticipate to use, etc These will help in proper auditability.\r\nMore information on the work and career of proposers could have also been offered in the proposal to avoid any suspicions about the real identities of the proposers.\r\n\r\nI therefore score this proposal with a score of 4. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_925", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 11, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "\r\nThe problem needing to be solved has been identified and articulated namely that it can be hard educate students in Northern Ghana about Cardano Ecosystem and its benefits\r\n. \r\nIt is clear that this proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief by Organizing community events to educate about 2,000 tertiary and high school students in northern Ghana about cardano and its benefits\r\n \r\nThis proposal shows how it adds value to the Cardano system by organizing community events  \r\n  Key metrics  have  been stated clearly.

Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out.
