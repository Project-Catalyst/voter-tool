The authors justify that it is a strategic place to invest, since it has a high number of technology students graduating annually, it is also one of the countries that most accept and use cryptocurrencies, I know this because it was a fact showing in another proposal that I evaluated. I found it interesting how the authors thought about this project in a circular way, that is, they don't just intend to introduce and develop the contents with these students, but to accompany and guide them during the process of creating and submitting proposals. In this way, there would be a more complete follow-up with young people, because they would not only be taught what Cardano is, but how to launch and execute projects on the blockchain, through funding from Catalyst. That was my general understanding of the proposal, and I think it goes beyond several other proposals for this same challenge, not limited to exposing information. What could be improved, in my opinion, would be the understanding of the meetings themselves. I would like to see more detailed planning, that is, what would be the subjects covered in each meeting, how many would they be, how many students would be planned for each meeting, from how many meetings would go into practice (launch of proposals), who would present each meeting... Details. But overall, the impact of the proposal is high and fits in very well with what is asked here.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The authors make a very different presentation about themselves: they not only define who they are, what they do individually, what their areas of training are, but also include several links from their social networks, such as linkedin, where we can get to know them more intimately , and several direct communication channels, where individual contact can be established with each. About that part, it's excellent. A lot of confidence in the authors' ability to successfully execute the project is conveyed, mainly because they are all from the technology area. I would just like to suggest that you hire someone from the marketing and design areas to promote proper outreach and design graphic materials for the meetings, these parts are also very important. There is a very detailed script here, in which we know what would happen in phases, divided into months. What I suggest is the creation of a schedule, so that the information is organized in a more synthesized and visually simple way, regarding the meetings themselves. The part of the orientation for the submission of proposals is a more qualitative and individual process, which doesn't fit so much in a table, in my opinion. But yes, the level of detail is quite satisfactory. On the financial split, I think this proposal ideally explains how the money would be used, because they don't just split the total amount, but specify more details about each part. In this way, we have an accurate understanding of how this money would be used. What I suggest here then is just a more direct organization about the script in relation to the meetings themselves, otherwise that's fine.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We have a lot of information about auditability so that it can be done safely and accurately. The authors explain the expected results for each individual phase, providing details that make it possible to closely monitor the parties. If we were to form a team to follow the progress of the project, they would know exactly what to assess to determine whether the project is being done as promised or not, and could bring that feedback to the rest of the community. The authors also provide us with KPIs, by which we have more quantitative information, data that directly point to whether success was achieved or not. As a more objective part, I believe that such information could be included in reports and exposed directly to the community, through presentations in Town hall, for example. Finally, what I suggest to give even more strength to this auditability would be an individual monitoring of the students involved with regard to the results. The team proposes to guide them in project submissions, but would also like them to bring to us whether they got funding or not, what impact Cardano has made in their lives, if they intend to maintain contact with the community and work with it in the long term. and etc. But that would be a bonus, because the team has already provided us with enough information to do great auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 14, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposers has put a lot of thought into this proposal. Their experience in Project Catalyst shows clearly and can be seen on how they pin-point a local issue and correlate it within the Challenge setting. They clearly articulate on how approaching universities is the way to go to onboarding the correct crowd onto Catalyst and Cardano. Though it is not specified which university will be targeted and how, and what guarantee will that chosen university be 100% receptive towards this event. Correct crowd here meaning the minimum steps needed for an individual to understand and implement Cardano, with this being a short-term goal. They have also addressed the long-term goal, by stating that this proposal is a continuous process spanning 2 years, which also addresses continuity, for having one-shot events does not equate to sustained interest in Cardano. A large portion of the Challenge setting is covered by this proposal and if documented correctly, this event can be scaled and duplicated throughout Viet Nam. This is indeed a highly effective proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no doubt in the experience of the proposers, all are accomplished individuals whom we can track through their LinkedIn links. It's clear this group of individuals brainstormed this proposal together for almost all of the proposers and co-proposers have a teaching background. Though at the same time, it does raise a question for being this heavily educated there is no clear syllabus on the material they will use to educate the university students on Project Catalyst. The initial focus is on having the event itself. Of all the proposers and co-proposers the only individual that has background in Catalyst and might be able to educate on Catalyst is the only individual without a teaching background in this group. One would reckon, preparing the materials first in Vietnamese would be the first step. Nonetheless, this could probably be mitigated through collaboration with the Catalyst School. Budget wise this proposal is quite detailed though the numbers mention are quite high for this region. An hourly rate of $60 across the board; from mentoring a proposer to conducting surveys, might be better of allocated to developing local teaching materials. Though there is a mentioning of risk, it is actually more of an opportunity.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is no doubt on their preparation of the event. There is a clear roadmap of it, reaching till the fifth month with also an achievable KPI. With all of the data above, auditability can be done be responsibly.
