I think this is interesting because, in fact, there is no single place where such organizations can be made. But I have a few observations to make; first, there are already many tools, such as Miro and Jamboard, where different people can work with each other online and display information in a visual and intuitive way. It would be interesting if the authors argued why the platform they have is different and better. It is known that the site already exists, and it is very beautiful by the way; the authors say that some events outside the community (which ones?) have already been developed through the platform. It would be beneficial if some of these events were exemplified, if they clarified more because Favorse is more practical, easier and superior than other pre-existing tools, if this site could be made video calls, attached white papers, visual assemblies, etc. The other issue I thought about is that during the course of the proposal, they intend to reach a level of development where the site users themselves could vote on projects, invest in them, etc.; this worries me a little because it might be slightly confused with Catalyst's own activities. I don't know if it would necessarily be a negative point, but we are working to improve Catalyst, I don't think that outsourcing activities to another platform is the best way to unite the community and produce projects with impact. But it's just my opinion, in general, the idea does dialogue with what is asked in this challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The authors have a lot of information about themselves through an individualized breakdown of each, followed also by links to their profiles on social networks. Also, you can see this if we go to the website provided, there is a part that introduces the team, with photo, name, role and linkedin profiles. Therefore, we are not helpless in this respect. I believe they are well prepared, according to the information provided on the site and even because the site itself is well made, has an easy-to-navigate and aesthetically beautiful interface. About the script, they include an explanation for the first six months so that we know exactly what activities will be carried out each month, who will do what and what is expected to result in that time. In this part I think we are provided with enough information for a solid vision of what would happen in the practice of the project. And on the financial division, they also provide a satisfying breakdown, where we know who would get how much and why, although I think each work topic could be explained further. For example, what would the design creation look like? Would he work doing research directly with the public, would he assemble the interface according to previous projects that were successful? One thing I noticed was the absence of a monetary portion for marketing, I would like to understand how they would promote this project, because if the objective is to create a collaborative space for community members and outsiders to work, how would these people know of the existence of the platform? This is just as important as the product development itself, in my opinion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The authors provide several topics that could be analyzed to exercise good auditability, such as the number and diversity of participants on the platform. It would be important to have such data organized and demonstrated to the rest of the Cardano community, in order to verify if the project was really successful. Another point could be for some people to participate in these collective meetings, with the aim of analyzing their functioning, and also for there to be a check on whether the events planned there were actually put into practice. I believe it is a very possible project to monitor, both by monitoring the site itself and the events created (are they organized, have a legal reach, etc?). For me this topic is well done in the proposal, although the authors provide us with less extensive and detailed information about possible ways to follow up on the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 11, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The project team behind Favourouse are proposing to create a web tool to encourage co-creation of events that will provide creators with useful customer or potential customer insights in the inital stages of idea formation. A app like Favourouse will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through opening opportunities up to feedback from a wider audience and providing buy-in from people outside the Cardano commubnity in the initial stages of an idea's formation, as well as the potential for people to fund or seek funding from interested parties. \r\n\r\nA app like this has the potential to quickly overtake older crowdfunding platforms such as Pozible, simply through the framework of having idea formation and idea testing and co-creation as a basis for the platform to exist.

And because of this feature, it fits well into almost all the metrics of the Challenge setting. Taking another example besides voter-proposer participation, such as keeping the community  together. Because individuals can request an event to happen, where they also offer compensation to be agreed upon, sustainability and relation building between parties involved is therefore achieved.
