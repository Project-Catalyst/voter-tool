Leading after town hall events are a great way to build more community because individuals can meet with others who share similar interests, which can lead to potential proposals in the future. Awareness about the Cardano Catalyst project is crucial in its continued development, so providing spaces for voters and proposers to interact is in line with the challenge.\r\nOne question I do have is in regard to the marketing strategies mentioned by the proposer. I am unclear as to what kinds of strategies the proposer hopes to implement.

Add to that a proven implementation plan with clear OKR's and KPI's, this proposal continues to build confidence on their capability to deliver. Though the budget break down needs some further fleshing out, most specifically regarding the new feature that will be tested out, which is researching the reward system. There is not yet a clear definition what is the reward system and how it works in concept.

The team behind After Town Halls, Catalyst Swarm are proposing to encourage further dialogue and collaboration about Catalyst events through hosting break out rooms after the Town Hall meetings. \r\n\r\nConsidering the team have a track record of delivering 20 After Town Halls so far, which have been attended by hundreds of people with a further 2000-4000 views on Youtube, it is likely their further proposal to host break out rooms is informed by articulated needs from the Cardano community. Hosting smaller and more dedicated and streamlined conversations will encourage wider participation from people that are potentially highly skilled but poor on time and unable to commit hours to lengthy unfiltered conversation, working to add skill and value to the Cardano community. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed breakout rooms will undoubtedly bring the community together, increase meaningful participation, encourage deeper connection to peers in the community and create opportunites for people to increase their own networks by meetin other active members in the community. \r\n\r\nCatalyst Swarm are also proposing that this breakout space is an open platform, enouraging Cardano community members to register to host a breakout room. This encourages discourse, increased participation and opens the community up to not only participating in established conversations, but to start and host their own which will lead to the diversifyication of the community and encourage leadership from within the cardano community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the track record, commitment and ongoing engagement of this team it is likely that the breakout rooms will see some success. Catalyst Swarm have initiated a number of projects that have expanded the use, knowledge and networks around Cardano. Based purely on the Catalyst Swarm's past acheivements it is likely the team experience is aligned with the project objectives. However, without specific detail as to who is involved individually and their specific skill sets, it is difficult to fully comment on this. That said, based on reputation alone and previous commitment and execution of the After Town Hall projects, there is a high liklihood of success for this project. \r\n\r\nThe proposed timeline commences in February 2022 and is ongoing for three months, running concurrently with Town Halls. The plan is mapped out, however there is little detail in the marketing campaign with a budget spend of $2000 USD, nor is there capacity targets for increased participation that would be tracked through said marketing campaign. This makes the project difficult to measure in terms of the success of the marketing campaing. If increased participation is the primary concern of this campain it would be advantageous to include specific participation numbers at this point and breakdown who the target markets are, and why and dig further into how the marketing campaign has been successful or indeed how it could be improved throughout the project. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a further 6k allocated in the budget for \"research & experimentation on After Town Hall Reputation and rewarding systems\" however this significant spend is unclear and doesnt' seem to be addressed anywhere else in the proposal. The expenditure amount is comparitively high within the context of their overall budget, so it is a shame that this essential component of their budget lacks detail and specificity. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given the frequency of the After Town Hall events, there is some grace afforded in the lack of budgetary specificity for one item in that the auditability of this project is very high. On a weekly basis the community has not only an opportunity to ensure the project is on track, but they also have an opportunity to participate and buy-in further to the events and activities surrounding Cardano. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current KPI set is clear, with a target of 80% participant retention for After Town Hall, however as mentioned previously there are no clear numbers attached to KPI's around current and target particpation acheived through the marketing campaign and there are also no specific numbers around the uploaded breakout rooms discussions (however this could be deduced by the proposed targets mentioned previously in the proposal.)  \r\n\r\nThe delivery dates are clearly defined, as they sit alongside the Town Halls. There is however detail lacking in the roll out and execution of the Marketing campaign which would likely need to commence in January, not leaving a great deal of time for the February commencement of After Town Halls. Again, without any specific measurements attached to the current and target participation, or details about the target markets, style of campaign or what the Marketing campaign is setting out to achieve specificially - it is hard to determine if this timeframe is suitable.

It is interesting how the authors explain the functioning of After Town Hall, both for guest and presenter. This makes us understand the activity developed more completely. The question would be, then improve something that already exists, according to the points raised - timestamp, implement reward systems, promote marketing and so on. In my honest opinion, the 25k requests could be used to create new projects, After Town Hall has been in existence for a few months now and works well in the current way, I believe the goal of promoting debate and connections between engaged members of the community is already being achieved without such improvements, so I don't think this proposal would have that much impact.

About the script, it is very simple, the authors indicate what would be done in general next year and specifically in February and March. But would the project focus on two months? Who would do what, in what period of time, in weeks, to achieve the proposed objectives? I don't know if the rest of the script has yet to be completed or that's it, but it gives the impression of being very dry, so there is not enough detail or length of time for us to fully understand what will be done, how, by whom and and When. About the budget division, I believe it would also need more detail. For example, when asking 6k to research and experiment with the rewards system, what is the justification for this amount? How would this research be worked out, what would be researched, who would research it? How much reward would each person receive, individually?
