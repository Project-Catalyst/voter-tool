Sometimes that one step might motivate someone to view the link and add credibility for your project and give him a better idea on the project which enables him to vote for the project. \r\n\r\nYou can also look more into developing a contingency plan if for any reason your original plan does not work out. This planning is very favorable when CAs and voters consider proposals since more often than not, what we think will happen wont happen but some complication or issue will arise.\r\n\r\nI am qualified to write this assessment based on being a translator since 1992 at the State Broadcasting Corporation as well as since that time,running my own translation agency, working with the two native languages of my country as well as working on various translation projects into other languages, including translation, transcription and proofreading.

Being it only one day, it is most likely to be ineffective. This is due to 2 (two) factors, the lack of Cardano content that is bite-sized and structured based on easy-to-hard, therefore communicating Cardano in such a limited time will be challenging. Compounded by no mentioning of a clear target market. Rather than going for an 'all in one basket' event, perhaps a series of workshops that spans a certain amount of time would be more effective. This is mentioned in the proposal, where it seeks to achieve a certain long term goal, by having monthly events. Continuity is crucial to form a database that will act as validators to request further funding and just by having one event, the database collected might not be viable. Therefore perhaps in the proposals next iteration, to directly go to a series format. Although this proposals intent partially meets and align with the Challenge setting, it does not clearly state how this proposal will add value based on this particular Challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Based on the credentials provided by the proposers, they will most likely be successful in creating the event but given the plan presented, will most likely miss the Challenge setting parameters. The event itself is quite vague, though their long term target actually is more clear than what this proposal intends to deliver in the short term. The budget requested to materialize this proposal makes sense and is sufficient. Timeline though is also vague and questionable due to that there is a budget request for actions such as; marketing and project management, but it is not reflected into a detailed timeline and plan in the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In general, the information provided is more  towards displaying actions to be executed but not accompanied by how and when it will be executed, therefore making it difficult to audit. This can be seen in the budget break down and roadmap. Particularly in the roadmap, it is more of a lumpsum of things to do. KPI's are difficult to measure due to no existing numerical targets. The problem statement and solution actually interconnects but unfortunately it focuses too much on the venue and not the event itself.

Target market has been indicated in the proposal with ideas for who will be approached but also that this is an event that has time for further planning and input from the community (cardano community, community in Paris etc). I disagree with the assertion that the proposal fails to clearly state how value is added on this particular challenge - I think the proposal was not read throughly by the assessor. Feasability rating is 3 but the rationale does not match the rating given that the assesor has said that 'based on the credentials provided by the proposers, they will most likely be successful in creating the event...' Furthermore, a detailed timeline for project management should not be a reason for a reduction in rating as this should be seen as on ongoing administrative task by definition...'KPIs are difficult to measure due to no existing numerical tarkets' - I challenge the rating of 3 for auditability based on these statements, as the KPIs provided indicate that the number will be tracked, as such no such set number for a target is provided.
