There are currently not many projects that focus on building awareness and knowledge from early ages, so this proposal has a very unique perspective and purpose that definitely adress the challenge brief. Educating our growing community will always be a priority, and addressing that problem on the \"seed-level\" and having the purpose of creating a sub-community from that is highly valuable through my experience as a teacher and community participant. It might not only include younger people to Cardano, but also spread information and knowledge to their parents, friends and contacts. Even if they have experience with blockchain or not. The details of the proposal is presented clearly with a strong connection to the problem statement. It is somewhat presented (and I would agree) that this is a slow burning project and a long term investment which would explain why some parts are explained more broadly, closer to detailed concepts than numbers and figures. All in all, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively adressess the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal clearly states what it means to achieve within a certain timeframe, and what is needed to make that happen. What's really important is that the proposer aims to continue developing the project whether or not it is received funding in FUND7, which speaks about long term determination and commitment. The website is live (but no active platform yet, time frame is provided in the road map). Since it means to do a lot within a very short timeframe, the budget allocation is quite substantial (1/4 of the total challenge budget), which might be too large for an initial funding round. Maybe the project would benefit from focusing on the core aspects of the platform (education, curriculum, videos etc) and leave things like \"immersive technologies\" til a later fund? I understand the value of launching a fully realized project from the start, but from my experience as a teacher it might have been more beneficial to focus on the core educational content and teachers working on it in initial stages in order to increase the chance of getting funds. \r\nI would have liked to see more verifiable information and background about the creators of this project, maybe a LinkedIn-profile to further strengthen the pedagogical expertise of the core creators? There is a podcast interview being linked, which gives some information about the proposers background and knowledge. Also, there are mentions of a personal LinkedIn, but that is not included. \r\nThe team seems to be missing a lot of technical expertise, but this is taken into consideration in the budget allocation. This might explain why some technical or specific aspects are not included in the detailed plan, which would have been beneficial to include in the proposal. \r\n I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

It is ambitious spanning through 6 months initially, but the proposer makes it clear that there are more milestones and goals in the time following it. I believe it would be beneficial for the proposal if it included more KPIs or success metrics. Currently the info provided is relying on the onboarded community and educational interactions, but there are no numbers to measure the success and development of the project. There is a mention of a goal of 30-60 Beta testing-students, which provide us with some measurements of success. \r\nThe budget breakdown is very clearly presented, but it would be nice to see some further details included in regards to estimated working hours. For example, 8000 USD is allocated to vetted educators but it would strengthen the proposal further to include the estimated working hours, number of educators etc. The proposer seem to have a decent understanding of the risks and challenges connected to developing the project, mainly the danger of the need for hiring different educators and technical developers outside of the core team and the risk of losing consistency in the educational material because of that. The timeframe is also mentioned as a possible challenge, which I noted earlier. \r\nOverall, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_349", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 14, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal addresses the goal of this challenge category to increase participation in Cardano Ecosystem.

The funds will be used to create the platform; digitally and legally, to create the syllabus, to purchase hardware to create the syllabus, to purchase a lot in the VR space, to purchase the VR tool to access the VR space etc. This thought process is incorrect, for the Project Catalyst is not a fund to all-out purchase physical items for the proposers benefit. It is an empowerment tool, Project Catalyst to an extent is like a VC. And like a VC, when one does ask for funding they do not all-out ask to purchase various items without some form of validation for these purchases.
