The integration of culture, philosophy and arts has been an osmotic process within Catalyst to date -in the background, without cultivation- and this proposal seeks to bring the role of these areas into the foreground with dedicated space and accountable members of the community to drive discussion.  Because philosophy and the arts are tools for discovering and imbuing meaning, it makes sense to encourage these tools to be developing alongside NFTs and exchanges, guiding eachother in carefully thought out ways.  It remains to be seen just how eager the community is for this avenue to claim some of the limited bandwidth of attention needed to navigate already vast spaces of Catalyst (the proposal teams early efforts indicated 30 people participated) but that could be just the beginning.  Outside of encouraging a dialog on creatives role in the Cardano ecosystem, this proposal isn't very specific about what might be the result of this campaign.  It suggests perhaps art workshops or exhibitions, but does not really clarify how that grows Catalyst or Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal team appears to already have been implementing a base version of this idea, a swarm session under the Catalyst Swarm format, from which they drew the ideas for this proposal, along with media channels on discord and telegram, so it is to be expected that they could repeat the feat as required to continue to deliver the product.  While it is not explicitly stated, the roadmap (creative swarm sessions, ideation directed towards establishing fundamental creative questions and goals for Cardano, and preparing new members for Catalyst and proposal processes) appears to lead to the creation of a Fund8 challenge team based around creatives.  To this end the road map lists concrete goals such as establishing reliable swarm sessions over 3 months, while maintaining and featuring their media channels within Catalyst.  While the timeline of the roadmap is somewhat vague, the milestones are specific and realizable.  The ability to lean on the existing Swarm teams and protocols gives this proposal a high probability of success.  The budget is reasonable and for the 3-5 months expected coverage, should allow adequate resources.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The creation of public meetings allows for high auditability, and the proposed media channels should allow the community to remain in touch with the project as it develops.  The proposed website/blog won't be available right away, but once it goes online it will provide another avenue of seeing if the project remains on track.  Finally they expect to contribute on at least a monthly basis in the Town Halls.  Measurement of goals, however, seems to be limited to tracking number of participants in the group and perhaps the number of dedicated 'sub-groups' that collaboration might spawn.  Another metric they should consider, especially if they believe they could sponsor a challenge team in Fund8, would be a number of very specific challenge settings to be curated through the first few months and meetings.  An example might be a concept like \"value\", which has deep roots in philosophy and art, and to dedicate swarm sessions to ruminating on how to create a detailed and concrete challenge setting around it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 12, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This will be a beautiful inclusion to the Cardano ecosystem. For I see this as an embryo towards the creation of Cardano art community, which is very important, the reason being will come later. General public might dismiss art due to the over-saturation of NFT projects which by it's nature to some extent is being exploited by individuals or entities, whether that be giving value to NFT through hype or market manipulation. Both practices has occurred in major NFT marketplaces and NFT issued by brands or influencers. Art's value is slowly being redefined by this practice and by the misconception of associating the current NFT with art. When there is a strong community of artists, curators, collectors, historians and educators talking to each other from around the world discussing blockchain and it's interaction with art in one forum, only then can NFT have value that is rooted in history, in art education, in techniques, in differentiation and not in hype. NFT is here to stay but NFT will evolve. Although this proposal articulates well it's intent, it's effectiveness in growing Cardano through the metrics of the Challenge setting, is a visionary sell. Meaning, only those who have the knowledge, understands the value of this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team involved and whom are in the proposal, on the basis of what is stated, correlates well the intent, knowledge and the implementation plan inside this proposal. There is also a mentioning of a co-proposer, though details regarding their background is limited. I can only wish there were links to the proposers but to a certain extent I can understand the nature of individuals from the art field. This though is counter-balanced by their timetable which is very detailed and also the intent to collaborate with Catalyst Swarm, a reputable community within Cardano. Proposer has also considered the challenge and risk they will face, which although is an obligation, not many take effort into explaining them such as what the proposer has done. This must be valued as upholding the standards of a good proposal. The small budget provided is also sufficient in comparison to the timeline determined and goals to be achieved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Again there is a detailed roadmap, although not attached with numerical targets, situations correlating with art is valued not by numbers but by the quality of engagement. Which in the beginning can be limited interactions in the grand scheme of things. Provided also are OKR's and KPI's that fits well with how developing a creative environment can be. Problem statement also correlates well with the solution provided.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_635", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 8, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal focuses on exploring and establishing an environment of social and cultural inclusion to support, facilitate and generate culture and art movements.
