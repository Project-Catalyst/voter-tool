It is always very good to have a contextualization of the problem found in the place, so that people from abroad have a better understanding. In this case, the authors state that even young people with formal educational background face difficulties in finding a job, which generates a lot of family pressure and I believe there is some agony on the part of this portion of the population. This makes training teenagers and young people about technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem even more urgent in this location. I believe that, for a portion of society that suffers so much from a lack of opportunities, this project will be something they will grasp with their claws, valuing it, as it will pave the way for what they are looking for (source of income). As such, it is very likely that this initiative will receive positive feedback, while it will also benefit the Cardano ecosystem itself, as it will recruit new participants, as is one of the objectives of the challenge. This is also related to the challenge launched in the previous fund, \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\", which further increases the value of the project, because I believe that the community is still willing to invest in the continent, despite this fund having been successful. I focus on other parts of the globe, such as Latin America and Japan. Therefore, in my opinion this is a high-impact proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors of the proposal clearly specify the objectives they intend to achieve with the development of this project, which also leads us to the possibility of defining, in a clear way, the phases that will be necessary to be fulfilled. The authors are also concerned with defining the topics covered in each workshop, in addition to the number of workshops per month (2), but this part that talks about the events could have been more detailed. They could let us know in which month each would take place, where their exact location would be, who would present them, their estimated audience reach and so on. It is seen that the authors have strong partnerships, including the WADA group, which is already well known at Catalyst for launching projects that positively affect the African continent. Such connections are essential to ensure a good baggage and quality support for the project, certainly with this general team the workshops would have a high standard; however, I would like the authors to have informed, as I said above, who would be presenting them. Most likely they have a list of speakers in mind, but it would be important to know them, as well as to know better the authors themselves, Emelia and Afia, who give us a very brief description of who they are. I would like to know a little more about their previous work, what paths they took within the WADA group (I understand that they are members) and so on. Finally, regarding the financial division: I found the amount requested in the financing to be very reasonable and it is well justified with the project. The authors explain what each portion of the funding would be used for; once again, I emphasize that the need for greater detail is needed to further increase the value of this proposal. When they talk about $1500 for lease, internet and equipment: where would that lease be? How exactly would the $2000 for logistics be applied? For example, where would speakers come from to justify such a value? However, I think that even without a deep detail, we have a very clear notion of how the money would be invested. In order to arrive, this topic of the proposal was well covered, it needs more details, but it is good.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability can be clearly exercised in this proposal, based on the information that is said in the topics of success and impact metrics. In general, I believe that the most organic way to understand whether the project has worked is whether the youth involved in the workshops are being inserted into the job market, either by founding their own businesses or even joining existing companies. I would like there to be some kind of follow-up of these people, that is, how could we keep in touch with them, in order to be aware of their post-event achievements? We could think about establishing this point, suddenly a member of WADA itself could be responsible for this and bring feedback to the rest of the community, through participation in Town Hall, for example. We can also exercise auditability by monitoring the workshops themselves. A community member living in Ghana could participate face-to-face with them and prepare reports to score whether success metrics during the event were actually being met.

Add to this the young demographic that makes up Africa, with a median age of 19.7 and one of the highest population growth in the world, educating early-on in this region should be prioritized.

All intended success metrics also fits well within the metrics of this Challenge. If goes as planned this format I reckon can easily be duplicated and implemented to various schools across the region simultaneously. Only critique I have would be the effectiveness, education early-on has it's risk, educating them in a rigid manner I fear would only cause confusion and reluctance to learn more, a current issue of Cardano which is having bite-size and easy-to-learn content.
