The structure of the Heartbeat podcast is made of 3 rounds : members make a project update, quick debate on topics selected by the community and followed by a vote, commitment time for communities' work.\r\nThe proposer clearly states the problem that maintainining collaboration in Catalyst collaborative workshops require time and energy, which some members have in limited quantity. \r\nProject Catalyst Heartbeat podcast solution offers to distribute the effort in time and among members (limited time for each member) to develop collaboration without the pressure of a commitment to a big effort (like attending a long meeting).\r\nThis project has a potential to foster collaboration between Catalyst members, offering members a new and more time saving way to collaborate than today's Townhalls. It can also facilitate new proposers onboarding: this podcast is a place where they can take ideas and find support.\r\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively address the Community Events Challenge, and can have a strong impact on Project Catalyst performance.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The two team members are identified and gather the skills necessary for this project: experience in teaching, in computer science, in project management.

The proposer plans to use several channels to introduce the event and familiarize the community with this podcast facilitation protocol.

But I would not focus too much on number of CAs \"in sync\" as it is rather the quality of their interactions which is important. \r\nI would recommend the proposer to elaborate on a metric that would show the benefit of this solution over other type of events, like townhalls.

The town halls always start of with community led briefings from proposers, etc. \r\n2.
