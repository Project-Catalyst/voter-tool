Where it could shine in the overall Cardano ecosystem is encouraging the idea swap with heavily engaged NFT projects to get us from 'wen moon?' to 'I didn't know you could do THAT with an NFT!'  Catalyst has the potential to be THE force that drives NFTs to the next level of innovation for creators and market participants.  An idea about specific NFT projects, whether they are already native to Cardano or looking to move over from another platform, their needs and frustrations with existing tools, would be a useful metric for evaluating just how relevant this proposal would be to the problem as stated.  But as solely a bridge to onboard the conversation, it is a great start as is.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team is a well known group of ambassadors, builders and contributors to the Catalyst Community.  They have been funded frequently through Catalyst, and have demonstrated the best qualities and interests of the community at every turn.  Their organization of Idea Fest, a huge success in on boarding proposers, is a strong indicator of their ability to successfully work to bring in new ideas from the NFT community specifically, repurposing and scaling existing formats and tools.  The proposal didn't indicate whether they had particular knowledge of the strengths and uniqueness of Cardano's NFT potential, however this shouldn't be needed to successfully organize the meetings between those with that understanding and those who are curious about CNFTs potential, and the ability of Catalyst to get ideas sorted and off the ground.  The schedule, given that they already have tools, teams and formats available is urgent without being rushed, and the budget proposed is in line with previously funded proposals by this team.  There is a high predictability of success here.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is a simply audited proposal, as its product will be a consistent stream of publicly available content beginning to be available almost immediately in February.

Therefore, it strongly impacts on Cardano ecosystem. \r\nThis project also has KPIs & OKRs that will make a big impact on the ecosystem, and of course, align with the challenge givens ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The leader of this project is well-known in the Catalyst community, he has well connected to CNFT community, and has experience in organizing events with Calalyst team.

NFT(s) are more than just being that, and we have seen it grow into a more functional asset! This also includes that the community can innovate together to implement and venture extraordinary insights and experience between each other, which in turn not just adopting new users to the Cardano ecosystem but to plant an innovative signature as a routine in the NFT side of the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members are not classified though the idea of the proposal resonated where it said \"Regarding the NFT Ecosystem, we see a lot of competition and run for the fast Money\". The evolution of NFT(s) is slowly starting to be a more functional and utilitarian asset, and this proposal would be a great way to improve the quality of creators, marketplaces and businesses. Besides NFT Guild YouTube channel, zoom calls and discord, will there be other online platform to increase awareness of the proposing subject? A more detailed metrics to what extent of number of participants can be achieved, potential collaborators and types of held events will be helpful to foresee the success of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Though I believe its the funding required is reasonable, and milestones given are achievable, it would be helpful if there are few important key points that could be listed.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has indicated connection to however no specific commitment has come from established groups within the Cardano community such as Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Town Hall, Catalyst School, Ambassadors Guild and the Bridge Builders Guild. It's therefore unclear if this project seeks to leverage these already established initiatives to bring greater awarness about Cardano to the CNFT space - or indeed if it is about creating additional work that would lead to a greater understanding. The reporting mechanism within the monthly Catalyst Town Halls would likely mitigate or steer any project creep away from the intended mission. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a clear budget and timeline inlcuded in the proposal with a proposed amount of 500USD per event over a three month period.
