The events are a great way to encourage new community members to understand the ecosystem and potentially contribute their own ideas. Additionally, a competitive environment, such as a hackathon are a great way to bring out the brightest minds that are looking for a way to get involved with Cardano. One question that I do have is related to the key metrics of success. 3 high schools and 4 technical institutions isn't a high number, so how can good competition be incentivized if there aren't many participants? If the proposers could answer this question, it would strengthen the proposal.

The budget of the proposal seems reasonable given the time that will be put into the project. Clarification on the prizes and how they would be distributed would benefit the proposal.\r\nThe proposers, however, did not provide much information regarding specific examples of content that would be taught in the min courses. What kinds of content would the students be learning? If the proposers could provide some concrete examples, it would make the proposal more clear.

If several meetings are held, the chance of being able to mobilize new people for a more solid participation in the community is greater. What I thought here was, how long would these sessions last? Because despite there being several, the authors did not specify how many, it would be important to have this notion to understand the magnitude of the project. It would also be important for us to know exactly how they would get students' attention to attend such meetings. It is known that there will be rewards, but which ones? Would they be in ADA, local currency? Who exactly would present the contents of these meetings? We have team members here, but we don't know if they would do it themselves or would outsource the service; I believe it's them, but we don't know if they are all, we don't know if any of them have contact with the world of education, in order to have strategies to transmit the teachings. Overall, the idea is very good, and it certainly fits the challenge of promoting events that benefit the Cardano ecosystem, bringing in new participants; I would just like more details in relation to a few things, as I mentioned here. It would also be very important for them to draw up a more detailed timeline for these meetings, as I will explain in the discussion topic below.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved seems to be very well prepared with regard to the knowledge inherent to the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem. We have several professionals with different areas of expertise, speakers of different languages \u200b\u200band most with many years of experience in the profession. It would be even more interesting if they told us some examples of past work in an individual way: we know that the Wada group is quite active in Catalyst (I've already evaluated several of their proposals), and they point out some milestones already made. It is positive how they present the names of those who would be involved in the project and their roles, making the team's understanding more solid. Another thing I thought was that this project also needs less technical work in the technology area, for example, in marketing, the logistics of meetings, the production of the event itself. Would these parts be made by themselves, or by other people? The marketing part is essential for success here, because outreach is as necessary as the content of the meetings, so someone experienced to do the job would be important. I also think there will be graphical content, both in the presentations themselves (they probably used slides, graphics, visual demonstrations of what they say), would that content be done by some designer? That would be the best option, in my opinion. I missed the mention of these two professionals in the project (advertiser and designer). About the script, the authors include what they will do more generally and the subjects that will be covered in the meetings. It is possible to have a preview of what will be done, however, there could be more detail. For example, we know that they will get in touch with some educational institutions (which ones?), that will promote meetings (if we already had dates, or at least we knew how often they would happen, it would be better) and also the topics covered in the meetings (They could divide which ones would be addressed in the first moment, and in the second meeting, so on). On the financial division, I think it was the most superficial part of the proposal, unfortunately, we don't have a very deep understanding of what will be done with each part of the money they mention. For example, 9k in prizes: what would be the value of each prize? Is it real money, or do the authors intend to buy equipment such as notebooks and give it to the winners? In the motivations of the team/misc. other motivations, it would be good if they included explanations of what this is about, I didn't quite understand. In general, the authors provided us with information about the team, script and financial division, but there could be more details in the script and especially about the money, for a better understanding of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The authors provide us with valid information so that we can carry out proper monitoring. Success here would be measured in two ways, in my opinion. At first, based on the data cited by the authors: the number of young people and institutions involved in the project. But also, we could follow what each participant would do post-events. For example, let's say that of the 42 students involved, 20 showed a strong interest in entering the community, whether through study in programming, the Catalyst project or other areas. It would be very worthwhile to monitor the progress of such young people, in this way we could also monitor if the project is bearing the desired results! In summary, I believe that the project's auditability is quite possible and not that complex, it is enough that some members of the community commit to following the data cited by the authors (or even provide feedback themselves) and that there is a follow-up after the events for those who showed interest in getting involved going forward.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 10, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "A great proposal that I reckon comes from the insight gained of continuously being involved in the Cardano community. There are indeed currently various events that act as placeholders but rarely are there events that attempts to enter non-Cardano communities such as this proposal. Seeing that education is key for Cardano, approaching education centers such as schools, universities through the creation of Cardano University Club logically aligns and is a non-invasive way to introduce Cardano. Being non-invasive is essential because educating tends to be invasive, educating on something new takes a lot of time. By integrating with the clubs ecosystem in the universities, although they all have their own topics, all interact and acts as a melting pot to get to know one another. This social aspect of introduction seems to be diluted in the current Cardano approach. Again, great proposal, totally see it being scalable and totally fits with the Challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the information provided, the stated team has what it takes, although there are no links that proves so. Educating is a passion and the team majority being teachers themselves, add to that their software developer background, this proposal based on those specific data has the potential to be well-executed. Additional info such as what schools and education institute the team will approach would also help in gauging the teams assessment capabilities and the success of this proposal. Example; if the team where to target a school that is multiple steps away (from a basic academic skill perspective) from being exposed to blockchain technology, then this proposal will perhaps become ineffective. Unfortunately, as much as I love this proposal, all the budget components are not clearly broken down. Specifically the prize element with budget of $9000. $9000 can be in it's own a proposal itself, which merits the need to clearly state the use of. Then there is the motivation budget of $5000 and $1000. Perhaps this is just wording, but it would be more logical for the budget to be fleshed out, as an example; Guest Speakers invitation, educational and motivational videos on YouTube that can also act as your marketing materials or services for setting up the clubs in the universities. Such a shame the project management aspect of it is does not instill confidence of this beautiful proposal being executed well.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal also unfortunately does not have a clear roadmap and timeline on how it will achieve their deliverables. It is leaning towards -take your word for it- that this proposal will achieve the metrics it has put on themselves.
