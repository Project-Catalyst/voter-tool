You are right that there may be other factors for SPO to switch to renewables, but at least our project will give an incentive (visibility) for those who are doing. And for the whole community, the progress towards a green blockchain would be visible, regardless of specific reasons for a SPO to switch or offset. I will try to add some points about this to our proposal."}, {"q0": "This proposal stands as an example of work that can have maximal impact on accomplishing the challenge, and by this putting Cardano as a world leader in acheiving the climate neutrality of blockchain technology.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team consists of environmental experts and scientists who lead in the world in the field of climate status evaluation and restoration.
