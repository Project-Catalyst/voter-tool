The budget and timeline look reasonable provided that the documentation will be done in detail with full fisclosure so the new SPOs could evaluate if running the pool is an ideal operation for them.

A clear diagram would help people to be more confident in their way becoming a SPO.

However, when it comes to visual content, it also requires designing/editing skill to get the information across effectively, so you should probably consider that.

It is fully aligned with the challenge objectives to create tools for SPOs. The problem and solution are well defined in a simple way. It would have been helpful to have some estimation of the impact such as solution could bring - i.e. how many new SPOs will be developed or how much time new SPO will save?

It could have been helpful if you mention some other community members you are collaborating with on your SPO or the SALMON pool. More information about you will be helpful as well.

One key risk is how to make it available for the community so the resource created will make the required impact. I.e. add it to SPO guide\nresources.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Also here it is straightforward as the deliverable is clear and the proposer will publish the diagram and scripts in a public forum, such as github or a Miro board.
