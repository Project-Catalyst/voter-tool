For ex: number of SPOs that deploy their solution... ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team gives us the timeline of bi-week working and all their progress will happen in 8 weeks, and the budget breakdown is reasonable for this timeline. \r\nThey have a detailed implementation plan but don't tell more detail about the tech in this proposal, but people can check their job at GitHub. \r\nI wish that I can see some risk-relevant to their plan, It will help me know how they will face potential risks when doing it. By the way, they also have 1 week backup incase disruption, so I think this proposal is feasible.

Due to its interesting content and self-sustainability, this idea has a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. If completed this idea could add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

Very interesting idea!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is completely transparent. He posted a link via Github where we can see all the necessary information about who is behind this idea. It is clear that the proposer has the necessary knowledge and skills to realize this idea. The budget is reasonable and clearly presented and broken down into identifiable items and with the requested amount the idea could be realized. Proposer states a clear plan with realistic timetable to complete the work and resources needed to realize the idea. Proposer presents details of actionable tasks and order of execution which are needed in order to complete this project. The technical aspects are listed as well as the idea of possible risks, so probably the proposer left aside $300, which he stated in the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is not the type of developer blockchain proposal that requires programming still proposer presents roadmap with time frames.
