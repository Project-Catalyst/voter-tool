The roadmap moreso indicates, that the team will be providing workshops and an active online discourse about NFTs in relation to Cardano, including setting up an Art Festival at the end of the projects roadmap. So basically, most of the possible directions for this challenge will be addressed: creating educational material (in this case about NFTs), getting people together, translation and education. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers provide an already active website as well as a twitter handle to look up the current state of the outreach program. So I find it highly likely, that the team will be able to put more work into their programme with additional funding.\r\nThe team would like to add several NFT themed educational programmes as well as an NFT Art Festival. The information provided about the team points to an already active following that will be the targeted audience for the development of the NFT program. The proposal does not indicate that the team has prior experience with NFTs and it does not indicate how well the team is connected in the art/NFT space and how they intend to reach out to possible artists for the festival. Generally, this proposal is very clear in how it will provide educational content and a platform to discuss NFTs, the proposal - however - does not provide any information on how they are planning on setting up an art festival. So basically, the scope of the proposal shifted during writing and is focussing mostly on creating an NFT themed website with educational content and workshops - with the goal of setting up an Art Festival.\r\nIt would have been interesting to find out more about the connections between the english and the japanese community, as it is mentioned a couple times in the proposal and \"bridging\" seems like a great idea to not create isolate spaces but rather try to merge communities that are divided by their language. I\u00b4m not quite sure if the proposers refer to the running website or if they are planning on creating a new website. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The budget is broken down somewhat broad and with the \"solution statement\" referring to an Art Festival there should be funds allocated for the festival. So far, the funding is only for the website including the graphic design of the website as well as some marketing. If working with national and international artists as mentioned, the team should provide some goals for this Art Festival and also would have to break down the budget for this, including for the artists that they would like to work with. The roadmap and the goals included are feasable and auditable and will be transparent through discord and the website.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 13, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "In the late 20th century, global population knew of Japan from its electronics brands. By the last few decades, most were drawn to its culture primarily via the visual Japanese representation of anime & manga. I agree that an NFT Art Festival not only effectively belongs to this challenge but it is an apt event in more ways than one. There is an opportunity presented by this proposal that could not only lead to further adoption and a more widespread awareness of ADA but one where our CNFT community can benefit from with creative Japanese-inspired artworks. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The qualifications of the two main proposers are very-well detailed and are both in line with the event being proposed. Yuki seems to be a proven provider of translated-to-Japanese Cardano resources with links to currently published outputs included in the proposal. Timothy seems to have the experience to organise such an event and the main bridge between the two cultures. Furthermore, his network appears to be large in scope that he may well succeed in bringing Cardano awareness to people who are not commonly part of our crypto-world. This can only be beneficial. The fact that the pair have been conducting Telegram/Discord sessions already adds to the probability for success as they would have surely learnt how to run such an event. There is already a regular captive audience which can hopefully grow larger when it eventually occurs. As someone who had assessed tenders for a university institution in a previous life, I can attest that the qualifications of the proposers, their previous experiences and on-going Cardano commitment are all recipes for success. I agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully if given the opportunity.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a fair bit of planning projections, costings and pathway provided to enable auditability of this proposal. The two proposers seemingly approach their Cardano-related work on a part-time basis and this may well be the rationale for a year-long deployment of the project. Nonetheless, there are significant milestones established on the 3, 6 and 12 month marks which will allow Project Catalyst to assess its progress. This bodes well for the proposal. There isn't much I can suggest to this proposal to further improve it and it is a testament to how well it is presented. My only recommendation is for the general Cardano Community to join the Telegram/Discord channels even of you are not a native Japanese speaker as you may well gain an understanding of this growing community. You never know, you may well benefit from its impending CNFTs with an early look-in. Good luck.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 14, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea meets very well what the challenge seeks, because it intends to create a website that will, as I understand it, encourage debate about NFT Art on platforms such as discord, telegram and zoom, aimed at the Japanese community. The authors also intend to promote in-person festivals, but I believe that only after the project moves forward, that is, that the first investments are made and the target audience grows larger and consolidates. It is positive that the authors already have an extensive work of translating content involving the Cardano ecosystem into Japanese, which demonstrates their involvement with the cause. It is also important as they already have a good number of people in their communities, which would make project execution simpler as they already have a potential audience. What I thought here was that, I don't understand why it would be necessary to create a website to leverage such discussions; they could be promoted on the portals they already make available. I would like to understand a little more about the functionality of this site, what else would it have in terms of content? I believe the authors used a lot of space to explain their previous activities and who they are, but they didn't explain the core of the project, that is, the website. Why would he be that bridge, how would he break down cultural barriers and so on. I would like more details on this.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The best part of the proposal was undoubtedly the presentation of the authors. We know their names and in great detail several things they did before, what their relationship is both with the Cardano ecosystem and with Japan. About this part, there is nothing to criticize. Full confidence in the authors' ability to successfully execute the project is given. Regarding the script, they do not establish phases to be followed with duly detailed activities, what we have here are the definitions of success. Through this topic, we have a sense of what would happen in each quarter, but it is not enough to have a solid understanding of what will happen during the construction of the project itself. I suggest that the authors make a division of phases (per month is a good idea) and mention: what will be done, who would do it, for how many days, so that... I wish it were useful, the process will be better understood. Regarding the financial division, I believe that the same problem occurs. We know how the money will be distributed, but this is done in a rather shallow way, the division is very macro. For example: \"$3677 for website design and graphics\". It's a good amount, how will this design be built? What will be done besides the website interface? Would they hire a professional in the area? In my view, there was a lack of detail both in the construction of the phases and in this financial division, so a review in this part of the proposal is necessary.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Through the definitions of success given by the authors, it is possible to exercise good auditability. We could set up a small community group to have meetings with them to show them the progress of the project, and the feedback could be taken out to the rest of the community. It would be interesting if the people chosen to monitor the project were also Japanese speakers. Another thing that would be important is that the authors themselves provide data on how access to the site would be, how much their communities (in discord, etc.) would be growing, if there really would be a significant number of people adopting technologies from our ecosystem (in this case , the use of NFT). It is important that they give this feedback in English, as most people in the community do not speak Japanese. Thus, I believe that the authors did provide pertinent information for future monitoring, it is enough that the community itself engages in monitoring the construction of the site and that they themselves bring feedback on the number of accesses and new users of our blockchain, through of digital assets.

Seeing the experience both members have they will probably need to hire members for the design of the website and development, but there is no mention of this.
