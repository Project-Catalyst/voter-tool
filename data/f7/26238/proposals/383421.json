Through the online fair, we provide information about the cryptographic universe in a winning and educational way. I really liked that they already brought the idea with a visual identity. The target audience is Japanese people who have already heard something about these matters, but do not have enough instructions, to the point of trusting in these technologies and therefore adopting Cardano or actively participating in projects such as Catalyst. I found it very positive as the author of the proposal did several researches to prove his point, that is, as it is necessary for such campaigns to be promoted, he wishes that the \"seed\" of blockchain and crypto is already planted in the country (for example, some merchants and companies are already adopting as technologies), it is now necessary to drive this wave. In fact, Japan is a country that stands out a lot in technological matters, and if there the adhesion of our cryptocurrency and blockchain becomes a habit, Cardano will have an exponential growth, and this proposal works well on top of that. In other words, in relation to the impact that this proposal will cause, it is undoubtedly very positive and fully corresponds to what the challenge seeks. Regarding funding, it is complicated for authors to ask for a single proposal half the money allocated for this challenge. Unfortunately this makes this proposal very complicated to be funded, despite the idea itself being great and the possible results are what we expect for the challenge. If the value is readjusted, it will be much more suitable.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is a duo with relevant and interesting backgrounds, but I don't know if they are ready to lead this project, they didn't show any kind of connection with the Cardano universe in their descriptions. They provide us with a short description of who they are (this description could be more detailed), a website that already demonstrates some of their work and gives us examples of some brands they've worked for. Regarding the step-by-step steps that will carry out this project, I found it very superficial. There is little information about what would happen in 3, 6 and 12 months, we even managed to get an idea of \u200b\u200bhow the process would be that way, but not a deep understanding that would only be reached with the presence of details. Also, the splitting of the money was done relatively superficially too, the total amount is split into some parts, but only the topic \"project management\" is better explained. I think, unfortunately, this proposal topic left something to be desired in several respects, I would like the authors to have clarified how they relate to the cryptographic world and especially our blockchain and provided more detail in both the script and the financial division parts.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is insufficient. The only thing the authors provide to monitor the progress of this project would be the number of attendees/views of the events. But it is necessary to go further. I suggest that there is a member of the community, who lives in Tokyo, who participates in the fair and then prepares a report on how things happened, in order to present it later to the community. The authors themselves could establish some connection with the event participants, in order to understand how, after events, they became involved with the cryptographic community. If this project really aroused their interest and curiosity to study about these technologies, to invest in crypto, adopt the use of NFT, participate in Catalyst and so on. I think the authors could also create infographics passing on the information that would help us understand if the project's goals were achieved, since they already demonstrate a lot of mastery in the graphic design part. Therefore, I believe that audibility here still needs to be built better, it is a very expensive proposal, which further reinforces the urgency of being monitored with precision and frequency.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 14, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This is a must proposal for the future. The proposers want to display Cardano in all it's glory but we are not ready yet. Reason this proposal is for the future is because there is not much yet to be displayed from Cardano. DApps that are online on Cardano are limited, prominent NFT content creators are also limited but indeed we are growing, it's like a pent-up pot waiting to explode. Indeed the proposers intend to create NFT of their own but without building a community, that NFT is just an NFT. There is no binding social value to it. No journey behind it but for the sake of marketing Cardano. Rather than just creating a NFT, work with the Cardano community. There are artist here, there are stories of beautiful suffering waiting to be told, there are passionate communities fighting everyday to achieve their dreams. Although this proposal will indeed introduce Cardano to at the very least their clientele, other than that, the mass effect the proposer intended to achieve might be missed. Highly recommend the proposers to please be patient, to connect with the existing Japanese Cardano community and the community in general. Patience, wait, then deliver that killer kesi giri. Your time will come.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "After going through all their LinkedIn links, all their Instagram social media post, majority of their website, this is a team of hi-value and hi-skill individuals outside the Cardano ecosystem. A great indicator to the Cardano ecosystem that we are gaining more and more attention. They have worked with many high profile brands, especially the YF Agency. Eggworm might also be equally prominent but from the social media metrics available they are behind YF Agency. Nonetheless, both entities have a solid team and portfolio behind them. I am confident enough the will deliver on their future proposal. Budget provided is broken down clearly, though only with an adjoining post and not a detailed action plan. Timeline presented of one year make sense and given the human resource at their disposal is logically doable. A bit surprising they have not accounted the risk and challenge they might face organizing this kind of event. Most likely due to that these 2 (two) entities have not researched their target client well enough. Reckon to look over the tons of video content of the Town Hall in the IOHK YouTube Channel, video content of the Cardano Summit also in the IOHK YouTube Channel and to also join Project Catalyst Discord channel to get gist of how wildly active Cardano ecosystem is. Again, please be patient proposers, build relationships first.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are 2 (two) roadmap sections. One conveys their step-by-step break down of the event, while another is their general implementation plans with milestones. KPI's are also available in 2 (two) sections, one is a KPI section in itself which can not be measured for there are no metrics, while another is imbedded in their roadmap. It's a series of hits and miss with their proposal in general. Reckon they should also approach Catalyst School to learn on how to create and submit a strong proposal. If proposers are too busy they can view various workshops by Catalyst School that are on YouTube. Problem statement and solution are well thought out, resulting it being interconnected well.

The proposal states that the intended audience is beginners and the summit wants to display a variety of usecases for blockchain/crypto/ Cardano and show things that are \"cool\".

This makes it very likely, that the team will be able to set up a summit and connect it with Cardano and blockchain. However, the information provided in the proposal is lacking clarity and content. The word \"cool\" is used too often and should be substituted with examples to demonstrate that the team has a wide knowledge-base of the Cardano ecosystem and the blockchain technology. The team gives a broad overview that it intends to focus on merchandise, NFTs, but also about blockchain technology, developers and futurism. While this might be a good starting point, the team did not provide relevant information on the content of the summit at this moment. The roadmap is a good example, as the first sentence reads \"complete planning, preparation and launch within 3 months\" but it does not give any indication on what content they are planning on doing. I think, mostly, that the team has a strong marketing background and so it points towards a fun branding event that they might be planning, which could attract and onboard new users for sure. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap is relatively broad and does not include some necessary information about possible contributers and how to make the process transparent and auditable for the community through github or discord or statistical tools that would be able to audit the program. I\u00b4m not sure and the proposal does not mention if the team is already active in the Catalyst/ Cardano/ crypto space and has a following that would be the targeted audience for their summit, or if they have to plan for outreach and marketing from scratch which would make the intended KPIs more difficult to achieve. It would have been a good information to add to the proposal. The budget is broken down well and would be able to cover all parts of setting up a summit.

The budget breakdown is missing information. A clear breakdown is mentioned for what they need the funding for but there are no numbers and statistics given.

Being 11 proposals in this challenge, it may seem unreasonable to allocate half on that amount on one .\r\nAlso, I would like to see the input form current Cardano & Catalyst community members to support this proposal and take on some tasks as volunteers to reduce the budget cost.\r\nAn idea like this will really help promote the cardano.
