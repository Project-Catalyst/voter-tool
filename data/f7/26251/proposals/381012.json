The proposal is trying to elliminate most duplicate work by developers by building a marketplace tooling in one reusable place. This will allow other Dapp developers to focus only on the different features and aspects of their own Dapp. As a developer myself I would love for such tooling. The challenge setting is in line with the proposal. This project will add huge value to the cardano ecosystem, because of the speed up and consistency upgrade if all future marketplaces have the same bones.  This is a big team, which will be able to scale with any furure challenges that could arise. Unlike a lot of the other simmilar proposals I've seen, there's no elements missing in this one. Right now the dev ecosystem is missing such tooling, and it will play a vital role in the future.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is quite big, and this assures me the work will be done as described in the roadmap. They have all the necessary software skills to bring this project to a conclusion. They've left their linkedin profiles, and thus are bringing legitimacy to their work. The budget is quite big and would have been nice to have a breakdown of the actuall costs that are planned in the roadmap. I'd suggest to the proposers of this project to really think about a budget breakdown table. The fact that they've already have identified the specific team numbers and skills set is amazing, but what's even more amazing is they have already formed a team ready to work.  There is a realistic sensible time table to complete the work. The proposers will show not only when, but how the work is done, when they open source the building blocks.  The technical aspects of the proposal are prety straightforward ... write code so other developers can use the code. As a developer, I was impressed by the fact the CLI (command line interface) will be done using Haskel, which is the original choice of language for the cardano ecosystem. The team mebers have a very vast majority of skills and abilities so i feel confident in their ability to face challenges down the road. Future projects would have to sync with this one IMO to promote faster development.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Anyone interested in the open source work would be able to follow the progress of this proposal, except for the CLI tool, which will be open-sourced once the project is deployed. This makes athe auditability of the proposal quite easy. There are no KPIs listed, which is a small issue, I'd recommend for some metrics of adoption to be added for future projects.  The project roadmap and milestones are clearly set and doable. There's a clear and understandable description of the targeted problem, and the proposers are asking all the right questions. It's easy to see, they've really thought things trough before making this proposal and really digging in the business and development problems of the current state of the ecosystem.

The core components are listed that are common to a marketplace and that are often shared pieces of logic and functionality between systems. As identity and payments increasingly utilize blockchain we can expect to see an increasing demand for marketplaces for both services and products. Marketplaces represent some of the biggest companies in the world and due to that there is a big opportunity for this proposal to lead to high impact marketplaces if executed well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team are listed in a separate link with their LinkedIn profiles added. The team has a strong background in software development which will be important for feasibly executing this proposal. A budget breakdown is not provided which makes it difficult to know exactly where the funds will be used. The teams background makes this proposal feasible but to further improve the rating more information would be needed for a budget breakdown and also potentially more information on the core features and how they would be implemented as they are non trivial. Some of the features could have been marked as high priority and released in stages as they are completed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap is presented with the key areas of focus. No KPIs or success objectives have been added. As an area of improvement the core components listed are likely non trivial to implement, it would have been good to see some groupings to state which ones will be implemented first so they could be released and shown to the community, ideally open source. This would make it easier for the community to audit and provide feedback as the proposal progressed through the initial implementation. Better clarity on the budget break down would also be valuable so it's easier for the community to audit where the funding budget was spent.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 3, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Provide developers with a base layer marketplace functionality, so they can focus on the specifics of their products and services.", "experience": "An experienced team of developers, Plutus pioneers, legal experts, project managers, and CTOs."}
