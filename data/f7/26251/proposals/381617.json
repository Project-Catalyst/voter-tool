The impact depends on the adoption of this project, so the impact is very hard to measure by iteself. This project surely will help the cardano developer ecosystem with an example of a build Dapp. The proposal states how it will bring value, but it doesn't specify the cardano ecosystem. This project would have an even better fit in the DApps & Integrations challenge. If the proposal can scale with interest is entirely up to the author, but keeping in mind the stated experience, I see no issues in welcoming the challenges and potential growth.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The impact of this project depends on it's adoption. Most of all on product providers being honest when describing the process they use. This fact is a big flaw in the project for me. It is clear that the proposer has put a lot of though into it, but I also believe it's too idealistic of an approach to work in practice based on the videos posted on the youtube channel which state that the relation between how much you need to pay for a product would indirectly rely on a provider answering honestly about the origin of the water used to grow the product, the furtilizers used (destructive to the environment or not) and a series of a specific questions for each different kind of product. I see two main practical issues  which were not mentioned anywhere: 1. how will you guarantee providers will answer honestly to questions that will potentially be detremental for their business. 2. Who decides the questions asked for a specific product. Because of those two main reasons, I don't believe this product is feasable. If the proposer doesn't plan to bring a team together for future proposals buidling on top of this one and supporting it, it's going to be really hard to bring this idea into reality. The budget is broken down to identify the items, but I really feel like more funding would be necessary to clear the outlined goals. I'm speaking as a developer who has done some independant work simillar to the proposal. No timetable is offered in the proposal, so I'd say that's a critical pointt of improvement of this proposal. There is a vast description of the end goal in mind, which is great but I didn't find in the proposal were the concrete steps to get there and the timetable for the whole plan.  The technical aspects weren't detailed enough for me to undestand although I watched through several videos posted on the proposers channel. A whitepaper of some sort would have been great way to educate people of the actual implementation of the idea. The proposal only states that the tokenomics for this project is complex without further explanation. My suggestion would be to think about the relevant risks to a successful implementaion like: do I need a team? do I have the concrete steps, roadmap and timetable to complete the tasks?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer didn't mention any KPIs or a way to follow the progress of the proposal, so my suggestion would be to focus on clear practical examples and targeted KPIs to enable the cardano community to help and understand the whole idea of the project.
