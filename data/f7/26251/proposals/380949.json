Keeping in line with the challenge brief, this library will help developers make use of the cardano blockchain. The impact for developers and by extension Dapps will be great. Supporting this solution will point the community toward decentralization. The proposal makes it clear that it has a place of value when talking about contribution to the community. Mostly devs that are still new to the space will benefit succh implementations. The goals of the proposals align perfectly with the challenge. No mention of scaling is mentioned, so I suppose the proposer works alone, which is fine for some time, but with scaling I'd suggest to start thinking of a team, because it is no small feat to make such a basic library. The proposal is lacking technical strategy of execution which is important, especially when future work might grow. Currently there is a great need of such libraries and framework, because the cardano developer ecosystem is still very young and hasn't matured yet, to have all the libraries and goodies developed and ready to use. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer, obviously a developer states significant skillsets, but unfortunately I weren't able to verify any of them, because no links or credentials were left in the proposal. While I respect the need for privacy being a state pool operator, it's very important for any proposal to have people standing with their names behind a project, because in the eyes of the voters this brings great credabiltiy to the author and the proposal. I'm still unsure about all that work being done in such a short time by a single person, because no other plans for team members were mentioned. One item that was a bit lacking was a clearly outlined milestones and technical tasks that should be completed in order to bring the project to fruition. The proposer mentiones something about rewriting the plugin system for 60 hrs. As a developer myself I find that very hard to believe and that timeline asonable to me, but let's hope the author has a team in mind for this rewrite. A step by step plan for the whole project is missing as well, not only for the technical part, but also for future growth of the project, self funding and so on, because such libraries need to be maintained in order to stay relevant and be used. There is a budget, but not the specific resources / manpower that is going to be necessary to build the project, so I assume it's 1 man. I would have been glad to read more about technical implementation, details, and plans, because this might have sparked the desire to help with the implementation, but as it stands now, I'm not sure about the exact plan. One more thing I found missing in the proposal is future challenges that might arise during the implementation like: the rapid growth of the usage of the plugins, the continious support and updates of the plugins and so on. I'd suggest to the author to take a look for other plugin creators and join forces in order to maximise utility for the ecosystem. We're strong when we're together. There are quite a lot of proposals simmilar to this one - building framework for future use.  Despite all of this I believe it's a good project and it's worth the time and vote.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since there's a github linked, I'd expect each cardano community member that's interested in the progress and development of this proposal to be able to follow along inside the repository linked in the proposal. The KPIs were lacking and IMO they are important for any projects and helping the community follow and get excited about the project. A simple metric like downloads per week is a simple but great marketing tool. I was looking for a longer horizon roadmap, but didn't find one.
