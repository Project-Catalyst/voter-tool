If you don't know what an API or a backend is, just look at the youtube video posted in the proposal. The proposal identifies a problem and seeks to solve it as promissed. As a developer I believe open-source is the way to go. The proposal is absolutely 100% in the right challenge and will bring imense value to the ecosystem as an open-source project. It's going to be a template on how to develop for the blockchain.  The project has a specific section where they dig into the possible challenges that open sourcing the project might find like security issues, process set up and others. I don't say this for many proposals, but I don't see anything missing from this one. This should be left somewhere as an example of how a proposal is supposed to be! This will add a missing part of the ecosystem, which is a reusable open source code that is tested enough that could be relied on. As a dev I don't have any concerns about the proposal. I just hope it gets funded. Many many projects will greatly benefit if this proposal is funded and the impact for the ecosystem would be great.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided interviews and a name which is verifiable along with links to a website so no worries if this is credible or not...it is! Open sourcing the blockfrost API will bring a ton of new people to the project and will ensure blockfrost will have the manpower to do all the upcomming work and scale properly. The budget is very simple and clear. It's outlined where it's going. Security audit and hiring two people to work for a year. There's a realistic timetable to do the promised work. It's about a year which is sensible.  The resources necessary for the proposal implementation like FAQ by blockfrost users is present and it's being looked at.  The project has considered a lot of possible challenges and that's exactly why it's going to take a long time to open source the whole codebasae.

The KPI mentioned are not only present (unlike many other proposals), but are relevant as well.

The budget is broken down into 3 parts. It will pay for an audit, and a whole year's salaries for a software engineer and a community manager. The time to launch after funding is at most 7 months, which is reasonable as the audit can take up to 4 months. Since the product is already built, they didn't explain how and what is being built. The fund will go to maintain, audit and community manage this product.

The. main member/founder from the blockfrost has been to cardano 360 earlier, and explained in details (this link is also available in this proposal) how blockfrost is helping many developers focus on business logic and abstracted away the interaction with Cardano.\r\n\r\nAs a developer myself, the solution and its benefits are quite clear to me. Moreover, separate section on why should it be open sourced gives a good details to non technical community members as well. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would have been better to also provide the historical challenges/decisions on why this was not developed as open source from the very beginning ? With this details included in the proposal, (not only that your intent was to develop open source solution since beginning but also a link to that INTENT reference would have been great)\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From experience perspective this is quite clear to me, as proposers are the developers/owners of the blockfrost API and backend already.\r\n\r\nThey know best on what challenges are needed to move it to an open source project. \r\n\r\n I can understand that the $24k that are asked for the security audit are absolutely needed, so that before the code is open sourced it is high quality.\r\nWhat i am not clear OR what i think might have been done better is to give more details on what the senior backend engineer will do for a year to make this project open source ? \r\n\r\nWhat kind of major code refactorings/issues they are expecting that they need an engineer to work upon that for an entire year ? I am sorry but being a senior developer myself, i am just hesitant on the budget justification. I agree that it is written that these people will be primarily public, and at the end of the year a report will be shared. But if we are talking about agile way of working, then i feel more information/justification could have been provided by providing a detailed plan (3-6-12 and further split into biweekly to monthly). I think since the proposer owns the entire code base, they will have pretty good idea on what changes are required, and i dont see any reason why this was not presented here :) \r\n\r\nNevertheless, i agree because from proposal implementation perspective, i do not see any issues here :) GOod luck to the team\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To this point i can not agree neither can i disagree. Not because i do not think the proposer can not do it, but because I think the proposal should have been more elaborative.\r\n\r\nThe total budget asked for is more than 50% of the total fund. In my opinion would have made sense if they split this further down to man hours, and provide a good backlog (at least based on feature sets per milestones). Also that way they could ask for lets say 30k$ for 3 months first, and then propose again in next funds. \r\n\r\nMoreover, if this is going to be mostly repetitive bug fixing (identified in security audit) (maintenance job), how can we be sure that bugs are indeed found within this year ? Moreover, i see no detailed description given in the proposal for a relation between maintenance of the backend vs moving it to open source. As a senior developer myself, i think often the developers find it hard to convey the work progress if it is just maintenance. However, when you are asking for almost 55% of the total challenge fund, your plan should be crystal clear in terms of planning and work estimations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i can neither agree or disagree, as i feel that this is hard on the other smaller proposals who are going to bring in also as equal value if not more to the cardano eco system and are much more clear in their project/implementation planning.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 8, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Blockfrost is a well known and trusted API service provider on Cardano ecosystem.
