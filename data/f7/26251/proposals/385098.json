Therefore, from experience perspective on Smart contracts/technicalities on Cardano eco system i do not see any issues. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the proposer proposes that they will basically hire some PBL team member to develop this, and since the proposer is himself Gimbalabs founder and also has given links for the similar work that was already done by PBL team members, i am fully confident from the experience perspective.\r\n\r\nThe plan presented here is fairly straight forward, so i do not see a reason to split it further down. The budget is well justified, for two months.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it would have been nice to also include the risks associated with this (example: developer not found or could not do it etc), along with how the success will look like ? \r\n\r\nI think one example could be that they will use it in some of the existing projects initiatives by GimbaLabs ? Since proposer has lot of experience with it, he could have added in those details. hence i think i see some room for improvement there", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The implementation information itself is sufficient to audit the progress of this proposal.\r\n\r\nHowever, i think the success of this proposal  implementation can only be found out once this smart contract is deployed and is in use by some of the dapps. e.g. how many dapps are using this solution in 6 months from now ?\r\n\r\n I think in general, given the experience of the proposer, it would not be hard to provide such examples to the community.

In my opinion \"success\" of an open source library hinges it's documentation, maintainer(s) and fine folks committed to providing support and addressing bugs. It's clear that they will build thing but with the lack of maintenance and support plan, I can only give 4 stars here.

That would make it decentralized, secure and on-demand. I am no expert in the area so I don't know if this problem needs to be solved or not so I defer to the expertise of the proposer. There could have been a more clear articulation of why is this important and how will it benefit the cardano ecosystem. I feel like the author should have explained in more detail the idea behind doing this so he can get people behind the idea before starting explanation on the technical part. The key metrics are relevant for the challenge. Nothing was mentioned about scaling and considering the words decentralization and minting were mentioned, I think it would be a good idea to include a \"how will we scale?\" section in the proposal.  This proposal would add to the ecosystem, but I'm no sure how valuable would that something be, because no impact was mentioned or how will this affect the cardano community. As a developer myself my concern is that voters would struggle to see the point in this proposal as I am.

A mention of one team member is mention, but I don't mention if they already talked to them and they agreed to work on the project or that's to be seen. The budget is prety clear: a salary for 2 months for a Plutus Engineer. The proposal could have put a bit more effort in a roadmap breakdown and tasks that can be followed by the community. The plan for implementation is sensible, it's just a bit vague on the specifics.  The technical aspects is one of the pros of the proposal, because they're well explained and connected together. No challenges and risks were mentioned so I hope the work is straightforward.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's a linked site where the plutus developers have put a short comprehensive description of their work relating to smart contracts that they've done, so tracability of the progress is there for any interested community members. There is a mention of KPIs although a bit rough and hard to progres check. There's a bids eye view of a roadmap about the 2 months of work planned out. The targeted problem and solution could be better explained and written and that would be my main suggestion for the author for the next proposal.
