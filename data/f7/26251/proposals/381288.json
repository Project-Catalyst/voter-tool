The impact would be great since there is a need for more Dapps mobile or not. Cardano growth relies on such projects to invite more economic insentive in the ecosystem. If you're a non-technical person: SDKs (software development kit) are necessary for developers to write applications. The proposal absolutely knows what's problem it's solving and the challenges that will come along the way when solving it. This project will bring value to the cardano ecosystem and the proposal states clearly how it's going to do that. There are no key metrics to speak for alignment with the challenge settings unfortunately. Keeping in mind what the team would look like I don't have any doubt the propsal will be able to scale in the future.  Compared to other proposals I'd say this one is a bit wanting in enabling supporters to follow along.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has proven his workflow in previous funding rounds and has a working and delivered project to speak of. That's a great assurance that the continual work, delivery and quality will be up to par with the cardano community standards. One small suggestion I have is to actaully list some of the credentials of the people that are going to work on the project, since listing overall summary of experience is great, but it doesn't bring any more credibility to the proposal since there is no proof of the statement. I personally will follow the progress of this project. Links of team members is a valuable asset to bring credabiltiy to any proposal. The budget is outlined although not broken down, it is implicity understood where the money will go when you look at the hourly chart. As a dev myself, I believe this is a realistic timetable to do the work described. The proposal does a very good job describing the how not only the why of the whole implementation, which is important from a technical perspective. All the resources necesasry to bring the project to fruition and well described and understood. There is almost too much technical explanation for non-technical people. Challenges and risks might not be accounted for, but keeping in mind the experience of the proposer, I'd say that is a non-issues.   ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's a open-source repository where anyone can follow the progress of the proposal so that's great concerning auditability since any community member can easily checkout the work being done. I would recommend a more thorough monitoring plan in mind. More could be asked from the proposals KPIs like: addoption rate, downloads of the SDK and such. There is a more or less clear roadmap to folow, but nowhere to follow it, except for github, which might be good enough (time will tell). There is a clear problem to be solved and the means to solve it.  For future proposals, I'd recommend a more non-technical description and for anyone interested, you can leave a link to a whitepaper or some kind of technical design docs.

To reach mass adoption the community will need to have SDKs in multiple languages and environments so that DApp builds are able to create solutions using the Cardano blockchain. Providing this proposal can be executed well it could have a large impact on opening the door to developers who prefer working with Flutter as a development environment. To give a better impact score it would have been great to see some people already using the SDK or some evidence of the demand for it so that to an advisor it is crystal clear that this proposal will start producing more impact within the ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer adds in their background in the relevant experience section but does not attach a source such as a LinkedIn profile. A video is provided of the SDK and also a link to the open source repository. Both the repository and the video help to provide sufficient evidence that the proposer has the expertise to complete this proposal as has already been demonstrated in the code produced. The tasks and hours are broken down by feature into very reasonable time frames along with a very reasonable budget for completing those tasks. The following tasks for the proposal appear to be more complex by nature to provide all the functionality required however based on the information and evidence provided it appears likely this proposal can be executed as intended.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer adds a detailed feature roadmap with the hours required and the repository and video also give good clarity on what the proposal is intending to do.
