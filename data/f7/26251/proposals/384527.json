The proposal is right for the challenge settings, offering education and growth for the community and SPOs to be percise. There are clear examples of how the proejct will add value to the cardano ecosystem by bringing more people to be SPOs by educating them on the credability of the whole operation. Missing KPIs and metrics for measurement of success, which is odd considering the proposers are doing an analytics proposal. As a developer myself I believe this project would be able to scale well with potential growth (technically speaking).  This is a piece that was missing from the ecosystem, and a lot of the current SPOs had to figure out things for themselves which is hard and not everyone would do it.   ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Concrete skills and people that would do the work are mentioned. I found them on linked in and they seem legit all credentials and skills matching the ones described in the proposal. A clear path for the implementation for the proposal is showt. One caveat would be the missing link to a github repo mentioned in the proposal (where all the code will go). It's a small effort to do an empty repo, but it pays off. The budget could be described better. There is some breakdown per tasks needed to be done, but no reasoning is given behind the specific sums. I expected hourly rates for development like every other proposal does, because it makes sense. It's a bit odd to give a price for development in any other way because it's hard to proove that one feature might be more or less expensive compared to another. There's a realisttic timetable for sure. I have no doubt the proposers will manage with the current time horizon. I was hoping for some kind of technical document about the implementation, but it's not a big deal if they don't have one. It would help though for geeks such as myself.  The technical aspects are a bit blury to me and I'd be interested in helping out if I knew what the plan was. That's the beauty of open-source. The authors haven't mentioned any kinds of expected risks or challenges so I guess it's either prety straitforward or they haven't thought about it.

I'm not so sure where will they post their github repo and how will they make it available to the community post funding? These questions could be avoided by simply linking an empty github repo in the proposal. No metrics and KPIs which is kind of disapointing considering the type of the proposal. There's a clear roadmap and milestones for the planned out time, so no worries there. The description is clear and understandable for non-technical people as well, which is good. The solution is well written as well.  The project would greatly benefit the cardano community if done with the right level of community inclusion. Good luck!
