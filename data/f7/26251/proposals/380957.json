I love the definition of success stated in the proposal, because as a developer that has tried out new frameworks and libraries, it's important to have good documentation. This idea is great for this challenge and I believe that if the other two proposals get voted in, this has to be as well.  The metrics left some to be desired, although they're in line with the challenge setting. As stated by the author, most of the site will be generated, so that would make supporting it relatively easy, and it can be handed off when the project grows enough. What I lack in the proposal is a plan when this proposal(the documentation) gets voted in but the actual libraries that this docs are written for are not. Maybe it would have been a better idea to bundle this proposal with one of the other two to avoid such a scenario. Just a suggestion for next funding round. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Even thoug there is an extensive list of relative skill, I couldn't find a way to verify them by googling or following the links left in the proposal, which kind of left me a bit wanting for more information regarding the credentials of the person or team or organization that's planning on doing the work. Since there isn't any mention of a team, I suppose it's a one man show.  The budget is stated clearly and it's understandable where the money goes and what it goes into. The provided timeframe, also seems legit to me as a developer who's done something of the sort. There is a clear picture that shows the plan for implementing the documentation and the tools that are going to be used.  The technical aspects of the architecture are prety straight forward, but it would be a good idea IMHO to list them anyway in the future. I don't believe there are any risks for this particular project realization other than what I already mentioned about only this proposal getting funded. I'd recommend for the author to search for like minded developers in the community and colaborate with them for future funds.
