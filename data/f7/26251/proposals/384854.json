An important problem (security) is identified by the proposers and they plan on solving it using the bricks laid in the ecosystem. As a developer I love this. It's clearly stated how this will benefit the cardano ecosystem and it's users in particular. There are clear metrics (one of the few projects that has them) and in sync with the challenge settings. The proposal will be able to scale with future challenges, based on their extensive experience.  There's a need for security now more than ever, and the fact the authors thought of a way to implement something that was already battle tested OAuth.2.0 just speaks to their level of skill and imagination. I have no concerns about the proposal, I recommend to vote for it with all the votes you have. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I managed to verify all the listed credentials in linked in and a few other places, so the proposers are legit and have the know-how available to bring the project to it's success. There are set team members that have collaborated together and have been already funded by the previous round. The budget is straightforward and broken down reasonably. There's a verifiable plan easy to understand and follow as an interested party. A realistic timetable for all the tasks that need to be done and worked on, along with explanation for each one makes for a good proposal. The plan for the implementation is not too technical so anyone can understand it, but it's not too simple so it shows it's value. Resources that would be needed for the implementation are mostly specifications and they're listed in the proposal. The technical aspects are well defined since the proposers are going to implement an already existing standard for authentication more or less. There will be challenges, but the proposers have mentioned them in the the proposal and have thought them through already. The project is in sync with what's already been done and it's ready to build on top of it. I love the proposal, good luck to you and see you at voting!

Being myself a developer and used IdentityServer based openid connect and oauth2.0 authentications/authorisations, i can vouch for this idea 100%.\r\n\r\nThe idea fits in perfectly and might be ground breaking use case for NFTs. Almost everywhere we see right now google/FB etc based oauth mechanisms in place. These companies just provide their implementation of these standards and perhaps control also all the data in many ways.\r\n\r\nAn open source solution like this could open up a new paradigm to web3 or even at web2 and people can finally start seeing diverse use case for NFTs.\r\n\r\nFull points from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From experience perspective i fully trust the team, the team has really good experience with Cardano eco system and also have contributed to developer eco system quite extensively.\r\n\r\nThe team details are public and as can be seen have good professional work experience in software engineering.
