Collaboration with a Japanese community member to provide translation and secondly to also entice engagement, which they have done. One beautiful, critical and worthy note that needs to be put on the spotlight is their mission, distributed governance. Seeing that a prominent Japanese representative who is also deeply entrenched in Cardano is also involved in this proposal, shows with out a doubt the unbias and fair spirit behind this proposal. This proposals statement, '... avoid a few members of the community exercising an excessive amount of control over the process.' is implying something that only the proposers and in-the-loop individuals know of. And to bravely clamp down on this is truly decentralized.
