Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research, and numerical programming capabilities back at my university, not professional experience in the field of software, hence this part of my assesments in this category will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done and my general programming knowledge in mind. The proposal identifies a problem within blockchain which should be solved.\r\nIt clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem, and the key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.\r\n The proposal should be able to scale with the growth of the cardano NFT ecosystem, however this will need regular adjustments, updates and hence more budget. The proposal has an overall potential and a reasonable use case, however it only a very shortly formulated idea and could be explained more thoroughly in order to be able to be assessed for it's effectivity properly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "One of the Co-proposers is according to himself a software developer. According to his github linked, this claim seems reasonable and he might be up to the task.\r\nThe budget only is very coarse-grained and does not give a more detailed rationale for the two positions that are presented there. A budget of 4000$ can suffice to develop an app with low complexity, but not for one with higher complexity, so in order for it to be determined whether the budget is reasonable, a more detailed insight into the fuctionalities and sophistication of its architecture and UX/UI design should be provided. No plan is presented for the case that additional funds will be required.\r\nThe proposer offers a timetable with milestones, that could however be more detailed in order to indicate thath in-depth planning has already been done. Feedback: Put a bit more thought into the details of what you want to do and present it to us in a more clear and step-by step manner. For example the actual app development process should be explained in more detail. In general, technical details are left unexplained, which is a clear requirement for proposals in catalyst, especially in this area, and which would have also provided a more credible picture of the team being up to the task.\r\nIn its current form the proposal can, with a competent developer be implemented, should however have a more sophisticated implementation plan.\r\nChallenges, resources required and all the deeper details are not considered in the proposal. General feedback: Try starting with 1 or 2 proposals next time and make them really sophisticated instead of starting up with seven proposals that are not properly planned. If you are unsure what I mean, take  look at some of the past funded proposal, and how they have a very dedicated and detailed plan, where every factor and every requirement is explained in detail.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A brief roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented.  Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are presented.

Being able to display cNFTs on your smartphone would make sharing and showing assets easily with others and could potentially attract more non-NFT participants. I envision this tool to be akin to having pool.pm/token at the palm of your hands. Unless I am simply being ignorant of existing tools, I do not believe there is such a phone app currently in the wild for either IOS or Android devices. There is a potential for usage to exceed the numbers laid out on the proposal and for the $7000 requested funding, it certainly falls under the remit of this challenge. I strongly agree that this proposal meets the criteria for both Impact and Alignment. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I positively agree to its feasibility but not too strongly, hence I held back the full five-stars. The team's names are published but with no direct links to their bona fides in linkedin.com or other generally accessible sites. Further investigation led to the main proposer Travis' profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/travisyatsko/) who seems to possess the expertise to lead the team in terms of development, project management & marketing. The other named team members, Jia & Ismael, were more difficult to search as their names are more common. Taken at face value, they seem to possess the skillset to develop such an app, which should be relatively easier to build and deploy than a Plutus-based SC. The app would essentially have a back-end which would navigate the complexities of IPFS and display NFTs on the front-end. The roadmap for the first 6 months is described at a high level with an MVP & a v2.0 planned to be released in that time frame. From six months and unto a year is essentially a measure of the KPIs and adoption of the app when it is presumed the marketing activities will start. There is only a high level breakdown for the $7000 requested, split between engineering and marketing. To improve upon the score, I recommend the proposer provide direct links to each member's experience, qualifications & past developments particularly in IOS and Android. They should also provide a more detailed description of what makes up 'engineering' and 'marketing' as these would provide greater confidence that the costings are realistic.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a GitHub presented which could be the main source to audit its progress and development. There's activity starting from Sept of 2021 which the team can build on and present to the Cardano Community and Catalyst. The proposer is also an SPO (ticker: FYTO) and is currently active and minting blocks. This can be another channel to query the project's activities, should it be voted in. I agree there is sufficient info to make this project auditable but it can be improved if the split expenditure between engineering ($4k) and marketing ($3) drills down to a lower level that would make accounting for the expenditure easier. The proposal describes a KPI of 5000 downloads from both IOS and Android after a year. I believe this number is quite low given the value it presents to the cNFT community. Good luck.
