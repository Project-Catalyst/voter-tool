Try to avoid using obscure phrases (especially of technical nature) in the problem statement and in the solution in the future, or at least explain what they mean.\r\nThe solution again confuses me with terms such as \"vanity URL's\" and \"powerful regex search plus \"and\" logic\". Not everyone is a developer unfortunately and most of us struggle with this language.
