Hence, can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In programming specific costs in budgets I draw my knowledge from research but not personal professional experience in the field of IT, hence this part of my assessments in this categeory will be more superficial and more focused on the general budget rationale with the research done in mind. The proposal identifies the problem of the lack of access to finance and provides a viable solution to adress it by providing infrastructure for microfinance utilizations. The topic of microfinance has been discussed by many economists to be a very powerful tool to self-empowered economic development and should be supported. Giving access to microfinance will be both beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem (by providing new markets) and to the borrowing sides, as with it, they will be able to borrow at much lower fees than from local moneylenders. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align well with the topic and I can confidently assess that WADA will be able to scale this proposal, as they are a big, competent organisation, and already from the setup the proposal is quite scalable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.
