For example how Jack plans on structuring his software development effort, will this be using SCRUM, Agile or different approach. Will he be using DevOps pipelines for automated CI?, Where and how will the system will be deployed? For example will he be deploying the system onto a Kubernetes clusters on AWS, or will he just deploy the system on a few Raspberry pi's since this is a PoC. \r\n\r\nFrom the plan it mentions that there will be success if a PoC of a smart contract implemented with a usable frontend.

Aside from this, I also use a diverse range of financial services, including peer to peer lending, which gives me insight into this proposal.\r\nThe problem statement is clearly formulated, but I think it could have benefited from mentioning why having more ADA investing and saving options would be beneficial to Cardano (and then discussing this at length in the detailed plan). I'll expand on this shortly..\r\nThe solution is easy to understand as well, but using the word \"bank\" in the context of crypto is probably not a good idea. Banks are inherently centralized and people come to crypto wanting to escape that kind of danger. If the intended use of the word here is \"fund\", one that would be enabled by a smart contract, then that would have worked better.\r\nOn its face this idea sounds good, but I wonder what the effect on the network would be if you had a safe option to receive higher interest on your ADA than staking it. People would naturally gravitate toward that and unless the staking rewards rate can be adjusted (I'm not sure they can be), then the network would become less secure as less people were incentivized to stake.\r\nMy next question is, how would users receive higher than 5% interest on their ADA just by depositing it in this \"bank\"? I understand from the plan that the user would have to approve loans manually (again, depending on the scale of the project, this is not feasible - most P2P lending platforms have an autoinvest feature to avoid cash drag, or uninvested funds). Interest for loans can be a lot higher than 5%, but it is important to distinguish between that and interest on a deposit.\r\nThe rest of the plan is very basic as well: the proposer himself admits there is no way to make this fully decentralized, which does not sound exactly good for the \"Seeding Cardano's Grassroots DeFi\" challenge. To be fair, however, we are in the early stages of DeFi and many applications still have a certain degree of centralization, perhaps this could be improved in the future.\r\nDue to the lack of clarity on how this will add value to Cardano and the plan in general, as described above, as well as the fact that no metrics and clear goals have been discussed here, I don't feel very confident that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

It makes it more verifiable. Please consider adding this in future proposals.\r\nIdeally, the budget should have been broken down into an estimation of the cost of separate tasks (with the cost per hour mentioned). This again helps people see that the project has been thoroughly planned and the team is taking a systematic approach working on it.\r\nAside from this, the proposal is also missing risk analysis (as I mentioned above, what happens if this turns out to be a bad idea for the health of the ecosystem actually?) and details on the planned technical approach.
