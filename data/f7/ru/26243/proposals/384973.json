However the explanation for how it can bring value to Cardano is vague at best.  What about the idea will onboard those who are outside of the crypto environment, as well as those already using the linked platforms on Ethereum?  This proposal idea definitely falls within the specifications of the challenge, but again the KPI's and goals are vague and do not provide much of a \"how?\"  It also mentions goals of scaling up to more exchange members as time goes on but there is no explanation provided for how the project plans to do that either.

Based on the roadmap it is unclear whether a team has even been established yet.  The requested budget seems to only be enough to propel the proposal through step 1 of the road map (paying the team through March to write the technical document.)  What is your plan for additional funding past that point?  How much additional funding will the project require?  Will the project use social media, a token sale, VC funding, etc?  As stated above, there is very little clarification on \"how\" any of the roadmap milestones are to be accomplished.  I am also curious what type of obstacles the project has ahead of it in order to successfully penetrate such markets as the Vietnam real estate market and others, both legally and politically.

Each goal provides flexibility on when it is to be completed with a wide range of completion dates.  However that can also be viewed as a lack of knowledge on how long each goal will/should take.  The main goal for success of this challenge is to have four Defi dapps launched on Cardano in 2022.  Based on the roadmap this proposal will not be set to launch until early to mid 2023.  The roadmap also states that membership is to be grown leading up to test-net and into main-net but does not provide details on how the community will be grown.
