Even though I agree that introducing new concepts to a new user in their own language increases the likelihood of that person joining the community, before I will agree that this proposal is in line with what this challenge seeks, I would like to understand the precise details of the proposed path to ensure that a new user is added to the community as a result of the consumption of this translated material. Although the impact metrics associated with the challenge are presented, it is not clear to me how to ensure transparency in that regard. The proposed solution is aligned with the F7 challenge: Multilingual resources. \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal is written by Maria Carmo 369, who has a YouTube channel with a substantial number of subscribers (12,900), therefore, I would consider her compliant based on her skills and experience.

In spite of this, I must say that I frequently employ translation services due to the nature of my job, and these are normally quoted on a per word basis, which would enable me to make a more accurate estimate. As a Latino and having the pleasure of having many Brazilian friends, I have been able to get to know the good and the bad of Brazil's culture. In explaining this, I am telling the proposer that an hourly rate of $30 is much higher than what is paid in the market. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Lastly, and in line with the previous point, the data necessary for carrying out a complete evaluation of the auditability of the proposal are not included in the proposal.
