No success objectives or KPIs were provided. The proposal is fairly simple to understand but it would have been good to know more on the success metrics side where the cut off is for translations. For instance this proposal could fund three months of keeping translations up to date and we expect to request further funding after that. Or perhaps instead we don't expect the documentation to change much and this will be the only proposal we need so this proposal covers 12 months and that information can help form some of the success measures or KPIs.
