Sure, it can be one of the reasons there's a lack of regulation but there can be plenty of other reasons it can happen, especially when involving lobby from the current bank system that might lose profit with decentralized currencies (or other fiscal and monetary risks to governmentsa). In order to verify whether this problem statement (simple misguidance/lack of knowledge) is true, it would be nice to bring some evidence based on reasearches, articles, specialized papers, news and so on. The way it is written it seems to be just an assumption, which, in case not true, might compromise the whole project.\r\nHaving said that, and assumining the problem statement is true, I also see the solution, with 'short workshops', as way too simple to solve a problem this complex.
