I live in Brazil and I can confirm that the consumption of these contents are huge and, in other hand, the content creators are always complaining about the monetization algorithm and currency variations. \r\nThat said, I think that having another platform which uses an \"international\" money with a fair pricing and payment methods may impact.\r\n\r\nHowever, my concern is about the overall adoption: 1) There must be an special attention in the user experience of the platform.

How would this allow to offerusers the same quality or similar for the service as big players?
