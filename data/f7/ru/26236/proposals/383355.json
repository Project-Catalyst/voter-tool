It will only be applied to short intra-round projects. I have two key worries. 1) It will perpetuate any bias already exhibited in voting patterns. 2) it will potentially be subject to adversarial attacks to get into the top projects, though this is mitigated by using actual voters to make final decisions. Whilst not cheap, this is the sort of project that could have a substantial impact if successfully implemented. Voters and reviewers time is a limited resource, and this project uses it sparingly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has good experience and a well presented idea. As stated above I'd like to see some effort put into managing the issues of bias and the process being exploited by adversarial actors. There is always the risk of failure, but the project could be transformative  and I believe has a good chance of producing something useful. The methodology selected by the proposer is well used in the ML community and there is every reason to expect it can be applied here.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A detailed project plan has been presented against which progress can be audited. It would be good to see some plans for testing of the accuracy of the selected projects.

The author clearly explains the concepts and process behind the implementation and provides confident answers to the key metrics that the Challenge is looking for such as if it is faster, scalable, transparent and impactful. It is clear by reading the proposal that the author has analyzed the requirements of the Challenge and developed a novel idea to create impact. It is important to note that the project is the development of a MVP prototype with the execution of a one pass sample of rapid funding projects that ends with the evaluation of results and adjustments.

The proposed system is all but simple since it involves not only the design of a system but also a matching algorithm based on pair-wise comparisons. As I'm an artificial enthusiast with advanced knowledge on the technology, I've read the project carefully to better understand the process. I have no doubt that the author has come out with an unconventional solution and has provided lots of details in explaining the theoretical concepts, the risks, the needs (i.e. datasets), budget associated with breakdown, project timelines and even answers to common technical and organizational questions. Although the project is complex and the budget is high, I consider that the project deserves the highest ranking on feasibility based on the information provided.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal includes a well detailed plan with timelines with a clear description of what the outcome of the project will be. Since the budget is large, the author provides an estimate of the efforts distributed in ten areas. He also mentioned that it is the best estimate based on his experience, and I can validate that the numbers look correct as approximations. The project plan also provides milestones to track progress and metrics to measure performance and success that are well defined within the scope of the Challenge. A list of well defined deliverables is also provided such as datasets, open source code and algorithm and the final demo.
