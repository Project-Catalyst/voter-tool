Improving user experience is a large part of what will help push crypto mainstream by letting people more easily interact with the DApps and services being built in the ecosystem. The proposal solution looks to further help within the ecosystem by helping educate developers on the technology involved. With both end users and developers potentially benefiting from this work there is a high chance the proposal could have a great impact in the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Three team members are listed in the proposal all with their LinkedIn profiles added. There is experience from Emurgo a core organisation within the Cardano ecosystem and the main developer behind GameChanger which is an established wallet in the community. It is clear the team has the technical expertise and experience to execute against the proposal outlined. The budget breakdown is basic with little details added however the requested funds are also low so this is of minor concern. The key features and goals of this proposal are detailed and the timeline given sounds realistic given the teams experience.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is clear with explanations on the current ecosystem around the PAB and how those factors influence the execution of this proposal. Relevant KPIs have been added. The main area for improvement would be around the work being open source and a Github repository for the work that has been implemented.
