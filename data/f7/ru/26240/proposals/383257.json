Without being more concrete, my first instinct is to disagree, because I tend to only pay for services from verified providers with good reviews and I very rarely have issues as a result. If this proposal is only about home repairs and maintenance service providers as alluded to in the solution, then that should be stated clearly in the problem statement. If I understand this correctly however, it intends to be a sort of Trustpilot app, but for home repair service providers, which sounds like a good idea. I kind of expect there to already be an application for this purpose however, and I see no mention of market research in the proposal. A quick Google search gave me this result for Canada: https://homestars.com/. I'm sure USA and most developed countries have several similar applications as well.\r\nThe detailed plan of the proposal is too sparse in my opinion. It mentions the features this DApp would have, but does not give any reason for why this would have to operate using blockchain technology. In order to learn how this would help our ecosystem grow, I think we would need to hear details about its unique, blockchain enabled features (e.g. certificates / ratings that are hosted on Cardano and cannot be altered etc). \r\nDue to the lack of details in the plan and the fact that no metrics are mentioned, I have to disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has stated that they have more than 20 years of experience in training and education, plus access to developers familiar with blockchain technology, but no credentials have been provided to back this up. Please note that it has become a standard for proposals to have such information in them (LinkedIn profiles, other social media accounts, websites etc). This is crypto and unfortunately, anyone can just say anything. We need proof to be able to verify the claims that are made.\r\nThe budget is not small at $30k (for a Catalyst proposal), but considering how many features the application plans to have, it is extremely unlikely in my opinion that it can be done with just this money. I say that because I work in the software development domain and creating an app of this sort will take 3-6 months at the minimum with a team of about 10 professional developers. Assuming just $2k per person, per month, this would add up to over 60k for only 3 months. I would also suggest that next time you do the budget breakdown in the proposal itself, not in an attached document, as voters reading your proposal might have trouble downloading your files and viewing them. Due to the concerns I mentioned above and the fact that there is no risk analysis here for what is a moderately complex project, I have to strongly disagree that this proposal has a high chance of being implemented successfully.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As described in the sections above, I got an idea of what the proposal wants to do, but there is no clear detailed explanation of how it will be done and how progress along the way will be measured.
