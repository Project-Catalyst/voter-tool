Furthermore, there is a strong understanding behind the tokenomics that will drive this idea. \r\nIn order to improve this proposal going forward it would be beneficial to have a deep-dive into how the proposal aims to improve the existing system and how it works in practice.  This would potentially look like unpacking the comment around 'democratising healthcare' [insurance] and how you plan to do this. The practicalities around \"is this parametric\" or \"what type of data sources from oracles will you use\" are some important questions that have not been answered and doesn't allow the community have confidence that this doesn't just remain as an idea.

Further, the proposal would also benefit from having a clearer budget breakdown in terms of why the figures amount to what is requested and how it plans to achieve the set goals. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the proposal that appears to be lacking is a breakdown of the risks associated to the project. Are there any tokenomic risks such as incentivising agents to provide liqudity or selling insurance policies? Any development risks using the new smart contract functionalities? Any risks associated to sourcing the right data oracles? Unpacking even a few of these emerging risks would have highlighted a deeper recognition and maturity of the project difficulties and challenges.
