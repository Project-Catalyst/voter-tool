Currently smart contracts in Cardano have no standard design pattern for upgradability which is problematic for DAOs or dApps in-testing. The problem is not exclusive in Cardano, even Ethereum does not have standard for smart contract upgradability. In my opinion the team's idea has excellent potential to improve Cardano ecosystem and be a great help for developer community. As a smart contract developer, I also encounter the upgradability problem. The standard for smart contract upgradability means DAOs and DApps could have more flexibility for improving their system.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As ex-Emurgo and ex-IOHK employees, team members have relevant experience and significant network in the Cardano development that could boost the likelihood of project success.
