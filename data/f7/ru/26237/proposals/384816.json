The only thing I miss in this area is that the proposer has not mentioned possible difficulties and how to deal with them (e.g. difficulties in adoption of the tools/API\u2026) The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. The scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it's convincing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This team explaines very well how and what they will build on a timeline. Also provided key performance indicators, some that will be measured using github. They provide a tool that will benefit Dapp creation for DOAs.
