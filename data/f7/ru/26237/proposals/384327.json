The Proposal is well aligned to the challenge's purpose and provides an effective and impactful solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I do fully agree that the Team brings the needed experience and qualification and surely strong skills and a very committed engagement which is needed to successfully implement this proposal.

DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. The proposal adresses a clear problem, the complicated regulatory framework in the EU regarding DAOs and supranational organisations in general, as both EU-specific and nation-specific regulations need to be considered. Providing a blueprint framework for DAOs to deal with these regulatory challenges seems both reasonable and very effective, and since it will facilitate the forming of DAOs within the EU it will sure be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem.
