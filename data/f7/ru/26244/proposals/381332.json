It is evident that the team has put considerable effort, strategy, and knowledge into its making. Here, it is argued that the majority of projects in Africa avoid integrating with Cardano because of the difficult growth curve involved in using Plutus. In order to address this challenge, it is proposed to use the Wada hub to implement a strategy to train developers using a project-based curriculum. Of all the solutions presented, the one that I believe best addresses this problem is the third one where meetings will be held to enable developers and entrepreneurs in the area to network with one another. Both the strategic objective and the success metrics of this proposal are aligned with the objectives of the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team proposes an implementation plan divided into seven phases, in which the first phase is dedicated to developing the curriculum and training the trainers, and culminates in a consolidation phase, where all the knowledge gained during the project is applied in preparation for the next strategic phase: expansion. An in-depth description of the project members is provided, however no references are cited to verify them. Furthermore, the WADA partnership is considered a strong element, however, the name of the contact person(s) of this organization who will provide support for implementation of this proposal is not provided. This budget is divided into seven identifiable items, which allows one to clearly understand the logic used to request the final amount. Finally, I would like to express a concern that I have. The proposal team has 10 proposals in this catalyst cycle and most of the proposals mention the same people. While some of them complement this proposal (which I believe to be totally valid), I identify other risks that should have been identified, analyzed, and addressed. It would have been useful to explain, for example, how will people assigned to these projects be allocated and controlled in order to minimize the risk of delay in the proposed schedule due to dispersion of work. \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides all the necessary information needed to conduct a thorough auditability assessment, along with a roadmap that offers sufficient information to understand the implementation process.
