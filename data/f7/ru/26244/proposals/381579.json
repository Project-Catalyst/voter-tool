This proposal aims to integrate Cardano further in that city to make the city 'smarter' by introducing CNFT-based product tracing. This could make Cardano's presence in Yoshinogawa more visible and accelerate community influx. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This project's previous phase has been funded in Fund 6. This is a follow-up proposal expanding on the community hub that was established then. They have expressed a desire to expand the project's reach beyond one city, further indicating a successful previous phase. One minor concern in the proposal is that you aim only one product as a pilot instead of expanding the reach with several products. This might be an improvement to consider as it can provide you with data faster.

The proposer should separate the activities (NFT use case should be on its own way as it requires a DApp build or at least a platform when the NFTs can be used as required) and make a clear statement about the project direction.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge Brief says \"Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding\" and the proposer should follow this path and build something to achieve the set goals.\r\n\r\nIf the proposal goal is to deliver presentation materials to the community, then it follows the challenge objectives, if it is something more complex to deliver, then the proposal should ne rephrased and presented in a more appropriate campaign.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer already has a proposal from Fund6 that was funded and is on its way success thus the experience for assembling meeting is covered.
