Proposers are a crucial Catalyst stakeholder, and this proposal attempts to address a concern mentioned in Catalyst Circle. It is designed to address this demand by establishing a \"Community Hub\" on Gitbook where users may leave feedback and report issues. However, I must admit that I am having difficulty finding a direct link between this proposal and the goal of this challenge. There is a partial alignment for me because because it attempts to strengthen Catalyst's relationship with this vital community.
