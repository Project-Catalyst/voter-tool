I think that the creation of a device that helps communities get connected is a must, but they failed to mention how this can encourage mass adoption and bring value to the cardano ecosystem. Nevertheless, I think that, with some creativity, the proposers can include cardano into the device in order to add value to the ecosystem. My suggestion for the proposer is to write a better proposal with the cardano ecosystem in mind.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have provided relevant skills and experiences with links to their github.

The roadmap is broken down into understandable items. Based only on my intuition, I think that the prices and the budgets are reasonable. A detailed plan of what  they intend to build and how they plan to achieve it is also disclosed in this proposal. Nevertheless, I would suggest to the proposers, to add the challenges and risks they consider upon successful implementation. Apart from that, I believe that the project can be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has provided a roadmap and reasonable milestones to reach their goals.
