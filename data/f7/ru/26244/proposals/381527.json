In my opinion, they present a fairly generic solution, but with a lot of potential given the profile of people attending Oxford; therefore, I agree with the alignment of the mission of the proposal with what they are looking for in this challenge. Based on a quick analysis of the success metrics presented, I believe that they are appropriate. One concern I have is that the team estimates they will retain one third of those who attend the community events proposed, and from my experience the retention percentage is usually much lower. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team presents a description of its skills and experience, as well as references that can be used to verify them. This budget is broken down into identifiable line items, and sufficient information is provided to understand how the final amount requested was determined. The team presents a simple but effective plan that explains what it is proposing to do in order to bring this proposal to fruition. There is only one element that I consider important for this type of proposal that was not included, and that is the identification of potential barriers or risks to the success of the proposal. It would have been helpful if the team had addressed latent risks such as the dropout rate and presented counter proposals to address them. It would also have been helpful if the details of the curriculum of the educational program had been provided. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Lastly, the team does a good job of outlining their roadmap in three, six, and twelve months, outlining not only milestones but also success metrics. Both of which seem to be appropriate and incorporate everything that the team seeks to accomplish. In my opinion, one element that is missing from this type of proposal, that occurs in the \"real world\", is the consideration of improving transparency in the execution of the actions over the entirety of the implementation period. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 7, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposer wants to create a local hub that attracts programmers in Oxford university. I think that students are a really good  audience to target as their youth, their desire to conquer , and their energy are needed to build this ecosystem. These students will be introduced to the plutus and to the haskell programming language. The end goal is to grow the developper army in the cardano ecosystem. I think that this can have a great impact in the community. Furthermore, speaking about value, some of these students will certainly join the catalyst program where they can submit proposals, work as CA or VCA. Altogether, I have a positive note on the impact that this proposal will have in the cardano ecosystem, and I think that it should be able to scale in future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided evidence of relevant skills  (linkedin profiles) of the team members. The number of the team members are disclosed in the proposal. The budget has been broken down, and based on my sole intuition, I think that it is reasonable. However the proposer didn't outline a plan if additional funding is needed. Although it's not a make or break thing, I recommande to the proposer to consider adding a plan for future funds. \r\nApart from that, the proposer has done a good job by providing a comprehensible timetable to complete the work. Altogether, the proposer is clear on what the project is all about. The plan shows clearly what is being built and all the resources necessary to achieve the goal. However, the proposer didn't consider in this proposal, the challenges and risks that they may face relevant to a successful implementation. Other than that, I believe highly  in the feasibility of this proposal.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is auditable based on the information provided. The proposer has included a roadmap and milestone that can help track the progress of the project.

And with a bang. Would not have started with that problem statement though :). Adoption through education is key. Cardano is not just undermarketed brand wise, their technology is also not well-known, add to that nature of Haskell that many view as an unpopular and difficult language. Though in actuality this language is used by various widely know entities such as Microsoft, Kaspersky Labs etc, By aligning with this proposal, it is a natural setup. Oxford, who till this day is still viewed as the congregation of the brightest minds 'deserves' the brightest technology. Cardano is that brightest technology with an even brighter humanitarian mission. These proposers are smack in the middle of the wealth of intelligence that Cardano can benefit from. Supporting theses proposers will introduce Cardano to the future developers. From a CA perspective, of the 5 (five) metrics provided in the Challenge, these proposer and their proposal fits 4 (four). To my fellow CA's and vCA's, please 5-star them. We need them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have meticulously stated their experiences and backgrounds. One has a background in leading student bodies, one is prominent in digital strategy and business development, one is a deep understanding of blockchain and to round it off, one has interest in using technology to support social needs. Of the 4 (four) three have provided their LinkedIn links. This is an A-Team who will most likely implement their proposal successfully. Budget is broken down in detail with simple action plans adjoining to them. Though through this budget, a question does pop-up, the need to provide stipends to persuade the students to believe in the mission that is Cardano. I do understand that they are not there for Cardano, they are there to learn from Oxford. Although that's sad to hear that it boils down to that, it is gamble that we the community should take. Implementation plan is also clear and are accompanied with rationale, including the rationale of providing stipends. There is one part of their implementation plan I 100% believe in, partnering with the Oxford student societies. These proposers are pragmatic, a trait of future start-up founders, in their approach and being so usually yields results. Their rationale of partnering with student societies is spot on. Unfortunately though, they have not accounted for the risk and challenge they might be facing in during the duration of this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a clear roadmap with milestones and additional action plans here and there, although it is jumbled together with the KPI's. Of the KPI's the can has been identified a large majority of them are measurable. Making this proposal on the easier side to audit.

Definitely up to the challenge and seemingly scalable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent seems to have enough knowledge and experience to create content as good as he is suggesting. The recommended group consists of 4 members, 3 out of 4 have provided LinkedIn to easily verify their authority. Besides, each person's abilities are rich, so they can complement each other. Further proof that I am confident in the feasibility of the proposal is that the team has a Fund6 winner on three proposals and community advisors.\r\n This is a very interesting idea, I believe they will be easy to implement because according to the description, the proponents are all students of the prestigious Oxford school, so it is easy to attract the attention of people. Other students come to Cardano by creating a scholarship that will help students invest more time and effort into learning more about the ecosystem to make their application more powerful. It would be great if the proposal anticipates the risks that may be encountered in implementing this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap and key metrics have been presented that allow the success of the proposal to be assessed and monitored.
