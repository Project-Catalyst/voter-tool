The fashion industry has become increasingly interested in sustainable production, so this proposal is of great interest to me, as it would attract the community part of society, which is very distant from blockchain technology in general.

With respect to the budget, it is divided into four identifiable components, however, a better job could have been done with regard to the detail described. For example, I find a range of $5000 to $10,000 per event to be quite broad. The assessment becomes even more difficult if data on the size of these events is not provided. Another example would be the allocation of $13000 to NFT development; in this case, additional information such as the number of developers which are to be hired and their estimated time of development should also be included. The author should also provide a description of an implementation plan. It is vital that the community understands what needs to be done to ensure success of this proposal.
