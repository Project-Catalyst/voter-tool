This knowledge and my knowledge about mission driven stakepools enables me to provide valuable insights for this challenge. The proposal identifies a legitimate problem, the lack off accessibility to creating a stakepool, the legal difficulties with it and the resulting increasing centralisation of stakepools. By providing a solution that facilitates becoming an SPO within local regulations, the proposal can have a lot of positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem by fostering decentralisation. Hence, the key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings\r\nand the proposal will help with future scalability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DLT360 has so far shown (with their proposal from F6 they currently govern) that they are a serious and competent project partner for catalyst.
