How do you plan to install on the node and server that will use your solution?

The benefit of this is for the node operator to be able to increase their awareness of potential issues, get remote access to status updates without accessing their local machine and to add custom alerts that may be relevant. The easier that it becomes for people to run their own stake pool the more decentralized the ecosystem can become with higher confidence levels of good node operation. If executed well this proposal could have a high impact for node operators.\r\n\r\nA useful service for SPOs also can turn into a re-occurring business model which aligns well with the challenge brief of creating new opportunities in the space that are economically viable.
