LinkedIn of all members would be helpful. Also, a link to the consultancy company would be helpful, and specific some related work and success stories will add more value.

What is the budget required for it and what will be the activities? As a mentor for startups, I saw many plans and this one seems a bit generalized. Having more details is important. The budget is detailed but it is not clear for how long it will be sufficient and more detailed info will be helpful. Also the main budget item will be used as a treasury for the stake pool?
