So first the human problem needs to be solved and that entails the core question: 'Who decides what is just?' \r\nDoing research on this topic, gathering as much datasets as possible and creating think tanks is definitely a step in the right direction.

However, the field is already a very broad and diverse area of study, with extensive research available, and this proposal attempts to address AI ethics more broadly than seems realistic. Proposed deliverables including outreach to scholars, development of videos, building of datasets for ethical AI (not clear what this means -- datasets are highly specific to particular AI application), case studies and workshops, but without specifics about what will be delivered in each of these areas. So while there is relevance to the challenge brief, there is insufficient specificity to articulate a useful project.\r\n\r\nThere is also a fairly limited articulated connection to SingularityNet other than to say that this is a \"teachable moment\" for Cardano and SingularityNet -- apparently meaning that they need to be told about ethics. I agree with that in principle, but again more specificity is needed.\r\n\r\nThis proposal gives the impression of having been put together without careful thought on specifics. This team is submitting a large number of proposals in Fund 7 -- some of them are significantly better on specificity than this one, which may have received less careful attention.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of focus and specificity, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Although the team on this proposal plainly has experience related to AI ethics, the lack of specificity in this proposal makes it hard to conclude that it is highly likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully. \r\n\r\nFor example, as mentioned above, it is not clear how the team would create \"machine learning datasets for ethical AI\".
