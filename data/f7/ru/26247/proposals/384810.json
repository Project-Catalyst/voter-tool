I am not sure it is tractable. In the end though this proposal is basically asking for $500 to write a proposal. Whilst its a tiny request, I am not sure this is the sort of thing we want to fund. On a wider note, Catalyst may well spend that much just compensating CA's and vCA's to review this proposal.
