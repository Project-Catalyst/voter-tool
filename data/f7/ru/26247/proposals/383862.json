It basically enables anyone to become an SPO, even without hardware and thus effectively rewrites the SPO function within the ecosystem.

This is a great opportunity to increase the robustness of both ecosystems. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very experienced with Dr. Kabir Veitas, the NuNet CEO as the teamleader.
