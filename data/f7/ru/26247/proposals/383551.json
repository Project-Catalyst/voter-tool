As stated above this proposal is lacking in details of what will be done. All we have to go on is it will be used to hire 4 back-end developers and bring forward from Q3 in the original proposal to Q2 the AI Model to anticipate improvement in the Character's AI, and deliver a final model of the characters AI in Q3.

This accelerates adoption significantly, especially if it brings about an innovation, like in this case an (almost) new genre of gaming.

The player has to accept the fact that he is not in total control and that brings a new facet to the entire experience.

I do not know enough about gaming to predict whether this is likely to be of interest to gamers, but it is certainly innovative.\r\n\r\nHowever, the challenge brief relates specifically to creating engagement between Cardano and SingularityNet, and this proposal does not mention SingularityNet at all. There may be good connections to SingularityNet in this innovative idea, but the proposal does not mention them. The proposal also does not address the alternative guiding question of the challenge of how AI can benefit society.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I like the idea, but because of the lack of connection to the challenge brief I neither agree nor disagree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Victor Corcino appears to have AI-related expertise sufficient to manage this project, and the explicit goal of the project is to hire additional people who can deliver the AI / \"artificial brains\" functions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the proposal is not very specific about what these functions will be (the only description is \"fighting and advanced surviving mechanisms\"). Therefore, it is difficult to tell what specifically would be implemented and I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n\r\nTaking another angle on the same point, AI is challenging for this type of application (I lead an AI start-up), and very clear goals are needed to achieve success. Given that the budget here is only $24,000, there should be narrower and more specific goals about what is intended to be achieved.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Given the lack of detail on specific AI capabilities being built (as noted in the above \"feasibility\" comments), it appears very difficult to audit the success of this proposal.
