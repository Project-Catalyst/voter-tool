Budget will go to  one single developer. They don't seek funds for themselves, just the one extra developer they need. 9 weeks to complete the project seems realistic. They explain the different stages in their development process and also state what is being built, like documentation, interfaces and models. They know what is needed to build this and even mention the type of testing they need to do. This project will be a typescript SDK that other developers can use for their projects. They don't mention any risks or challenges, but they added 2 extra weeks to development for the unexpected.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap of 7 weeks with clear milestones have been provided. They have 4 measurable KPIs. One more KPI that comes to mind is how many people use your SDK and even how many commits or pull requests you get at certain points in time. The more KPIs you ad the easier it is to measure performance and progress of your project. It is clear that they want to solve the problem of an easy way for a developer to integrate their project with all the DEXs on Cardano. They solve this by building an open source SDK for developers to use. If implemented successfully this comes with a lot of extra benefits for the ecosystem as well as the developers.

However, it is important that DeFi projects have good accessability and also enable to bank the unbanked instead of just beeing an elitist project. I have done some personal research on both DeFi and microlending especially with a focus on Global and social justice and hope to bring in a valuable perspective on accessability for poorer people with my reviews in this challenge. The proposal excellently identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved and provides a solution for it that will add quite some value to the Cardano ecosystem, especially by increasing accessibility with an open source concept. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings really well and show the proposer has understood the challenge.\r\n The proposal is not just able to scale to address future challenges, it actually increases scalability in the whole area.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are well-known in the Catalyst community and are competent and up to the task. They have already successfully delivered to other proposals and have shown that they are trustworthy and their proposals are deliverable. This shows without a doubt that they know, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is simple and reasonable to achieve the set goals.No plans regarding the need for additional funding are indicated, but since the organisation already has some other projects and thus most likely also liquidity, that should not be a problem.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic and detailed timetable to complete the work.\r\nThe proposal provides a well-made plan for implementation that shows what exactly is being done and how.\r\n The plan describes the necessary resources as well as the technical aspects well, which shows the proposers have a good grasp of the subject.
