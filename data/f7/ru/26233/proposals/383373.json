Thus this proposal only focused on what was achievable in the first 3 to 6 months, for which funding form catalyst 7 and 8 would be approached. Once the team has a product (and the suggested one for first use was BTS), the strategy for adoption and acquisition would be addressed with a clearer idea. Regardless, there was some insight as to offering this product to stake pools as the first step in integration to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nAuditability: I agree that there is a need for this level of detail regarding KPI and measurable goals in the medium to long term. However the goal setting and KPI's that were addressed in this proposal focused on the core development of the product. As this project is at its start. Therefore measurable goals for the development of the product/project could be reviewed before testnet/mainnet deployment, for which (i agree) signups and tie-in with DEX's would be addressed.
