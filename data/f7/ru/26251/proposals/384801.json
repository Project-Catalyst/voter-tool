I am having difficulty placing this effort in any of the directions suggested by the challenge team: developing common tools as libraries or containerized services, incentive system for developing & hosting common open source utility's, common audited repositories, organising events to bring open source communities together, defining common standards. The different direction here might be excused if the solution was using open source utilities and hosting structures. Centralizing around one operator (yourself) and one gcloud provider proprietary spirit doesn't jive too well with the spirit of open [source]. \r\n\r\nI recommend that you join up with https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/385065-48088, the kustomize-dandelion, effort,  an already live api. You can run a server, and get paid to it! ps. I currently have no affiliation with the dadelion team. The community can benefit from diverse services with different apis, but in the context of developing \"Open Source Developer Ecosystem\" this proposal can be strengthen by moving in a less centralized direction, in terms of operations and technologies deployed. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "That there's already a working prototype, there's hope of a successful implementation. What the team is proposing is a central service to serve a large portion of the community that can result in 10s if not 100s of millions of requests.

The proposal identifies a stake pool operator problem rather than an ecosystem problem, but nevertheless it fits the challenge setting. The proposal will benefit SPOs which will cut costs by sharing the database state and enabling more complicated query functionality. A couple of questions come to mind: Aren't we a a comunity striving towards the decentralization? Will regular users be afected if only the SPOs use this shared database synced once a day instead of multiple times? There are some key metrics mentioned about costs to maintain an SPO, alongside with more convinient queries in BigQuery fit for the challenge. The proposal will be able to scale because BigQuery is made for scale and ease of usage, because it's centralized which allows for easy scaling. What I'm missing as a developer is an explanation about how will this affect the SPO active delegators, and what the impact would be on them.  I'm concerned on how voters would react to a proposal that strives toward centralization to cut costs, without obvious benefits for the regular cardano community member. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It would be great if the proposer left his linked in account to be able to verify all the skills listed in the proposal. As a developer myself I wouldn't say the proposal is complicated so I'm sure he'll be able to do it, it's more of a problem concerning the scalability trilema. You have scalability-decentralization-security and you can only choose two of them. In this case we're leaning toward scalability-security without decentralization. Keeping in mind the idea of the cardano ecosystem is to be decentralized this is in opposition with the cardano way. It is also true that it would be better to have many SPOs instead of few, so there are pros and cons either way. Only the requested budget is shown without a breakdown or explanation why the cost is as stated. I'd suggest an hourly rate or specifict tasks that need to happen alongside an hourly rateand a cost estimation for each one based on how long will it take. There's a 3 month timetable, but I don't have the competence to know if this time is sensible so I'll defer to the authors estimation. There seems to be a sensible plan for implementation of the project. There is a file with estimated cost of running a pool, but there is no comparison with the current cost of running and BQ given the same conditions apply. The author assumes a 50% increase in users every six months for 2 years, but I haven't seen argumentation for this assumption anywhere. The proposal explains what will technically happen, but doesn't touch on the impact for the community and this is one of the requirements for a good proposal.   Overall I think everyone has the right to choose how to run their SPO and if voters want to help him cut those costs it's the community decision which is fine by me.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There's an issue with funds tracability. There seems to be no way for the community to follow the progress of the implementation of this project, which is concerning. There's no mention of a place or a group where the status of the project (if implemented) will be posted or shared. KPIs could be better, and a measure of success could be the positive impact for the users if any. Roadmap could be a bit more concrete, but overall there are separated tasks per months.

I completely agree with the fact that as Cardano blockchain grows, it needs to utilize more robust solutions to its condition. \r\n\r\nETH and BTC are much larger ecosystems, thus taking examples from them can be a way to go. \r\n\r\nAlso, this proposal would be beneficial to all users of blockchain, as a regular holder or SPO which could result in more attractive environment for newcomers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I find the proposal in accordance with the challenge goal.\r\n\r\nRating given 5.

Part of the proposal let us think that the latter would embed strict parameters (e.g. 24h data import interval). A mitigation is proposed to fork and redeploy the code to fit other needs. In that scenario, the economical and operational value of this solution would greatly diminish, even more if a large part of the audience doesn't fit in the set criteria. Providing options and flexibility to cover as many use cases as possible would make this solution stronger.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is unclear how the proposer will maximise awareness and usage.

It is also positive to see that the budget factors in the future blockchain growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, there a number of concerns and inconsistencies in the proposal.\r\n\r\nFirst, the proposer did not provide any profile links or detailed skillset to help cross-validate fit. The size of the core team is also unclear. Even more confusing, there is reference of the need to hire additional developers but that is vague and not reflected in the requested budget. A clear list of the core team member(s), their skillset and the additional roles required and budgeted would drastically help build trust in this proposal. \r\n\r\nSecond, it is unclear who will own, maintain and operate the solution during the two year of operations that have been proposed. Build and operational costs seem to be missing from the budget description. Adding budget allocation, and separating costs by development, infrastructure and operations would guarantee ownership, uptime and that there are no hidden charges and everything has been well thought about.\r\n\r\nFinally, the budget requested is around 44k USD, more than a fifth of the total challenge allocation, and includes 3 months of development and 2 years of operations. The proposer also projects to create a stake pool after the 2 years have passed to bring a new revenue stream and reach economic sustainability.
