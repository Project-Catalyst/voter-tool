I fail to see how will this project impact the cardano system in any way since there's no mention of how this project is related to it. A suggestion I have for the proposers is to do what other game designers have done already, which is to do an integration with the blockchain like NFTs giving you the ability to interracti with the game and such. There is a problem to be solved there, but it needs to be related in some way to the cardano developer ecosystem. I'm sure this game can add value to the cardano ecosystem, I'm just struggling to see it, maybe they missed to mention that part by mistake. The proposal is a bit off the original challenge settings. Future challenges could be a way to intertwine the game with the cardano blockchain like unity did for instance. As a developer I would be interested in helping the proposal if they provide me with a clear way or a github repo and good documentation to do so. This proposal could bring a lot of untapped potential to the ecosystem, but not in it's current form. My concern as a developer, is that this is a really good opportunity which will be missed, so I want to encourage the authors to rethink their proposal so it's more feasable for the next funding round. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposers added relevant experience, and I'm sure it's valid, but unfortunately there was no way for me to verify their stated skills because no relevant links containing some kind of credentials and projects they've already done. The proposer sure has the skill to develop such an engine, since he's been doin it for over a year. There's a link to the projects github, and it's a serious open souce game engine, which already has some contributions by interested parties. Because of that, I believe they have the skills necessary to do the job, just because it's aparent in the way the proposal is made, they have the skill required. They have a clear understanding of the manpower that this project will take along with the time. The budget could have a better break down, because the only thing clear is that they need 9000 dollars fork which is doable. The timetable I'd say is realistic considering they already have experience in the field. There is somewhat outlined plan of execution and technical implementation details. The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.   The project could be more in sync with what's already been done in the cardano system. I'd suggest they take a look at other crypto games and take ideas from them on how can they integrate the proposal to better fit the challenge settings.

Lacking KPIs and expectations from the end result once everything planned has been implemented. I didn't find any specific metrics and KPIs for the project, so my suggestion would be to add adoption rate and other relevant metrics to monitor their success in future funds. The roadmap with milestones is set and it's relatively clear where it all leads. There's a clear description of the trgetet problem, even though the problem is not really related to the cardano ecosystem right now.  With the risk of being too critycal I'd ask the proposers to look at their proposal with the eyes of a voter. That will allow them to see what the community wants and expects from any game and how there's an expectation to grow the cardano family with more gamers and people interested in doing things togethrer.

This tool could provide tremendous value in short and long term for content producers in the Cardano ecosystem and simplify many development pipelines. Lots of Dapps, especially in the game and NFT sector, will need a tool like that, although the software is neither blockchain specific nor Cardano specific. It still aligns with the challenge, as it provides a viable + FOSS solution for them. Successful funding could attract new users of Godot to Cardano, as ProtonGraph is one of the more famous extensions for Godot, which is the biggest open source game engine.

This can still be done if you dive into the links provided at the end of the proposal to another proposal + github, and confirm that the proposers are also part of another team that was already funded (Educhainment), where sufficient identifiable information is provided. This should have been included in the original proposal.\r\nThe budget equates to a wage of $15 per hour, which is unreasonable for full stack and UX devs. This shows their will to successfully fulfill the proposal, but they could have asked for more budget. \r\nThe software relies on Godot 4 which is currently under development, with major changes/enhancements being made compared to the previous version of the engine.
