They do however provide Github links so if anyone needs more technical information they can find it in the Github links.

Down the road there might be staking and related daps available in ledger live. There's a clear goal to open source the integration with ledger live, which makes this proposal fit the challenge it's in. There's a clear message about the value that will be added to the cardano ecosystem through: employing valued members of the community, strenghtening trust and relations between the community and ledger live, bringing a significatnt codebase to be open sourced, used and developed by everyone interested and capable. They've chosen to Send / Receive and Synch ADA accounts on Ledger Live Desktop and Ledger Live Mobile as a phase 1 of the proposal and the indicators if that is done will be evident inapplications. Keeping in mind the teama sitting behind this proposal I have no doubt that they will be able to scale and face any of the mentioned challenges.  What's missing in the ecosystem right now are big companies collaborating with the community. This project is a perfect first step to bring the community closer to the providers of hardware wallets.

It isn't transparent enough where the funds will be going and the calculation made in order to come up with the stated required funds. Nevertheless there's a realistic timetable to complete the first phase of the work without an issue. The technical part of the explanation isn't described, but if anyone is interested there are links in the proposal with the codebase which will be used in relation to the integration. So if anyone is interested, there are link to dig though. It's described what resources will be necessary to implement the proposal, but again I wished they were a bit more specific on the technical side of things.  The considered risk are relevant, but it's always better when you're prepared.  Overall a good proposal, I wish you the best of luck! And may the community be with you!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One thing I'm not worried about after reading the proposal is the tracability of the project. The authors took special care to list several ways to interact and to enable a channel allowing them to listen to the community. There are discord channels as well as regular AMA meetings. KPIs are missing but not exactly. Since there will be a github repository anyone interested would be able to see the implementation progress being done in there. The roadmap not only for this solution but for future funding rounds and ideas are also presented in this proposal, which is nice because it allows the people to see the way the proposal isheaded.

The phase-wise implementation strategy and a moderate amount of groundwork add more weightage to the feasibility criteria.
