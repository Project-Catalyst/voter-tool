It would have been beneficial to ad more metrics to the proposal.

KPI's weren't mentioned in the proposal and a metric like Usability / downloads per month / linked projects using their infrastructure would have been nice. My recommendation would be to focus on the KPIs as much as they have on the technical part of the proposal, because it's equaly important IMHO. The roadmap is quite clear and the time they've chosen will work out based on what they have already achieved with funding from the previous funds. There is a clear solution to the problem, which is important when you take on such a big challenge.  One suggestion I want to make is for the proposer to put themselves in the shoes of a non-tech-savvy person and read through their proposal, because it's quite hard to read and understand by an every-day-joe.
