There is a reason to believe that promoting diversity on a regional level can be more effective (have higher ROI) because of the ability to adapt to local languages and cultures. \r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point because this initiaitve supports only one of three strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of alternative approaches to prove that focus on this user segment can bring high ROI to the community.\r\nMy rating is 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Catalyst community is definitely capable of bringing in new contributors and including them into its processes - the growth of the community from fund to fund is a clear indicator of that.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the proposal would be stronger if it provided a detailed analysis of the problem (which particular segments are underrepresented) and discussed recent success stories vision helping to undestand the impact and necessary funding to make a noticeable impact..\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of an analysis of the problem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal defines metrics (the number of new users, engagement, new communities, languages, etc.) that can track some progress.\r\n\r\nAt the same time those metrics are insufficient to track the progress towards fully solving the problem.

It would be important to frame these and to define diversity (even if loosely) if we want to define good measures of success. I note that this challenge will intersect a lot in terms of it's goals with existing challenge such \"Grow LATAM, Grow Cardano\", \"Multilingual resources\", \"Scale-up community Hubs\", etc and fostering to diverse cultures is already covered by these. Saying this, i'm certain that there are many communities, specially under-privileged ones that we could do more to outreach too, and this is where i see this challenge having a positive impact.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A lot of the issues regarding \"lack of diversity\" are often structural and that will not be easy for the community to change or influence by itself. Note that Project Catalyst is an open platform, that anyone can join, so the challenge will be one of outreach and helping under-privileged (communities with lack of access to IT infrastructure). Saying this we have lots of good examples of funded proposals that aimed at tackling these issues, so the community has already demonstrated it is ready for it.      ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Some of the metrics are not very relevant or measurable. For example how do you measure the number of new users onboarded into Cardano ? Also simply measuring the numbers of users or Catalyst community members added is not a measure of diversity. \r\nThe number of new communities/countries/languages added to the conversation will also be hard to measure. Unless we start asking people for there cultural background information (which i don't think we can do) the only metrics i can think off would be to survey the community how on diverse they think the ecosystem is, or some material metrics such Number of people provided with IT access.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_125", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 7, "ng": 15, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge seeks to bring in many new groups of people which is critical to achieving Cardano's mission.
