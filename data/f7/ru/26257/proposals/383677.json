However, it does not go into the details to:\r\n1) provide an overview of specific cases with historical examples that lead to lower participation.\r\n2) analyze alternative solutions to the same problem.\r\n3) present a cost/benefit analysis suggesting that the chosen solution is the optimal one, etc.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this proposal would be stronger if it spent more time to precisely and with examples define the issues of the current system and to formulate a call for proposed solutions from the community instead of defining a solution itself.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of the problem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discusion about the relative size of the use cases and their importance for Cardano ecosystem.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a clear analysis of alternative approaches.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Implementing the proposed experiment with multi-round selection is simple.\r\n\r\nThe only blocker that I can see is that the software we use right now (Idea Scale, etc.) might not have the needed  functionality yet.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific analysis of the problem and key use cases.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\nMy rating is 3.\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The defined metric (unique voting wallets) can help track progress.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this single metric is not sufficient to:\r\n1) Understand the incremental contribution of this specific challenge to the growth of voting wallets.
