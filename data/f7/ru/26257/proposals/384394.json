The reason for that is that Project Catalyst is the key influencer of funding for all of the initiatives in the ecosystem. Without the ability to effectively organize and scale the work of community advisors, the Catalyst process can break. Moreover, with each fund Project Catalyst intends to onboard and integrate the more and more contributors. \r\nEven though that Catalyst scales rewards for the CA community proportional to the budget, the tools that CAs and VCAs use might not scale that well, creating a lot of frustration and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nOut of my personal experience as a CA, the community needs better tools to support the process and scale it to the new highs.\r\n\r\nMy rating is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst community has many talented developers, moreover the CA community is skilled to provide feedback and name the opportunities for improvement.
