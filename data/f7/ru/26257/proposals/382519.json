For example, by solicitng proposals for building a Caradno-based crowd-funding / donation platform that can affect all kinds of socially-oriented projects.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 2 points because this initiative does not support any of the strategic goals of Fund 8.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discusion about the relative size of the use cases and their importance for Cardano ecosystem.\r\nMy rating is 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Since the primary support needed from the community is funding, Catalyst can definitely provide some.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, because the objective is to fund income-generating projects and fight poverty, the proposal would be stronger if it provided an overview of recent success-stories in this area to clarify if the funds requested ($250k) are sufficient to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\n\r\nIn addition, providing an vision how blockhain-based solutions could have a higher impact on this problem.\r\n\r\nI have made the following deductions:\r\n- 1 point for the lack of a discussion about the sufficiency of the requested funds to achieve a noticeable impact.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of specific use cases that need to be addressed.\r\n- 1 point for the lack of vision how specifcly blockchain/cardano can help beyond funding.\r\nMy rating is 2.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal defines metrics (the number of countries engaged, the number of communities impacted, etc.).\r\n\r\nHowever, they do not have the capacity to track the impact with regards to the underlying problem specified: povetry.
