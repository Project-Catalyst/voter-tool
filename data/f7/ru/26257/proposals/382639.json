I have seen new members getting onboarded that are totally unprepared and have to learn so much before becoming suitable and valuable members in their respective roles. This slows down the process not just for them, but to the people directly around them as they are the ones that have to do the educating. It is good to educate those around you, but it would be more productive if someone took care of that before hand and you can all focus on the task at hand. This challenge setting is also perfectly in line with the strategic goals of Fund 8 in the sense of preparing people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst community is extremely helpful and kind to each other. They have been onboarding new members every Fund, so it is not something new to them and they know how to help and where to point if someone needs resources.

There is a team behind this challenge and if they take ownership on its approval this Challenge setting will be efficient from the get go.
