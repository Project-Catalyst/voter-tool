The project is very well substantiated with calculations done by specialized people.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The creators have a reliable background as climate scientists, environmental and computer engineers. They have the expertise needed for this project. They are currently actively working on this project. The proposal has enough evidence to support their project.

From the proposal description it is clear that the proponents are aware of the difficulty and risks of the task at hand. However, given their perfect expertise and qualifications, and especially the very small budget they are requesting as of now to begin this crucial work,  I would wholeheartedly entrust them with my confidence for this high risk high reward undertaking. One thing which can mitigate the risk would be to find other external experts / dedicated groups / organizations who can evaluate the resulted methodology and eventually contribute to its further improvement. In my opinion this work is absolutely necessary, but it is only a beginning and it will take several iterations to make it into a useful tool that I anticipate will evolve along years to come.
