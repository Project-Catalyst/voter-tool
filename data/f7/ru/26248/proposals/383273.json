As a suggestion for improvement, the problem could be better described by bringing facts, examples, or any information that goes beyond the proposer's own statements. That is, back it up with external information. \r\nThe proposal brings a project that is virtually able to be scaled, although it lacks quality in the ability to be audited and executed (these criteria were considered in the other two parts of the assessment and not here).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The activities and milestones are detailed enough and the proposer has given access to a demo-view of the exchange. Apparently, the technical skills are fulfilled and this is not an issue. \r\n\r\nHowever, according to what is presented in the proposal, marketing, networking, crowdfunding, and campaigns are essential to make the proposal feasible. But in the budgeting, in the talent acquisition, or in the relevant experience, no information was given to show that the proposal is fulfilling this big part of the project. Therefore, the proposal is underestimating this aspect of its own. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "By having presented a 4-year proposal, the proposal is not well detailed in a way that the community can make sure it will achieve the milestones. In addition, the milestones and activities in each stage of the platform are putting the expectations too high without backing up the reader or evaluator with information about the market. As a CA, I suggest that the proposer would be more successful if he/she can provide information such as market research, studies indicating the potential growth of an exchange in the mentioned context, or any proof that he/she can achieve at least part of the key steps that will lead the exchange to where is being pointed.

The proposal identifies a general problem which needs to be solved; The access to finance and DeFi solutions legitimately is a problem in some countries. \r\nThe proposal describes how it will add value to the Crypto space in African countries, however the relation to Cardano could be defined a bit better. If the exchange is implemented correctly and manages to acquire sufficient liquidity, it will be able to scale to future challenges.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is very transparent about his background and seems competent and up to the task. He provides proof that he already has done some of the neccesary work. It is highly likely that he is up to the challenge. The proposer knows, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is outlined clearly, broken down into identifiable items and seems resonable for the set challenge. No plan however is made for the case that the proposer needs additional funding. The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work and also a time horizon ahead of the typical 12-month milestones.\r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how.\r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal in an identifiable manner.", "q1r": 5, "q2": " A detailed roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement is presented.\r\nMetrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are presented.\r\nThe problem and the solution statement are well-defined and reasonable.
