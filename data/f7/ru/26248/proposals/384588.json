Given that some of them are very ambitious - including securing a deal with a world-class company and create a new standard for product authentication - I would appreciate more detail to conceptualize the full product journey and thus better understand the competitive advantage that the complete system could have over other existing solutions in the market (such as VeChain). A flowchart on the interactions of the solution with other devices, mockups of the desired look and feel, or even prototypes of what the NFQ tag might look like, could help CA's and voters better understand the vision of what this project is trying to achieve.\r\nTo conclude, should this proposal get funding I recommend following up jointly with the sister proposal under the \"Dapps and Integrations\" challenge, as the former cannot live without the latter. \r\nHowever, if only the Dapp is funded, it could be integrated with other widely established solutions such as those mentioned in this proposal (QR codes, barcodes, etc.).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It seems to me that auditing the progress of this initiative will be challenging as the intermediate steps of the major milestones need to be much more detailed.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the project objectives are very broad, but the criteria for measuring success are not sufficiently clear.\r\nI also found it difficult to validate the background and expertise of the Paystars proposed key partner, as I could not find any information online about their previous ventures.\r\nI understand that the funding requested here covers only the most initial aspects of the development, but that is why I consider that the project would benefit from a much more detailed business plan, establishing more detailed goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_883", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We decided to split the proposals because of the nature and divide from completely software and the hardware that serves as a foundation. These are two distinct ideas that couldn't be properly represented in one single proposal. In the same regard, if we get one proposal funded and not the other, the development of the system could go on. If we put all our eggs in one very competetive basket, a failure of the proposal would mean no funding at all from Catalyst. Therefore the Misc Challenge is where our hardware proposal was placed to mitigate risks and to better represent that aspect of our system. For the assessor to knock points off because of how they felt about that decision isn't very objective.\nOur aquisition and roadmap are complimented by the detailed plan to provide the steps needed to get to our 12 month goals. We don't have a perfect understanding of how this will work until we get into the devolopment. Therefore, we cannot provide exact specifics without the risk of giving too short ranged of information that is still very malleable and flexible. I agree with the desire to have a mockup of the system and proof of concept videos and such, but we are simply not at that stage of development yet. Our monopoly section should provide understanding of our advantage on the hardware aspect.\nAs this is our first proposal, the roadmap goals of 3 and 6 months are our best understanding of what and when needs completed to accomplish our goal with how it is related to this Catalyst funding. Since this is still in the very early developing stage, the order of development of specific functions has not yet been finalized. To overpromise and underdeliver because another function's development happens first or is drawn out over several months is not very plausible and would be misleading to Catalyst and the community. Our goals are stated along with the expected timeline of development. When this project is funded we can supply a more broken down progress map as our understanding of necessary order will be much better at that time. That being said, at the moment of writing an accurate monthly breakdown is not possible based on our current understanding, planning, and nature of the project.
