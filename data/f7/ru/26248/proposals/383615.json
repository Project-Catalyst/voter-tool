The proposal is also well structured with clear problem statement and solutions.\r\n\r\nAs further suggestions, I'd include the initial launch date planned for the final version of platform (at least the year it is intended to be made available for broader public), not just the MVP. Its hard to know by the proposal when the final desired outcome will be ready and the impact to the community would be brought. It seems theres still a lot of work to do and start with a resaarch is great.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear also how the plataform itselfwould be self sustainable in financial terms. Will it depend of funding or for a long  time ? will there be ads on it? or would it be charging small fees in the transactions?
