Since this is on the Miscellaneous challenge, I would agree that it fit into the challenge. The solution focuses on growth and sustainability-oriented content which might have limited Impact to the wider community. The MVP phase 1 focuses only on posting content as a blog, I would love to see the technical details of how this will incorporate NFT to the blog post and what differentiate it from normal blog post.\nIn phase 1 , The team proposed at least one post a week ,one page for live online classes , What happens if there is a need to post more NFT enabled Content.\nI am concerned about the scalability of the Platform.

As I understood, the idea is to create something similar with a social media but based on NFT technology. The whole point here is that you dont need NFT to create these platforms. Moreover, the main feaures highlighted in the general plan sections are available already in facebook and other social media, as sharing texts and asking quistions and platforms for commercializing NFT already exists. It also suggest it would be similar to blogs but it is not  the content it will be posted. There are just vague terms as \"inspiring texts\" - what is inspiring for the proposal?\nAlso, it is mentioned that the contents (as posts) will be turned into NFT and auctionted. As visual arts, texts could also be NFTs, of course, but it would be important to assess beforehand if theres indeed a market for it. If we think in real life, visual arts (as paintings, portrayts) have their values for being unique - and rare- but texts not - as they are printable anywhere. So, in order to validate this premise, and hence, the project, the potential of NFT texts  generating revenue should be brought in the proposal.\n\nAs a suggestion of potential application for NFT in texts, purchased books and course/traning materials, handouts could be turned into NFT to avoid piracy.\n\nAlthough some features as a in-app marketplace for NFT auction and wallter integration might be useful, separated already consolidated platforms for these purpose will likely offer a better service and interaction as they are dedicated to it and have already a established number of users.\n\n\nIn general, the idea of turning texts and contents in NFTs is valid and having a platform for it would be good but their commercial value should be validated beforehand (like a business plan).
