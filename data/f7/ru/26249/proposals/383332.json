In addition to this, I have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal presents a great application to facilitate the development of dAPPS and empower citizen developers. It matches the challenge great. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.
