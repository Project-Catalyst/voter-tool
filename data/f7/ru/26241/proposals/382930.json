Create a game that allows gamers to both play the game and be profitable in the long run.\r\nThe proposers of leveraging Cardano Native Tokens to build a game experience where people can use their wallets to participate in the game are called MechVerse. MechVerse:Origin is a base-building strategy game (Like Rimworld, Factorio and Stardew Valley) inspired in space embedded exploration with Functional NFTs.\r\nThey have built a community of over 1000 members.
