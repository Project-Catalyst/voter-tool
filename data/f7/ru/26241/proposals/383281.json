The more detail in the roadmap the easier on audit and we love it more than a roadmap with just a few headlines without detail. Or the team can explain more about the roadmap in another part of the proposal then just summary it again. Of course, the key metrics must be fitted with the challenge given as first, if not it's failed from impact assessment. \r\nOne more thing is the team must describe how they are aware of the problem context by detailed explaining it, then detailing the solution that must address those problems.
