The game has almost every component that an MMORPG should have. One interesting idea I like about this game is that it makes changes for each season with respect to the balance of items available. In this way, I think we can control the flow of the items, and also create situations that require players to keep track of the new information during different seasons and spend more time engaging in the game. The other elements regarding the monsters, the potions, the armor, the sorcery, the storyline, and so forth are quite old but still can be considered. However, on the other side, there is a point that I am still concerned about this game is that how can it gain attraction from people. Though the elements of this game are good, they aren't new. There are many similar or even better games that currently dominate the market. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Honestly, I don't have much hope for the success of this game. Though the basic elements of the game are presented, I still don't see any points or strategies in promoting this game that can compete against other similar games in the current market. The idea of decentralizing the creation of gaming assets is intriguing, but I need more than just that. I need more information about another game that give players the choice to specialize in a craft or explore the realm as an adventurer discovering the rare materials for the crafters.

There still exist some vague points of the game that need more clarity. For example, how can we calculate the ranking scale or the rarity of the objects made by different players? Why Metahagane is called a trading card game but has no mention of cards in the description? I know this game is new, but it's also because the game is too new that I don't have sufficient information to fully assess the success of this proposal.
