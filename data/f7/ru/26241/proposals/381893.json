First let me say that the nature of a metaverse has a game like nature that will get people accustom to other games that will use metaverse style tech. This game is projecting ar and vr tech as well as land through nft's and other aspects of crypto gaming that are still early. A quote from Charles Hoskinson I took from the proposals website is as follows the way this proposal's successful implementation would align with the challenge is as follows. To make a great on chain gaming ecosystem we will we need many proof of concepts along the way especially when it comes to anything related to vr and ar. This proposal is creating a proof of concept that is scalable by creating a \"Virtual Real Estate Game which creates a detailed digital earth with billions of property boundaries that can be reg. with NTF Deeds\". This game will be creating many proof of concepts that we don't currently have and that's why to me the roi on 10 k they are requesting will be through the proof of concepts we get from this game and team building this game.

I would have liked to see a more detailed breakdown of how the 10 k would be used. This would help to picture the progress and timelines of the completeness of the game. I would encourage the team to add more timelines and a more in-depth plan on how the funding would be used to score higher in this section of the review.

Now the end product is also somewhat unclear in regards to what it will look like. I would have appreciated maybe an info graph or sketch to give us a better depiction of what the game will look like so we can hold the proposer accountable for the design as well.
