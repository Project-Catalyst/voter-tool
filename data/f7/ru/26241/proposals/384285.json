The proposer also knows the required manpower to successfully complete the project. Moreover, the budget breakdown were outlined clearly into identifiable terms. The budget required is also reasonable to achieve the goals. Furthermore, this proposal also offers realistic timeframe to complete the work. However the proposer did not mention the technical expects of the game. What engine will the metaverse be built on? What technology will be used on creating the metaverse? Please elaborate.
