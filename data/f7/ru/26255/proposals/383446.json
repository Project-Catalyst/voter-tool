This proposal will bring previously funded proposals into a competition with huge exposure and the chance to win significant funding for expansion.

The cost plan is available on high level and could benefit from additional information who is receiving the funds, and e.g. where the campaign, marketing & pr activities are planned. The channels are mentioned and a mapping from resource to channel to budget would bring it on an even higher level. The requested amount is below the value package.
