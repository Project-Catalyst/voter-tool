Its not clear putting all the challenges eggs into one basket for an unproven new accelerator focused in one location is a good idea. A key measure of the campaign brief is \"Distribution of programmes across the world to serve different audiences\". For instance 2 competing proposal by established accelerator SeedStars for a 1/3 of the challenge funds in total would cover both Africa and emerging markets. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The two key proposers have experience in the accelerator and start-up space, however its not clear they have the experience to set up a new one from scratch. The budget breakdown is relatively with the $500k they are after broken down into pretty course buckets. It is hard to give this a highly likely to succeed rating given, especially given other projects which have been proposed by teams already running accelerators and for fractions of the cost. It doesn't seem like a great idea to put the whole amount available for the challenge to one group looking to set up a new entity.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal a clear set of deliverables and time lines against which progress could be audited.

Just not sure how easy it is to pull of this plan should there be a bear market. The website (new.tech) cannot be reached. It almost feels like the team didn't have time to finalize the plan.

That is what the team should have focused on. I don't think it's the best use of the Treasury money to fund the high Norwegian salaries and legal fees.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of legal matters, knowing the regulators' stance on security tokens, this bit makes me uneasy: \"Newcoins will be distributed by new.tech to startups in exchange for ownership in their respective equity and/or tokens.\" When you do re-submit your proposal, make sure you have finalized the model so that it won't be torpedoed by the SEC and the likes.

Vision, value proposition and marked need is outlined detailed. The approach starting with 'newcoins via ISPO' is outlined and should be broken down into more details. The success metrics in a 3-months timeframe look impressive and are highly ambitious. Working in the VC-area for 5+ years I know how hard it is the 'first money'. It would be helpful to add the 'why' to multiple topics. E.g. why Oslo, why 10-100M, $1B market cap, 100 countries, \u2026 The cost is broken down to a very high level. It would be very helpful if we could get more information in which timeframe you need how much money in order to achieve xyz and what is the benefit for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The market approach became very clear to me. I did not understand at what stage (pre/post Catalyst) the new.tech circular accelerator helps our community. The audibility for the high level plan remains pretty open as we do not learn about how (in much more details) the team is going to achieve the targets. \r\nWhat remains open is the benefit for the Cardano ecosystem. In an updated version it would be great if you could elaborate on how to fuel Catalyst funded projects. Especially the budget topic is more than bold and unrealistic watching the behaviour in previous funds.
