The team knows how Catalyst funding works and it is understandable that they have adapted their approach into many small proposals. This, however, doesn't leave a very good impression because most of the text is copy-pasted and finding \"the beef\" in individual proposals is difficult. Although this feedback might sound overly critical I must stress that the team seems to be on top of their game and will create value in the Cardano ecosystem. The sums asked are modest and none of this sounds like ill-willed money grab.\r\n\r\nThe Challenge brief asks: \"How can Catalyst harness professional firepower to bootstrap an accelerator environment that amplifies and commercializes funded projects?\" The team wants to \"establish & maintain a systematic application portfolio assessment as input to the community's professional portfolio management\". If I interpret this correctly, the idea is to make the already funded projects more visible and encourage collaboration to create synergies between them. Could be worth a shot. Worth $25K? Maybe not.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As the team states it, none of the proposals have a detailed plan but only an \"orientational overview-listing\". Hopefully in Fund8 there is more funding available and these can be combined into one proposal. Furthermore, expecting the CAs to book \"on-demand MIRO sessions\" with the team is not realistic. To visualize their plans, the team could have used slides, PDFs, images etc as attachments. Even an explanatory video would have been a good addition. Lastly, each proposal refers the reader to the website that is supposed to have the most up-to-date information but, unfortunately, it is largely work-in-progress. All this makes me wonder: did the team bite more than it can chew?\r\n\r\nYeah, again, if the team has time to do all this, they can probably do what they have planned. Rather than starting everything from scratch, however, perhaps they could collaborate with \"Built on Cardano\" (https://builtoncardano.com/).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Targeted problem: \"Catalyst triggered hundreds of projects, many developing in silo-mode. This leads to substantial redundancies & lack of strategic alignment\". Solution seems to be improve the already funded \"Risk & Opportunity Radar\" somehow. Does that address the problem? Maybe. The metrics are again based on the team's own reporting (0-100%) and a Net Promoter Score of the final presentation.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "It is great to have a proposal to assess catalyst project portfolio. It does have several projects divided in silos that dont talk to each other and ideascale strucuture doesnty contribuite for any overall pipeline strategy assement.\r\nThis assessment can be used to evalaute next funds and potentially suggest or supress future challenges.\r\n\r\nI missed here, however, more details on the framkework/canvas that will be used in the \"Risk & Opportunity Radar\". I tried to look in the website provided but theres one picture about it and its a bit vague. It will be good to have some examples of the possible outputs and what conclusions could be drawn from it. Also, what  kind of actions, in terms of portfolio alignment/prioritization, would be recomended? What dimensions/parameters/properties of the projcts would be analyzed/considered in terms of risk and opportunities ?\r\n\r\nMoreover, I wonder if this kind of assesment will only be done once, for the current active projects or if it will be a live thing, updated with frequency as new projcts are funded and others are concluded/discontinued. If the final outcome of this project is good but not easily replicable due to tool limitation (idea scale) it would be imporatn to consider in the future a project/portfolio management tool adequate for this real time analsys.\r\n\r\nLast, there are a lot of vague terms in the proposal that makes it difficult to assess its potential. For instance, \"Interaction with relevant projects and partners\", what is relevant  for the proposer? \"inter-disciplinary perspective\", what disciplines are considered here? \"quality checking\", what is quality in this context?\r\nThere are lot of information about the \"big picture\" (set of 3 proosals together) but not enough of this specific project.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I see a great potential here, as this kind of portfolio assessment is much needed, and a very well sctrucutred proposal, but the core of it still lacks information or is not so easily understable.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Theres a qualified committed team, though some back office resources still need to be hired. This team already lead funded proposals in F6 so I gues it is capable to run this project. There are links to verify the qualifications of all.\r\n\r\nThe plan is sensible and time-framed which is really good. Budget breakdown is well done and clear.\r\n\r\nOne point concern regarding feasibility as a whole is how the data aquisicition of these 2 steps below will be done, in terms of whether it will be directly with project leaders or with catalyst/idea scale. I wonder this because I\"m not sure hot easy is to get these kind of projects data\r\n\r\n\"Interaction with relevant projects and partners\r\nIn-depth analysis of the Cardano Application Portfolio (existing and from innovation pipeline) and of the application landscape outside Cardano\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are good milestones and kpis to audit the projct.
