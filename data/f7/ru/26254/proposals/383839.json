This proposal addresses an important interoperability problem by working towards the creation of a clear standard in the State of California.

We should first separate out the overall impact of the project this proposer is representing, vs the actual intent of the funding of this proposal.  The project itself is an essential part of the future of crypto, and by association, Cardano:  Informed draft legislation that can transfer between jurisdictions to inform lawmakers is best designed by crypto participants, particularly participants in forward looking chains like Cardano.  To this end, the proposal suggests a $40k 'buy-in' from Catalyst in exchange for a seat on their internal committee that specifically addresses DID issues.  This would be an opportunity for Catalyst to have input, but would require Catalyst to deliver a solution to how that seat at the table is occupied.  Assign a member of the community?  A sentiment aggregating DAO?  Recurring vote?  The onus for satisfying this criteria would be on the Catalyst Community, jeopardizing the ability to actually influence much early on in the input process, or to be a meaningful participant once the actual push to move the proposed legislation through legislative bodies is undertaken.  What role would Catalyst have beyond the scope of the first year proposed in the timeline?  What role will this committee (and Catalyst's place in it) have if the legislation successfully creates a Working Group?  The impact of this team's larger project on Cardano has the potential to be immense, but it is unclear how this proposal helps it reach that potential.  ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team (blockadvocacy.org) behind this proposal seems well organized with voices representing the crypto space, especially in the areas of DID and privacy.  Their legal strengths are not apparent, however they claim to have moved legislation through CA congress before (AB-2004, the establishment of a previous Working Group in regards to medical/VC).  The budget for the proposal is unclear, as it does not align with the proposal funding and has confusing line items (Organizing/Advocacy/Coalition Building Costs- 75k?) that should probably be broken down into more specific outlays.  The budget total of $245k is not reconciled with the proposal funding of $40k, so there is no way to assess the feasibility of where the $40k is being applied.  The roadmap also makes any deliverables unclear:  is the goal the establishment of the working group, the creation of draft legislation for state committee review, or Catalyst input on how to create that draft legislation?  A lot more details beyond just a previous success would help assess the merit of this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a confusing aspect to this proposal in terms of auditability:  if Catalyst does have a seat at the table of this organization's DID committee, then it should be presumed that that seat would entail knowledge and oversight of the process being undertaken by this org.  However, how is Catalyst expected to occupy that seat?  As a DAO, as the proposal suggests, how would metrics be returned to the community?  If an assigned or voted-in member, what information would they have the ability to share from this committee?  The vague nature of the proposal really comes home to roost in this auditing stage:  if the proposal is one thing, it might be highly transparent and accountable; if it is the other thing, there is almost nothing specific to measure or deliver on. To improve clarity and auditability, the best approach may be to revisit the structure of the problem/solution provided under impact, and make sure the request, down to milestones and funding, represent best what is being asked of Catalyst.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "re: Feasibility: Our \"legal strengths are not apparent\". We have Leslie Katz from Clark hill as our legal counsel, the head of their blockhchain law practice. I also don't think this review understands the distinction between policy and law, which is fairly common. I'm a policy expert, not a legal one. We get bills passed, lawyers argue about them after. The legislation which is attached suggests a working group composition meant to directly give influence to stakeholders from the tech community, and we will lobby for the best people to be selected. This reviewer is asking good questions but doesn't have the context for the rulemaking process.\n\nreAuditability: The political process for passing a bill is actually quite transparent. It's a public one. We would update the community at each inflection point and the committee members are involved in all stages of the  process.

"}, {"q0": "The problem statement is clear and so is the proposed solution. The impact of the project is high. California is the largest economy in the united states and is home to a large portion of the blockchain industry. Rules passed in California are likely to be adopted in most other states and rules passed in the US generally will influence the world. One of the main stated goals of this challenge is to get trust frameworks established and this proposal aims to do just that. The team brings receipts so to speak. They have an already formed and active advocacy group lobbying and getting results in California. The plan to give Catalyst a committee seat on their board is also very interesting and would ensure that the community has a say in future activities of this group. Therefore, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides a clear roadmap as to the legislative steps required to accomplish their goal. The team has presented bills to the California government and have led these efforts successfully. The feasibility of getting any bill through is always a bit speculative but the approach here is certainly the most often used and proven effective. The combination of lobbying and maintaining a pool of domain experts who can speak to government panels on behalf of our community is likely the best possible way to attack this problem and this is what is proposed. Draft language for the proposed bill was included which is nice to see. Overall here the goal seems to be to get our foot in the door to then try to guide the working group which would get formed. I think that is a reasonable goal and well worth the requested funds. The only reason I was not able to give a perfect score to this section is due to a lack of clarity around the requested funds and the full budget of the proposal. The full budget of the proposal far exceeds the requested funds and it is not explained how the team will get the rest of the money or why they only requested 40K from the community. One would assume that an experienced team like this has other revenue streams but unfortunately having to assume here is not ideal. On the whole, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Overall the metrics here are very straight forward and easily verified since they are a matter of public record.
