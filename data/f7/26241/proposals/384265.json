Aside from that, I\u2019ve been a gamer my entire life and I\u2019ve also worked as a game tester, so I know a bit about the industry.\nWhile the problem statement does not so much identify a problem, as it points out a few things gamers like, we can understand that the proposal aims to create a Free to play and Play to earn game which would give players a lot of control over their in-game assets, allow them to earn NFT\u2019s and also donate to charity. As feedback to the proposer on this part: if you use acronyms in the opening statement of the proposal, explain what the terms means shortly after. Do not expect voters to know these terms as many of them will not be gamers and some will generally not be very tech savvy. Also, later on in the proposal, it is mentioned that the funds here are needed to create the MVP for the game. This should have been mentioned in the solution in my opinion, so as not to confuse people into thinking that the expected output here is the full game.\nThe short run-down of the project as outlined in the Game Overview section is that it will be a battle royale chess card game (see Might & Magic Chess Royale for a comparison), where people play against each other to earn XP (the use of XP is not detailed), pirate gold (which can be used to buy in-game chests, which, when opened, give you a combination WOPRace tokens, NFT cards or other in-game assets). As far as I understand, these tokens will be used my players, along with WOP tokens (which can only be bought with ADA / fiat) to then vote on the direction of the game in the DAO which will be established later on. The developers also plan to make this game AR compatible to be played outdoors with phones.\nI agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, since what we\u2019re looking for here are good games to bring people in the Cardano ecosystem. I cannot give 5 stars however, because the proposal has not talked about what the success metrics are, nor what the MVP will look like exactly and what the plans to scale in the future are. There are a few words in the white paper about long-term sustainability, but these focus on the fact that the game is Free to Play and are rather vague. I would have expected to see concrete projections for the following months / years.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided a link to the project\u2019s site (https://worldofpirates.io), but it\u2019s kind of empty, to be honest. The names and roles of the 5 team members can be seen in the crew (/contact) section, but these do not provide any information that is not already mentioned in the proposal (role and past experience). Try to add some social links in the future please, so that anyone can verify these are real people easily. I\u2019m sad to say that I personally reported a different proposal here in Ideascale, because it claimed some people worked for them that did not (I reached out to them on LinkedIn and they confirmed it).\nAside from this, another important part that is missing is information on how this project will be completed. We do not have a step by step roadmap, nor a timeline with expected results after 3-6-12 months. Please note that the https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap page you point to is blank. You also mention that you have sold some NFT\u2019s and donated them to a charity, but the link you point to for details is also blank: https://www.worldofpirates.io/potm. \nThe lack of all this information I presented above, as well as no mention of any possible risks or impediments to the project severely lowers my confidence in the feasibility of the project. \nThe only part which has a bit more details is the budget, which is calculated for the following 3 months (how long the proposers consider it will take for them to create the MVP). The numbers here seem credible enough, if a bit high ($4000 per month per developer and 3000 per month per sales person, for a total of $53000 in salaries, while only $1200 is estimated for ads costs). After also adding up the costs with the infrastructure, the total sums up to $60000. Again, these are credible numbers, but a bit high in my opinion for an indie project which is looking to get started. I understand the people in the team have a lot of experience, but you might want to consider looking for extra funding sources as well, since I\u2019m not sure if Catalyst alone can cover all you need from fund to fund.\nTo recap feasibility, the proposers did not provide links to verify the team\u2019s experience, several links on their site which they refer to are just blank pages, there is no roadmap or timelines except for the mention that the MVP will take 3 months to complete and I feel that the budget is quite high for such a short amount of time for an indie project. Based on the above data, I disagree that this proposal is likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As described above, the proposal is clear enough in that it wants to create an MVP for a Free to Play battle royale chess card game, but it lacks a lot of details on how it will do that. In the future, please add details about what the approach will be and what the deliverables are at certain intervals (try to think of a timeline for your project with milestones for the 3, 6 and 12 month marks). Also, for projects to be auditable, you need more detailed Key Progress Indicators. At the moment, the proposal only mentions that after going live with your socials pages on 04.12.2021, you got 300 members on Discord, 100 followers on Twitter etc, but Project Catalyst needs to be able to track your progress in the future. For that purpose, it would have helped to set clear targets, like for example: \u201c1000 Twitter followers after a month from the first ad campaign, 60% of minted NFT\u2019s sold after the MVP is released, one youtube video per month tracking the update of the project etc\u201d.\nBottom line, this proposal has a lot of ambition, it seems quite clear from the white paper that the team has put a lot of effort into this idea and I do think that if they managed to get the snowball going they have a shot at success, but lots of important pieces of information that Catalyst needs are missing, as I\u2019ve outlined above. \nAt the moment, I neither agree nor disagree that the information here is sufficient to audit the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 15, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Overall, this proposal addresses the challenge posed.

About our website, we currently focus on the characters, universe and the NFT part, but the website is a creature itself and it will evolve in the next months once we will focus more on the game MVP and next versions this will be reflected in the website too."}, {"q0": "This proposal is very well presented both in ideascale and in the recent ideafest presentation. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the theme and gameplay through Free and Pay-2-earn scenarios, but also how best to utilise the blockchain functionality , incorporating NFT trading, NFT creation & an off chain DAO for artists. There are multiple avenues into this game so should appeal to a large demographic thus aligning with the key objectives of the challenge. More user, transitions, games on Cardano.\nInterest is already being shown. 100 twitter followers quite in the proposal, this is now pass 300.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap on the website is great and provides very high level view of the next two years. However for this specific proposal, which is developing an MVP, it is not particularly clear what the steps involved are to achieve the MVP. The proposal really needs a plan vs budget vs deliverables vs milestones to provide confidence in feasibility. At the moment the voter is placing trust in the proposer based on a the website work done to date. This is a simple fix for the proposer, they need to due the due diligence on feasibility and i would suggest they reach out to a project manager/mentor to help with future proposals or presentations to a VC.\nA number of people are named in the proposal but it is not clear if these are actually going to be part of the delivery team. In addition resource profiles are not provided in the proposal or on the website.\nThe is a basic budget breakdown. Senior developer cost of $4000 per month. These are sensible assuming the named resource are simply taking this as their permanent salary and they do not need to engage contract resource which could cost significantly more.\nOn the basis of what i have seen from the ideafest video only have confidence to give this 3 stars.\nThere is a note about recruiting marketing and sales people. This is also a key risk to the project. Mitigation is either a very steep learning curve for the current team or a potential increase in costs if they need to engage a 3rd party organisation to help for example.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is difficult to assess as not key metrics or KPI's are given.

They provide the necessary skills required on their website. Concerning the rest of this proposal, I see some inconsistencies.

The roadmap provided is sound and secure. The budget request is more than sufficient for the proposal, although it is a bit on the high-end. Because of the inconsistency, I'll remain neutral on this.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap provided remains rudimental for the proposal. the proposal is for one step within the global roadmap and the proposers don't provide us with milestones within these three months.

There's a clear way to add value to the cardano ecosystem through leveraging NFTs and the blockchain integration into the game. I love that this project has well through out KPIs and metrics. That's something I'm missing in some of the other proposals. The team has thought about possible future challenges and how to overcome them and is listening to what the community has to say. To be honest, I don't see anything missing from this proposal. I think it's a great idea with a great team behind it to back it up.  As a developer, I don't see any issues with the team credentials.

The budget is clear enough and is broken down into understandable parts that are easy to follow. As a developer myself, the roadmap and time frame seem reasonable for the work that needs to be done which shows that the team members have no problem estimating the tasks ahead.  All resources linked in the proposal are relevant and further explain details like how the future process and charity work will be done. The idea is to have royalties from the NFT sales got to charity which is noble. I love the proposers have shown the economic incentives for the players to go on their platform and are not just hoping but have a plan in mind to build a community. Risks and challenges are mentioned in the proposal and have well explained plan of action.  Overall I think the game is feasible and I'd play it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Should have no problem with tracability and auditability.

It is quite complete, both in terms of content and design. We have a lot of information about the project, and we can get to know it in an attractive way. Now talking about the idea itself: this proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge. The team intends to create a game that is a mixture of several things: chess, stake pool, NFT and donations to an institution dedicated to activities related to the ocean (here we have the explanation of the name of the game, in addition to the characters, that we can meet in the attached website, being pirates and the game's theme revolve around that). In my opinion, this game has everything to work out, because it already involves something very famous and appreciated - chess - with the minting of NFTs, greatly benefiting the Cardano ecosystem since all this would be done through a pool and also these NFTs could be exchanged for ADA. This would automatically increase the number of transactions on our blockchain, fully matching what we are looking for in the challenge - games that increase ecosystem activities. As a bonus, we could still meet one of Cardano's general objectives, which is to promote sustainability, through the donations made (the authors attach a link that is specifically about this, through which we can better understand this part of the donations).

This did not make me understand the real experience of the group, that is, how old each one is, and in which areas, etc. It is positive, however, that they already have their developers in Plutus, because from what I've noticed many proposals need these professionals but will still hire them. The presentation of the group is perfect - we have a good description of each member, knowing their names, roles and areas of training. The linkedin profiles were also linked, in the end of the proposal. It is also positive how they leave open the possibility of hiring freelancers for design and storytelling areas. That is, in relation to the team, I believe that everything is in order (I was just confused by this story of 80 years of experience). The money asked for funding is also explained very adequately; we know what each small fraction would correspond to for the execution of the project, even though it is a high value (60k) it is quite understandable for the many people who would work here and also the various activities that would take place. It is a large and complex project. The roadmap is attached on a website (https://www.worldofpirates.io/roadmap), I loved the graphic way they organized the steps, really creative and gives us a good understanding of what would be done and in what order.

They don't tell us exactly some goals to be achieved, they don't predict possible challenges to be faced along the way, etc. We weren't helpless, given the great level of detail about what this game is and how it would all work, but I wish the team had paid more attention to how they audited the proposal.
