Aside from that, I\u2019ve been a gamer my entire life and I\u2019ve also worked as a game tester, so I know a bit about the industry.\nThe problem statement is easy to understand and I agree that games which teach people about African culture are quite sparse. The proposed solution is to create such a game, which would have Ada Lovelace and a Samburu girl named Naisula as characters.\nThis game actually sounds like a good idea and fits into the challenge category, but unfortunately, no metrics for success, detailed implementation plan or thoughts about future scalability are mentioned.

KPI\u2019s are easy to track items that Catalyst can use to check the progress of the project (an example of a good KPI here would have been a target for a number of github commits / month).

A game that explores the cultural aspect of the characters in it and educates the gamer on cultural items, heritage is a great idea. What I am missing in the proposal is how this addresses multiple metrics of the challenge. Since the proposal is short we can't find enough details about how the game works and how it addresses the challenge. I love the idea but as feedback to the proposer, I would say work on the details of the game.

The proposer states that he has 20+ experience in education but does not provide us with details on the experience.

It is not stated in the proposal that the proposer has the skills for this nor that he is seeking someone for the development. We do not get a proper roadmap, under KPIs we see some bullet points that sum up what the proposer has planned for this project but not enough for a proper roadmap.

It is a game that would explore African culture and the life of Ada Lovelace, whose name she named our cryptocurrency. Right. But then, what would this game be like? What purpose? What's the story? What would the phases be like? How would the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem be involved? Would there be characters in NFT, smart contracts, transactions in ADA? The way it is presented, we have no idea what is being done here, we don't know what we are dealing with, in short, nothing can be concluded. Unfortunately, the grade will be minimal.

It is ideal to introduce each professional involved and attach a short description. In the script part, we need to understand the phases that will compose the development of the project. And finally in the budget, we need to understand, how would the 30k be used? A game involves several aspects: design, programming, marketing, storytelling and so on. In addition to, of course, developers working on Cardano, to justify funding on Catalyst. It needs to be very clear how this total amount would be divided between the parties.
