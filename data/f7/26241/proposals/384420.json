This proposal clearly states how it will add value to Cardano however they did not mention on how many people does this project aims to help, explain how many people that this project aims to bring onboard Cardano and what will success metric look like (example : aiming for 100000 users within 1 year after V1.0 delivered)? Furthermore, what is the long term plan for the toolkit after it is delivered? Will there any other functions that will be added for future demands of the market? Will it be able to scale to address future challenges? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.

Moreover, the budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable terms. The proposer also offers realistic timetable to complete the work. Furthermore, the proposer also provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. However the proposer did not mention of any risks and challenges in completing this project.

The team provided some great key metrics and goals, and they showed a list of needed features for their platform. But the Catalyst needs more about the implementation that the team doesn't provide yet. Their roadmap in the proposal is only the list of group activities/ features that the team plan to do without a specific timeline. \r\nMoreover, they don't even provide any budget breakdown to show which one of activity or jobs in the project will use how much money. Sadly, I really love this idea but just only assess it at low feasibility. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We can't audit this proposal because there is nothing. After funding, the team will have to report regularly to Catalyst their progress, hence, the team must provide a roadmap and key metrics for CA/ vCA assesses that is available to audit this project. The more detail in the roadmap the easier on audit and we love it more than a roadmap with just a few headlines without detail.
