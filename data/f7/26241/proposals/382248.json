As it is a mixture of both starcraft and clash royale, does it take only 2 to 3 weeks for the whole strategy to be implemented. It would be helpful if these main points are broken down into a deeper key points on how the funding could be use to prosper the project. There is no clear roadmap for the game and milestones for which the community can have confidence towards the project. Though given experience is stated, a proper introduction and complete links of the team members would be useful for the community to vote for this project. (due to increasingly scams/rug pulls).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I have looked on the website, it is still unclear for users to understand the flow and content of the project and its benefits for users. A great suggestion would be listing out a good roadmap for easy auditability, key metrics and goals for the project and improving on sending the message for users to understand its value for the ecosystem.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_669", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 1, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I think I am competent to assess this proposal for a challenge setting as I have been active in project Catalyst since fund 4 and I have experience analyzing business requirements from over 5 years of delivering software solutions for small business and corporations as well. Aside from that, I\u2019ve been a gamer my entire life and I\u2019ve also worked as a game tester, so I know a bit about the industry.\nLike many proposals in the Gamers On-Chained challenge, this proposal does not identify a problem to be solved exactly, but rather describes the idea of a game that is a mixture of StarCraft and Clash Royale. The solution then just gives a few more details about this (there will be 3 races, with 4-6 characters each and they will all have special properties).\nSince it\u2019s a game, the proposal fits into the challenge, but a few things are missing here, such as metrics for success (the only number that is mentioned is reaching 100k followers across all media channels) or details on why this project would bring value to Cardano necessarily. The emphasis both in the problem statement and in the plan is on \u201cthe focus being on making the game addictive\u201d, but there is no mention about how that will be done or what is the future scalability of this. In my experience, successful games that last for years are those that are built with passion and with the intent to be good, not those that are designed around being addictive and extracting money and time from people. Another big impediment to the success of this project in my opinion is the fact that apparently you would need to buy an NFT to even start to play. Gating the game behind something like that will slow your adoption, so I recommend  you consider another approach.\nRegarding the detailed plan: the proposer mentions that \u201cthey are in the process of doing calculations on scoring, mechanism, power-ups etc and they have found quite a few people with experience, this will be the first milestone to deliver in 3-4 months\u201d. Aside from the fact that this is all very vague, in the budget breakdown it\u2019s mentioned that the development of the game strategy / architecture (which includes a lot more than what was just listed above) will only take 2-3 weeks. This contradicts what was stated above and is just overall unrealistic for a game that wants to emulate StarCraft in any way.\nThe information we currently have is insufficient for me to agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, so I give it a score of 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer mentioned that they have a big team and they have delivered quite a few milestones over the past 8 months in the blockchain space. However, no social links are provided to verify any identities. The following statement is also made, but not backed up by even the name of the companies: \u201cWe have 3 firms with 1 that we very well will finalize soon in coming week\u201d.\nNo clear roadmap or timeline is provided here. At one point it\u2019s mentioned that full gameplay will be implemented on the website (https://www.grise.finance I assume) in 4 months and then a mobile version will be done. What does full gameplay mean? Will this be a browser game? The proposal should have stated clearly what platforms it targets. The requested budget is $35000, with only $3600 going towards \u201cstrategy/architecture\u201d, while 21600 would be needed for \u201cactual game development\u201d and $10000 for marketing. Again, this breakdown avoids any specific terms or planning, which does not give me confidence. Finally, there is no talk of risks or impediments to this project.\nDue to the many pieces of crucial information missing or being extremely confusing, I completely disagree this proposal is likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Further down, the proposer mentions that one of the completed milestones here is an AI index platform (https://grisemetamoonverse.io/AI). I have visited this site and I really do not understand its purpose. There is a Nami wallet connect button which does nothing, there is a pie chart for crypto with \u201cmoney in-out; largest transaction; user growth; concentration on-chain\u201d being the \u201cdata\u201d it represents (see imgur: https://imgur.com/a/U1qCcWo) and below that, there is a \u201cprice prediction chart\u201d, which states that the price of Cardano on 14 January will be \u201c2.07\u201d (not even the currency is mentioned).\nAside from this, the proposer says that they have an NFT marketplace completed (/nft for the above site), but this is just a page with a few images, which when clicked show a prompt saying \u201cWrong nami-wallet connection\u201d (like I said, however, the Nami connect button does not do anything, meaning I checked the Network tab while clicking it and no request is being sent at all).\nAll in all, this proposal is all over the place and I simply don\u2019t understand what the purpose of all this information (much of which seems to be false, inaccurate or unverifiable) is.\nFurthermore, there are no KPI\u2019s listed and there is no clear roadmap for the development of this game, so I completely disagree that this proposal is auditable.

I know they are very famous games, but I only know the first one. That said, the author's idea is to create a game centered on his characters, whose objective would be to make them evolve. Cardano would enter the scene from the moment these characters would be NFTs, and also because the game would have its own wallet (NAMI) in which the addresses would be linked to Cardano (at least that's what I caught). In that sense it's a good idea and one that aligns with the goals of the challenge as it would increase the number of NFTs in Cardano being circulated. However, I think it lacked more detail about understanding the game itself. The proponent cites something about running; I couldn't find the video he told us to watch. He also mentions that the characters would have 3 races. It would be extremely positive if he had delivered, along with the proposal, the design thought for each of these races and some examples of evolved NFTs. This would all give us a more solid view of the project. I also can't understand why the game is so addictive, as the proponent explains. I don't think it's a bad idea, but it needs to be better detailed so that we have more faith in the impact this game could have on the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Who is this team? We don't have names, we don't know the professional training of its members, what they would do in relation to the game, who here has a connection with the Cardano ecosystem (that's if anyone has it, because the proponent claims they've been working with blockchain for 8 months, but no we know exactly which one...). In relation to the team, no confidence is passed, precisely because of the scarcity of information. I don't even say details, but some more basic things. Unfortunately, the way is not to say that I have a diverse, experienced team, etc... but to present it properly. About the script, they do not establish a division of phases to be fulfilled. The closest thing to this is the \"following is the current state of NFT market place launch on cardano\" part. They are loose activities, which have been completed or not. Unfortunately, this does not convey a notion of planning, of division of tasks into stages, we don't know who would do what, etc. And the funding is also explained in a very superficial way, for example, for the development of the game in I know USD 21k is asked, right? But within that amount, there is certainly the salary of different team members, sponsorship of activities such as programming, design, etc., and none of this is specified. They say they have thousands of people already gathered around the game in various media, but it would be better if they had attached the links, so we could check it out.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent establishes two KPIs to be followed, which say more about the final results to be obtained. The progress of things, that is, the development of the project, could be done by verifying the tasks explained here. A constant monitoring of this project would be necessary, because, as is usually the case with games, there are several professionals working, a high amount of funding involved, and with that it is more than necessary to understand if what was promised is being fulfilled. I believe so, in relation to auditability, the proponent is concerned with preparing an auditable proposal. It's not perfect, because there are only 2 KPIs for a complex project, as I said in the previous topic, the roadmap is not really a roadmap, it's more of a to-do list; this allows a partial understanding of the project and also partial monitoring.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 11, "ng": 15, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create a game that has 3 races, and each race has 4-6 characters (initially).
