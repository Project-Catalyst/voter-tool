The game's relationship with our blockchain is precisely that these buffaloes are in token format, and everything that involves them being a transaction coined in the Cardano blockchain, for example: their maturity, geographic location and their characteristics, such as temperature, weight, etc. It's a very original idea, in my view, and it can work very well, I think it's very attractive for those interested in this type of game, being a mixture of games where we can manage environments (for example, farm games, but in this case totally focused on buffaloes) and also hunting characters such as the pokemon go. I see potential in this initiative, and I believe that having all of your information minted in our blockchain would greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem. I just wanted to get a better understanding of how this augmented reality question would work: players would download the app on their cell phones, but how would the game relate to the environment? And what would it be like for someone with augmented reality glasses? As it is a very out-of-the-box and somewhat complex idea, it would be positive if the authors included a short video in the proposal explaining precisely how the game works in practice, in a simple way, so that people who are not from the technology area can also fully understand how this project would take place. Other than that, I believe it is an idea with a lot of potential and that it dialogues directly with what the challenge asks for. Not to mention the fact that it could still be beneficial to the physiological and psychological health of the players, as the authors argue, proving these lines through the links attached at the end of the proposal, as it would take them out of their usual rooms or places. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team appears to be very capable, as they: 1) explain the technical characteristics of the game in a very deep way 2) briefly mention their areas of knowledge during the course of the proposal, as well as their experience levels 3) attach their profiles from the linkedin at the end of the proposal, where we can get to know them better and see some of their past experiences. Regarding the script, unfortunately this part of the proposal is practically non-existent. The authors provide us with an extended explanation of what the game would be, what technologies it would involve, what the general idea is, but they don't clearly explain what steps would be needed to build it all. It was important for us to have a definition of phases to be followed to result in the final product. The authors say that the full development of the game could take years, which is worrying, we don't know exactly how the grantee's money would take care of the first stages. In other words, what % of this project would the $65k cover? It is necessary for us to have a solid vision of the whole, investing in something uncertain is a little distressing, I would very much like the authors to have thought about the total trajectory and exposed it here to see how far the money from this financing round could help to get things done. I really liked the idea of \u200b\u200bthe game and I don't like to point out these flaws, but it is necessary that we understand the whole thing before investing. About the money, more specifically, the total amount is divided into some parts, but each one of them could have been more detailed, in my perception. How would this 3d modeling be? How is this kind of thing built? And how would 10k be used for this? That said, I think the team's biggest flaw was actually the script issue, which if resolved, will go a long way towards making the proposal more amenable to funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This team is different from the moment it suggests preparing monthly reports and providing them to the group that manages this game challenge.
