First difficulty comes from the fact that a) the proposer has been provided with plenty of useful feedback in the comments section but not all of it has been incorporated into the proposal, and b) the proposal is dotted with terminology that should have been opened up more. I did take a look at what Fracada is (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FvKUlh7Fs8) but it would have been useful to open up what this \"fractional minting application\" is supposed to achieve and how. After doing some more research into the topic I understand that something like this would probably be useful for many projects in the Cardano ecosystem. This reasoning should have just been spelled out in the proposal itself.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on how the proposal (and budget) is written, it appears that the proposer doesn't take any of the money himself but instead pays MLabs and a yet unidentified UX/UI designer to get the job done.
