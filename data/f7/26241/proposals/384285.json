This proposal also clearly state on how will it provide value on Cardano. The proposer also clearly stated on how many users that they are aiming to bring onboard. However, the proposer did not mention on the ability of this project to scale for future market demands. Can the game handle growing interest of millions of people and also the demand of the market to expand the world beyond moon? Will there be any server overload and lag problems just like star citizen?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provided verifiable links to the relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. The proposer also knows the required manpower to successfully complete the project. Moreover, the budget breakdown were outlined clearly into identifiable terms. The budget required is also reasonable to achieve the goals. Furthermore, this proposal also offers realistic timeframe to complete the work. However the proposer did not mention the technical expects of the game. What engine will the metaverse be built on? What technology will be used on creating the metaverse? Please elaborate. In addition, there were no mention of risks and challenges that they might face in completing the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal provided a clear roadmap with milestones and time horizon for achievement.
