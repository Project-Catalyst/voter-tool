For this reason, I think it is a good fit for the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has experience with art and programming but they don't really go into too much detail about that - however it doesn't seem that the level of technical expertise required to accomplish what is set out is very high so there probably won't be any roadblocks in that regard.

But I don't think one can truly fault it for that, since it includes clever ideas such a connecting physical cards to mintable NFTs.

So I think it's a relatively safe bet: If approved, we will probably get the card game they promise.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Here's where I am mostly concerned. The roadmap is good and I don't contest that at all. And while it's mentioned that the game was \"tested\" and that part is complete, I saw very little if any actual information about the playtesting of the game. It begs the question: If the game is produced, how do we know it will be a fun? How do we know it will be an engaging and enticing gameplay experience that people will want to return to and spread word of? Unless some detail is shared about the playtesting process (how many people, how many hours, how much were game rules revised as a result) I'm not sure we can say the game will be good with much certainty. And if it isn't, we won't find out until after it's released. If this proposal fails, I would encourage the proposer to give us more on the playtesting process and results the next time it's up for vote.
