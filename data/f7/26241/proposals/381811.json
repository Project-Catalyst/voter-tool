In this way, the player would make a kind of investment in himself, and the purpose of the game, as I understand it, is that it should be in RPG and have a kind of medieval vibe. This can work because a considerable portion of players like RPG and are also interested in this type of universe. The game well meets the challenge goals of increasing the number of NFT outstanding on our blockchain, promoting transactions in ada since multiple sales would be made by smart contracts, and attracting new users to the ecosystem since people would be well seduced with the proposal to profit literally playing. You can better understand how this question of world building would work in the topic \"Build / grow together\". The authors also provide an example of what would happen in practice during the game so that we can more firmly understand what is being described. So I think it's a very interesting idea, different and one that can greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem in many ways.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script has a time division every 3 months, which I found too spaced to understand in a specific way what was going to happen. The authors also draw heavily on what would be accomplished in the game, but don't talk about the activities behind it. For example, in the first quarter they would build the map, so that players would begin to have some kind of contact with that universe. Certainly, developers, animators, designers and screenwriters would be needed for that. I would like to understand what their daily work would be like, what small tasks they could do individually to build this final product together. This logic extends to all milestones - what is the work behind each advancement in game technologies? However, these milestones are very interesting even to perform auditability, as I will detail in the topic below. No information is invalidated. Regarding cost sharing, the authors ask for a high amount of funding, 80k, which is detailed in some topics. But these topics could be better explained, for example 16k marketing: how would it be done? What kind of campaign do they intend to run? How to reach the target audience? 27k for platform programming - this is a large amount and would need to be further broken down in order to promote a more solid understanding. I think this part of the proposal could have increments. I would love to understand how the 3d design and modeling would be (I think this branch is very interesting). How would this be done, in stages, by whom, for how long and etc? Now speaking of the team, we are given their names, roles and linkedin profiles. In the proposal we have a superficial view of what they would do, but through social networks we could know them more precisely, so that part of the proposal is satisfactory. So I think there are good things that need improvement here, overall.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are two ways to monitor the project here. The first would be the most obvious, through the KPIs provided, which are about audience reach, number of partners created in the game and NFT coined. But it is also possible to track whether each milestone has been fully achieved, as they are broken down into smaller activities. Therefore, the authors provide us with enough information to properly audit the proposal. It would be interesting if some audit team were formed, to monitor through practice - playing. And also, that the team prepare reports that gather the data traced in the KPIs, in order to inform the rest of the community about the game's success.

There is a link of great website in the proposal, but I was a little suspicious by the fact that the games posted on the page are misleading because they pointed out that they are finished and can be downloaded from the apple store, but unfortunately these games do not exist. The team is transparent which is a great thing. The budget is clearly defined but I personally don't prefere a proponent of large sums. In my opinion, it would be better if the requested amount of $ 80,000 was halved and half of the funds were requested in this Catalyst F7 and half in the Catalyst F8. Maybe the budget is realistic for the realization of such a project. It would be good to see within the budget allocation how many hours it takes to build certain parts of the project. Detailed implementable plan is excellently presented and details of actionable tasks and order of execution also exist. Any project that has a time frame of a year is quite risky in my opinion because we never know what can happen. So I advocate shorter time frames. The proposal states a time frame of as much as 18 months, which sounds quite unrealistic for a project like this in terms of the speed of project implementation. The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal but has no description for technical aspects such as architecture, language and technologies.
