I think it's great how the authors were concerned with contextualizing in a very narrative way how this project would take place, because a game is, above all, a form of immersion in new universes, and the team seems so capable of this that it starts, already by the description of the proposal , to involve us CAs and potential players. It is also positive that the game is in RPG style, something that is very successful, but that, at the same time, it already has several projects and some well-worn narratives - that's not what happens here, we have a different proposal than what we've seen so far. in the RPG universe. It is known by all of us that this modality is very pleasing to players, being one of the countless signs of success that this project presents us. The idea of \u200b\u200busing artificial intelligence is also really cool, it gives players a certain - not full - share of control for their characters. I see this as a way to captivate players, lock them in, in a certain way, as it ends up becoming something with a sprinkling of gambling (something that is also undeniably loved by the gaming community). It is also another positive point that the game takes place in rounds that relate to time in the real world, this generates more engagement, because it would mix life with the game, in addition to the fact that the game adopts the \"play to win\" mode , something that attracts the public a lot - usually people don't want to invest money in things right away. The team is concerned with studying the characters' characteristics very accurately, making their visualization very solid. They also outline possible risks, already promoting some solutions, which shows a lot of prudence and a sense of reality. And about how the project would benefit from the Cardano ecosystem, I think in many ways. Starting out, each character would be NFT, which would directly increase the uptake of technologies from the Cardano ecosystem as more and more players get involved here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, the team is concerned with defining which activities would take place based on the quarters. They are listed under topics, and give us an understanding of who would be doing what during the passage of time, which gives a very clear view of the process. The team is undoubtedly apt to carry out this project successfully, starting with the members of the AIM group involved here; they have already introduced some very useful projects to our community, such as CA tools and vCA tool, thus demonstrating their technical capability. They are concerned with providing the names and roles (in addition to a breakdown that includes some previous experiences in some cases) of each participant. Victor and Lucio appear to be extremely capable people: the former is well recognized in the Cardano community for several achievements, having an engineering background and being interested in games, in addition to being someone always present in Town Hall and fully active in the community. Lucio seems to be very prepared due to his working time, besides he knows how to program in several languages, which is something rare (in my opinion). The rest of the team seems equally relevant to the project, they are people from different professional areas, not just the technical parts. We also have designers, who are of paramount importance for the project's success, both in terms of character design and ambiance, UI/UX and etc. And finally, as far as the monetary repartition is concerned: they divide the total amount, which is quite high, but justifiable, into topics. Each topic is explained separately, and it is basically about the salaries of the professionals involved. In this way, this part of the proposal is also very understandable, making us understand why this amount was requested.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding game monitoring, I believe the team provides us with enough information to carry out a detailed follow-up, not only of the final results but also of the process. I say about the process because we know who would do what and when, in this way we could maintain direct contact with the professionals involved to talk and monitor the progress of each part. And in terms of the final results, it's basically about how many designs were created, NFTs sold and users playing in early versions of the game. I suggest that the team itself monitor this data and gather everything in graphic reports, in order to show this information to the rest of the community. This could be done during a room in After Town Hall, a project promoted by the Catalyst Swarm group, with the aim of promoting debate about projects already financed (the case here) and future ones. Therefore, I believe that we do have enough information to exercise a proper auditability of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 17, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Love it.

They have sketched out a plan of what they want to do.

Its worth taking a risk on.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have provided a clear roadmap for delivery against which progress can be audited. They have also provided a number of KPI's against which success can be measured. It would be nice to add some goals to these KPI's, but in the end these types of projects have a long tail.
