In their introduction, the authors say very interesting things, like the fact that the game is made available in several languages \u200b\u200bso that it can reach half of the world population (according to them). It's great that they keep in mind how the concept that \"games can't be useful\" is out of date, and want to break that paradigm. And I also found it very positive how they conceptualize what MMO and Sandbox would be, so that people who are not so familiar with it come to fully understand their proposal. Thus, it is clear that the objective is to create an interactive learning space, where each language would represent a world and the player could choose their role. Regarding how the game would relate to the blockchain Cardano, the team explains that coins can be exchanged for ADA, some characters are NFT and players would form different DAOs, and other ways that information would be minted in a decentralized way. Therefore, I believe so, this proposal is of high value and meets what we seek in the challenge, as it promotes a very interesting world creation not only for fun but also for learning, and it would use various technologies from the ecosystem system to work.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears to be very capable, as it already has projects financed in f6 (it would be interesting to mention which), it has other proposals in the same fund and it attaches a website where we can see a little more about their work and also individual descriptions of each member , which include a short summary of who they are and links to their social media. This way, it is very sure that they have the knowledge to successfully execute the proposal. They provide us with a very detailed roadmap of what needs to be done in the near future, and this detail is essential for us to fully understand the process itself, since the project is complex. It is positive as they explain the project over the course of months, and not just make a \"big picture\" of the activities that would be developed, making the specificity high and the understanding much more solid. About the financial division, despite being a high amount, it is fair. The game is certainly a project that will require several hours of work from those involved, as detailed in the proposal description, they will work hard and will receive a monthly salary of $1200, which I think is fair for the job. This part of the proposal is not that detailed, but I think what was said is enough to promote a good understanding here as well.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team provides us with a number of KPIs (and something that is unheard of in my view, I haven't seen any other proposals determining long-term KPIs so far), but they are relatively synthesizing. It is possible to monitor the project through them, but I would like to have a closer monitoring, I would say. For example, I will quote the French language; it would be interesting for the team to draw a bridge between the participants in our community who are lacking that language and the game itself, so that they can give opinions and give tests, even before the game is released to the general public. It would be great if the team did a general overview of the information and present such results in some Town Halls (I say in the same plural, because as I said, it is a large complex project, so I believe that just one presentation would not be enough). I would like the team to go even deeper into auditability so that we can understand 100% of the information they already provide us.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea will make a big change to the way billions of people learning language and skills around the world because language and skills are important to everyone in the world that is unlike other game ideas is trying to get players to engage with their gameplay and style only. And with their vision of success and plan to work on Cardano network, I believe that when the team successfully launches it, there will be a lot of people joining and developing. Therefore, it can help to directly increase the gamer into Cardano communities as this challenge set. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "After looking around on their team info I think they can solve their idea well, they're all talented and skillful in their field. My only considering thing when assessing the feasibility of this proposal is risks on their way.

", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They have a good roadmap and key metrics that can help Catalyst tracking when successful funding.

It is great that KPIs indicated in the proposal match the ones indicated in the challenge and that they are able to scale future challenges and everything is in place.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a team with serious intentions and everything is transparent. There is an account with experience and skills that are necessary to deliver what is explained in the proposal. The website looks good and I could easily found all the necessary information and skills, knowledge that one team should have. The proposal clearly shows the budget needed for the project, but it would be better to have more information on how the team members will distribute the money. It can be seen that the money goes to the salaries of the people working on the project, but it remains unknown what will happen to the $ 4,800 money if they don't find another Plutus programmer. There is a detailed implementable plan and it is very well developed and the amount of money required is reasonable for this amount of work and the realization of the project itself. The team does not mention additional funding, so no additional plan has been developed. The team sets up real timetable to complete the work and the plan they gave describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal everyting is covered. The team in the proposal does not mention the possibility of potential risks so we have no solutions if certain risks arise.\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team made a great roadmap with milestones with dates which gives us confidence that the project will be realized.

Indeed, it has a strong impact on Cardano communities when it succeeds too. \r\nI believe that their vision of success will make a big difference to currents centralized projects out there, they're all not designed like a game or even with gamification ideas, that's boring. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap for the development of this proposal is detailed enough to estimate their works, and I think they can do it well with their experiences and skills. But for more clarity about the budget, my advice for the proposer is that should outline the roadmap in more detail because the fund you're asking for is monthly not by group tasks. Moreover, the outsourcing budget also should point to the tasks that will be used.\r\nAfter reading some other proposals of this project I think the proposer should provide some risks and your solution for getting rid of them. This project is huge and complex to go without any risk. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I hope that I can see some number in their KPIs, and should add some more key metrics related to the challenge setting that their project can get, for ex: language learners, gamers, social engagement... \r\nIndeed, they have a very detailed content of problem with case study and explanation, then they show how their project to solve those problems very well.
