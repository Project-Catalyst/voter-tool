The problem statement targets a specific issue that NFT based games are mainly targeting the gamers, but in general i have also seen in my experience a huge surge in small kids playing games on tablets/mobiles. \r\n\r\nThese games of course are either educational OR kids specific. Therefore, i think there is a huge market to tap into in this direction.\r\n\r\nIt will be great to increase the demographics reach for gaming on Cardano. This proposal touch bases and provides their solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience of the team is publicly available and gives a good first impression of technical and business abilities of the team to achieve this proposal goals.\r\n\r\nI like that they have tried to cover all the dimensions and not only one or two. e.g. Coding, art, game design, marketing. Therefore, it is quite good that they already have people who are covering this proposal from every direction.\r\n\r\nThe fund allocation is well explained and hourly distribution is explained. However, i am not sure why this 7% tax is required ? it would have been great to also add onto why this tax part is required.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, use of additional catalyst funding section provides a good details on where else they want to utilise the funds in the upcoming future. Overall, very well written proposal and hence i fully agree that  experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully \r\n\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe business model - road to success provides a detailed description on what the team have been doing so far, and where the catalyst funding comes into picture. This gives community confidence that they are not completely relying on catalyst funding and very motivated. \r\n\r\nThe quarterly goals/milestones are well presented and can be used by community to have a vision on how the short term vs long term success will look like. Also the risks are outlined, this gives an ability to keep risks involved in mind while community  audits the progress of this challenge.\r\n\r\nOverall, i do not see any issues for tracking the progress and success of the proposal", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 11, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The game meets very well what the challenge seeks. The idea is to create a game where players would customize, with many details, their character, which would be an NFT. I found it very interesting that this game is also aimed at a children's audience, I don't remember having seen other proposals that catered to this portion of the population that is massively relevant for the creation of entertainment content (we know how huge they can be, for example, the youtube channels aimed at children, this could be repeated in games). If the project succeeds, it would be a good gateway for new users to the Cardano ecosystem, maybe even the parents of the child who play the game will be interested in learning a little about our blockchain; it would also certainly increase the number of tokens being minted and ada being traded in the game, so I believe the project would benefit the Cardano ecosystem in different ways, aligning perfectly with this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team seems to be very capable, they have already developed a whole concept of visual identity, which we can learn about through the website that was attached and also through the image of a character that was provided directly in the proposal. I thought it was very beautiful and attractive to the public, not just children. They also provide a short description of who they are, including their roles and some past work, so they can reassure you about their experience. And they seem quite experienced indeed, for example, according to the description given, Christian is very smart with over a decade of experience in graphic design. About the relationship of this team with the blockchain, from what I read, Conward would be the one that has the most connection with the technologies of our ecosystem, but I would like this bridge to be explored further. On the financial split, it is good that they have precisely determined how the total funding (which is quite high, but justified) would be used, but I think there could be more detail in each part. Some parts are detailed, like animation and coding works, but on the other hand some like marketing and the cool part are not well explained. These two parts of the project take a high share of the money, which makes it necessary for us to better understand what was going on. In marketing, could it be explained how the dissemination campaign would take place, through which channels would this be done, how to reach children? In the part where they explain the development of the project, they mention in the first phase that there would be activity on social networks, which makes us deduce that part of the marketing campaign would take place there. But it was important to understand exactly how this would come about. Speaking of phased development, I think this part of the project is pretty detailed so we have a pretty accurate picture of what's going to happen, when and how, the way it's supposed to be. So I think this topic here is very good, I just suggest further deepening the details in some parts cited.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Excellent auditability, the team defines in great detail what success would be like, so we have plenty of content to monitor. In addition to the topic created especially to understand the KPIs, we could go further in the monitoring as they also detail what the phases would be like, that is, we know what would be happening and when, so that it is possible to check if things are happening as promised. What would need to be done would be that 1) the team prepare a summary of the results and present them to the rest of the community, I think that in the specific case of this project the most appropriate would be to participate in some Town Halls, since it is a highly project. visual and they've already proven to be great on the graphics side, it would be great if we had a short visual presentation of how the results would be developing. And 2) the community itself got involved with the game, testing it, bringing constant feedbacks, some members could be selected for it, including those who had children could do some tests to see how children would react to the universe and characters created. That said, I believe that the project's auditability is very well underway, it just needs to be exercised by the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 16, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Flooftopia aims to bring a brand new game on the Cardano blockchain, not only for PC but also on Android and IOS devices. \r\nTarget users will include also children and women.\r\nSo the challenge is definitely addressed by this proposal", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has an extensive experience in the sector as some members worked for big gaming companies such as Ubisoft. The game structure is not based on pay to win, which potentially can bring more active users and encourage them to continuing the gaming experience.\r\nA minus for not using the already existing CNFT.io webiste, because it would save some time and cost, but I guess using a dedicated NFT marketplace would help users avoiding switching pages and be lost buying wrong NFTs that would not work in the game. \r\nThe risk analysis outlines potential delays that would be avoided by shifting temporarily some resources to overcome them.
