I think this because, as the game would be, in short, to create cards (NFT) that represent players from the Argentine Football League, maybe people who are not even interested in games and cryptocurrencies will decide to explore these universes in the name of a taste for the sport, since the country has a lot of tradition in the game. I found it especially interesting when the authors say players will be tracked by scores, which directly relate to each player's real-world results. I think that would bring a very dynamic bias to the game created, and could value and devalue certain players and encourage trade, perhaps. It is also very interesting when they commit to refund the money requested in the fund if the game is commercially successful (this could be made official somehow, so that this promise is not forgotten). Furthermore, it is positive that the authors cite several objectives that they intend to achieve in the short, medium and long term in the game, they give us an understanding of what would be the basic components and also some complementary ones for the functioning of the project. They attach a white paper, where you can see in more detail about the technical parts and motivation of the project. One thing I would like to note, however, is that in my opinion it could have been clearer in the proposal description if there were any in-game tutorials teaching people how to handle NFT. Some people are already familiar with this technology, but most are not, so there could be, for example, a guide on how to play this in practice, the game seems to me a good gateway to new members of the ecosystem and has chances to cause a lot of movement in the blockchain, in addition to also relating to the challenge of Latin America. And finally, I would like to emphasize how the authors attach numerous sites that argue the importance and validity of their project, making the investment something more plausible in the eyes of those who are not from Argentina and do not know how the relationship between its inhabitants and the cryptographic world is going. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors divide the development of the project into five parts, and each of them has a short text explaining what will be done. Such descriptions make us have a solid understanding in relation to the activities that will be developed, and through the spreadsheet in the docs we know, for example, who would do each thing and for how long each of these 5 steps. About the team presentation: it's good, but there could be more details about each person involved. We know their names, main functions and there are also links to most linkedin, so we have the possibility to know them in more detail. Despite this, it would be interesting if a little about their trajectories were described in the proposal itself (it would not need to be anything that long, around 3 lines we would already have enough information). What's great here is that it's a large and diverse team, from developers to legal experts, but there was a lack of design staff on the team, despite their emphasis on the importance of investing in UI/UX. They have a partnership with a company (ECOM) that already has some involvement with Cardano, which is a factor that conveys security. And lastly, they set out a very detailed financial breakdown, in fact this is the best budget organization I've seen so far in my f7 reviews. It is a document in the docs with a division made into stages, weeks, activities and who would be charging for each stage. I think I would just like a little more detail about the team members in the proposal itself, but other than that everything is great.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Right in the introduction of the proposal, the authors speak of several objectives, which gives us content to be audited throughout the development of the project. You can monitor whether the basic requirements have been met, and then the complementary ones. This could be done by any member of the community who is Argentine and who, preferably, has an interest in the world of football. Added to this we also have other data, the success metrics, through which we can have a notion beyond what is expected with the completion of the project. The team could also contact the community later to present some of this data, this could be done monthly through the elaboration of spreadsheets in the docs (they have already proven to be good at this). In short, I believe the team was concerned with establishing solid auditability for its project, by providing a lot of information.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 15, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal effectively addresses the challenge by providing a NFT based (tradable) football game that will be tightly coupled with NFTs on Cardano eco system. \r\n\r\nThe idea is noble and in sync with what community wants to achieve by having larger presence of Cardano in gaming eco system.\r\n\r\nThe idea goes on to  give essential complementary and planned features and functionalities for this proposal.  Argentina is one of the few countries where football is most popular sports and I think combined with Cardano tech we can onboard a lot more people to Cardano ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe attached google docs is very detailed ones and in my opinion can be reduced a little, as i think in general whoever is here will not need an introduction to Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. Nevertheless, good intentions behind it.\r\n\r\nMoreover, i think more clear distinction could have been made, so that community can understand that it is going to be an NFT gaming platform, not a game itself ? Therefore, i see some room for improvements in writing of the proposal\r\n\r\nOverall i find this proposal to fit effectively within the confound of this challenge settings.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The experience of the team is good, especially for the funding that they have asked for. They do have resources for Front end and back end development and the links are posted to have a look at their skill sets.\r\n\r\nIt is also nice to see that they have some Emurgo students in there, which means they are already active in plutus programming and gaining some experience in there.\r\n\r\nThe plan presented is quite detailed, with a separate link google docs, where different stages are split into tasks and subtasks. Each subtask is well outlined with potential duration and this gives a better understanding of why certain funds are requested. Nevertheless, it would have been better, if the numbers $15000 was also split in the same way as in the tasks and subtasks are split. e.g. What is the rate of developers per hour etc .\r\n\r\nTherefore, i think with addition of such points i had given it full ratings. Nevertheless, good luck to the team.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided here is sufficient as the roadmap is given with respect to 6 months. Also the detailed plan outlined is easy to audit by the community as it gives good detailed outlook on what implementation is expected when.\r\n\r\nHowever, the potential risks could have been mentioned so that community is aware of what potential blockers might exist. As this helps community to upfront be aware of problematic situations. Given the fact that your team has also people from Tax and Law domain, i expect may be you see something that is worth mentioning on the risk front :)\r\n\r\nSince the team is publicly available, in general i agree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of this proposal", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 7, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The team has very detailed documentation about their project including detailed tasks for each phase, and their goals in the proposal can help us well understand how their idea can solve the problem well and further development. For better, they should provide a more detailed explanation or case study for their goals, it will help everyone easy to understand how the project gives value to the football industry.  \r\nAnother better thing is that their key metric aligns with the challenge setting and with the idea of supporting the sports industry, I think it will scale fast in the future when their idea is formed.
