It is a game that would, according to the author, merge the world of NFTs with socialization, something that according to him is lacking in the universe of crypto games. Okay, but what would that socialization be like? The author explains that clubs would be created in the forests, from what we can understand, the characters would be bears (probably NFT coined in Cardano). But what would happen in these clubs? What missions would be the basis of the game? How could players showcase their characters? It is not possible to understand in detail what is being passed here, unfortunately. A website is attached, where we have some illustrations (I loved the 3d projection of the bears) and a little about the story, script and contact with the team. I found the site very beautiful, visually, but in terms of content it doesn't deliver much. The white paper is also nothing different from the website (it might have been an error, but when I entered the given link this is what I saw). In general, the impact here could be better measured if the proponent had gone into more detail about the game itself, how NFT coining, socialization between players, universe building, etc.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We have a script here, but it's pretty sketchy. That is, the phases have little detail. For example in Q1 2022, the only topic is \"Airdrop Bears Club 3D NFTs\". What would that be, exactly? The construction of these characters? Were the tasks destined for 2021 actually accomplished? If yes, I would like to see the results. Detailing is not absent, but it is insufficient. It doesn't allow for a very clear vision of what would need to happen to make this idea a reality. On the attached website, the same script is available, in a better diagrammed way, but no extra information is given. Regarding staff and funding, there is also a gap in details here. Starting with the monetary breakdown, this is very unspecific. The author states that 70% of the funding would go towards the development of the game. Very vague explanation. Within development, we have several activities, such as design, programming, storytelling, smart contracts?, in short, several things. It would be necessary to understand how this 70% would be distributed. He also says that legal and marketing actions would be needed, but that is also very vague. Everything is vacant, unfortunately. He doesn't dedicate any space in the proposal to present a team that is responsible for the different functions of the game, as I mentioned earlier. He claims to have experience with programming and games involving cryptography. But what did he do within those areas? What kind of relationship does it have with the Cardano ecosystem? About the designers he intends to hire, what would that selection be like? Unfortunately, there are many doubts in the air, not giving a sense of security in his/her team's ability to carry out the proposal in a guaranteed way.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponent establishes some KPIs, which relate to the expected results for the passage of time counted in months. It's a good way to audit the proposal, saying about the final results. However, these KPIs cannot, in my view, cover all the complexity of the project. Games are always (almost always, perhaps) quite laborious, difficult to create. For that reason, I would like more detail. Another way that I find here to do the auditability would be through the script. Through it, it is possible to follow the development of the game. But because it is a shallow script, this monitoring would probably also be superficial. In other words: yes, the proposal is auditable, but not perfectly. I suggest that the author invests in detail both in the metrics part and in the roadmap itself, so that we have more specific information to track. It would be interesting for him to gather the data, partial results of each step, bringing them to the rest of the Cardano community. This needs to say about all aspects of the game: marketing, design, NFT, etc. In this way, we would have a lot of confidence that the project was being carried out in compliance.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 14, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal's problem statement and solution addresses the objectives laid out in the challenge. The proposal's aim to add value to Cardano by creating a social network platform with play to earn ability through gaming. Furthermore, its key metrics and goals are aligned with the challenge. However, the proposer did not mention on its ability to scale to cater future market demands. Can the game be able to serve more than 10000 bears? Think of millions of bears that want to join game and use it as a platform to connect with other users. Also will it only focus on bears? Will there be other form of character that will be added in the future? Another question on scalability is will the game only be available on browser or will it be available on mobile as well?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer did not provide any verifiable link to their profiles.
