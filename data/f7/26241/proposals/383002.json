In addition to the players' NFTs themselves, non-profits could participate in the game with their own NFTs, which is pretty interesting too. In other words, regarding the connection of this game with our blockchain, I believe it is quite clear how the project could benefit the Cardano ecosystem, since the players and institutions involved would mint their tokens in our blockchain. What makes me wonder is, actually, if the idea of \u200b\u200bthe game itself would be widely accepted, if people would really be interested. The team claims that during the tree's development, whether from a seed to an adult tree or even a forest (would you like to understand what this is like, would the person multiply their tree?), the player would learn how all the plant's systems work. and he would also become an expert at identifying species. I confess that it's an interesting idea for those who are already interested in this kind of thing, but I don't think it's the profile of most players, generally people like something that involves building the universe, direct interaction with other players (which can happen here too, but less intensely), games of chance... My question is whether we would really be able to reach a sufficient number of players, who would mint their NFTs in Cardano and make transactions that would cover the production costs of the game and generate profit. I hope the authors of the proposal don't take offense at my point, what I'm trying to say is that in my opinion this game would work well for a certain niche of players, but I don't think it can have a broad following. I could be wrong, of course. In conclusion, I believe that yes, this game would have a positive impact for our blockchain, I would just like the authors to include in the proposal a marketing plan that could explain well how they would attract players and keep them active in the game.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the team, it is positive that during the detailing of the proposal they have specified how many people would be involved in the project and what their roles would be. They also attach a website where, if you scroll down to the bottom, there's a little tab with the presentation of team members; I have already evaluated another proposal with this same team and they seem capable of this type of project, which has a more educational bias. It is important as we have details about who the members of this team are, a small resume in which we could learn about their previous work, etc. About the elaboration of a script, it happens here that they establish steps to be followed according to the time, but I think there was a lack of detail. For example, in the first phase, they say that the website and visual identity will be created. But that's all. It would be important to understand in more detail how this process would happen, the creation of the visual identity would be a key point for this game (in fact for all games, the visual design is of paramount importance). And finally, on the issue of the financial division, this point had even less detail, unfortunately. It is known that they calculated a salary of $1200 per month for each professional, but did not specify how many hours a day they would work with it (they mention part-time, but this varies from place to place), how many days of the week they would work, how the internal organization between them would take place (how they would intertwine their parts to compose the whole)... Basically, we do not understand much about how this money would be used in practice, we only know that it would be an equal distribution among the team for a certain period of time. Another point is that, as I understand it, the money asked for in this funding round would only cover salaries for the first quarter of development, it would be important for the team to make that clear. In the part that explains the money requested, they multiply the monthly salary by the number of professionals and by 3, that is, 3 months of work. Would they ask for more money later? Would they be able to afford it from there? How would things happen? I felt a lack of security in this aspect of the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The authors provide us with some KPIs to measure the game's success. I believe they are satisfactory to understand if the public is really following the idea, if it is reaching out, if the number of NFT in our blockchain would be having an expected growth for the proposal, and also if non-profit institutions would be benefiting from fact (which directly relates to the more general objectives of the Cardano ecosystem). It would be important for the team to periodically prepare some reports that have this information, and present them to the rest of the community through one of our communication channels. Another point would be to monitor the development of the game itself, not just the results. The team foresees a total of one year to finish the game, it would be important that the community could follow the phases that were mentioned by them, I suggest a meeting at the end of each phase to demonstrate the progress. In this way, we could exercise auditability more completely, based not only on results, but on the creation process itself. I think the authors did give us some means of following the project, but not enough for strong auditability.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 11, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea of tree simulator is interesting and fresh. The idea that you could save you tree as NFT and have the 3D model of if for printing or any other purpose is quite interesting. Especially if it would be used as some educational project, like schools where kids could have the tree 3D printed that they gave 'life' to. Additionally the idea that you could buy NFTs from other users is also interesting and a good way to make transactions. Also as it would be used for funding real life environmental projects is a good thing. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to be passionate about educational projects, so proposal would most likely be implemented successfully. One of the potential issues could be the small niche for market. As not a lot of people would find interesting a tree simulator. But the fact it can be used for educational purposes is a nice touch that could attract people, especially kids that are willing to learn more. Overall an interesting idea but in my opinion a potential small market. Additionally would the  game become monotonous after some time?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information seems to be sufficient, but maybe additional milestones would be nice to have.

This proposal tries to address the quite ignored aspect of the challenge which is the scholastic side to the games. When it comes to games, people often look at them from the entertainment view rather than the educational side. Especially, during the times where the flora and fauna are being disregarded, a proposal such as this can be of exorbitant importance. This will certainly lure a special fragment of people (i.e environmentalists, nature enthusiasts, NGO) to the ecosystem who have been very few in numbers on the network at the moment. The proposal also comes with a detailed game plan and timeline which makes the proposal more intriguing and promising.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very diverse and the mix seems to have the necessary experience and expertise to make this proposal a reality. The requested amount of 18.3k USD out of the allotted 250k USD for the challenge seems to make justice. The break up of how and where the funds are to be utilized is fair and reasonable too. The road map even though is brief, is quite self-explanatory. But the only thing that concerns me is that the team has not mentioned the possible challenges and hiccups the team might face during the implementation and how the team proposes to get the better of them. Provided all the above information, the chances of the plan being implemented successfully are still high. Therefore, I rate feasibility with a score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a clear mentioning of the KPI/Metrics one can use to audit and track the progress of the proposal. The metrics are good enough to monitor the footsteps the proposal leaves across various segments of people. However, a few managerial metrics such as cost of quality, productivity, customer satisfaction index, and daily active user to monthly user ratio, customer retention ratio will probably provide more insight during the audit to monitor how well the game is being received and appreciated by the customer base. Henceforth, a dainty bit of attention to these additional metrics can make the proposal a heavyweight in this challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Build a 3D tree simulator for players to grow their own NFTrees from seed to giant, while giving climate-focused non-profits visibility.", "experience": "UX/UI, Full-Stack Dev, Plutus Pioneer, Generative Artist, Procedural Modeling, Cultural Scientist, Treegenerates"}
