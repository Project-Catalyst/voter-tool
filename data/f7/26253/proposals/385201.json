The idea is to create a portal where the community can follow the progress of projects; in this portal, there would also be \"work packages\", which are basically pieces of the project to be done, once the team presented results of the respective parts, the funding would be, little by little, released, and so the packages would advance and the money would be available. What I found great here was that it organized things in a very systematic, pre-standardized way. I believe that each project has its specificities, but it is certainly possible to predict a timeline of actions for each one of them and divide them into packages. I believe that the navigation needed here is a crucial point for the success of the idea. Because there would be many projects categorized, divided and specified. The UI/UX design needs to be studied in order to create the simplest possible platform. One question I had was precisely where this portal would be. A webpage, an app? It would be interesting for the author to clarify where he would be hosted. Other than that, I loved the idea itself, I think it would make monitoring projects much more accessible (it is very complicated to follow hundreds of funded projects, mirrored by the most diverse corners of the internet!).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the author's ability to successfully execute the project, I would like more details about who he is. He gives us very little information about himself, all we know is that he is an engineer, an entrepreneur and has experience with financing distribution. But it would be important to have a more detailed curriculum, examples of previous work, how is this experience with the distribution of funding, what would the traditional method be like? It would be very beneficial if it attached a linkedin profile or some other platform where we could get to know it more closely. It would be very important for this project to have a UI/UX designer experience in order to build an intuitive and easy platform for any community member wishing to exercise auditability. It is also not clear whether the author himself would be the programmer, he does not say whether he intends to hire a marketing team to publicize the idea, etc. About the script, this part is very well detailed, and it is added with the division of expenses. While the author points out what would be done, he says how much funding would be used for a given part. And the steps are pretty well unraveled, so we have a solid sense of what's going to happen in each part. Therefore, what I think needs improvement is the presentation of the author itself and the explanation of the formation of a future team, mainly because it is not possible for a project of such complexity to be done by a single person. And as we were introduced to a team and what would be done by each professional, we would also have greater grounding in determining whether the money asked for in funding is justifiable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author is concerned with drawing definitions of success according to the passage of time, in a direct way to exercise auditability; I also think this could be done in two steps. First, of course, let us follow the construction of the platform itself. This could be done through meetings, in which the author shows the advances, which parts were made in certain periods of time. It is possible to know what to charge through the division of phases that he establishes, and because it is very detailed, we know exactly what to expect from each. And after completing this process of creating, it would be necessary to observe whether the platform was working properly, whether the auditability of the \"hosted\" projects really improved, whether the community is having access, what the community is thinking about browsing the portal, possible errors to be corrected. In other words, it is possible to monitor the progress of the project through the information provided during the proposal description, in addition to the aforementioned success metrics. It is enough that, first, the author establishes this bridge between the process and the community, and then the community itself uses the portal and gives feedback on the experience.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is a driving a meaningful impact towards improving catalyst transparency and growing auditability.

It also allows for much more managament by funded proposers besides the audit itself. I also like the idea of the fundings being released by work packages as it evolves, according to its schedule, completition and depencencies and have a system manage this \"stage-gate\" would be awesome.

It would be good check with whomever \"owns\" this information if you could have access to it before starting.

Firts, it should be clearer if the desired solution is going to be developed internally or if it would be an arealdy exiting commercial solution - or if both would be evaluated. It seems to me that the idea is to keep this management in idea scale but that brings the question of this place is really the best for this kind management and if the solutions proposed would be available from ideascale.

On the other hand the author uses this timeframe in order to test his own proposal as a prototype to the proposed audit and rund release portal. What I would expect, from my experience building portals for +3 years is an architecture concept taking into account roles & rights and the different user groups a bit more detailed, as it could be the critical point for ease of use for Catalyst users.
