Rather it is a proposal to establish a regularly published body of work that audits the proposal auditing process.  It works in concert with this group's other proposal to audit the governance process (funded proposal auditing is the fourth leg of that stool).  By regularly scheduled public meetings, monitoring of the funded proposal environment and tools, and the disposition of 2 surveys, this group will turn out a report approximately once per funding round.
