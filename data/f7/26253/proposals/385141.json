This proposal, in summary, offer to setup a youtube channel to report on WADA related projects with videos being uploaded weekly. This aligns with the objectives of the challenge as it will provide visibility to the community.  The problem statement talks about providing a \"complete comprehensive oversight\". The proposal doesn't really explain what this means though, hence rating = 4. A useful addition to this proposal would have been to define the parameters around which they are working (eg will the videos be general chats with proposers or focused on project delivery or outcomes or impact or all of the above?)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is quite difficult to decipher from the information provided.\nA list of 8 named resources is listed but we don't actually know who is going to do the work.\nThere is no evidence of any of them having experience in video production or managing a youtube channel. I'm not overly concerned about this as, from experience,  it can be learned quite easily.\nThere is no real activity or milestone level plan detailing the activities over the next 6 months. The plan seems to be a simple as setup templates, interview proposers, upload videos. This is fine but could have been made clearer with interim milestones, eg an MVP with a feedback loop for example. \nThe budget has 4 line items that I'm finding difficult to relate to the plan and resources. $3k for travel, $1k for training, $1k for marketing. The budget section is the only place these activities are mentioned.\n\nAs the budget is relatively small and from experience setting up a YouTube channel is not a huge task as score of 3 is given based on the trust and reputation wada has built up in the community.\n\nFor future proposals the proposers should work on aligning plan vs budget vs deliverables vs milestones. This is a fairly straightforward task and there are some good examples in Fund 7. Alternatively they can reach out to mentors or the community for help. It will not only force them to challenge themselves on their delivery plans but will make life so much easier for everyone to understand how they intend to deliver.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Some targets are provided however these are in general terms and not really measurable by the community. As an example, the proposal talks about weekly/bi-weekly (btw this could mean twice a week or every two weeks) upload for many projects. A specific measurable would have been for all (10?) wada projects funded up to fund 6 a weekly video will be produced. \nIn summary, a great idea. The delivery detail needs work, however the voters should weigh this up against the relatively simple project, wada's reputation and the modest budget.

I'm more qualified to speak on the procedural and communications aspects of this project than I am on the technical side, so I'll just reiterate that this project is a fantastic idea that suffers from being presented as not much more than an idea.

It would be helpful to include information about the parameters that you wish to report on and how this reporting will take place, for example the use of graphs to display projected sales against current sales.\nThe lack of key metrics and goals means I am unable to assess how well the proposal aligns with the outlined challenge settings as none of the key metrics are referred to.\nIn my opinion, proposal would be unable to successfully scale without sound fundamentals required to enable it to address future challenges.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer does not demonstrate sufficient knowledge of auditing or how they wish to measure the performance of the catalyst proposal, nor is there any evidence of any persons with such knowledge relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal on their team.\nThe budget is not outlined clearly, nor broken down into identifiable items.

Considering the size and demographic of the area it would not be possible or feasible to conduct such an operation on such a small budget.

Generally this is done by plain documentation and video would certainly bring a more \"human component\" to this process at the same time it allows funded proposers to proper explain all the development done, in words and images.\nHowever, the documentation part still would be essential as it is really proof of what was done. The proposer here understands this and offers, together with the video, a place to keep this documents. Having everything in a dedicated platform, and with a standard template, would defintely make things easier and help community.\nI also see this proposal very aligned with challenge as it would increase the \"Number of reports, articles and videos/podcasts\".\n\nThe only reason I didnt give 5 start here is because it is still unclear how much work would have to be put on to make these videos. Usually, this kind of media demand much more effort (and specific knowledge of tools and design) to be ellaborated, even with a template, than a regular documentation (word documents, spreadsheets, powerpoints). My concern is that funded proposers might not want to make the videos (either because of time it takes or because they dont know how to do them) and this project ends up being not very broadly adopted. To overcome this, it could be included in the scope of the project some support/training on creating the videos, besides providing the template, a possible way to outsource the creation of these videos (even if with a small fee) or other ways to facilitate the creation of this content. It could also be mentioned how was the impact, in a quantitative manner, of their previous funded proposal (Wada Media Funnel for Proposers), that involved video creation as well. It would clarify how prone proposers are to create these medias.\n\n\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As this this team has already developed a similar project in past funds, initially I'd say this proposal is generally feasible but it lacks some key information, that I describe in the sequence, that makes me give only a 3 score/star. First, more information on the team experience, person by person (it is mentioned mostly their area of expertise), and links to verify the information, as linkedin links, would be necessary. \n\nSecond, budget breakdown could better explained. For instance, it says \"Travel and security logistics \" but it could explain somewhere why these trips are necessary. \"Team costs\" could also be better ellaborated (is it just to pay the team or involve other kind of costs? how much will be paid per hour or per peson?).\n\nLast, There's a simple roadmap but it is not time-framed and only some vague actitivites are described. This roadmap could be better organized in months/weeks, with more straightfoward tasks, deliverables and main milestones per period. \n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are good time-framed milestones but no KPIs. It would be imporant to measure and follow up with how many audit videos are being made by funded proposers, how much time they are spending on it, how many people are watching and assess if this is really a better way to audit projects. Maybe it would be hard to set target on all them initially but their experience with past funded proposals could be used to give some sense on these targets (even if within a range)\nThe first bullets in the auditability part seems more related to engagement between proposers and community than the proposal itself.\n\n\n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 10, "ng": 14, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This follow-up proposal builds on work that has been started in Fund5.
