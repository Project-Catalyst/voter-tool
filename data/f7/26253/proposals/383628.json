This proposal seeks to fund the research needed to strengthen the KPI component of the previously successfully funded Proposer's Tool, arguably the most important element of the tool.  Alongside the research they lay out an achievable feedback roadmap to tune these KPIs to Catalyst proposals.  As well, the end result of this initial work -a white paper and presentation- will be useful beyond the impact of the tool itself, by empowering developers and proposers with ways of thinking about the moving target that is KPIs.  Lastly, after experimenting with the present version of the Proposer Tool, I can see the potential for it to be a good brainstorming tool for proposers with SDG specific proposals, or even just potential proposers curious about how to bring SDG into their proposals.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "AIM is one of the most established toolbuilders in the Catalyst ecosystem (I'm using their CA tool to create this assessment) and have a reputation for developing and delivering with reliability.  They have excellent access to the communities, especially the SDG specific components, so integrating their research functions into, and successfully collecting feedback from, proposals is within their capabilities.  The roadmap provided lacks granularity through the first 6 weeks, but highlights the evaluation of 5 KPI systems and reporting mechanics for them, which provides natural audit points as they are checked off.  The following 6 weeks is a little more detailed and split between analyzing proposals with the evaluated KPI systems, and finally assembling the final report. The budget seems a little slim, and doesn't cover the delivery and presentation of the whitepaper, but the hours estimated for the research and analysis seems extremely adequate.", "q1r": 5, "q2": " While more details are possible throughout this roadmap, it has multiple audit points and 3 deliverables (guidelines, proposal analysis, white paper) that will be easy to monitor by the community.  The AIM team is a regular contributing member of the community with a history of transparency and communication.  With the 12 weeks of this proposal intended to roll into a future funding round for development of the tool this is a proposal that will make itself accountable to the community and the communities feedback.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Impact:\r\n\r\nThis proposal is impressive on so many levels! Not only is it a shining example of a high quality proposal with a user-friendly, readable format, it has made my job as a CA easy to identify and assess Impact, Feasibility, Auditability. I have seen this tool used on several of the proposals I have assessed so far. Using it for myself, I have found it, like all AIM tools to be very user friendly, time saving & practical! This tool simplifies an overwhelming deep dive into the UN SDGs possibly never to resurface or be seen again.\r\n\r\n*Impact on Cardano: As articulated under the title \" SDGs and Catalyst/Cardano\" this proposal not only impacts off chain issues & solutions, the Cardano blockchain, and the Project Catalyst community, it takes impact to a whole new level by showing \"the actual impact of funded projects with clear KPIs\" & continues \"to position Cardano as the blockchain of sustainability, attract more collaborations with UN organizations and states as well as a growing number of companies and people concerned about impact and sustainability. It will show the community, and the world the impact of the funds provided.\" This proposal contributes in a real & meaningful way to fulfilling Cardano's mission of \"Making the World Work Better for ALL.\" \r\n\r\n*Impact on Challenge Metrics & Goals: The F7: Improve and Grow Auditability challenge asks the question: How to make the auditing process of funded proposals efficient, distributed, and transparent? One of the possible directions is \"Reporting on metrics, spending of financial resources.\" This proposal \"will be able to measure the real ROI (return on intention) as well as demonstrate the actual impact of Catalyst on people's lives and nature.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this challenge is \"Several projects evaluating funded proposals, providing reports, articles and metrics on the development and implementation of the projects.\r\n\r\nThis proposal adds another layer of auditability to this challenge. Well done to the team behind it for your forward thinking and making the path forward to tracking the impact of our contributions towards solving climate change. No government is on track to meet the 17 goals by 2030. They are too slow and inefficient to implement the necessary changes. You have provided a tool to help us get this done from the ground up, NOW. \r\n\r\n*Scale: From one fund to the next, I have seen firsthand how any tool initiated by AIM meets challenges head on. I have faith this team will be able to scale to address future challenges.\r\n\r\n*Impact on the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs): Is clear and easy to measure since they used their own tool for their proposal to assist in mapping their impact to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals! The SDGs proposal tool https://cardanocataly.st/proposer-tool-sdg/ \r\n\r\nOne of the challenges for future fund CAs may be confirming the accuracy of the self-selected goals.\r\n\r\nThank you to this team for taking the time and making the effort to create a clear & understandable proposal. \r\n\r\n(7) I most absolutely & strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and goes two steps further by their efforts to impact climate change and make this impact measurable through Funded proposals in Project Catalyst and throughout Cardano as a whole.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility \r\n\r\n* Team, including Skills & Experience: The two team members are experienced and well known through out the Catalyst Community. Yoram is a keystone member of Cardano4Climate. Without his continued support, guidance and bar raising, this thriving community would only be wishful thinking. In addition, for those who are familiar with the team members, the proposal provides evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. \r\n\r\n* Budget Amount, Breakdown, Timeline & Plan for Additional Funding: The modest budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals within the timeline & a plan for additional redundant. This proposal is the continuation of steps already taken in the right direction to impacting the environment with the creation of tools to measure and audit impact on the UN SDGs. \r\n\r\n* Resources both Off-Chain (Applications) & On-Chain (Technical): Raz presented their research on how many Fund 6 proposals. Turns out this was 97%, with 26% being aware of impacting the goals & another 70%, not knowing their proposals would have an impact on the 17 UN SDGs See https://youtu.be/SAPUIlLFYio?t=1286\r\n\r\n (5) is my overall rating for feasibility: It is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. Not only have the proposers proven themselves in the past, they have the Cardano AIM, Project Catalyst, Sustainable ADA, WADA & Cardano4Climate communities behind them.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Clarity/Auditability\r\n\r\nMy opinion of & support for this proposal is clear. \r\n\r\n* Roadmap: is simple, clear & will be easy to audit, with a clear goal \"to perform the research and evaluation and to prepare a spec for the development of the KPI tool and reporting mechanism and offer it as a proposal for Fund 8.\r\n\r\n* Metrics \u2013 KPIs: are simple, succinct & listed below the title, \" SDGs - KPIs & measurements framework\" \r\n\r\n* Problem Description: Why? \" If we can show the actual impact of funded projects with clear KPIs, it will continue to position Cardano as the blockchain of sustainability and attract more collaborations with UN organizations and states as well as a growing number of companies and people concerned about impact and sustainability. It will show the community, and the world the impact of the funds provided.\" The challenge? \" A key challenge to track project progress + effectiveness are clear impact measurements, especially for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\" \r\n\r\n* Solution Description: What? \" Researching the basis of an Impact Measurements Tool to help define KPIs, measure and report them, with a focus on SDGs impact.\" How? \" The proposal seeks to research and design a framework that helps to integrate the KPIs already in the proposal process and measure them through the lifecycle of the project.\" \r\n\r\n(5) I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information within their \"Working Plan\" to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. \r\n\r\nAt the rate I write assessments, it is quite possible that I will run out of time before the 5pm UTC deadline to \"rate\" all the proposal I want/need to. I can let the pressure of this expectation go because, as a community advisor, a passionate supporter of the experiment called \"Project Catalyst\" and an active member of Cardano4Climate, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are headed in the right direction(s). \"Climate Change is a failure of cooperation\"- Scott Poynton. Together, WE will not fail. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, my hope is that you, the voter, will read this proposal for yourself, connect to the problem & support the solution to this challenge with your voice and voting power.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_500", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 7, "ng": 7, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal aligns with the challenge partly. We have 100% match if we assume that Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are relevant for proposed projects.

The SDGs are an important auditability metric of the already-existing UN system, and thus seeking avenues to integrate Cardano-based initiatives with the Global Goals already set by the international community isn't just effective but very important if we want Cardano to achieve widespread legitimacy as a productive and respectable financial system. Legitimacy really is the name of the game here: Eventually the Cardano community will be the world community, if we're successful, and so we need to operate in harmony with all the already-existing major evaluation mechanisms to grow and really have a social impact beyond the cryptocurrency subculture.
