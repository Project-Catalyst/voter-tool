In addition, new proposals are added each cycle and, as a result, the manual effort involved in following up on all these proposals becomes overwhelming for IOG. In order to accomplish this, the author suggests leveraging the resources in the \"challenge teams\" already established in the community for the purpose of auditing the proposals that have already been implemented. However, the idea of allocating a fixed amount of funds for auditing a proposal without a clear structure, without the possibility of taking advantage of tools that are available or even exploring a collaborative effort between the auditor and the proposing entity, I am concerned that the allocation of these funds will not be as effective and therefore will not have the desired impact.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author gives an excellent description of his skills and experience, as well as the necessary references for verification. However, in this case it would not be relevant since he would not be in charge of implementing the proposal. Here the relevant experience would be the members of the \"challenge teams\", although this does not seem to me to be a big issue either, since they are people who are voluntarily working for the benefit of the community. In terms of feasibility, I have two major concerns. It is assumed here that the members of these teams will have the necessary skills, experience, and importantly, the time to conduct these audits thoroughly. Additionally, no mention is made of the time it will take for these reports to become available to the community. While it is difficult to estimate this time, it is nonetheless a factor that influences this feasibility criterion.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Based on the characteristics of the project, auditability does not appear to be a significant issue; however, from my perspective, there is a possibility for improvement in the criteria used to define success.

They way it is written, it seems to be more of a delegated responsability than a project to be developed and lead by proposer.\r\n\r\nIts nice to have this in place but the process still need to be devloped, validated and rolled out/standarized.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it look more like a project I would make a more clear process implementation schedule and a scope statement. This would help all to understand the role of the proposer in implementing it and how he would interact with challenges team. As example, I'd include in the scope the development of a standarized external audit process, in partnership with challenges team, the creation of standards templates, the selection of a single tool to do so, and so on.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As the role of the proposer is not clear in proposal, its hard to assess his capabilities for the project.

This is easily verifiable by linkedin bio and other links put available.\r\nThe budget breakdown is clear is fair. \r\n\r\nThe main point of attention in the feasibility is the lack of a implementation plan. its not clear how this process will be rolled out or its completition date (process fully establhished and running).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are some metrics to track the project but some of them are bit vague of subjective (for instance, how the \"Quality of audit reports\" will be measured?).
