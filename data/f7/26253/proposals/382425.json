Problem statement is clear and proposal solves it accordigly.\r\nA dedicated session expose impact is also very welcomed as it makes the value proposition clear. This proposal is a continuation from one funded in F6 and, as I understood, it actually broadens its scope in such a way that really makes sense and makes it more robust, contemplating the whole auditability process.\r\nOther thing that will bring value to this proposal is the process of creating and implementing little by little with feedback from the community. This may help to avoid a over beurocracy on what would be a key challenge here.\r\nAs suggestions,  It would be nice to have these report metric as visual as possibles, with graphs and dashboards and possibly add a Kambam layout, so people can see the size of the backlog and what stage the tasks are in. I would also a directory to attach \"proofs\"/evidences of the achievements as documents.\r\nIt would be also to see a more detailed communication on plan after month 3, when iteration with more member and final roll out will happen.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Pace team has already experience with this type of proposal in this campaing so chances are good the project will be a success.

This proposal, building on previously funded work, seeks to accomplish both.  Their analysis of the current reporting process has already turned up a lot of low value reporting parameters that lend little to the communities understanding of project progress, and unnecessarily burden the project team  (once a project is reported as \"started\" why report that with every project update?).  They have also proposed numerous alternatives to these \"low-value\" inputs (project status updates, similar to the ideascale proposal model; clarifying the concepts of \"successes/blocks\" to better cover the spectrum wherein project \"progress\" lies; etc.).  This process has also turned up questions that need to be kicked back to the community (for example, can the process be made clearer and more accurate by auditing projects, vs auditing proposals?  Should this be factored into the toolset?), and as such, this proposal also represents Catalyst functioning as intended:  information and community input guiding projects to beneficial endgoals, even if that means changing design intent.  As another incremental step in decentralized ownership of Catalyst, this research and eventual tool implementation could have a tremendous role.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This highly qualified team indicates an important understanding:  self-auditing governance will be an iterative process.  To that end this proposal doesn't promise the world, rather it outlines what the end goal could achieve, and then breaks down the first careful steps in that direction.  Having said that, the roadmap and timeline lay out a steady course with simple milestones and objectives:  rollup existing tools, research and analysis into a pilot to be run on a trusted cohort within the community (they include evidence that some of these steps are already in progress), reiterate the implementation of the tool.  One of the biggest accomplishments this proposal could achieve would be an objective, easy to use KPI reporting implementation for projects, and discovery of those parameters could actually function as a KPI for this proposal.  The budget is straightforward, but has a particular line item (Initial implementation development / integrations - 120 hours) that would benefit from being less generalized, as it is half the budget.  A more granular breakdown of this item would serve both the assessment of the budget, but also the feasibility of the timeline:  what specific objectives are occurring during this major portion of the project?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The already available Gitbook on this project indicates that following along will be no problem for the community, and the need to collaborate with the community and the proposers indicates that transparency won't be an issue. The teams connections to Catalyst Circle, as well as other proposals in Fund7 mean they will be accessible, and likely to be a regular feature of Town Hall and Swarms. There could be more clarity in the proposal that the goal is not to roll the public database and tool out, but to iterate it until it is right (maybe that is 3 months, maybe that is 6 or more; it has a lot to do with the feedback from funded proposals, this project has a long tail).  As well, there could be more clarity in the timeline of a public database that could itself spawn other auditing tools with other parameters or reporting ability.
