This meets all of the requirements to meet the challenge brief with the core underlying mission of building a \"Catalyst community entrepreneurship program developing entrepreneurial skills and building networks between entrepreneurs and mentors.\" Hopefully you get the feedback desired which will end with a successfully funded campaign.

By facilitating this program it could lead to many new partnerships being formed and could yeild significant results by way of new projects to benefit the Cardano ecosystem.

I feel that you could provide some more metrics like 'The number of projects being spun up as a diret result of this project' also including a meteric for how many of these projects were collborations between participants of the Accelerator, and further to follow-up at various milestones advising of the status of the engagement (i.e. if they have attended an accelerator, are they are planning some future collaboration etc) ", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_575", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 9, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal aims to teach the proposers entrepreneurship program to catalysts members.

The budget is presented but only the price of the certification program is stated and we do not have a clear insight into the working hours and fees and how many people will do the job so the budget seems unreasonable.
