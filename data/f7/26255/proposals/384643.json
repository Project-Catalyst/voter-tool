By focusing on crypto-only projects for the accelerator that not only provides the education, bootcamp, and coaching, but also an opportunity to pitch within the accelerator, this proposal sets itself from others within this category. This increases the impact of the proposal as devs and other crypto-businesses will equipped with the skills to launch their projects to the next phase while having a direct line of contact with key players already in the Cardano ecosystem.  I would have liked to see how the team plans on engaging the Cardano community in the development of the programme and how the final product will be shared with them. It is unclear how interested community members would be selected for participation or whether this would be an open-source programme or whether it would be commercialized for profit. While I do believe that the project sounds like it could give impact to the community, this point needs to be further explained. To receive full marks, voters should not be left with questions on the what/how/why components. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the plan presented and experience of the proposers, it is highly likely that this proposal would be implemented successfully. The proposers do an excellent job of providing their credentials for community members to validate prior to voting. It is clear that they have the experience to deliver and are veterans of the blockchain/crypto space. I am giving 4/5 on this section for the following reasons: 1) there is no timeline and the roadmap only offers an overview of the programme but not how they plan to develop/achieve it; 2) the budget is nowhere near detailed enough for the amount being asked. Saying $100k for staff does not give voters any indication of how you got to this amount and whether it is reasonable - how many staff? at what rate? for how long?; 3) while the credentials of the proposers are helpful, there is no indication of the willingness of the \"guests\" to participate and whether steps have been taken to engage them already. Their absence does not infer that these issues are unavailable or not thought of, but it is up to the proposers to be explicit and to not leave voters making assumptions to reach the conclusion. Incorporating these points going forward would likely give voters extra confidence that what is presented is feasible. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, the information provided is neither sufficient or insufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. While I am grateful for the \"results and KPI\" section included within, it is too sparse and does not really measure whether the proposal could be audited. For example, the proposers list: 15-30 Startups graduate through the first cohort; At least 1+ live mentor sessions per team; Successful demo day; and Post-cohort survey. However as presented these appear more as a checklist than something that can be audited. Let me explain further, if you have 15-30 graduates from the program, how will you determine if their time spent was a success? Does this include drop outs or attrition? What are the selection criteria for these 15-30 individuals? Next, having 1+ live mentor session per team is an interesting indicator but that is also part of the course that they will go through with the guests - so it is unclear how this will help audit the proposal since it's already a criteria for their completion. The final two points also feel too underdeveloped for voters to have confidence regarding the auditability. How would you define a successful demo day? Number of projects funded? Number of VCs interested? Number of attendees? And, what is it about the post-cohort survey that will be helpful? - what will you measure? - how will the results be provided to the community? \r\nAs it seems these components are missing yet are vital for voters, I neither agree nor disagree with this component. In future rounds would strongly encourage more elaboration for voters.

This meets what the challenge is trying to do, though maybe not quite as well as proposals from already up and running accelerators such as SeedStars.

Whilst the proposer have been involved in this area, its not clear from their LinkedIn profiles how much they were involved in actually getting it all up and running. They probably have the networks to bring in the mentors given their experience.
