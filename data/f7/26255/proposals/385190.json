However, the functioning of this platform is very confusing. Starting with the fact that it is not clear whether it would be a physical or virtual environment. In terms of the division of expenses, the author included expenses such as office rental and furniture, which leads us to conclude that it would be a physical space. But it would be extremely important for the author to clarify this question, if it is really a physical space, where would it be located? It is also not clear how the monitoring of people on this platform would be; First, how would the people/small businesses to be counseled be selected? \"The template will be provided by us and will include the necessary reports requested for the support provided,\" says the author. But what is the content of this model? Second, what information would the expert team gather in order to help them? How would the knowledge acquired in the space in question be tested, how could we see, in practice, the advancement of the beneficiaries? The author cites something like engagement topics and working hours, but it's not enough for us to understand this issue. I believe that overall data provisioning is lacking, it is not possible to have a solid visualization of what would happen in this project, unfortunately. I suggest that the author review the explanation of how the follow-ups would be, through which metrics success would be measured and how such results could be exposed to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The author gives us practically no information about himself and his team. All we know is that he has experience in working connecting people and is also involved with the blockchain network in Africa. But what kind of involvement with hubs would that be, he says? How is your involvement with the African blockchain? Does he have any participation in the Grow Africa Challenge, Grow Cardano, from the previous fund? I would like to see some examples of his previous work, how he came to our blockchain and so on. And about his team, we don't know who they are, what their names are, how many people make up the team; what each one does, examples of previous work individually... I just realized that there will be a team because in the expenses division part he talks about several areas such as marketing, developers, human resources, etc. I missed someone specializing in design, which is always important to create a positive navigability and appearance for the online portals that will be created. About a script, unfortunately there is a total absence of this part of the proposal. The author does not specify which steps would be necessary to carry out his project, how the sequence of activities that would compose a whole would take place, and how long each one of them would last. We have no idea how this project would be built, it is necessary for the author to create a timeline of activities so that we can understand the process, and not just the result. And finally, there is a financial divide, although it is superficial. For example: 500 for utility. What is it? 10k for human resources: how many people would work here, doing what and for how long? The same questions can be addressed to 12k for developers. He asks 2600 to travel, but I don't understand why, travel where and do what? These and other issues need to be clarified.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author does not provide us with any KPIs or success metrics for us to exercise project auditability. If there was a script with very detailed phases, we could monitor whether such activities were taking place, and also whether they were taking place within the allotted period of time. However, there is no type of information that can give us any content to use as a basis and promote monitoring. I suggest that the author draws some topics about this, establish a bridge with the Cardano community, in order to present results of the parts of the general process, that is, gradually what would be being done, and finally, that the people who were guided here in this some feedback.
