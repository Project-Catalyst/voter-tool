There is need for more marketplaces in the ecosystem so this project is in the right project setting and it will be impactful for the community. It clearly shows how with more features than it's competitors like minting, it will bring new value for the users. One thing missing from the proposal is KPIs and a way to measure them. I love the fact the authors have posted videos of working functionalities and integration, that hypes people up.  Compared to other proposal this market place has a competitive advantage because of the NFT dual listing functionality. As a developer I don't have any concerns about the implementation. Overall an impactfull project with great promise that work has already started on. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is more than enough evidence posted in the proposal in the form of linkedin profiles facebook profiles that enabled me to easily verify the listed skillset in the proposal. This brings credibility to the project in my eyes and to the voters as well, I'm sure. There's a complete team with specific skillset already assembled and working. The budget is broken down and explained extremely well unlike many other proposals. The budgets states the work that will be payed for. There's a reasonable timeframe for in order to complete the listed work.  The proposal lacks a bit of the explanation on the technical side of things, but I can't blame them for keeping their development under the hood for when they have a competitive edge.  One thing I was missing in this proposal was expected challenges, because a project of this magnitude is sure to have some, but having said that, they're searching for a competitive advantage with the dual listing and that implicitly means they're thinking of overcomming challenges like competition. It would just be nice for those possible challenges to be listed in the proposal as well. I hope the project is in sync with other open source plugins and modular solutions, because that would avoid doing double work. Overall a feasible project that I'm going to follow and vote for!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "No worries about tracability since the proposers have left a plethora of links where anyone interested in the progress of the project can follow the newsinformation about this project. The KPIs are the one thing I mentioned missing. I encourage the project leaders to add them, because it will allow for the progress of the project to be measured and therefore optimized. There's a complete roadmap with realistic and modular milestones to be completed in the desired time. The description and solutions to the problem are clear enough for technical and non-technical people to understand.   A good proposal that will be an interesting one to follow along with.

Stay tuned, bro!"}, {"q0": "The team shows up their idea to solve the shortage of providing service to help those who want to digitalize and bring their assets on to Cardano blockchain, in the form of an NFT then trade. The idea sounds like a new marketplace in the Cardano network, but they mention the \"Dual listing\" that is never seen in others and I think that users will love this feature. Therefore, can drive a lot of users to their services, and impact the Cardano ecosystem. \r\nBut they should provide some key metrics, things that if lacking in the proposal will make us hard to assess which way they want to go, is it align with the challenge setting or not? And also help to audit their idea so far.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This idea is developed by experienced guys that master in their field. And they have a great detailed roadmap in the group of features that can help us assess what they will do whether affect their idea plan or not. In addition, the budget breakdown is reasonable with their roadmap and implementation plan info. \r\nThey also provide some links and a video to help us assess better their ability to implement the idea. \r\nOne last thing but they lack is the list of relevant risks to the project. The team said like their idea is new to everyone, so which risk will meet when they implement this project? ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team showed up with a good roadmap in specific periods of timelines that I believe that's all realistic with their ability. \r\nUnfortunately, there are no key metrics to help me know where they want to go. In this project, my advice should be the number of assets, users, transactions... that will be in their services. \r\nBy the way, their way of explaining the solution is too short to help us visualize the big picture of the team that will want to acquire. They need more words to explain it, at least in case study of user.

But there are many risks and challenges, too. You are absolutely right when recommending to risk/challenges. But you know, we have some unique features such as Dual Listing / NFT Distribution...so that we are very confident to face challenges. We also have been analysing and learning a lot from other NFT project's mistakes/risks. On December 06th 2021, we've released beta testnet and no issues happened. Cardahub's mainnet coming very soon in December. Anyway, we really would love to discuss more with you about risks/challenges. So please visit https://cardahub.io/home to reach out us and to see what we have been deploying . \n\nAnd, we have been doing a lot of interviews on CNFT Space.
