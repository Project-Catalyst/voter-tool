In summary, the idea is to create a lottery system, in which transactions would take place through tokens and the rewards would be in ADA (which benefits the Cardano ecosystem), and also convert half of the profit from each draw to plant trees , favoring the environment. It is very positive that the author of the proposal attaches a post on Medium (a site where you can create a kind of blog, in a practical way), showing a lot of involvement with the idea, which is more detailed there. What was a little confusing to me was how this project would be hosted, in this case I think it would be through a web application, but I would like this question to be emphasized. Overall, it's a high-value proposition that brings together two very relevant issues: environmental conservation and a taste for gambling, which I've already noticed is quite common among the cryptographic community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author himself seems very experienced and has a strong background, having a degree from the University of Toronto in Computer Science and having two decades of experience, but it would be amazing if we could dig deeper into his background. We can also see more details about his career in the final part of the proposal, where he has included his LinkedIn profile, giving us the possibility to get to know him more deeply. About the rest of the team, the author claims to be looking for professionals to work with the design, marketing and app management parts, which is a little worrying, because the asking value in funding is high, so it would be better if he already were with a formed team. The ideal would be to have a team that was properly presented, where we could get to know each component in depth and understand how each one relates to the idea of \u200b\u200bthis project, because it has an environmental nature, so I think it is important that the professionals involved also have a good engagement with the cause (don't work just for the salary...). The author is concerned with unraveling a timeline well, so that we have a solid and chronological notion of the tasks that need to be done to achieve the whole. And about the justification of the financing amount, here we have a division of values \u200b\u200bfor the parts of the project, but I felt a lack of detail in some things and a great detail in others. For example, on the issue of marketing, the author is very specific when explaining what strategies would be adopted to promote the application, but about the construction of the design, a kind of embryonic visual identity is not drawn so well, that is, how it is intended build the UI/UX. So I think we have great points here and things to improve.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "By having an extremely detailed marketing plan, the author makes it very clear what his intentions are to reach audiences with this app. That way we can have a pretty solid preview of what's to come. These values \u200b\u200bare also summarized at the end of the proposal, as well as what is intended to be collected in ADA and how much would be converted to plant trees. One thing I thought here was: I wish we could have a closer monitoring of how the planting was being carried out, a monitoring of the growth of trees, a proof of how this reforestation would be positively impacting the environments. Another detail would be where this reforestation would happen, it is not clear to us, the author kind of outsources this part of the proposal to another company, but for me it is as important as the creation of the application itself. It would be amazing if the app had this dedicated space to follow the post draw, so to speak. Therefore, I consider that the auditability is good, but there are some things to improve, the community would certainly be assured of the benefits it would receive with this proposal, but the environmental issue could be emphasized more.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is a great idea that meets the challenge objectives. Lottery models are definitely scalable and attractive to many people, off-chain as well as on-chain in other chains. It is great that the lottery model aims to support climate change activities which is a key area today worldwide and also share the values of Cardano. The proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem both in terms of scale as well as positioning Cardano as a leader in providing climate change mitigation The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal focusing on the tech development area. It could have been good to mention any relevant expertise to managing a lottery platform or potential team members/advisors/ partners that have such expertise. For example around legal issues related to managing such a platform. It could also have been good to align with other projects on Cardano related to climate change such as the Veritree project (as the verification of where the money is going and its impact is also of high importance). The proposer states that he needs some additional team members to come on board but still keep an open question if other people are needed. It is good to ask and could have been part of the proposal process but within the proposal, it is good to be as precise as possible about the needs. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. It is a good idea to split the budget into two funds and provide enough evidence for the community to support phase 2 based on the 3 monthly KPIs. The budget does not include legal costs for establishing the DAO for example as well as working on the governance of the DAO which will be quite important for such an initiative.  More information re the budget of the app development in the first 3 months would have been helpful as this is the key cost (i.e. how did you get to $15k?). The proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. Well done for volunteering the Plutus development work and that in phase 2 the key budget is for the treasury. It would have been helpful to have some estimation of the treasury by year-end and if they will cover the operational and development ongoing costs. \r\nThe proposer did not include challenges and risks relevant to successful implementation. From my experience as an entrepreneur (20 years) with activities also related to climate change (working for an NGO), there are some challenges both the implementation as well as impact  (I mentioned some above i.e. legal, team, impact verification, Governance).  \r\n\r\nBased on my experience, there are good details about the process and good tech development expertise, but missing still a lot more details about the management of the DAO and additional key team members to give more confidence re the feasibility.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The deliverables and timeline for the first 3 months are clear and measurable.  The split of funding to Fund 7 and 8 will give the community the opportunity to evaluate the deliverables and decide if to continue and support Fund 8.  Going through the proposal, however, it is not clear when is the launch date and a lot of key specific KPIs will be verified 3 months past this date. \r\nAs the software will be licensed under an open-source license and can be used as a template for other potential lotteries built on Cardano, it will give the community visibility on the quality of the code (still need to understand more about the license terms). Having a team, or being active in the community increase could increase the confidence for auditing the proposal and I would recommend you to consider it for Fund 8 application. As mentioned, by splitting the budget into two funds, you give the community the opportunity to evaluate the deliverable.
