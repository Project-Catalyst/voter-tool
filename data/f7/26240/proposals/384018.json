The proposer names are well known in the cardano project catalist community and they realize the potential of the challenge within their proposal. This proposal will add value to the community by making sure no one can tamper or censor the community built process in any way shape or form. The key metrics are relevant to compete with other proposals in the challenge setting. The proposal will be able to scale better if they figure it out after the research phase is done. I don't see anything missing from this proposal, but my suggestion would be to popularize your own proposal, because it needs to be voted in. If implemented the proposal will make the cardano review process bulletproof. As a developer myself I don't have any concerns about his proposal. Let's make it as soon as we can. Good luck to the proposals, I hope your soluition get voted in! \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am not worried about the team members. They've provided the necessary links and stand with their names behind this proposal and are well known and respected members of the cmmunity with enough projects behind their backs. The number and type of team members to lead this project to it's success is already known and mentioned in the proposal. The budget is clear and broken down enough to be easily understandable and should provide to be sufficient for the full implementation of the proposals stage. There's a realistic timetable set for all stages of the proposal. Most proposals don't pay too much attention to research first code later and I'm glad this is not the case here. There's a sensible plan for implementation that lays out the plan for implementation and the \"how are we building this?\" is described as much as the \"what are we building and why?\" which is great.

The project is in sync with what's already been done, because the same people have done it, so this will be a great evolution of the same idea they originally had.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "No problems concerning tracability or auditability since these people are very active community members and don't need to be reminded the community needds to be kept in the loop about what's going on and how's the project progress going.
