However, in general i feel that the problem statement and solution could have been elaborated in more in depth fashion\r\n\r\nThe problem statement \"to use cardano a user has to study a lot of information \" - i do not think that is correct neither do i understand what it means by \"To use cardano\" - In my opinion , such terms are vague and unclear to a general user. One alternative could have been  - \"To use (sell/buy/stake) ada new users have to go through a lot of pain points, such as create account on exchanges/do KYC/Talk on telegram channels to be able to do any transactions using ada, it is not convenient and difficult) - \r\n\r\nThe proposal solution is to use Trustee wallet, and mentions that user can perform all the necessary operations in the app. What necessary operations ? \r\n\r\nIn my opinion the proposal writeup should be in such a manner that proposer does not assume that the reader has the same knowledge as the proposer OR the reader can look into the mind of the proposer :) \r\n\r\nTherefore, i will not give it full points as i see some room for improvements there. Nevertheless, being a CA since i understood the point this proposal is trying to make, i agree.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The experience of the team is quite good and they are the creators of trustee wallet. The github activity is healthy and code is open source, which is always in align with cardano vision.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the team has presented a plan that is very short with respect to timelines, and i like that in general they want to have this integration asap, to continue expanding in future funds.\r\n\r\nThe budget break down for February 2022 is a little bit on the higher side imo, therefore, personally for me, it would have been nice to know that how many developers (hourly rates) they are expecting for 2 + 2 weeks work. Since the amount is a bit on the higher side, it would have been nice to have this information presented. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, product is already functioning, and has integrated other crypto currencies, and i am therefore very confident that this proposal will be implemented successfully in given timeframe", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has given the roadmap for the proposal implementation, and since the timeline for this implementation is  2 months, i strongly agree that tracking the progress of it is easy for community.\r\n\r\nThe team has also split each implementation activity into a 2 weeks timeframe, which always is a good sign to me (coming myself from 2 weeks sprints and agile working background), giving community a good ability on auditing the progress in shorter timeframe. \r\n\r\nThe KPI mentioned are trustable as the wallets have good amount of downloads (100k+) and usually the downloads shootup faster once this number is reached.

Staking function).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer team is very well skilled about the whole context and, knows the Cardano community very well because they work as developers and there is a functional pilot (https://trusteeglobal.com/).\r\nThe scope of the solution is well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026).\r\nIn my opinion (I'm 20 years experienced senior information manager on financial sectors) the budget requested is coherent with the elapsed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones, but no  KPI metrics are shown.

The budget is divided into identifiable items but it's not realistic. In my opinion, the team is asking for too much money, considering that the budget of the challenge is limited. It would be good if the team has presented a detailed implementing plan and details of actionable tasks and order of execution to clarify the whole preparation and implementation of this project. The team states the real time within this project could be completed. It would be good if the team has presented the necessary resources to implement this proposal.
