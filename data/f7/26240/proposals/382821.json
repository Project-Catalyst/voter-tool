The proposal focuses on providing the startups with the fundings and financial assistance needed. The decentralized feature provides this platform envisioned by the team with more scalability and integrity. The proposal on successful implementation could draw more attention from startups planning to host on a decentralized network and make them prefer the Cardano chain over the other chains.
