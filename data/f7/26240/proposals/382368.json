It seems the project is in the right setting falling under the integration umbrella. The proposal is very clear and descriptive when stating how will it bring standars and value to the cardano ecosystem. These standards are required all over, but I'm happy the proposers have focust on only one pain point which grows the possibility of success. The metrics are many and well thought trhough. They also fall under the integration part of the challenge setting. The authors are not only ready for the project to scale but plan on it and welcome it.  This proposal would bring much needed standarads to the ecosystem, whoever tried to certify an NFT in the cnft marketplace will know the pain and manual labor. As a developer I don't have any concerns as for the implementation of the proposal, but I will mention a couple of things that could have been done better. Overall there will be a great impact if this gets implemented for all of the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's plenty of links and evidence for the proposers identities and skillsets. Part of them are active in the community channels as well as leaders in the community. I'll definitely be joining the discord they've provided in the proposal. They have a pretty good idea of the team they need to form up as they've already done and have a good grasp of the time it will take to run through all the phases described in the roadmap. The budget could have been broken down better, because some of the project expenses still remain unclear to me.  There's a very good explanation on how the project will be implemented and the whole process that's going to be followed. This provides for a better overall credability.  The technical aspects are rightly so, not mentioned in much detail as the analysis phase of the proposal is still to be completed. The proposal is very well throught through and it is apparent that a lot of effort has and will go into it. The challenges for a successful implementation have been considered. The project is in sync with what's already done and have planned on molding an evolving standard for ntf to be used and verified easily through an open source repository posted in the proposal. Overall a feasable project that I hope gets voted in!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I already mentioned, I know some of the proposers personally and they've proven to be great community members that take great joy in working with others and considering their feedback. The mentioned KPIs are relevant and not too modest. Metrics are in line with the success of the proposal. The roadmap and milestones are a match for the time horizon for gathering analizing and implementing the information. A clear and understandable description to a dire problem. As a developer I'd greatly benefit of a standardized way to verify NFTs but as a community member, I'll be more secure when I know all the marketplaces follow the same evolving standard for NFTs.   A heavy task that the right people have sat down to solve. They're going to keep the community involved everystep of the way.

Already NFT marketplaces are growing, implementing such solutions would be a greater benefit to the community in the long run.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposer provides the details that they are SPO's, NFT creators and have built tools for the Cardano community, which would have sufficient experience and capability to implement the current proposal, However, providing some more proofs/links would have made it better. Adding created NFT links, and some links to the profiles of who are the people involved would add more value to the proposal. The budget breakdown is mentioned very clearly and reasonable.

The successful implementation of this proposal should result in many/all the nft marketplaces/nft creators following the defined standard thus making the verification process for nft users/community transparent.
