It's great to see when things go forward, and it means the impact here is a reality. As the project has been under development since f4, it means that successive financings were well used and therefore renewed, the authors list a series of impacts that have already been achieved in previous rounds, clarifying well what has been done. The real estate market is certainly one of the most profitable, and also traditional, which requires a lot of dedication on the part of the authors to break a little of this tradition by including transactions in cryptocurrencies here. The platform they developed and are continuing to improve is certainly of high value and generates positive impacts for the Cardano ecosystem. I say this because they mix real estate market activities, first the direct purchase and sale of real estate, and then other types of more complex actions (such as investments through loans, etc.) with the technologies of our ecosystem. In this way, they are opening up new possibilities that go beyond the most common practices in the cryptographic world, such as the commercialization of NFT, games of chance/gaming in general, bringing new users to Cardano, either through the adoption of the currency or through the development of contracts intelligent, as is the case of the specific proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As for the authors' ability to carry out the project, I believe there is not much to be discussed. They have been doing this project for a long time, they already have several success milestones that prove how prepared they are to carry out such activities, and what I think is positive about them is their awareness of going little by little, as they comment, their overall project is extensive and expensive, but they were gradually asking for financing. In this way, they delivered results and proved their worth in practice, clearing any doubts regarding this part of the project. About the financial division, unfortunately I thought that this part left a little to be desired. They divide the total amount into percentages, and these are explained in a cursory way. I would like to understand, for example, what would be the relationship between the part that goes to the smart contract itself and the part that goes to wages within 90%? And how would the marketing campaign mentioned in the 10% happen? It is true that they already have the project consolidated, but I believe that improvements also generate the need for strong dissemination. Regarding the steps to be followed, they were well explained, this part was adequately detailed in my opinion; we know what will happen and in what order, and the little activities that will make up a whole. Therefore, I think that in this topic of the proposal only the explanation of funding could be improved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is very well covered with regard to auditability. The authors give us a lot of information by which we can monitor the project's development. In \"metrics\", we can know what steps they intend to take in relation to the improvement of the project, so that we can monitor whether such actions were in fact carried out post-financing. They also explain how your platform works in everyday life, that is, there is how to enter, navigate, even do a transaction simulation to check if everything is happening properly. In addition, the authors provide us with an overview of how the real estate market is in some locations they aim to operate. This made me think that maybe it would be interesting that some member of the community, who has experience in the real estate area, could act as a mediator between this project/its authors and the Cardano community, providing feedback with some regularity, which could be presented in some Town Hall or simply made available to the general community. That said, the authors provide us with the means to perform auditability, it is necessary that we do this through constant monitoring.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 11, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Real estate investment is a high stake high risk endeavor with complicated local laws and procedures.

Of course we can conclude when the project is realized and purchases and sales take place through the smart contract of the Cardano system if that happens that will be very useful  for Cardano ecosystem.

We do not have any links via LinkedIn or Github to confirm that the team has the experience, knowledge and skills to complete this project. I guess the team from Estati has experience in selling real estate but not in the blockchain. That is why they put a link in the proposal from a company that deals with blockchain, and their team is professional and transparent. In this proposal, an external associate is taken who will be paid if funds are received. The proposal states a clear reasonable budget from which 90% of the funds will be allocated to external collaborators. But it would be much better to specify in more detail exactly what the funds will be allocated for. There is a clear plan and details of actionable tasks and order of execution. Proposal offer a timetable through which the work would be completed but it would be good if it was a little better worked out.
