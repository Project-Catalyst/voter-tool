The problem statement is lacking, but I implicitly got the idea and it's a good one fitting the challenge it's in. I believe these kind of platforms will become common place in the future, as I've heard simmilar ideas before, but this is the first actual proposal. Bringing creative people like content creators will bring a lot to the ecosystem. The metrics are in line with the proposal chellenge setting. I'm not too sure about the project scaling so easily since the work is done by one develoer right now. IMHO the proposal lacks a team, because the idea is to build quite a lot of content and no mention of reusing other community members effort was mentioned. The proposal will absolutely add something missing to the ecosystem, namely more content creators and their followers, which is efficient to grow a community.  Overall it's a decent proposal and I would very much like to see it have impact on the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided a link to his linkedin acocunt and he has the necessary skills to undertake such a task, but time will be a problem in this case. However the fact that he is standing behind his project with his name makes the project feel more real and brings credability. Valerio has an idea of what team he would need to bring together in order to bring the proposal to it's success, but I guess hasn't found the people yet. One thing I find strange is that he has mentioned needing more funds if he has to hire people (which would be great in this case), but he doesn't seem to plan on doing this as he hasn't asked for this budget and rather plans to work by himself. While this is noble, it's not optimal for success. The budget could use a little breakdown like an hourly rate and work estimation. I'm not sure if the timetable set is realistic or not for one person to do.   The proposal paints a really clear map on the tokenomics of the project, something not seen often and worth praise. The proposer has mentioned sensible challenges like finding content creators while staying competitive with other platforms, which is again hard for a single person to do. My suggestion for the proposer would be to take a look at what tools have the community has already built and reuse them to speed up the development process and focus on finding contracts with content creators. Overall I'm not sure if this proposal is feasable, but I encourage the proposer to search for a team and try again for the next funding round! ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The tracability of the project is not mentioned in the proposal. I didn't see a way for the community to follow the project development or progress. I would suggest based on what other proposals are doing to have a telegram or a discord channel. This will help with finding future people to work with as well as content creators and simply followers for the project in one place. The KPIs seem relevant, but there are no mentioned metrics to measure those KPIs with. The roadmap is plain enough and the milestones are relevant to the project, and I deffer to the author for the time estimation. The proposal could have had a better description of thetargeted problem, but the solution statement seems solid and understandable.   In summary the project catalys has a way to check the progress of the project before releasing funds, but IMHO the proposer should enable the community to follow along with the projects progress as well.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea is in perfect harmony with the main objective of the challenge. Here, the intention is to create a Dapp, where people outside the blockchain universe can, as the author quotes at the beginning of the proposal, lie and manipulate native activities without major difficulties. The difference here would be a very \"friendly\" interface, as he describes it, I believe it would then be an ergonomic and easy-to-understand platform; in addition, Dapp is not 100% focused on one type of audience, there would be creators (which can be people or small groups) and supporters. In this way, the target audience would be diverse, and with the ease of handling tokens and NFT, Cardano would certainly benefit greatly, fully achieving what this challenge proposes. It is very positive how the author describes for us what each actor (creator or supporter) could do, what the main activities would be in action in Dapp, giving us a solid understanding of what this idea is about and how it would happen in practice. I believe it is a high value proposition and that it will bring positive impacts to our community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The description about the author is very short, he could have written a short text that explains, in addition to his work functions, some previous experiences and projects in which he participated. That gap is filled, however, when he provides us with his linkedin profile; but I think the ideal would be to have a more detailed presentation and also the linkedin. At the end of the proposal, the author mentions the other professionals who would work on the team, but from what I understand he still does not have defined people, these professionals would still be hired. It would be better, it would convey more security, if he already had a formed team, but as this is not the case, I suggest that this hiring is done based on a lot of research and when the team is formed there is some kind of meeting with the rest of the community, in order to present it. The author didn't include anyone in the team building to promote Dapp, how would the publicity take place? It is important that this project is widely publicized, since its main objective is to make life easier for people with regard to the management of natives, even those who are not from our community, specifically. The author presents a roadmap, a step by step to be followed every 3 months, we can know what he wants to achieve in each period of time in general, because there is not much detail. And in relation to the financing division, the details are satisfactory, we know where each part of the requested money goes. But the amount is basically divided between the salaries of those involved, it is not thinking, as I said before, about any marketing plan, more than necessary for the success of the proposal. Therefore, I suggest that these details be revised in order to raise the level of the proposal even further.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author presents us with some KPIs which are, in short, the number of users of the application and the amount of tokens that would be created/circulated. However, as it is a very complex and expensive project, I think it would be more appropriate for there to be monthly monitoring. Thus, it is necessary for the author to establish more specific goals to pass each month, it would be even better if he looked at the work to be done on a smaller scale and provided details; for example, in the first month, what would you do per week? How could we run auditability on top of that? Perhaps, elect some prepared team members to closely monitor the progress of the project, all phases of its development. Therefore, I believe that yes, the author provides us with content to work on auditability, but because of the project, I feel that there is a need for even more detailed and specific content that can be monitored periodically, with the results of this analysis coming to the attention of the rest of the community members.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 10, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "There are a large number of content creators who could sell NFTs,royalties and fan tokens if the technical threshold to create, sell NFTs and present NFTs are made userfriendly. This proposal is aiming to address this important issue and more such experiments are required to create a user-friendly NFT world. Therefore it can be said that the project is addressing an important challenge in the ecosystem.

The proposer also has to onboard a Plutus developer for the development of smart contracts which have to be included in the site.
