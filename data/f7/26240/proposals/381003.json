The proposal has several interesting proposals in Fund 7 that play well with eachother but can be looked at as individual proposals in case not all of them get voted in. The proposal does an autstanding job of explaning how will it bring value to the cardano ecosystem by providing a combination between many people witth the same goal to work in colaboration while keeping their identities secret. The key metrics of the propoesal are relevant to the challenge setting. The proposal has a separate section on how will it be able to address future challenges and scale. It's greatly detailed and looks like an example to  be followed by other proposals. Currentyl I don't see major part missing from the proposal, but there are a couple of areas of improvement, like budget breakdown. This proposal is like no other I've seen keeping in mind I've looked through over 50 projects and have read the titles of almost all of them. This is a very interesting and inovative idea. As a developer I am very interested in this proposal and will be waiting for the voting phase to give my vote. Good luck to the proposals with this great project. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided linked in profiles and they have all the necessary experience to cover what's necessary for this implementation and more. There are a set number of team members, but there is room to grow and scale if necessary. Concrete people and skills they must have in order to join this project are listed as well. This brings credability to the project. The budget is otlined clearly and broken down into reliable items to be executed. There's a realaistic and detailed timetable to bring the project to a successful end, althrough I don't believe that it will ever end and more like keep growing costantly.  The proposal shows a very detailed plan for execution, along with a very specific section concerning all riskmanagement for many delicate cases like how to preserve anonimity in the DAO. The plan for the proposal and it's implementation is reasonable given the timeframe and goals. The proposal could have done a better job explaining the technical aspects of it, but it's not that big of a deal.  Most importantly, the project has done some research on what's already been done and will build on top. Overall a good feasable proposal. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Project catalyst already has auditing requirements for achieving milestones before funds are released, but I was hoping for auditing by the community not just project catalys. In that regard, there is a github repo linked, so anyone interested can have a look inside and follow the progress of the proposal. Tracability is good since there will be telegram and discord engagement. The metrics mentioned are relevant to the end goal and project success. The roadmap and milestones are also broken down well and provide a detailed step by step plan for reaching success. A clear and understandable description is provided as well as a very detailed and most of of applicable and practical explanation is provided.  It's clear the proposers have put themselves in the places of the voters and have listened to the comments of their community members, because this is an improved version of the original proposal.

Also, the proposer has made it clear that the long-term goal would be implementing a wallet for DAO tokens. Hence increasing the Cardano adoption and integration which is one of the primary requirements of the challenge. The proposal in its entirety could have a cosmic impact on the Cardano ecosystem and its calibre. Hence I score full marks in terms of the proposal's impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fine detailing given to the action plan and the possible challenges the team might face is intriguing and is in accordance with the proposed idea. The funds requested also look practical and reasonable after one goes through its breakdown. The phase-wise milestones and the time constraint by which they are planned to achieve also appear to be sensible. The only reason why I would give a 4 out of 5 for the feasibility is even though the product manager and lead are very much talented and well capable of driving the proposal towards success, the irresolute members to fill in the shoes of front-end developers and open-source wallet contributors leaves a sense of doubt regarding the 100% successful implementation of the proposal within the tentative deadlines. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Despite the unsettled team members, the proposer makes no mistakes when providing the metrics the auditors could use to monitor the progress. The clear-cut success definition and roadmap instills trust amongst the community regarding the proposal's success. The proposer also shows his/her/their intent, will, and passion in reaching the destination by providing a small gist about the possible requirement of funds during the further rounds. The 3 main KPIs provided in the proposal are in alignment with the expected metrics of the campaign. The DAO being made open-source and Licensed makes the audit process easier and prolific.

The proposers have proposed DAO NET in another proposal however, so what happens if they dont build DAO NET? does DAO voting (this proposal) not work at all?, or can they adjust it to be less DAO contract specific, i.e., not only work with their DAO product?
