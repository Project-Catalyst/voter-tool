If the proposers want to do a tool for NFT analytics, they're in the correct challenge setting. IMHO the proposers could have done a better job articulating the actual problem they're trying so solve so I could have estimated the value that could bring to the ecosystem. There are relevant key metrics mentioned in the project, which I'll touch on later.  It would be a good idea to add a few more lines explaining the proposal and the problem it solves along with the impact for the community if successful. I'm really interested to understand the economic incentive ETH users would have to use the application, because that part was unclear. As a developer I'm worried about clear implementation strategy. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are links in the proposal, which allowed me to verify Vasiliy Karpitski and hiss credentials, but the other linked in link wasn't working I think it was not completed. My suggestion for future proposals would be to read through the whole proposal as a voter for your proposal and look through all the left links to be sure they work before finalizing a proposal. The budget is outlined, but I was missing the exact calculation leading the the requested budget. As a developer myself, the timetable seems realistic, anad it's cool that the proposers are ready to self fund any additional costs themselves, which is noteworthy. There's a sensible plan for implementation and some technologies like graphql are mentioned, which I believe considering the properties of the project is the right call. The plan for implementation could have been a bit more specific, but as it is now it's good enough as well. The proposal doesn't go into too much detail into the technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies for the implementation which is a bit disapointing for me as a developer, but since they want to keep the intelectual property of their project I guess it's fair. The proposers have mentioned some potentiall challenges and how they plan on solving them.  Overall I think the proposal is doable, but lack of credentials brings the whole credability of the proposal a bit down. The idea for the community to try the MVP before proposal voting and provide feedback is great, but I didn't see mentioned how would this feedback be provided.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I did open the https://checknft.io/, but unfortunately I didn't see anywhere a community member could get an update for the progress of the project, neither a facebook group discord or telegram was mentioned. Usually projects need to find a way to let the community and interested investors a communication channel, but I didn't find such in the proposal. This leads me to believe that communicating the progress of the proposal might be difficult, which would lead to difficulties in auditability. The mentioned KPIs and metrics seem relevant to the projects success and are a good definition of success. A roadmap with concrete milestones are available and put in a nice timeframe for execution. As I mentioned earlier the project description could have been better, because after reading the whole thing twice I still wasn't sure about all the problems the proposer believes he addresses.  I'd suggest for the proposers to put themselves in the shoes of the voters.  As a voter I want a link to a communication channel that I could get the feedback to you, which is missed in the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The availability of an online NFTs comparison platform with an aim to bring out the best in market dynamics may have a substantial cascading effect with the potential to educate the people on the sophistication of Cardano outside the Cardano community.

Even then it will be a very steep hill to climb due to the tribal nature of blockchain at the moment.\r\nAlso, the number of NFTs that the team has indicated they aim to process on their platform is very low considering the average NFT collection has 10.000 collectables and there are already countless collections on both ETH and Cardano, and their number will only increase as time goes by.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The website provided is basically just a landing page at the moment and no functionality is present.

The proposer team has not mentioned any of the big marketplaces that provide data for users to explore such as https://opensea.io/assets/cryptopunks or https://rarible.com/top-collections or even other explorers such as https://nftbank.ai/explorer.\r\n\r\nThe question is does this suggested solution move the needle in the market and make an impactful solution? With the information provided, the lack of website or data analytics proving this solution does indeed have an impact it is hard to determine whether it is likely that this proposal has a high impact for the Cardano ecosystem.

It would be good to see more information on KPIs for certain user interactions that would help to gage whether their platform is useful. For instance it could be user time spent viewing collection NFT data or potentially how many NFTs a user bookmarks or some similar engagement metric.
