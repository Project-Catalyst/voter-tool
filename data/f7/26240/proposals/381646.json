Yes, BCoin is a new coing. BXchange is a new fledgling exchange. Yes, there is a white paper. The white paper states specifically that \"BRYO Xchange Coin AKA Bcoin is the token that will be used in the BRYO Xchange ecosystem. Its smart contract has been designed with the attributes of Ethereum blockchain and has been deployed on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) to link exchanges within BRYO Xchange and more.\" Ok, so - from the outset - we see that the BCoin platform is not a native Cardano platform. I understand that some new approaches could be used (wrapped tokens? Bridge protocols?... but nothing is set in stone here). In fact the white paper does not mention Cardano at all. Then there are some relatively amateurish elements on the exchange's website. For example, when answering the question \"Why shan't I miss this pre-sale?\" [of the BCoin token), the site states: \"You should absolutely take part to this pre-sale because after this latter, the Bcoin price will considerably raise and your chance to gain will be too low. Also, people want to gain money. More prospective the project is, numerous is the token use in the system and higher is the chance of the price raising\"... OK, come on, is that the utility? The only mention of Cardano in the proposal is the following sentence: \"-Make Bcoin compatible with other blockchain (Cardano Ethereum ...) to accelerate its adoption\". However, I do not see a plan for that. So, the proposal needs further tweaking in order to directly target the main issues of this challenge: Did our efforts manage to attract users to the [CARDANO] platform? Did our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano? ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Feasibility is a completely different animal from Impact. Yes, the impact of a proposal might be low in a challenge, but the feasibility might be very high. Meaning that yes, it could be implemented easily and it is likely to happen. So, even though I scored the impact low - we might see that this proposal scores high for Feasibility. Alas, not so much in this case. The proposed solution is more akin to a wishlist and the true level of completion is just described in words. A link to a demo of the  Exchange V1 [ https://xchange.bryocorp.com/demofiat.avi ] was not functional when I tried to open it. One of the explanations did not make sense: [Exchange V1 and the e-learning platform are already undeveloped according to our roadmap.] Not sure what \"already undeveloped\" means in this context. Then there is a lot of references to Africa as a continent and references to  some unnamed countries [\"Our Token is in ico, and people buy directly from their mobile phone with local currencies from 5 countries in Africa via our payment tool\"]. However, it is left to us to search for this specific countries (didn't find them) - and as we know, crypto exchanges are regulated on the national, not on a continent-wide level. I would advise the proposers to be very clear about the markets that they are targetting or serving, so that the success of the proposal can be later audited. The proposed use of the $20,000 budget seems haphazard and very general: \"80% to accelerate the development of the ecosystem and for the Bcoin brigde with other blockchain.\" and the \"remaining 20% \u200b\u200bwill be used for marketing around the project and to grow the community\". That seems to be presuming a lot of trust in a team that has yet to prove its technical know-how in the Cardano ecosystem. Also, there is already a BCoin (Rank #2819) on https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bombcrypto/ It is short for Bombcrypto. Is it the same coin? If not, wIll there be problems? I've seen BCOIN on the exchange that you included [https://info.bankcex.com/project-list.html] It mentions the project was submiited on Nov 25, 2021 and has a total supply of 1,100 [although your own site mentions a TOTAL SUPPLY\r\n16.000.000]. I presume the supply is 16 million. Your exchange site states that  \"BRYO Xchange allow you to convert your crypto currencies into local and foreign currencies everywhere in the world.\" - however I do not see where is BRYO Xchange based and where are its official registration details. The only contacts are email and a Telegram group. Who will be doing the KYC and has a partnership agreement with a KYC company been completed?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are good things about this proposal. Trying to improve access to trading of cryptos and NFTs in African markets. That is a worthy desure. However, Africa (like all other continents) has specific regulatory and infrastrcutural and market limitations that differ from country to country. If the proposers are to achieve their goal - they have to have a very targetted project in place that overcomes these barriers. If I understand well, this is a proposal for something along the lines of a Binance for Africa with a Binance coin for use on the exchange. There seems to be a lot going on here in terms of ambition, the budget is relatively small for such an ambition ($20,000) and the link to Cardano is very debatable and far on the horizon. I think it will be relatively difficult to audit the proposal as it stands. The metrics and KPIs are not precise. For exmaple: \"Launch of the v1 exchange, which will greatly facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrencies in African countries that we will cover with our fiat payment system (local currency).\" Sounds good - until we think about the fact that we don't know which countries are being targetted. Then again, \"-Launch of the BLearn e-learning platform\" - sounds OK until we think that we don't know what is the BLearn platform about. OK, yes - the team states that Blearn is to be: \"A fully decentralized and secure e-learning platform to facilitate access to field knowledge.\" But that just opens a new can of worms. What is a \"fully decentralized and secure e-learning platform \" and why does a centralized exchange and a crypto coin need a \"fully decentralized and secure e-learning platform\" - why is this part focusing on security especially and on decentralization? What's wrong with a centralized e-learning platform that has a narrow scope? So, the project seems to be going into many tangents .. with many statements and aspirations .. and the budget doesn't seem to match.
