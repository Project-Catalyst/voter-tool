I like the idea that saving means foresight, I agree with this assessment as it's said in the proposal there are good times and bad and we need to prepare for both. The proposal is in the right challenge settings bulding an application for the communitys use. This project will bring value to the cardano community as a whole, and because they plan on the mobile application to be simple and easy to use, they might bring some outside members as well. The KPIs are relevant to the challenge they're faced with, and as a developer I think the level of detail about the technical implementation is admirable. With the team described, I see no future problems scaling. I'm sure all challenges will be met. Maybe one thing I would have liked to see more of is for the authors to take a look around of what's already been done and use it, instead of building everything from the bottom up, but both approaches have their benefits. I don't see missing required parts from the listed items in the proposal.  As a developer I don't have any concerns about this proposal and I urge people to vote for this.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are plenty of linkedin links which is all I usually look for anyway. If names are stated the first thing I would do is look for them in linin. I like proposers that stand behind their project with their name. This brings credability to the project in my eyes of a voter. The team members are already grouped up and working, so I'd say the type and number required to implement the proposal is checked. The budget could be broken down to hourly rates to enable easy comparison between other such projects, but other than that it's outlined well where the money will go. The offered timetable seems realistic to me as a developer to do the described work in the proposal. The plan for implementation is more than sensible, it's concrete. For those of us who've read 40+ proposal, it's rare to see so much technical details listed in a proposal. As a technical person myself I can appreciate the effor to describe the architecture and technologies to be used. I like there are picture of how the possible implementation design would look like. This is extra effor that community members like because they can more easily imagine if they would use such a wallet at an early stage.  Some possible challenges are mentioned along with the process the team will follow to overcome them. People with such long experience shouldn't find problems rising up to challenges. The one small critique I have is the lack of research done on what's already out there and can be reused, but that's not such a big deal since every developer working on something new will aquire a new skillset and the less reused code, the better the dev will become. So that's kind of an investment of the future projects the devs will be workin on. Good luck to you and your proposal on the voting stage! ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "How will the projects progress be traced by the community? This is one of the questions I ask myself and the authors didn't disapoint here as well. There will be progress updates every two weeks on social media which is great that it's explicitly promised and mentioned in the project. Many proposers don't pay the necessary attention to the community access to information about the project progress. The mentioned KPIs are relevant and describe the success of the proposal if met. I didn't see any metrics like adoption rate, application downloads and so on, which is kind of disapointing so I'd suggest for the team to add them in future proposals. It's usefull to compare your expectations with reality down the line. A sensible roadmap and milestones were provided and a timeframe to work on all necessary described tasks. A clear problem and a solution to match have been listed in the proposal.   Overall I think the project is tracable, but if they can add a channel for getting feedback from the community in the form of a discrord or telegram chnnel it would be beneficial for both sides.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 10, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "It is a nice idea to provide some financial education to the people using some savings and costs analysis implemented in the wallet, yet I am not strongly convinced that it will be as successful as predicted.\r\n\r\nTo boost this, it would be nice to see what current wallets are missing and what your wallet will offer that will shift them or attract new people to it.
