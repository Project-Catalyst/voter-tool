The proposal is perfect for the challenge because it seeks to create a platform that will register a series of information on the execution of a project in the Cardano blockchain, as the author cites: \"software specification, project scope, project schedule\" and etc. This very well meets what we seek in the challenge that will certainly increase the reliability of transactions for those who are unable to hire an external intermediary to work on their projects, and the author argues very well the importance of creating such a product. Often, those who want to run the project do not do it for lack of confidence in what is presented, while developers can also feel insecure about the payment that is promised. These and many other details are really impeding the success of some projects, so filling these gaps will not only add value to our blockchain but also increase the number of projects involving the various instances of the Cardano universe. The author makes it very clear what his goals are with the development of this platform through topics, in order to synthesize and reinforce what is explained throughout the first part of the proposal and perfectly aligning with what is asked in the challenge. In addition to all this, at the end of the processes, NFT would still be generated, adding even more value to the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Certainly this project is in good hands, not least because it was perfectly presented and described here. We know the main author's areas of expertise and also the other components that make up the team, however, it would be beneficial if we were more detailed about each one of them, because what we have is only and their names and functions. It's always interesting to know what their previous experiences are, examples of projects they've already done, how long they've been in the area, etc, and this could be told by a short text for each team member or even by attaching their linkedin profiles. Regarding what will be done, for how long and in what order, we are given a breakdown into months and the main tasks that will be performed in those time periods, but as it is a very extensive and complex project, it would be important that these steps were more detailed yet. For example, I think about how the marketing of this project would be, it is a very good product and full of potential, but how would it get to the knowledge of the developers? And how would the advantages of its use be presented? The disclosure part was not explained here, I missed that, in addition to detailing the tasks mentioned. In the same way, it would also be positive if it were more detailed how the financing money would be used, we do have a breakdown of the money for certain purposes, but the author could clarify more how each of them would happen. I'll cite the marketing part again, how would the $4300 be applied? The salary of someone who was going to work with it, plus paid advertising on any channel, if so, which one?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For me, this was the part that was most to be desired in the proposal. The project is very large and complex, thus requiring continuous and close monitoring. There are a lot of activities going on and a long period of time, and we already know, in an approximate way, what the intentions of each thing to happen as each month pass. So, for example, it could be determined to hold periodic meetings with some members of the community who are technically capable of monitoring the progress of the project, in order to verify that everything is being done as promised and within the intended deadlines. And if not, detect the flaws and collectively devise ways to resolve them. In addition, it would be beneficial for the team to present the results progressively, that is, if over the months data were shown and the exact current status of the project explained. It is positive that the author determines his user intention, from 9 to 12 months 200 fixed developers using the tool and 1000 when the project is already well underway, this is a way to measure success. Another way I thought would be to realize how many associations with ID Atala Prism would be made on account of this project, so it would be possible to monitor from another view how successful the tool is being adopted.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Excellent proposal regarding a much-needed application.
