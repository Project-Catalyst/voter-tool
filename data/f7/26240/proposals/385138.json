They clearly articulate how they would address this problem by providing an -easy to use, high availability- APIs and developer tools (SDKs) to interact with IPFS. Creating these tools for developer will make it easier for people who are developing on Cardano (particularly for NFTs creator), while also further attract more developer to build on Cardano (lower entry barrier to entry the development), which eventually would lead to the increasing adoption of dApp built on Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal proven to have an experienced and exceptional team, and we can check their profile on Linkedin. Not only the team role is well established and explained in details, each person also have 7+ years experience prior in their respective field. The budget are reasonable for todays salary of each respective role, but it lack details on what are the thing would cost. It would be helpful if at least they could provide more details on, for example, the cost of the server infrastructure: what kind of server would you use? How much does it cost and maintain? etc. Other than the budget, they provide a plan for implementation in a sensible and conductible way, e.g how the JS SDK would look like, what are the HTTP API endpoints, how the user interface would be implemented, etc. The reason why I'm not giving it a 5 star, is because the lack of budgeting details, especially regarding the 'server infrastructure' budget. Other than that, overall this proposal have a great potential of successfully being implemented.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success of this proposal is clearly defined and easily measured in the sense that the APIs and the SDKs is either successfully delivered or it isn't. However, they didn't specify that this SDKs will be open-sourced on Github or not, and that will make it less transparent to check the progress along the way. Looking at their previous Github repo (cardano-wallet-js), it looks like they could easily create a new repo under tango-crypto. But then again, since it looks like a paid service (from their website, there are tiers for different service), I can't be sure if they'd make this open-sourced or not.

Roadmap includes detailed milestones with specific KPis for each which is what I generally like to see because it greatly enhances our ability to audit the success of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe team has provided a very detailed look into the very API endpoints that they are creating for this JS SDK.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is highly auditable and is definitely worth of 5 stars!\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_577", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal will have a positive effect on the Cardano ecosystem and will drive NFT consumers and producers to Cardano, however the risk could be in gateways which seem to be centralized.

There is a simple way to add the missing important information: I would have added one more step to the roadmap: After the service is launched, monitor (1) how many projects are actually using the APIs, and (2) how many files are added to IPFS, (3) how many NFTs are minted. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_956", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 7, "ng": 14, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We provide easy to use HTTP API and SDK for IPFS storage.", "experience": "We operate the TANGO stake pool and developed cardano-wallet-js and Tangocrypto Software as a Service."}
