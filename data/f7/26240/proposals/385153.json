As a developer myself I can relate to the problem described in the proposal and verify that it meets the challenge setting. It's clearly articulated how this will bring value and spark joy in the developers in the cardano ecosystem and to me included! The KPIs are relevant because they're measured in user experiences. The metrics are relevant and it's clear that the proposer has put a lot of thought in the actual proposal no less than in the tool itself. There will be challenges, but I have no doubt considering the authors experience and time management that all hurdles will be jumped over  without issue! There's nothing missing from this proposal, which is rare. This project will add something missing in the ecosystem: an easy way to work with transactions without having to suffer. There are no concerns here. This project will impact the community greatly if funded and I encourage people to vote for this as I will!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are so many credentials and skills listed that it took me a while to read and verify them all. The guy is a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics and has the credentials to show for it. There's a clear execution plan and he knows the work that needs to be done and the time and process to do it. The budget is clear and broken down well enough to be sensible to achieve the set goals, of which they are many and ambitious ones at that. A realistic timetable to complete the work is presented, but I'm wandering if a team wouldn't be more beneficial, but I can certanly respect the man who wants to build a tool in the proper mannar and having team members is not always the way to go to reach the end date. A detailed explanation is provided not only on the \"what\" but the \"how\" as well, which is rare and I do appreciate it. The resouces necessary for the project development are all listed. The technical aspects like the chosen edditor and functionalities already present and planned for the future are all described and meaningfull as milestones. The proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation. On top of that, he has analysed the impact of those decisions. The project is in sync with what's already been done, and this will be a building block for future development and building I believe. Absolutely stellar work of a proposal! Good luck!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Speaking of tracability the author has already very specific timetable and plan on how to include beta testers from the community to help him in the work cycle as well as plans for documentation. Letting the community know the features being made available is a priority. I see no problem with letting the people know what is done and developed. The metrics and KPIs are also on par with the rest of the proposal and that's rearly the case in many other proposals. A roadmap with milestones and all the necessary items are present as well as a time table that considers challenges and has a buffer for them. Understandable problem and an coresponding solutions are present and well writen althrough a bit technical at times. This is the solution for the struggles of the everyday software engineer.
