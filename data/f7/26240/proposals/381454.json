The idea here is to create an electronic data sharing platform, which will certainly positively impact the Cardano ecosystem. I believe that the phrase that would sum up this proposal well is the following, found right at the beginning of the description: \"sharing and renting your technology gadgets safely guaranteed by a smart contract based on Cardano\". With this goal in mind, the team, which appears to be very capable even by the technically very good description of the idea, could carry out an activity that would be useful to a good number of people who lack such a service, while increasing adoption of smart contracts in our blockchain. The authors also emphasize the need for their dApp to explain in a summarized and efficient way how the current market is, how this niche of electronic sharing is growing exponentially and how there is still a lack of platforms/companies/initiatives that address the subject. It seems like a smart move to fill this gap with a dApp based on Cardano, for sure the benefits will be guaranteed. The team is concerned with explaining exactly the product it will create, what its features and parts would be, making the understanding of the idea itself very clear. So, top marks on this review topic.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I thought the team could have been more generous in their presentation. We don't know their names, who does what, what their previous experiences are, how they got to Catalyst, if they already have any working relationship with our blockchain... There was a lack of detail to understand more deeply who they are. On the part of the financial division, I believe that there could also be more details, the amount they ask for is high, and although it makes sense for the complexity of the project, I would like to understand more about each part mentioned. For example, what would the marketing operations they cite? Another thing I thought is that it would be very interesting to understand the visual identity of the project, how people who are not so familiar with blockchain could use the dApp, what its interface would look like, etc. I think everything will be very well studied and executed, after all there is a UI/UX designer on the team, but such information could have been presented. As with the points mentioned above, I think the script could also have been more detailed; the time intervals mentioned are very long, every 3 months. We know what is supposed to happen at such time intervals, but I would like this information to be more detailed. For example, the team could have provided a monthly schedule of activities, the entire production process here is extremely complex, and non-tech people probably wouldn't fully understand what's going on; it would be perfect then if the phases were explained in an accessible language, just as the script every 3 months was written, in order to reach an understanding for the majority. Due to the lack of general detail, I believe that this part of the proposal could be revised.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability here is very good. We have monthly KPIs, including quantified ones, that is, we know what percentage of the dApp is to be ready at a certain point in time, the amount of smart contracts generated, users and so on. The authors also establish how the project's success would be, so that we have here the necessary information to monitor the proposal. It's enough for us to follow the progress of the activities, it would be good that some member of the community who understood the technologies present in the idea could have periodic meetings with the team, and thus understand the exact situation of the project at that moment, bringing feedback to the rest of the community. It would also be interesting to monitor dApp adherence, how many users are using it, on average how smart contracts and the use of our blockchain have grown since this project. We do have information pertinent to auditability, as I said, it is enough to draw strategies so that they are not wasted.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 9, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea here is very good. Indeed, circular economy is an increasing megatrend that tends to gain space more and more and solutions that address waste in general are alwalways welcomed. I particularly liked in this proposal that figures are brought to validate proposals point (as the tons of e-wated generated and the % of people willing to share their gadget) and there are links, in the end of the proposal, with the articles where thje numbers came from (my only improvement here would be to directly link these references with the text, as in a real paper, but this is detail).\nThere seems to have a sound plan in place with a MVP, which is essential in a project like this. I also appreciate the project already has its business model and sources of income detailed. The proposal also aligns with challenge metrics as it will result in an increase of Number/growth of application output, transactions and possibly profit to their creators.\n\nAs further specific suggestions, I'd made clearer in the proposal how the good and bad behaviour of gadget users would be assessed and how the legally binding agreement would extand for regions of the world outside \"company\" matrix (or even if the intent is, at least intiially, restrict it to some specific country - region of scope). Other things to consider here are logistics (how the devices would be exchanged? would there be a spcific pick-up and delivery service from app/subcontracted or the users would have to exchange by themselves?).\n\nIn general, the project has a good potential impact and proposal is well written, just need a bit more details on some points.\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In regard to the team, very few information is provided. It just name the people involved and briefly describe overall team team experience, which makes it very hard to understand how feasible is for the team to develop the DApp. In order to improve this point, I'd bring here the individual background, experience and capabilities of the 6 profesionals involved with links to verify the information.\n\n\nThere's a sound plan with deliverables but it would be good to have a little more descriptions on the acitivites involved. I particularly liked, however, the initial market validation in the 1st month. This is very important to do before developing the technology as it tends to be a cheaper but critical step (without this, the product wont have commercial value and will be useless).\n\nThere's no budget breakdown, just the total money necessary to create the MVP (proposal as a whole). To improve this point, I'd try to breakdown in the hours paid for the team, how much each step would cost (market validation, product development itself, MVP, etc).\n\nall in all, plan/roadmap is ok (just need some minor improvements) but team and budget breakdown need to improve in the proposal to better assess its feasibility.\n\n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project is generally auditable. There are good time-framed KPIs with targets already defined. They include both the market validation and the technical Dapp part development, which covers both of the main risks in the project (market acceptance and technical hurdles). There are also good and auditable milestones in the roadmap and a clear definition of success.\n\nAs further suggestion, I see a great importance in risk management for this project. As aforementioned, the market and technical risks are critical and some mitigation strategy would be nice to have. There other minor risks related to quality of DApp (which can covered by the MVP, as long, as it has a feedback loop/iteration with users) and meeting the proposed schedule.\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 12, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "A marketplace based on the cardano blockchain for sharing/renting technical gadgets. The authors plan to do a dapp so it's in the right category and fits the challenge settings. There will be impact on the community, and there were prety interesting documents about the \"sharing market\".  There were success definition and somekind of a roadmap, but I didn't see any metrics, which was a bit of a letdown. Not sure if the project will be able to scale as well, because I didn't see a possible challenges section even though there were such accepted comments. The proposal is lacking key metrics like user adoption, growth rate and so on. It's a unique proposal to be sure. I haven't seen anything of the sort. As a developer, I'm not too sure on the technical part, because no details were specified. Overall I like the idea, but the proposal could have been more detailed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I didn't find any references or links to any kind of credentials. There was a presentation linked, and there were some team members there, but I couldn't match them with the names of the proposers so I weren't able to verify the members that plan to work on this proposal. Unfortunately that brings the credibility of the project down. I see there's some idea of the type of team members, but they haven't approached them yet or at least that was my impression after reading the proposal again. The budgets is clear enoiugh, although it's a bit strange for the developer experts and marketing, business & customer operations to have the same low salary, but kudos if they manage to find these people. I'd say the timetable is realistic only if they already have found the people to work on the project. The proposal might have done a better job at explaining the technical implementation of the sharing market, but I won't hold that agains them since I don't thing they haven't found the devs yet.   One thing that IMO is lacking is the consideration of challenges and risks. What would happen if a gadget is broken once its lended. Are there any safety mechanisms in place like locking some token in or any kind of value before borrowing a gadget? How would legal disputes be managed? Does the smart contract hold weight in court? These are all important questions that weren't mentioned.  Overall I like the proposal, but I don't think it's feasible in it's current state.

There are no metrics to speak of, but there was a small definition of success table, which is a start. The roadmap is a bit coarse and could be a lot more detailed. The problem and solution statements are clear enough.  I'd suggest to the proposers to put themselves in the shoes of the voter and take a look at their proposal.
