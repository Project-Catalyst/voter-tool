The proposal is targeting a liquidity aggregator on Cardano, something like what Orion protocol is doing. This idea is not new to the space, however, on Cardano this might be the first one.  The detailed plan also explains how this solution will help Cardano eco system in DeFi space.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solution statement is clear to understand. Additionally the detailed plan also elaborates further on why the team think their solution is required.
