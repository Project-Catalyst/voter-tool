But this is essentially the closest it touched on the goals of the challenge and as such, I neither agree or disagree that it aligns. The proposer described the criticality of monitoring quality and time spent by wine through the distribution path but does not offer the specifics of how this will be achieved. There is mention of Industry 4.0 and of IoT, however, these were not at all linked to the DApp they are developing nor to its impending functionalities. We are all aware of EmurgoTrace and Cardano's ScanTrust, the latter utilised as a tracking mechanism by the Georgian wine industry to authenticate farm to table bottles. If this proposal is meant to be an enhancement over these existing applications, it somewhat fails to properly describe it to receive a higher rating.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I sit on the fence in terms of this proposal's ability to deliver a working product mainly because the pertinent details are lacking. To be sure, two of the team members are named but their LinkedIn profiles do not offer direct experience in DApp development which could provide confidence. Intellics Engineering seems to be more focussed on the automotive industry and there's no information on current and past blockchain deployments as claimed. If experiences in the automotive industry are to be leveraged to improve upon reporting on wine quality, as they relate to the transport of the product, this should have been better explained in order to create the linkage between their expertise and the intended deployment. The proposal describes milestones over a 16-week period which focusses on research, conceptualising and prototyping and have provided costings for the $35000 funds requested. There seems to be a disconnect between the 16-week activities listed and the intended distribution of the funds. Whilst the costing is development-centric, the activities planned to be conducted are more research focussed. I believe this proposal can benefit from a clearer description of the DApp itself, as a starting point. What its functionalities are, what it will monitor and how, who would be the participants along the chain to whom good reporting data is reliant, and what kinds of electronics and monitoring hardware will be utilised. From this point, the milestones and development path can be extracted and with proper and aligned costing, could enhance the chances for the project's feasibility. The proposer can also add details about what expertise they do and do not have; and from what they have, show links to blockchain developments as claimed. And from what they don't have (e.g. development in Plutus), how they will source such expertise. The milestones described here can be the starting point without any Catalyst assistance and would be a good foundation for a more substantial DApp proposal in a future funding round. Good luck.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There isn't much presented in the proposal that provides high confidence for auditability. Aside from the intellics.com site, which is lacking substantial detail in terms of how the project will realistically solve the problem presented,, there are no githubs nor social media accounts offered which could provide a means to track progress and ask questions. The research-heavy roadmap and milestones would be a source of the data they can present to Catalyst and the community, however, there are no mentions of how the discoveries will be shared. This proposal, especially given it's under the DApp and Integration challenge, would rate higher if a GitHub is presented. The proposers can also inform on the outputs of their conceptualising activities perhaps using gitbook or a similar publication mechanism. That said, I suggest the research activities should be conducted firstly by the team to solidify the ideas and direction as these would lead to a more detailed proposal for future submission.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 14, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal will provide a dApp with temperature sensor integration and tracking capability to monitor the storage condition of Wine. This is appreciated as a standard use case for blockchains in general. There is a need to create a demonstrable and well-marketed solution to improve adoption. Therefore the proposal is very much in alignment with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team has about 20 years of experience in engineering and management. The solution proposed in a standard use case for blockchain is being experimented with and under implementation. Therefore there is likely to be a paved road technically ahead of the team which will substantially reduce the technical risk. I believe that with this consideration there is a strong chance the team will be able to complete the proposal in time.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The fund requested in this phase is about one-fifth of the total estimated cost. The fund caters to developers, Project managers, and misc activities. The end state and KPI of this phase I is to build the dApp including both frontend and backend. However, the allotment for funds for software developers is only $ 7000. Notwithstanding the project clearly brings out steps and is auditable.

This proposal aims to store in the Cardano blockchain some characteristics about the quality of wines, such as their location, temperature, etc. Unfortunately, I see several points to be problematized here. The situation is similar to another proposal that also deals with the world of wines, which I evaluated recently (Wine open market - Stappato, present at the following link: https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBq7U). We know what the idea is, but there are not enough explanations for us to understand well how all this would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. It is not specified how this bridge would be established, which technologies would be used, how Cardano would be integrated, in a detailed way, in this project. All we are told is that the blockchain would be used to store some information, which would be tamper-proof, traceable and all the other advantages that the blockchain provides. But little is said about it. The proposal is concerned with explaining the crux of the issue much more - guaranteeing final consumers control over the entire wine-finding process - than how all this would use and impact Cardano. Another point I would like to highlight is: as in the other proposal on wines, I find it difficult for the target audience here to actually purchase these services, use this platform (from the attached photo and from the understanding I had, it would be a Dapp). How to reach people who are commonly unaware of blockchain? How to persuade them to use this Dapp, in addition to wanting to have greater control over the wine they will purchase, how would they relate to Cardano? The target audience here would be consumers of refined wines, usually older people and those with good purchasing power. In general, this is the target audience for fancy wines, right? I am not generalizing and putting them in boxes, but more practically, it is not a part of the population that uses blockchain. I would like to understand more in depth how this adoption would take place. In other words, unfortunately I do not see this proposal as something that will guarantee a good return for Cardano, both because it is something extremely specific, a very unique niche, in which consumers need a good direction to use blockchain (if the author had better explained the user experience, maybe this issue would be clearer); both because I could not visualize, in practice, how Cardano would be used here.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Explanations about the company involved, Intellics Engineering, are confusing. To begin with, they say they have experience in many very different areas, such as \"space technology, hotel systems and market industry\". How would it work in such diverse fields? What do they do with blockchain specifically? Have you ever worked with Cardano, or was it another blockchain? What is \"Industry 4.0 and IoT\"? It would be very positive if they had made a clearer definition of what their activities are, conceptualizing these different definitions that I mentioned last, in this way the understanding of the CAs would be much more solid as to who they are and what they do. Individually, the situation is much better, since they make the linkedin profile of their members available. With that we can get to know them individually, but that doesn't make up for the lack of knowing who would do what in this project. It would be necessary for them to clarify who would work here, developing which role and carrying out which activities. About the roadmap, we know which phases would be done and their respective costs (the funding requested would only cover the first phase). In the first phase, for example, the construction of the Dapp would be carried out, this would take 4 months and cost USD 35k. Right. But who would work here? The smaller tasks are defined, in fact, in the topic \"this phase will contain several important milestones\". This allows us to understand what would be done and in what order, as well as how long each activity would take. However, each topic could be detailed better, there is no way to fully understand the development of the project without knowing who would be responsible for each part, for example. The budget is explained in a somewhat superficial way, it is said how the money would be distributed, but each topic should also be more detailed. For example, 6k for marketing. It is said that some promotional materials would be made, such as pamphlets, shirts and publicity on social media. But in what way? What social media? How to reach the target audience? As in the marketing example, the other expenses could be better broken down. In summary, I think it's a little difficult to understand the activities of this company, but it's possible to get to know each stakeholder well; the roadmap is present and satisfactory, although not very detailed in some ways, as is the budgetary justification. The topic is well covered, just needing some adjustments.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is admissible through the data provided in the KPIs part, I found it positive that these data are quite diverse and are not limited to just measuring the amount of products/transactions performed. But some parts could be better explained; for example, user satisfaction. How would that be done, would any research be carried out? And what research? Would the results be shared with the rest of the Cardano community, and if so, through which platform? In my view, however, there could be more KPIs directly focused on the benefits of the Cardano ecosystem. In other words, if new members were acquired for the community, if they are active, if they suddenly started other activities within the ecosystem beyond the use of this Dapp. In the \"Challenges/Risks\" section, some possible obstacles are outlined, and a good way of auditing the proposal would also be monitoring if such problems really happened and if they were resolved. All this data must be directly presented to the Cardano community, as it is a project that has several phases, an idea would be that there was a meeting at the end of each stage, to situate the community on how the development is going and the results already partially obtained. I believe this topic was well thought through by the author, but some tweaks would make it even better.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 12, "ng": 13, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Innovative solution to create an IoT-cork that transmits storage data on-chain to an app. By doing this, the owner can ensure better quality for wine. This could also impact insurance policies on shipments, which can decrease costs overall as there would be less loss of shipments and proof of transportation conditions in the data log. There seems to be a real opportunity to go broader with this in the future and extend this to shipments of all kinds, reaching a larger market. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have the engineering knowledge, but some details were not entirely clear to determine the feasibility of this project correctly. That is: how the cork works. Judging from the gallery images on the website, the cork will need to be replaced by this device in order to determining the climate of the bottle's interior. Could this re-opening of bottles impact product quality and will this bottle be regarded as a loss in a shipment lot? Clarification on this could improve the proposal.

There is a thought-out plan present in the proposal and several risks have been considered. What could improve the proposal further is an explanation of how potential clients would be reached. The marketing plan mentions various forms of advertising, but not how clients could be actively aproached like sending out agents or attending economic gatherings.

Furthermore, the budget seems solid and it follows a reasonable timetable.\nHowever, I would like having a risk map more explored. I\u2019m not talking about this phase specifically, but the whole project. E.g. how about the competitors? I do not think that there is someone using the same technology as you, however, since the big sells go inside containers or it needs some specific logistic business to provide the service, is there possible for them to guarantee the quality of the product during the transportation (implementing one temperature\u2019s sensor inside a container, for example) in a cheaper way? The same with the warehouses and selling points. Of course your solution focus and guarantee the bottle, but there are some other products (meet, e.g.) which uses the batch quality.\nOne info that could be added is the expected (or real) price of the product and how much it is going to cost to wineries (to estimate how the price would change to the final consumer).\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I like the timetable however I do think it could be added some milestones (although the whole phase 1 is quite short).\nThe KPI provided is to the whole project, aiming to achieve 100K users and USD 100K revenue (are you going to raise USD 1 per user early?)\nIt could be added #wineries, #countries attended, #wines in the platform, #of grape, etc. (it would make the project more robust to those who are arriving in the platform).\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 5, "ng": 17, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Tracking of the wine's real-time quality in many supply chain checkpoints, supported with a blockchain-ownership and -monitoring solution.", "experience": "For the last 3 years, Intellics Engineering was involved in blockchain products and developed a lot of systems for Industry 4.0 and IoT."}
