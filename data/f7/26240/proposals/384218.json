They propose to use ADA as one medium of exchange for goods on services transacted on the Blockchain.  Rythmeet plans to bring musicians into the Cardano eco-sphere by providing a platform where they can meet and build groups, rent and sell instruments while getting much need exposure to ADA.  \r\nThis project proposes to use music's universal appeal to create a Music Platform that has the potential to pull in more adoption to the ecosystem.  The Rythmeet proposal lays out a very concise, clear definition of the problem of non-cryptocurrency user adoption within the blockchain space.  It lays out the potential for increased capitalization of the $10-$11.5 billion global musical instruments market share.  It makes a compelling case for creating a peer-to-peer music instrument marketplace and capturing the approximately 68 billion peer-to-peer market in the process. \r\nIn addition, the proposal illustrates the 2 main parts that make up the proposal one being the creation of the Rythmeet platform and the other being a (rm)NFT platform where artists and musicians can mint and sell NFTs and integrate directly with smart contracts all from the same platform.\r\nThe proposal goes in depth to describe very detailed scenarios and use cases to support their claim and how ADA and Cardano will work to bring about this mass adoption in the music world. The proposers plan to immerse musicians by allowing the platform to help musicians find performance venues, allow musicians to preview potential band member's musical capabilities before connecting while using the platform as a fundraising feature.  The money raised will pay for music school scholarships for students who cannot afford registration fees for music schools. Using the Cardano platform in this way helps to grow the total volume of ADA involved in application transactions, helps to grow the resource usage by applications and help to grow the number of application transactions.  \r\nThe proposal remains upfront as it lays out its challenges for the future in the realization that people might not be comfortable with cryptocurrency transactions.  The team understands that musicians might find using ADA to be complicated and recognizes this as a potential future challenge they are willing to tackle. The also recognize that musical instruments are very expensive, and people might not trust the platform to compensate for lost/stolen or damaged musical instruments.  They believe smart contract can help to alleviate some of the issues in this area.  The project recognizes that transparency will have to be at the forefront of the fundraising aspect of the platform and is prepared to be exactly that in its endeavor. ASSESSMENT SCORE 5\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility:\r\nThe Rythmeet project comes prepared with a solid, well-defined plan broken out via timelines.\r\nWeek 1 & 2 timelines include: Setting up the website and the initial ecommerce platform frameworks, installing plugins and spreading project documents to the development team members.\r\nWeek 3 \u2013 5 Involves developing the processes which enable rent and trade of physical items.\r\nWeek 6 sees development of payment features allowing web users to trade with Cardano (ADA)\r\nIn Week 7 the team plans to develop features for each account such as changing profile, sharing information through social media.\r\nWeek 8 Will see development of community type features between accounts like rating, reviewing and text chatting.\r\nWeek 9 will involve system testing for receiving and inspections.  Search Engine Optimization, problem solving derived from the system tests.\r\nWeek 10 will address launch issues found by users.  This part of the timeline suggests alpha or beta testing but does not outright say that.\r\nIn the next months the project intends to conduct further business analysis and add features based on users' opinions.\r\nThis project outlines a well-developed budget breakdown as well as a sustainable, durable, and self-sufficient revenue model.  \r\nPart of the revenue model outlines how, for the music classes, instrument/material rental, instrument/material sales and places to rent, the teacher/renter/seller will obtain 100% of the price they want. Fees will be added on a base of 8% if the purchaser pays using ADA or 15% if the purchaser uses another currency. Both prices will be indicated on the platform to push people to use ADA.\r\nAn option to put the announcement on the top of the list will be available for a fee of 2$ or the equivalent of 1.50$ in ADA per week.\r\nFor people looking for a music group to give a private concert for remuneration, there will be 8% fees using ADA or 15% using other currencies on the total amount paid.\r\nThe concern with a revenue model that relies on ADA is that price fluctuation due to inherent cryptocurrency market volatility will affect the fee/payment structure of the revenue model.  The 8% fee will be based on current market price and might be different for each individual involved based on time of the transaction.\r\nThe project's definition of success includes:\r\n3 months: The Rythmeet website is launched, and the first users begin to register.\r\n6 months: All technical problems have been solved and the website works smoothly. We reach 5,000 users and 15% of them use Cardano currency. We are developing the NFT part in parallel (if our 2nd proposal is accepted in Fund #8).\r\n12 months: We reach 15,000 users and 50% of them are using Cardano currency. People begin to give money to the fundraising project. We will also have launched the new Rythmeet platform 2.0 including NFT minting and sales if our 2nd proposal is accepted in Fund #8.\r\nThe project is backed by a strong experienced team with multiple years of backend, frontend, UI/UX development.  Graphic design, software development, agile and waterfall project management experience.  The team is stacked with all the right people in place to pull this off.  The proposal seems poised to accomplish its stated goals   ASSESSMENT SCORE  4\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability:\r\nThe project outlines detailed milestones that can be used track its progress: \r\n Stage 1: Project Definition formally defining the legal landscape needed to secure the platform's core function.\r\nIntegrating a CDN and developing a .NET or SQL database for all required on-site functions.\r\nDefining the online target audience and target market in order to help designers understand the end user preferences with the intention create an amazing user experience.\r\nStage 2: Planning based on collected data, creating a Birdseye view of the site map to determine the list and number of pages along with their placement and relationship on the site.  The planning phase also includes user-facing elements and backend elements.  The site map helps to define and organize the content in a coherent manner.\r\nStage 3 encompasses the design aspect where the design of the user interface will incorporate branding.  Stage 3 is critical to this programs success as creative minds come together to create a visual representation the project.  \r\nStage 4 involves content creation.  This marks the early stages of the actual development cycle.  Various content elements include:\r\nLanding Pages\r\nTestimonials\r\nBlog posts \r\nImages\r\nProduct/service description\r\nCase Studies\r\nStage 4 allows the project's writers to craft compelling messages that grab attention. The project team will then get heavy into development in stage 5.  This includes developer site functionality testing and other backend/frontend developments. \r\nStage 6 is testing and is one of the most critical phases of the project.  The software will be put to the test in order to ensure that everything works properly.  It is this time that validators will be used to ensure code/development integrity.\r\nStage 7 is the maintenance phase where the development timeline is laid out and is designed to get the job done.  \r\nThe project timeline boasts robust, efficient planning solutions designed to get results while increasing functionally. The prosper plans to make a very compelling case for the user of ADA as a regular medium of exchange.  This project has it all, a well-rounded team, a solid plan, budget breakdowns key performance indicators, the works!

Basically connecting musicians with their future place of work. Further down the path, the platform will allow musicians to mint nft and sell them along with a couple of other functionalities. The proposal matches the category it's in and it's challenge settings. It's calerly articulated how this project will bring in new people outside of the crypto buble into the ecosystem. The key metrics are good and relevat to the challenge settings. The proposer has already thought of possible challenges and specified solutions or at least paths to take based on them. Currently I'm lacking a place where I as a community member can follow the progress of the project's implementation, because no repository or social media links were provided. This proposal will bring artists to the cardano ecosystem. That would mean more money flowing through the cardano network, which is always good. I don't have any concerns about this proposal except for maybe more auditability and tracability of the project. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided names and team members which I was able to verify along with their skill set. A clear idea of how many team members of what type are necessary to do the work is described. The budget is outlined clearly and broken down in items, but could have been even more concrete like mostt projects are doing giving either reference points or hourly rates. As a developer myself, the timetable for the described work seems reasonable. There's a sensible plan for implementation that shows what's going to be done and in what manner.   The proposer has done great analysis of the challenges and risks relevant to a successfull implementation of the project. Not only that but has plans how to evolve the project further down the line and having that clear vision is what helps products such as this one keep north. The projects has plan to reuse some smart contracts functionality and build on top of what the community provides further down the line, which is a great indicator the project and authors have a clear view and understanding of where things are right now and how to take advantage of the ecosystem. Good luck to you and the project!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tracability is the one part I'm a bit concerned about that is somewhat aliviated by the mention of social platforms and total transparency along with giving money to charity, but some more concrete evidence would have been welcomed. The metrics and KPIs are present and on point. A proces that can be measured can be optimised and I write that everywhere I go because I believe in that. The roadmap with milestones is easay to follow and the time given for implementation and realization of all steps seems reasonable.
