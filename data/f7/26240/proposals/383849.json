It is no secret that metaverse projects have been blowing up lately, and this proposal seems to go hand in hand with that. I would have liked to see a more clear or detailed formulation of the problem statement and solution, and foremost how it is related to the growth of Cardano. I'm assuming that the platform will be built upon Cardano or use it in some way, but this is not clear since the team aims to build the platform on top of an already existing platform. In order to assess this proposal properly, I would have liked to see a more thorough explanation of 1: what the project is and how it will be developed? 2: How it will meet the needs of the users of Cardano? And lastly 3: What will the proposal provide to the ecosystem? If lots of advertisements on different platforms will attract larger companies to advertise on the platform, describe how the team aims to achieve that, and how it will bring value to the whole picture. Where will the focus lie? The immutability of blockchain tech might indeed revolutionize many different industries, but in order for me (as an experienced Community Advisor) to fairly assess the impact of the proposal, it would need to contain more details. Since the requested funding is quite substantial of over 20% of the total challenge budget, this kind of information is important. There is nothing wrong with the core concept, I would just like to know more. \u2028All in all, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I believe that this proposal would benefit highly from a short presentation of the core team, along with sufficient links provided to verify their competency and experience. Maybe a link to previous projects, or LinkedIn profiles? If the team has 12 years experience of developing high-end and managing Times Square ad campaigns, there should be plenty of information to share from that. And all that information would benefit the proposal. Having said that, the team DOES refer to their project GOTIGER (when asked for some info about the team in the comments), but sadly there is not much information related to either the team or this particular project to be found there. \r\n\r\nThis goes hand in hand with the budget allocation, which I would like to be a bit more detailed. For example, knowing how many Product Managers or Developers are part of the team, how the budget will be allocated between the individuals along with how many working hours that are estimated for each position would really increase the feasibility of the proposal. And subsequently, the faith in the team. Lastly, for the proposal to be more tangible I would have liked to see a further explanation of what the project aims to do, in detail. In order for it to be understood by CAs and the public in general it would need to contain explanations that immediately say if the proposal aims to have their Virtual Billboards in already existing metaverses, or if they mean to host their own spaces. I might be wrong in questioning the tangibility of the proposals explanations, and would gladly stand corrected if that is the case. Due to the lack of information provided in the proposal, I disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal includes some valuable information about measurements of success, and KPIs, even though it would benefit from more detail. If there had been a road map with milestones and estimated timeframes added and then merged with some KPI info, I believe that it would increase the quality of the proposal greatly. For example: After 3 months after being funded, we aim to have embedded 5 virtual cities within the system, after 6 months we hope to have 25 active advertising campaigns (minimum) in each virtual city. After 12 months we will gather information on how much presence our project will have in social media, and measure the levels of success according to this scale: [numbers]. Again, these explanations are only gibberish. What I'm trying to say needs clarification is the concept and presentation. Also, a channel where the community or investors/users of the platforms can monitor and interact with the proposers would further increase the level of auditability of the project as a whole. From my experience as a Community Advisor and working with Blockchain technology, transparency is an integral part of it. If this proposal would reflect that kind of transparency towards its users and investors, it would benefit it greatly. A short description of potential risks and hinders of development would also strengthen the faith in the competency of the team, and proof that the team has a deep understanding and perspective of the industry and the project. Overall, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

To certain extent it gives a good idea based on the working domain of the proposer.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat i am missing, however, is that why cardano ? What is the vision of the company in moving to blockchain space and how Cardano fits into this space and not any other blockchain such as Solana, Ethereum etc ?\r\n\r\nAlso it would have been nice if the proposal mentioned why and how cardano eco system will grow OR have positive impact if this proposal is implemented successfully.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly room for improvement on the solution presented here, therefore i do not fully agree ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I disagree, one reason is that they claim they have 12 years of development experience, but who are these developers ?

It would be much better if proposer next time provides good details about the team so that they can attain higher score in review process.\r\n\r\nThe plan that is mentioned is a detailed plan, and a generic proposal has been made that how blockchain can help with its immutable nature.
