This could promote a better organization and administration of tokens, however, I believe that users would already be able to access this data through traditional ways in a practical, fast and simple way too, which makes me think about the need for a new platform especially for this. The author does not explain exactly what these conversations with the Before Will chatbot would be like. How could we ensure that these conversations would be fully accessible to all audiences? Starting with the language, the chatbot would probably be in English, right? This is in line with the project's objective, because if the idea is to unify all the information and add comments about assets such as NFT, smart contracts, etc., the main goal would be to encompass the greatest number of people in a single Dapp. But if this were built especially for English speakers, there would already be a certain separation, I don't think it's so useful to create a new system to promote actions that can already be done practically on other platforms. I believe that the proposal would have more added value if there was a survey with the public, claiming the need to promote such an organization. It would also be interesting for the author to demonstrate his intention to, in the future, adopt other languages \u200b\u200bin order to universalize his chatbot. Anyway, the idea is not bad, but I don't believe it is fundamental and it fits so much with the goals of the challenges, which are to create Dapps that increase the use of our blockchain technologies and can attract new users. At no time did the proposal author quote Cardano, how would this application directly relate to and benefit our blockchain?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the team, we don't have any details. We know that the team would consist of developers, designers, marketing, etc., however, we don't have any specific information about each one. It would be necessary to know their names, roles in the project, a brief history of what they did before, what their direct connection with the Cardano ecosystem is. It would also be great if their profiles were made available on linkedin so that we could get to know them more deeply. As we're told, no trust is given to the team, unfortunately - there's no way to believe in people we don't know. About the script, the author is concerned with making a division of tasks based on months. But this explanation was extremely superficial, we could not understand the details of what would happen, visualize what activities would be needed here, understand the order they would happen, who would work in what, and why... It would be beneficial for the author to make a monthly organize including all These information. For example: \"1-3 months: Front-end prototype development with all encryption and security features included\". Who would do this? What are the features they are talking about? Furthermore, it is not possible to understand how long the project would take to develop in its entirety. As far as funding is concerned: basically the same thing happens, we are given very superficial information, so we cannot understand exactly what the money would be used for. For example, \"Software Developers - 33K\". This is a very high value. How many people would work? For how many months? How would the work routine be? How many hours per day? What would each one do, individually? He asks for 3K for marketing, but it is not clear at any time what the campaign would be like, what resources they would use, how these 3K would be spent. Therefore, I believe there is a lack of detail in this topic in general.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author is concerned with organizing 3 KPIs that are direct ways to understand if the project achieved the desired results. It's basically about the reach of Dapp, how many users are using the application, how many messages were recorded and the mentions on social networks. I believe these are good ways to measure results, but we will also need to go further. I think it would be interesting to promote a small survey with users, in order to understand how the use of this application impacted their personal organization, what were the advantages? It would also be necessary to establish some way of evaluating the process, not just the results. For example, establishing direct and periodical contact with the team, whether through meetings, writing reports, some kind of exchange in which we could constantly monitor whether the activities that were promised were actually being done properly. In my view, the author is concerned with tracing an auditability, but this is only done with a view to the final product. This project is quite expensive, we would need, for example, to directly monitor the developers' work routine to make sure that the 33K requests were being used well; also follow the construction of the design, I believe that the interface needs to be very simple and ergonomic, that is, UI/UX needs to be worked carefully here, if the objective of facilitating the organization of digital assets is to be successfully achieved.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 11, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal is a great response to the challenge.
