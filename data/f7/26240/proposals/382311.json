Meaning that people would have UX that wouldn't involve any code on their part. The problem identifies an opportunity to introduce regular people to smart contracts without even knowing it. This will have a great impact on the adoption of the cardano ecosystem if it spreads. This impact will bring value to the cardano ecosystem, through people getting the word out. The key metrics are sensible for the project and will provide nice tracking to optimize the process and the project in the future. As a developer looking through the people involved and the credentials and skills described I don't see a problem for this project to scale up. The one thing I wish I saw more of was ways to interact with the community. Fair to say that one of the authors has left a @telegram link so people can get back to him, but a discord channel can grow an actual and involved community. This proposal will bring a missing piece of the current ecosystem, by bringing regular people to the cardano community.  I really like the proposal, good luck and I'll be following your progress. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I always like when proposers leave links with their linked in profiles, because this brings be some piece of mind and further more it brings credibility to the whole project. In my experiecne  voters really like when proposers stand proud with their names behind a project. A team of specific skill members is already ready and working to implement the proposal and AFAIK they're right on schedule. The budget is simple enough and outlined clearly in an understandable manner. In the resources the proposers have explain with pictures (the best medium) the way the algorythm work and it's pretty straightforward and simple enough to work without issues. As a developer keeping in mind the work that has yet to be done, I trust the team will be able to finish within the timetable they have set for themselves. The plan is sensible and has answers to the question not only what are we building but how, as well. The resources linked in the proposal help to understand the possible implementation details or at least some of them. I like that one of the developers is a haskel developer, since that is the first rate citizan on the cardano development ecosystem. The technical aspects could have been a bit more concrete, but I'm speaking out of curiosity. The proposers have put quite the roadmap as their KPIs are very ambicious. The project is in sync with what's already been done, and their project will be a block that other developers will be able to step on to build their own applications.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The one small concern I have is the tracability of the project. Since they have a site for it, I hope they put a section where the authors can put some blog posts or some kind of progress reports concerning the project and how it's comming along. The metrics and KPIs seem relevant. I like the fact they are implicityle connected to the the projects deffinition of success. The roadmap and milestones along the way are concrete enough that the items can be implemented sequentially and the time set for the project still kept. There's a clear and understandable description of the problem to be tackles as well as a simple but well through out solution.  My small suggestion would be for the authors of the proposal to see through the eyes of their future community and think of a way like a discord channel, where this community can grow and help them betatest their work. Overall I like the proposal and will be voting for it.

They seem to be a mix of passionate young developers. Given that they have already started working on the project they are requesting funding for, there is a high likelihood that the project will be successfully implemented.
