The Problem statement is easy to understand and being a Software Engineer myself I have first hand seen situations where a lot of good content/scientific work is unavailable to the general public even though the funding comes from public domains. \r\n\r\nThis proposal, if implemented successfully, is trying to address such a problem and provides an indepth look on the multi variance of this problem.  The proposal has already considered the legal framework which will be important to realize the success of this proposal. Therefore, in my opinion this proposal will have a good potential to not only improve cardano network strength but also aligns with the vision and goal of cardano, that is to have an equal opportunities world going forward.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The  team from this proposal has already gotten a successful funding in the previous round, and this proposal builds on top of the work that was promised/targeted in Fund 6 proposal. \r\n\r\nThe experience of the team is publicly available, and the latest update from the team is routinely updated on the link provided in the proposal. \r\n\r\nThe plan is very ambitious, and a detailed layout has been provided both from bird eye perspective (to always have an eye on big picture) and at the same time detailed description on osNFT monetization strategies. Clearly team has thought through the roadmap and milestones, and an impact of these roadmap, with execution milestones in 3-6-12 months has been given. \r\n\r\nIt makes sense that while team has allowed community to have an upfront details on long term roadmap, but also that team has restricted themselves to this funding round in terms of budget asked for. The budget breakup is justified to me, and i am sure team will have lot of success and a positive feedback loop with community, leading to the success of this proposal.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that information provided here is sufficient to audit the progress and success of this proposal. Team is public and a link to their website where they are posting weekly progress updates is a good way for community to keep an eye on routine development.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the website gives in the different phases details, which each phase expecting a set of features along with the estimated timelines to it. This in combination with weekly updates gives a good positive feedback loop to the community, so that any changes to the projected roadmap is quickly propagated to the community.\r\n\r\nOverall, very detailed and good write up for this proposal and hence full points from my side.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposers want to create an academic market place for accessible research, that could be staked, sold or borrowed. There's a problem mentioned in the proposal that academic research is not so easily available although it's mostly public. I didn't know that, but after doing a bit of reserach I see the problem is real and it fits the challenge settings. The proposal adds an exhaustive explanation of the value it will add to do the cardano system, by bringing in more academics to the cardano community. The goals of the proposal are exactly what every community strives for: more educated people, people of action on board. After reading the proposal I have no doubt in my mind the authors will have no problems scaling their solution to measure up with the scaling challenges they will be faced with. I have read quite a few proposals now north of 40 and I don't see any key items missing from this one. The proposal would include the academic sphere and will create a marketplace that would help some underprivileged academics as well, which is really noble.  This is a great proposal, I'll be voting and rooting for them! ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The authors have grown their team since the last funding round which was a nice surprise for me. This means two things: 1. They have been successfulyly voted in and worked on a proposal already. 2. Their idea is good enough to attract other academics and their drive. The credentials are verifiable as the authors have linked the whole teams linkedin accounts. The team is forming up to be a formitable one, as it's formed from members arround the world. The budget is described and broken down in detail. There are reasonable and achievable goals. I'm not an expert by any means in the academic environment, but as far as coding and developing goes, as a dev their roadmap and timetable seem sensible and entirely doable. The plan for implementation seems solit and sequential. All the resources necessary to implement the proposal are listed, and quite a few scenarios like decentralization, future governance as well as bringing more people on board are well thought out and detailed. The technical aspects of the proposal are mentioned as well. The languages and technologies that are going to be used along with the reason why. The proposers have considered chaallenges and risk relevant to the implementation and set goal. I especially liked the fact they've thought of different ways to make use of their osNFT token. These academics have done their research on what's alreday available, and will build on top of other community members building bricks which is the wright way to do open source development. Overall this is a feasible solution and I can't wait for it to be a reality.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unlike many other proposals, I'm not worried about tracability. In their linked site, the authros have created a section called weekly updates where, they interract with all people interested in their project and give progress updates. Further down the line, they plan on having a section with blog post articles on what's being done and how is the progress commuing along. That's an excelent channel to keep the community involved and intrigued. There are relevant metrics and KPIs mentioned that IMHO are in line with the projects success. There's a birds eye view of the path as well as milestones all in a doable time frame. A clear understandable description of the targeted problem and a detailed, well thought out academic description for the solution.   I will you all the best.

The team has been spending time and funds to research and set up a framework, deal with copyright issues and other relevant topics around creating a science marketplace in combination with an NFT model.

The prior work and the references provided are very positive and on task and it is nice to see how excited the team is about their project, I like it. I think the proposing team has done good work at looking at the necessary issues that come with creating such a marketplace, which is good. I\u00b4m an academic researcher with more than 7 years of experience both as a peer reviewer as well as a published academic in peer reviewed academic journals. While I think that the process of reviewing the quality of a paper or a study could be improved, I do not believe that the peer review process is meaningless, I find it important that internal and external validity of a research design is monitored to ensure that . The way that this group of people are brainstorming and creating a framework to include researchers with less access to funding is great and could contribute widely to a fairer system of how science and scientists can use their research.
