This is a weak point of the cardano ecosystem right now, because it lacks the common dapps found on other chains. This will bring much value and will spark joy in the hears of cardanians. There's a clear roadmap that adds growing value to the cardano ecosystem. The key metrics are not only relavant but actually there. Many projects neglect KPIs which is a shame. The metrics put in this project seem relevant speaking as a developer and a regular cardano user. The proposal will be able to scale no problem, the authors keep in mind and expect future growth, which is great. I see nothing missing in this proposal, as it is short but done extremely well. This is one missing piece of the puzzle and needs to be voted in IMHO.

The team is set and is already working. That's what I like to hear as a future investor in their endeavour. The budget is broken down clearly and it makes sense as compared to the work that needs to be done. A realistic timetable is offered to complete the work. I'm going to foolow this project's progress. There's a sensible plan for implementation, although I would have liked for it to be a bit more technical or at least have a link to somewhere that describes the architecture.  The technical aspects are interesting to me as a developer, but I do realize that they are not mandatory by any means. The authros have a plan for potential risks and challenges that they have to be able to surmount and by what I read in the project, they will because they are prepared for them. I love the fact the proposers have a plan for self funding and won't rely on community funding for prolonged periods of time.
