However, this bridge from SingularityNET is a permissioned bridge, whereas the proposer idea is to make a trustless one. The proposer clearly articulates how it is important to have a trustless Cardano Ethereum bridge so that anyone can use it. With relatively low-cost transactions using Cardano, it will attract more project from Ethereum to move to Cardano, as it is more economically make sense to have a cheaper operational cost, while also secure and safe.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Applied Blockchain is a consultant company that have track record and experience working with various blockchain technology before, and it is explained in details on their website. This also prove that the proposer knows the team composition needed to work on this project to make it a success. Although the budget has been outlined, it needs more explanation in detail, such as; the number of people involved and the work hours with salary details. The $25,000 cost breakdown for each point doesn't explain much on why it need such amount of funding. We can see from this proposal that it will build a new trustless blockchain bridge framework named \"London Bridge\", and it will be build utilizing Intel SGX technology. It would be helpful if they could explain briefly on what Intel SGX does, and also explain how it will be implemented in details. For example: explaining how does using Intel SGX could help in security, in what part / aspect that it will be used when developing the bridge, and what are the challenges when implementing this kind of technology. By giving a brief and easy to understand explanation, it will further proven that the team know the technology they're using. This proposal says that the London Bridge is already being integrated with a number of other blockchains, but upon researching, it's hard to find any information regarding London Bridge and their history. It also says that it will be open source, but doesn't have any GitHub link or something similar. All in all, I'd still give it a 4 for feasibility since they've proven their experience with past blockchain projects with KLM, Toyota, Shell, etc.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal able to provide a clear roadmap. Each roadmap contains target and goals to be achieved, from the first 2 months of development until deploying it on testnets.

One of the best things that can happen for our community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "That the major energy company, Shell, has invested in Applied Blockchain lends tremendous credibility that they will accomplish the goals they have set out. Experience having created a large number smart contracts would have allowed them to learn many lessons which will increase the effectiveness of their work in the Cardano community. I would recommend that they include links to their company at least in the comments section, but best in the body of their proposal. One of the very important elements that makes the proposal more feasible, is the wallet receiving the funds is a corporate wallet, not a personal wallet of an employee. Every major request for funding should be organised like that.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The road map is clear and auditable.

No key metrics were mentioned, so I can't say they align with the challenge settings. Not much technical details are linked or explained so I don't know if the proposers can address future challenges. The proposal is lacking in a few respects: No resources, links names or credentials KPIs or metrics of any kind are mentioned in the proposal.  As a developer I find the lack of detailed information technical and otherwise alarming.

The mentioned relevant skills can not be verified in any way, so I don't count on them. No specific plan for a type or number of team members is present in the proposal, which is a red flag for me since any practical proposal would need people to do it. The budget is mentioned but there's no concrete breakdown or explanation on what specific work needs to be done and an hourly rate to do it. I have no idea if the timetable offered for implementation is good or not, because no technical specs or architecture is provided. As a developer I would have been able to estimate at least if the timetable is sensible or not for the job stated to be done. No time is mentioned concerning the integration of the implemented bridge. The deffinition of success is good, but it mentiones what it should accomplish, but the proposal doesn't state how would it support it. No resources of any kind are mentioned as necessary to implement the proposal. Having looked at over 30 proposals by now, this is very odd to me. The technical aspects like architecture language or technologies that are goind to be used for the implemention are never mentioned. A high level overview is not enough for a proposal of this magnitude.  I would love for this project to become a reality because it's a great idea, but as it stands now, I'd suggest to the authors of this proposal to have a look at other technical proposals and have a look through the proposal templates and questions to be answered. Make a better suggestion in the next Round8 and you'll be sure to be voted in! Good luck!", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No mention on how the proposers plan to keep the community in the loop for the progress of the implementaion of the proposal.

The roadmap is present but it could be a bit more concrete about the milestones and task segregation. The problem statement description is clear. The solution on the other hand needs some more work.
