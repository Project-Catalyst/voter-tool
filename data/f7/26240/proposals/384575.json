Working in the cultural sector and being involved in the cryptocurrency space, I would say that there has not been proper development with dApps connected to the arts and culture. Artists suffer from companies grabbing hold of most of the profit, and are still controlled by the middle hand in what content to create. This proposal would be a step towards developing a place where authors can create and manage their works independently, if executed correctly. The problem statement is clear in its description, as is the solution to the problem. At first glance, this proposal seems to be a lot more niched towards only the authors, but after some thought this project also aims to connect to the consumers (of course) which make it a whole different story in terms of outreach and adoption. It could very well be a good use of the Catalyst treasury, with a lot of potential to scale in the future if executed correctly. Best case scenario (according to the proposer) this would be one of the first decentralized libraries, if all goes well. I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer/team has experience with having proposals funded in Fund4 and Fund6, which speaks of the credibility and competency of the team. Here it would be beneficial if the proposal included a set of links to further verify the competency of the core team members. This could be links to their LinkedIn-profiles, or links to what proposals the team already have received funding for. There is youtube video provided featuring the founder (which is very good), but I would've liked some more detailed information related to this proposal. The proposal DOES include valuable contact information to the core team members, which is rarely seen in proposals (from my experience as a Community Advisor). \r\nThe statement that the team means to reimburse the funds for this proposal within a year speaks of high levels of commitment to the project and the community, but it would be nice to have more detailed information of where this money will come from and will be distributed throughout the year. The budget allocation is pretty straightforward and includes a plan of hiring developers with the necessary competency, presented with working hours and an estimation of hourly wage over a longer timeframe (approximately 2 months time, 1 full time dev and 2 part time devs). There is a part of the budget allocation that will go to the founder for working 30 hours per week, but it would be nice to have a short breakdown of what is included in that work-package. Is it marketing, managing this project only or other projects? If the founder will be working 30 hours per week on this project, does that mean that he/she won't be part of the other projects? \u2028The feasibility of the proposal would be a lot stronger if we could know more details about the dApp itself, as of know the proposal mostly feature the core idea but not much detail. What functions will it have apart from uploading/buying material? Will the buyers be anonymous and how will it be distributed? Will it be incorporating NFTs, and how will that function? I know that these might be \"obvious\" questions, but if the goal is to have a big outreach to people with varied experience of working with Cardano and Blockchain technology in general, I believe it would be beneficial if the proposal included this information. Because of the reasons stated above, I neither disagree nor agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to measure the auditability in a clear and structured way, I would suggest that the proposer should add much more detail in regards to the development and process of the project. It would be incredibly beneficial if we could see a clear roadmap with milestones, and with the inclusion of an estimated timeframe. At the moment we can only see that the proposer means to create a marketplace, but what are the steps in creating a marketplace for authors? Where is the project after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months? What social channels will the community be able to follow the progress of the project?\u2028I would also suggest to include some measurements of success in order to monitor the development (KPIs and metrics). How many users will be expected during the first month, or after 6 months? \u2028If I understand things correctly, Cardano Outreach seems to be pretty active in social media, and including that plan or process in the proposal would further increase the auditability and transparency of the project as a whole. Also including a short paragraph of text explaining the risks and challenges, and how the team plans to deal with these would further increase the trust in the team, and show that they have a multi perspective view and deep understanding of both micro and macro aspects of the project. \r\nBased on the lack of information provided, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

Therefore, in my opinion this solution, if implemented, will for the first time give the voice to such writers and allow them to not only express themselves but also be rewarded for it, the anonymoity factor is absolutely important when it comes to the implementation of this proposal. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, i see a lot of improvement opportunities here, especially giving a little more details about how this dapp will work ? atleast high level of feature sets and workflow OR functionalities information would have been better, as current description is quite abstract.

However, i have to remind that there are other proposals who have done it, :) so it makes total sense to give more stars/ratings to those proposals who have done a better job at presenting themselves so that community has bigger confidence on it. \r\n\r\nTo me i like the idea that proposer is proposing to repay the fees generated from the app, and it means that proposer is very committed to this proposal and wants to kickstart implementation of this idea.

The plan, the KPIs, and the success metrics are missing. How the success will look like ? what is the detailed roadmap for the MVP ? The idea is abstract and it is always better to sit with your developers and come up with some basic plan on what set of functionalities your MVP will have, when you will deploy it and who will audit/provide feedback on to it ? \r\n\r\nHence from the perspective of ratings i will give it 3 stars , which means i can not say for sure how likely it is that this idea can be audited and tracked perfectly.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea is excellent!

But if he could find developers with experience, knowledge and the necessary skills, the project surely could be realized. The proposer clearly communicates how many developers are needed in the team and most of the requested budget that is clearly presented would go to external collaborators aka developers. The budget is reasonable and broken down into identifiable items. An additional funding is required to implement the proposal but the proposer states that they will be borne by the founder and the devs. Proposer does not specify a detailed implementable plan and details of actionable tasks and order of execution are missing.

I assume StoryTime would be the decentralized version of Amazon KDP publishing, instead of a blogging platform. If so, then this proposal fits the Challenge's needs and could drive more adoption. But if it's a blogging platform, then Publish0x and Steemit is already providing a solution. This proposal would benefit from having a clear statement on its unique selling point. What does safe and decentralized environment mean? Amazon KDP publishers face the risk of being taken down and their funds frozen if the subject material does not meet their requirements.

More details on StoryTime's implementation needs to be included to justify the money involved. The proposal could also benefit from a section on the risks involved: what if there's too low of an adoption? What if no one finds out about StoryTime? How would censorship or quality management of published content be enforced? Just a few questions that come in my mind.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No roadmap with milestones for the MVP.
