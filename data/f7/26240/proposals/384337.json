I think the noble idea of developing small towns into a self sustaining and alternative economic model is a vision that we all at cardano community are envisioning for.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is about setting up the base for realization of such a goal. This proposal walks through the solution of having a wallet which is critical for the participants (be it investors or workers) of this new economy model. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I think the way proposal is written could be improved. e.g. I believe that how blockchain (especially cardano) will be used and fits right in for the solution of the problem statement, could have been elaborated as a separate bullet point/section within the detailed explanation. This would give the normal community member/voter to always have a bird eye view on Why Cardano and why this solution needs Cardano ? \r\n\r\nFinally, an overall well written proposal with possibilities to improve on few points like i mentioned above, hence 4 ratings from my side.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For me  the leadership team has really good work experience, and their public profiles are available. The idea proposer has very good videos posted and seems to have good grasp on what they want to achieve as part of this proposal. \r\n\r\nThe videos are easy to understand and gives a good understanding of long term vision of the team presenting this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe wallet creation proposal, however, that this proposal belongs to depends on the quality of developers they will get. Although, the team has presented that they have already (almost) selected/finalized the developers who will be writing smart contracts etc, i am not fully confident as long as i am not able to see their quality via looking at their contributions in Cardano community OR github activity. I am a senior developer myself, and plutus programming is not straight forward and there is a steep learning curve for developers. I would have appreciated if the team presented here also the details of possible developers. \r\n\r\nAll in all plan on paper looks fine, but being a developer myself i know a lot of challenges start showing up in implementation phase. Given the nature of cardano SC programming, and the high end budget this team has asked for, I have to unfortunately NOT be in agreement that this proposal has high likelihood to  be implemented successfully. Good luck to the team, and additionally it would have been nice if they could outline the architecture (offchain code/on chain code responsibilities), how much they are expecting those developers to finish up, what are milestones (not monthly but lets say agile way 2 weeks sprint breakup). Sometimes i understand it is hard to give an estimate early ON, but of course the higher rating has to be given to those proposals who have considered and presented  all these aspects in their proposal", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I can neither agree or disagree that the information provided here is sufficient to audit the progress and success of this proposal. My reasoning for this is as following\r\n\r\nAlthough, the team has given a good description of Quarterly milestones planning, but one factor that is overlooked is developers skillset and what kind of participance they are going to have. ? Therefore, i see a lot of risks involved here because it is absolutely not clear on which basis this milestones have been presented ? These are heavily dependent upon milestones implementation, and we all know that even IOHK has struggled to keep Deadulus (on windows still a lot of issues) /Yoroi (lot of sync issues) without problems. Therefore, i think that in order to have more confidence in the implementation roadmap of this proposal it would be nice to have some architect/lead engineer who provides good information on what he has done in cardano space in the recent times.. This would give in my opinion a lot of confidence to the community for a good audit on progress and eventually success of this proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "As a Dev myself, active catalyst member and funded proposer, I think the proposers purpose is very aligned with that of Cardano, and this DApp is a great example of solving real life problems with our blockchain.\r\nThe solution is complex, but I think appropriate and it is innovative in the way it is presented and applied.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers seem very passionate and willing to drive this proposal home.\r\nThe budget seems a little bit over for what it is needed.. 7K per developer I think it is too much for a Cardano, funded proposal, but it will depend on the geography where those devs are hired\r\nThe budget was detailed.. not too much but enough to understand how it will be used.\r\nThe timeline though is kind of fuzzy, it should've been more detailed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "KPIs are missing, though it can be inferred from the general timeline, it is not enough to be able to track the progress of the project.

The initial claim seems plausible:  the onboarding of a unique decentralized token holder (in this scenario an ICO called \"mite\" and a native token called \"LOL\") who needs a wallet capable of staking and transacting in these tokens.  However the their whitepaper indicates an issue:  they intend to do this on their own \"Ubuntu blockchain\" and that they will only temporarily use Cardano while they develop this \"more decentralized blockchain\".  There is no explanation given as to why they require a move away from Cardano, or why existing dApps and wallets within the Cardano ecosystem do not meet their need for a wallet.  From this, it is not clear exactly what their problem statement is trying to synthesize:  do they need a Cardano wallet, or something else, and what is wrong with existing Cardano wallets and native tokens?  The proposal does not appear to provide any long term impact on Cardano.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The existing team proposes to hire the development team (smart contract developers, dApp developer) after being funded, and they indicate they have teams lined up, but they do not provide any evidence of these teams skills.  A good question to answer would be whether they plan on tapping a Plutus or Marlowe programmer for these jobs. The funds requested seem odd:  even at high rates, the funds requested for the wallet developer amount to almost 300hrs of development time, while the rates for the smart contract developers amount to over 500hrs of development!  The proposal would be much more likely to be funded if this contract were shopped around a bit more.  The implementable plan is a bit sparse -barely two items: develop wallet, launch wallet.  It would be helpful to see a much more granular breakdown of milestones, actionable items and certain indicators of a deliverable project, such as development schedules or deliverables, and then to parse those out in accordance with the budget.  That would lead to a better understanding of the scope of the task.  Finally, a dApp rollout faces certain obstacles, such as testing and errors, and there is no mention here of how such risk could be mitigated or absorbed.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The 3-month time horizon for completion simply lacks enough detail to assess where audits could take place or be effective.  Without metrics or KPIs there is not a lot to go on for suggesting improvements here.  One possibility would be to consider target numbers for users onboarded to the wallet, or tx volume on Cardano for the tokens.  For this project in particular, with its planned migration to its own blockchain, another metric to consider would be something that shows a potential benefit to Cardano, such as volume of ADA transacted over time, or use of Ada plugins for commerce, or some such.  There does not appear to be a lot of crossover between this project and the Catalyst community at large, so it may be beneficial for the proposers to suggest means of transparency for the community to follow project progress, perhaps with dedicated videos or posts on the OST site.  Outside of these clarifications, I do not think there exist very good avenues for transparency and accountability to the community for this project.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_811", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "OST participant will have a wallet to timebank their Labour Of Love tokens.\u00a0\nThis wallet will open their free access to abundant resources.", "experience": "Researcher - Scientist - Author - Activist - Humanitarian.
