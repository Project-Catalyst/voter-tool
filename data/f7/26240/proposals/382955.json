Using Smart Contracts and Blockchain technology in market places is definitely an area that is relatively unexplored and underdeveloped, and would be revolutionary if the right project is developed. If such a project (like this proposal for example) were to be developed on Cardano, it would not only revolutionize the housing market in general, but also attract one of the most profitable industries in the world. There is a strong humanitarian flavour to the essence of this proposal, in that it seeks to reduce the amount of exploitation of the current system in the real estate market. It would be a very good use of the Catalyst treasury (even asking for roughly 20% of the total funds for the challenge), but I would have liked to see more specific details linked to the development of the project. The core idea and concept is amazing, but in order for me (as an experienced community advisor) to assess the proposal it would need to have more information included in it. But as of impact, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal would benefit greatly if it included a presentation of the team, along with some links to verify the competency and experience. Maybe include an estimate of how many people will be working with this project and for how long, and add some LinkedIn profile pages of the core team, developers and other key people involved. In order to assess the feasibility of this proposal, the proposal needs to describe who will be working on the project, and how. There is a mention of hiring seasoned developers and an estimated platform launch date of 2024, but it would be valuable to know if these developers are already hired, how many hours per week they would work and how big part of the budget that will be allocated to them. A detailed budget allocation would increase the credibility of the proposal, if we could see how and when the requested 55 000 USD would be distributed over the course of the 3 years. Also, since the proposal aims to target such a large industry, is there any plans to apply for upcoming funds, since the time frame spans over 3 years? But more on the roadmap later. In regards to feasibility, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal does provide an estimated timeframe spanning over 3 years, but not much more details than that. If the community, investors and potential users had a way to follow the development and progress of the platform it would increase the strength of this proposal immensely. A suggestion could be to expand the roadmap of the project, add some milestones (where will the project be in 3 months, 6 months, 12 months?) and some measurements of success (KPIs). For example, \"we plan to have 200 people onboard using the beta version after 12 months. After 24 months, we will onboard another 400, along with some collaborations of organizations (links) that have long experience with the real estate market\". Considering I'm not a working in real estate these examples are just meant to explain the concept of what I would like to see included in the proposal, and not what details are missing. From my understanding, transparency and safety is an important building block in the core values of this proposal (which are amazing), but I would like to see those core levels of transparency reflected as much in the proposal as in the idea of it. \u2028Lastly, one thing that is included in the proposal that is not very common is that the proposer gives a short reflection on some potential risks and challenges that might rise while developing this project. Seeing the proposer understand the potential risks of challenging a large industry like the real estate and how that might lead to some legal issues and troublesome companies and individuals, leads me to think that the proposer has a deep understanding of the real estate market, which increases the trust and credibility of the proposal. However, due to the fact that a lot of information is missing I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

There's a good description of how that will happen and what are the plans for the future of this project. I don't see any KPIs or metrics to measure the success of the proposal, so it's going to be hard to measure the projects success and impact. No team is mentioned so It's hard to judge if the project will be ready for future challenges. Currently there are a couple of major items missing from the proposal like: KPIs, metrics, verifiable team members, a roadmap and a tracability channel for the community to follow along.

There are no resources that would describe how to implement the given proposal. No technologies or technical aspects of an implementation are mentioned in the proposal. The proposer has considered challenges and risks, and have provided some explanation on how this business will stay competitive by incentivising the users with lower fees than the current ones. By reading through the comments, I saw that there are already other projects in the community that try and do the same thing and a collaboration between this proposal and others may prove to be more practical and possible.
