The proponents intend to create a Dapp, which would be a wine trading platform, using smart contracts. But what would these contracts be used for, exactly? Could it be the sales data? What data? What exactly would be being hosted on our blockchain network? What would be the advantages of this for wine producers? At one point, the proponents say that one of the goals is \"to integrate new wineries into the project, showing them the advantages of open access to their wines\". It would be important for them to define in the proposal itself what these advantages would be. Also, what are the benefits for end consumers? I believe that the target audience is upper class people with an older age group, these are usually people who consume more refined wines. This audience is not the audience we are used to dealing with in our projects - most of the time, we are aiming to reach people who already use blockchain technology (people who already have knowledge of the technology field and interest in the cryptographic world); or even potential users, who are more likely to use Cardano ecosystem services. But the audience here seems to be different, really, people that we don't expect to have any kind of connection with Cardano. How to make this public understand the advantages present here, how to convince them to leave the traditional and use these new technologies? Because of so many doubts, unfortunately, I don't think the proposal is as guaranteed to work, that is, to create a Dapp that increases the number of transactions in Cardano and brings new users to our ecosystem. It's a very specific niche project, and it would need a better argumentation about the points I raised. If there were explanations about 1) how this would benefit Cardano, in more detail 2) how producers and consumers would convince themselves to use blockchain, confidence in the impact would probably be greatly increased.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "We know very little about this team, all we are told is that they are three people with experience in the wine business and also knowledge about blockchain. However, this is very little! We would need to know their names, what each one does, a brief history of previous work and, above all, how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem. They claim there are professionals with blockchain experience - but what would that experience look like? Have you done any projects in Cardano before? If yes, which one? Unfortunately, there's no way to trust a team we barely know. I suggest that bidders include detailed and individualized descriptions of each, preferably with examples of previous work and if there are also linkedin profiles. There is a script here, but it is superficial. For example, the first 3 months would be devoted to creating the platform to show it to the producers, right? They know WHAT would be done with which GOAL, but HOW? What activities would be developed chronologically and by whom, in order to obtain such a product? I also think that 3 months time is quite long; it would be more interesting if the activities were divided and organized monthly, for example. A point that worries me a lot here is the following: \"part time external consultant with experience in wine business (~1 day/week for 3 months 1500 USD/month\". We would be paying one person to work only 1 day a week on this project, that is, approximately 4 days of work that would cost USD 1500? I found this value very high, incompatible with the work time. Many professionals from other proposals work full time to receive such a salary, whether designers, developers, publicists, etc. This is somewhat disproportionate, in my view. Regarding the budget, it is explained along with the roadmap. At each stage, we are told how much the activities reported would cost. In relation to this point, I believe we have enough information to understand the funding, my observation here is just that (in my opinion) some values \u200b\u200bare fair, but others are disproportionate, as was the case commented earlier. Therefore, in conclusion: 1) there is no way to trust the team because there is little information about them 2) the script is superficial, but allows a view of the whole 3) the budget is understandable but disproportionate in some parts.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability here is good, because the author of the proposal outlines some KPIs that serve to monitor the direct results of the platform: number of consumers, suppliers, products sold... These are purely quantitative data, but they would indicate in a concise way if the project was successful or not. It would also be great if there was some sort of analysis of how many smart contracts were generated, what was the direct impact for the Cardano ecosystem? This part is little explored in the proposal as a whole, and also in the final metrics. It is possible to follow the development of the project based on the given roadmap. But, as I mentioned, without much detail and with a broad temporal division of several months compiled, in addition to the fact that we do not know who would do what, it is not possible to carry out such specific monitoring. Therefore, my suggestion is that the author define some metric (KPI) focused entirely on Cardano and that the roadmap be more detailed. We need to have contact with both the sales person and the developer in Cardano, to understand how the full facets of the project would be being developed. It is possible to audit the proposal, but this could be done in an even more satisfactory way if the commented data were created, revised and improved.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 31, "ne": 18, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Although the cited problem is understandable, there is not enough information to explain the dimension of the problem.

Even though there is mention of experience in the blockchain and wine fields, there is no source or link to support this information. Who will be responsible for the development of smart contracts?\n\nThe project plan was divided into 3 phases, but there are few details that indicate feasibility. There is no information about the development of smart contracts and who will develop them. Phase 1 will have an MVP, but I would recommend that the team work more on the rationale to justify the idea/concept, because the way the proposal was presented there is not enough information to indicate feasibility.\n\nThe budget is not well defined. The proposal is asking for 10,000 USD and there is mention of costs for hiring a salesperson for 1,500 USD, a consultant for 1,500 for 3 months and 1,500 USD for marketing(based on these values how do you get to 10,000 USD?), but none of these costs involve developing a dapp and considering that the purpose of the challenge is dapp development it doesn't make sense that the proposal asks for money only for items outside the main scope of the challenge. The main point to judge the feasibility of the budget is to understand the cost for the development of the dapp and although the team has mentioned that it will cover the additional costs, this isn't an argument to support the feasibility.\n\nRisks and challenges of the proposal were not considered. Before creating a wine marketplace, it would be important to know the potential, the demand of this market and what would be the appeal of creating a marketplace on the blockchain. Will these wines be certified/authenticated by blockchain? Is there an intention to create a supply chain model? Is there intent to use metadata? If the wines are certified through the blockchain, what would be the mechanisms to avoid fraud between the data included in the blockchain and the wine itself?\n\nThe idea itself is valid and a marketplace would be within the scope of the challenge, but I would recommend that the team provide more details so that it is possible to assess the feasibility of the proposal properly.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The problem was not well described, I would recommend providing more data and information to understand the value proposition of using the Cardano blockchain for the wine market.

And I don't think the types of members mentioned will be enough to bring the project to it's success once scaling is necessary. I see quite a bit of things missing in the proposal: an understandable budget, any kind of proof for stated skills, thought about reusing what's already been done and open sourced, probing for partnerships or talks with producers and a couple of other minor things like supply chain management research, price points, competitiveness.  As a developer, I was expecting more detail. With all due respect, this looks like an idea and not a business plan. Overall a good idea that fits with the challenge.

I hope the proposer wasn't rounding up and just made a mistake in calculating the end cost. I encourage the proposer to come back for the next funding rounds and take better care when compiling the proposal keeping in mind the proposal requirements. Putting yourself in the eyes of the voter is also a good idea when writing a proposal. Overall there were a couple of more things missing in the proposal that I already mentioned. Keeping in mind all said things I'd advise the author to take a look at other proposals and look at how does a proposal that is already funded look like.
