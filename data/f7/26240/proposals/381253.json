Doing this on the Cardano blockchain could significantly impact the music industry and create a community influx. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers had contact with 2 major music labels who have expressed interest in using this platform.

The youtube video added to the proposal gives a very good detailed information on both the current problems in music industry and potential solution to this problem via blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nFull points from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that the proposer has the experience (business domain) and has collaborated with one of the blockchain tech companies who will provide the implementation side of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThe tech lead for this project given has public profile given, although would have been better if his website link was posted here on the proposal itself :) . As a senior developer myself, i could see that he comes from a infrastructure background, and holds a BS degree in software engineering, but i have some concerns when it comes to a project of this scale. This kind of project (dapp) would need more experienced technical hands imo. But that is just my opinion.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that you could collaborate also with some senior devs for. helping hands with smart contract development and i am sure this project will be implemented successfully.

However, i feel that  community will have ability to track the progress of this product via the proposer. \r\n\r\nHowever, i can see that the 16 weeks plan is given, additionally, a 3-6-12 months roadmap is given. What i am missing is when Smart contract development will be done ? If 16 weeks are spent with web app, iOs and testing, that means more than 3 months, after which we expect 1 Record label piloting the software. Are smart contracts already expected by then ? \r\n\r\nI see there are some unclarity, and room for improvements.
