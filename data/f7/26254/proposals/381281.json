A wallet is a necessary requirement for broader adoption of DID technology, and it will take some time to build and develop. By providing a quick solution, this proposal would allow all kinds of other development to continue moving forward, while a fully developed wallet is constructed. The community of PRISM developers would benefit significantly from using the availability of this tool. It also connects very nicely with the complementary proposal to build a user-friendly Wallet. I commend Esteban for the clear way the two proposals are linked together and explained. It is also easy to understand how each proposal could be funded on its own. While there are synergies from funding both proposals, neither proposal depends on having the other funded.  Getting this built quickly will help the development and scaling of the entire Cardano DID ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer clearly has the relevant background and skills to build the wallet tool. He also has been active in the Cardano community and completed important courses from Emergo and IOG. As this would be a quick project, and the budget is correspondingly low, it makes sense that one person would tackle this individually, rather than creating a team. The budget is detailed and seems very reasonable for the value of the tool that would be created. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is clear and Esteban plans to provide a task list and a weekly report to allow easy auditing. The proposal clearly details the existing issue that the PRISM SDK is not yet public, which makes public auditing of the work difficult. An additional risk that the SDK might change is also clearly acknowledged. The proposal also addresses the lack of public material by noting that the users of this wallet would be developers who had already participated in the Pioneer course, and therefore already have access to the SDK. It is impressive that a significant amount of work has been started already, and is outside the scope of funds that are being requested for this proposal.  The KPIs are a bit vague. It would be helpful to track the number of developers using the tool. However, as it would be easy to monitor the development progress by using the Github repository, I don't see this as a major deficiency. Given the low amount of budget required, I am still comfortable rating this proposal five stars.

They will ad value to the Cardano ecosystem by accelerating Atala prism project development which in turn accelerates innovation on other projects in the ecosystem. The key metrics of this proposal is inline with the Challenge setting in the sense of literally accelerating decentralized identity. The project is able to scale well as it is a tool to be used and will be open sourced.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The relevant skills has been proven via LinkedIn page. The budget is very reasonable and broken down into items and hours to complete each item. The launch date for this is 5 weeks after funding approval, which is achievable and reasonable for a one man project. He explains all the different functions of the tool and goes into the technical details about the architecture and what kind of functions needs to be created to handle specific tasks. He considered the risk of changes on the current SDK and will make the necessary changes should this occur.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "He's raodmap is broken down into identifiable items. He even has an action plan that is broken down into even more detail on how he intends to build this. The KPIs provided is different phases that gets completed, but he also states that \"a weekly report will be published with progress announcements.\" which makes it extremely easy to track the progress and performance of this project.
