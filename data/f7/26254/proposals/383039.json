The proposer does an excellent job laying out the problem (middlemen manipulate and distort markets to the detriment of farmers) and their solution to solve it (p2p buy/sell system) that essentially cuts out the problem. I would have liked to see indications from the proposers about where exactly they plan to launch their initiative, but by focusing on \"sub saharan countries\" the impact is likely to be great, regardless. By also providing evidence of farmers banding together to combat this issue, the proposer further justifies the likely uptake of this solution among the target population. The lack of direct government support does cause some slight worry but I respect the proposers' \"build it and they will come\" approach, and the concerns are somewhat mitigated by the expected benefits provided to the farmers themselves through the application. Integrating Atala Prism into such a program is an excellent idea in order to provide a level of security and transparency, and overtime will become compatible with other Prism-related projects and products. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposer demonstrates the problem very well and offers a strong solution that puts the power back in the hands of the individual, true to Cardano form. I appreciate the link to the proposer's github account so interested voters can access the code repository in order to confirm the proposer's ability to deliver. Based on an initial scan the proposer is highly competent. The plan as laid out is very good and it's obvious that the proposer has a good understanding of the assumptions, constraints, and risks facing the project, and has a preliminary plan to address them. The roadmap and timeline are well laid out and the breakdown into the separate phases (including budget requests for each phase) can provide extra confidence to voters that the proposer has thought through the steps required to achieve their goal. The reason why I am giving this a 4/5 and not a 5 is because one major assumption I do not see addressed is the acceptance of governments to adopt this solution should it prove successful. It does say that governments will be onboarded in phase 1 but how this will be done is unclear. Are there already leads into some governments you've identified? Have you received support in-principle? What is a contingency if they do not accept it but side with the brokers? While I do not suggest these have not been considered, voters would be taking a bit of a risk and likely require answers before giving full marks. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The proposer does an excellent job making it clear to voters exactly what they can expect for the money, if funded. The detailed problem description, innovative solution, and outline on how to achieve it are easy to follow and clear. The breakdown of the budget takes the guess work out of it for voters as they can see which activities and deliverables require which resources. I would have liked to see some more explicit KPIs for voters to know how the success of the project will be measured. Is the success of the project to complete it or is it getting x amount of farmers signed up? Or y amount of jurisdictions onboarded? These types of details are important for voters to know when success can be considered achieved. Overall great job.

However the proposer failed to provide the details of team members who will help in the execution of the project when funded this i think doesn't make the proposal complete.

Will there be a pilot program to try and gauge the farmers' willingness to participate ?

The requested funds are not small, and the expertise needed is vast.
