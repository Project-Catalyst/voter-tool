Let me start by saying congratulations to the team on this amazing idea. Not only does this proposal effectively address the challenge, it has the potential to deliver massive adoption in markets that are seemingly opaque and bureaucratic. The integration of Cardano DIDs in a trust wallet already in use by the Canadian Government would be a game changer for the ecosystem. As the proposers mention, integrating the Cardano blockchain into existing trust wallets will be necessary to accelerate mass adoption. By targeting a country like Canada, and making the legacy system interoperable with the new blockchain future, the proposers are building the confidence for other western countries to be onboarded faster. I have no doubt that if successful this project could be a game changer. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the plan presented and the credentials of the team voters can be highly confident that this project will be implemented successfully. The primary reason why I am hyper confident is that the wallet already exists and is in use by the Canadian Government. The integration of Atala Prism DIDs within this wallet will provide a seamless experience to the user while improving the accessibility, functionality, and interoperability. Users (in Canada to start) will be able to use their DID across multiple platforms as opposed to now where hyperledger DIDs essentially maintain only one or two options (Government sites). By creating a more portable DID that can work between the systems, the same identifier used for Government services or employment could also be leveraged in other sectors such as housing or insurance. The credentials of the team are very well presented and as a CA I really appreciate the transparent identification of team members and their experience. Voters can feel confident that the team can deliver and therefore this project seems 100% feasible. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The fact that the team has committed to providing a free, open source, digital wallet that will be interoperable with an existing trust wallet and the Cardano blockchain can give voters a very high level of confidence that the project can be tracked and audited appropriately. By creating the open-source wallet, community members will have the opportunity to interact, critique, and engage the material prior to use and to help the team achieve it's vision. The clear milestones and product delivery also provide identifiable measures by which the community can gauge their process and ensure they are on track to achieve what they have laid out. I certainly will be following this project and am excited to see where it goes. Hats off to you.

The costs is relatively low, seem like the sort of project we should be funding.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer already have this project working. This is about porting it over to a Cardano Wallet. They have the experience and should be able to deliver their plan. My biggest worry there is not marketing plan. How will they drive adoption? It is not enough to just build the technical solution.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has clear deliverables against which progress can be audited. Whilst they have set the ambitious goal of enabling Cardano to compete as the preferred distributed ledger for adoption of decentralized digital identity globally, they have not set any specific metrics with goals against which success of this project can be measured.

What about goals for government of corporate clients?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 3, "ng": 20, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I am huge on these kinds of projects because I work in immigration compliance and want to see passports, visas, and other compliance materials on a blockchain.

A six person team with good qualifications is what I see from their links.

Since the Hyperledger Indy network, based on the Sovrin Ledger, is already a trusted leader, a proposal to develop one wallet providing access to both networks would be extremely valuable.  Providing a gateway or link between DIDs issued on Cardano and verifiers on Sovrin, or vice-versa would encourage adoption and be extremely valuable to the Cardano community. The proposal emphasizes many times that the wallet would be freely available for users to download, which would aid with scalability. On the other hand, the repeated mentions of making the wallet free made me wonder about the long-term business model. Who will pay for the ongoing maintenance and development of a free wallet? This would be a question applicable to anyone with a wallet development proposal, but the frequent reminder that this particular wallet would be free prompted me to ask the question. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides nice links to the profiles of the Team, who clearly have significant experience in the SSI industry, and have deep connections to the Cardano community. Chris Raczkowski provided a compelling fireside chat during the Atala PRISM pioneers program.  The budget is very moderate, particularly given the enormous benefit that such a wallet would provide. Since Chris was involved with the Pioneers program, he must be aware that the SDK is not yet public. However, there is no mention of this risk in the proposal, or how they would mitigate it in order to provide an open-source wallet. This gap is the only factor keeping me from rating this section with five stars. The clear links between the proposal team and IOG, and Chris's role in the PRISM pioneer program, are what is keeping me from giving an even lower rating, due to the importance of the SDK. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a road map provided, but the details are more aspirational statements than measurable KPIs. While inspiring, those statements do not provide a detailed plan for implementation.  It is not clear how someone could measure whether or not the wallet has succeeded in becoming \"the most trusted digital identity wallet\" or how they would assess whether or not the wallet has enabled \"Cardano to compete as the preferred distributed ledger.\" These are worthwhile goals, but they would be tough to use as auditing criteria.  It is also worth noting that someone had left a comment asking for these additional details during the feedback phase.

The problem being solved is the lack of interopability between established ID solutions and Atala Prism. The outcome of this project is a free, open source wallet built ontop of the DIT wallet that supports VC's anchored on Hyperledger Indy and Cardano Blockchains. This brings awareness and acceptence from the wider community. The project aligns nicely with this challenge to increase growth of the Cardano network. In terms of scalability the interopability and accpetance of this wallet will help it to scale beyond the reach of the average Cardano user. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team have a great deal of expertise and experience in this space which would lend to the success of the project. There's a team of 6 highly skilled people involved with experience in blockchain consulting, web developent and SSI integration. \r\n\r\nThe timeframe for the wallet integration is 3 months which is very reasonable as is the budget for this proposal with clear justification for each budget item. There might be argument for inclusion of more cost breakdown as there are some larger items in the budget.
