They plan to develop these libraries for Web Browsers via plugins, iOS platform and the Android platform.  The plan is to use the C language for use in Android and iOS as well as Web Assembly virtual machine (WASM).  Implementation of C libraries for use in WASM is of particular interest due to its functionality. WASM stack machines are efficient and fast as they can potentially execute at native seed by taking advantage of platform's common hardware capabilities.  They are safe in that they can be implemented in a sandboxed environment inside existing JavaScript virtual machines.  WASM libraries can enforce the same-origin and permission security policies of the browser when embedded in the web. \r\nWith each implementation covering Client Side, Read/Write Encrypted Data, Agent Layer and a Thin UI layer, this proposal seems poised to create a much-needed solution to one of the eco-system's biggest problems of mass adoption.  Creating a robust backend that will allow a strong UX layer that is safe and easy to use will go a long way towards mass adoption of the Cardano eco-system. \r\nThe project is positioned to create building blocks and Libraries wrapped together under a light UI Layer using Hyperledger Indy Wallet Components as reference and as such, will achieve interoperability.  This interoperability will allow Cardano and Atala PRISM to interact with other eco-systems.  Some key characteristics of Hyperledger Indy include:\r\n1.\tDIDs that are globally unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority.\r\n2.\tPairwise Identifiers that can create secure, 1:1 relationships between any two entities.\r\n3.\tZero Knowledge Proofs that prove some or all of the data in a set of Claims is true without revealing any additional information, including the identity of the Prover.\r\nThe Open-Source Identity Wallet project seems to hit the target.  It is providing a solution to a very critical part of mass adoption by building the framework on which ease-of-use, secure, decentralized ID applications can bring the mainstream to the Cardano eco-system.  I strongly agree that this proposal meets the impact of the challenge. ASSESSMENT SCORE 5\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility:\r\nThe core ideas behind the Open-Source Identity Wallet appears to be backed by solid, developed, real-world resources.  \r\nAn Action Plan:\r\nThe project outlines success in a 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month road map.  The 3-Month milestone indicates a Detailed specification and API definition for the Wallet Components, including Wireframes as its deliverable.  It is notable that the API and wireframes for the wallet appears complete and is linked at https://github.com/IAMXID. The development team proves strong credibility by coming to the table with the 3 Month milestone already completed. \r\nThey plan to have the Reference implementation for Web, Android, and iOS ready at the 6-Month milestone.  \r\nThe 12-Month milestone of iOS/Android implementation, Source Code documentation with the Expected Launch date of 1/6/2022 really showcases this team's powerful march toward their ultimate goal.

This project's key performance indicators lie in their code linked on Github.com/IAMXID.  For people/voters not versed in coding, it could be difficult to tell what progress this team is making. I have no doubt that the project will achieve its stated goals however, more tools used, and a better description of the process used to develop the software could serve to give more insight into the progress of the program ultimately leading to the project being easier to follow outside of the development circles.  The project lacks good auditability and falls a bit short on specific key performance indicators that could help to track this project's progress and add to its overall transparency.

The field is so broad, and there are so many different use cases, that the team's proposal to build a flexible and general tool that could be adapted by specific projects also makes sense. However, I am a bit confused regarding whether this proposal seeks to build a wallet that would for end-users (as seems to be implied in some sections) or a tool that would be used by other developers of wallets (as is implied in other sections).  As a result of this lack of clarity, I am struggling to identify the target audience for this wallet, and therefore to assess which community would benefit from its creation. Similarly, the proposal would be strengthened by references to other projects in the ecosystem, to give a clearer view of where this proposal would fit in. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The detailed experience listed for the team members is impressive, and clearly supports their ability to build the proposed software. While the introduction references experience in the Atala Prism Pioneer program, it is not clear which of the team members participated in the course. As participation in the course is essential in order to access the Atala PRISM SDK, more detail on this point would be useful. Additionally, while the proposal states that Joseph Frankeiewicz is a co-founder of the EAGLE pool and the developer of the Pool Peek app, none of the other team members appears to have experience in the Cardano ecosystem, as detailed in the proposal. Additionally, no links are available to public information about the team. From googling, I was able to find relatively clear evidence substantiating their experience, but next time around it might be helpful to make that info more explicit. Similarly, IAMX is sort-of referenced in the proposal, but not explained. By googling I was able to find the company's website and they appear to be engaged in very interesting work in the Carano ecosystem, and to be partnered with WADA, which is also a strong community within the eocosystem. More detail about IAMX, and particularly whether this wallet is directly related to that company would be very helpful. If the company is not at all related to the wallet project, then I would suggest removing the references to IAMX completely. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap, although the milestones are a bit vague and would benefit from more detail. There aren't any KPI metrics described. A glaring miss in the proposal is any reference to the fact that the Atala PRISM SDK is not yet final or public. It is not clear how they intend to build an Open-Source wallet when the SDK is not yet available to the public. Other proposers in this challenge have highlighted the PRISM SDK as a risk, and documented their plans to address. The team does reference the Hyperledger Indy SDK. While their familiarity with that material is good to know, it is even more confusing that the Hyperledger SDK's is cited while the proposal is completely silent on the PRISM SDK. It would also be very useful to understand why exactly the Indy SDK is a point of reference, and how it compares and contrasts to the approach taken by Cardano.
