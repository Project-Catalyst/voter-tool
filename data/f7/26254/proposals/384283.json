I really appreciate the problem identified the proposer as the transfer of digital assets upon death or incapacitation will likely continue to grow and become a serious issue in the crypto space. If successful, such a platform (DID backed Wills and Testaments) would likely give massive benefit to the community, however what is less clear is how this project specifically would impact the broader community. Yes, information gathering and analysis is good, but I would have liked to see a better justification for doing this project in this manner. I am left wondering what other type of work is already ongoing in the community with respect to this exact issue, and how will the project accelerate the adoption of DIDs? As written, it appears the project would likely explore the option of DIDs in such a system but would not necessarily lead to their adoption, say if certain legal issues arise. To this end, is there a certain jurisdiction being examined first? How would the different legal regimes be accounted for? In order to get full marks for impact I would have liked to see a section  exploring/explaining these types of considerations . ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that this proposal would be implemented successfully. I appreciate that the proposer has shared a link to their credentials so that voters can look should they so choose. The proposer also has a good track record of success within the Cardano community which increases confidence that they have the ability to deliver the project. I am confused a bit however, why the proposer did not add in the credentials of the identified UX researcher since he is already on the team and will be responsible for half the work. What is also missing for me, however, is a clear timeline or roadmap for when this work will be completed. The deliverables are well laid out and the KPIs appear achievable but I am not sure over what timeline. If going off of the budget it appears that this only a 2 month project but for what is being suggested this is likely insufficient. To get full marks here, I would have liked to see this timeline and at what intervals the steps would be taken. The budget is quite reasonable and if successful could return dividends to the community for such a small amount, however for the reasons stated above more detail is needed for full marks. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is unclear from the proposal how it would be audited appropriately. While I appreciate the experience of the proposer as provided in the proposal, it is unclear how the community would be able to track and engage with the proposers. By opening the surveys to \"volunteers\" the proposer could inherently be skewing the results due to the fact that those who volunteer are often the ones with the most to say, and may not accurately reflect the situation. What criteria would be used to select these people, how would they be vetted once identified, and what, if any, safeguards are in place to ensure accuracy and clarity for the project? While the KPIs and deliverables are clear, what is less obvious is how the proposer will present their findings back to the community or tap into the community knowledge to help improve it. I am giving this proposal a 3/5 (neither agree or disagree) because more details are needed for voters to feel confident this could be audited appropriately. If not successful in this fund, adding these components to the next submission would surely result in full marks.
