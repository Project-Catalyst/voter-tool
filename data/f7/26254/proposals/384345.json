Given the significant differences between academic institutions and the systems they deploy, having a standardized DID (based on Atala Prism) is an excellent idea and could have a huge impact. This project is very exciting as it builds on a previously funded proposal and expands the scope by reaching more individuals and institutions. Being already situated in an academic institution the proposers are likely very well suited to lead this project and encourage growth to other institutions. I also value the social and community-building being delivered through this project, such as bringing together groups of students and educators from a wide variety of backgrounds, to help brainstorm ideas and discuss collaborative solutions. This speaks true to Cardano principles and serves as a gateway for many new members to get involved.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is extremely likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. What I appreciate about this proposal is that it is tapping into the knowledge of the community to identify problems facing the integration and adoption of DIDs, and using that knowledge to deliver solutions within an already situated academic institution. The location of the lead proposer, as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for the institution, can give voters very high confidence that this project will be implemented successfully. I also appreciate the risk identification and mitigation section as it implies the proposers have thought through the idea and are prepared to address issues that arise. This is also a WADA supported project with a WADA Stake pool being hosted at the IT department of the lead institution, lending further support to the likelihood of success. I am impressed that the proposers feel they can deliver the outcomes of this project for the community for such a low cost, but the budget is more than reasonable and is well worth the risk for the community given the likelihood of success.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is more than sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The proposers do an excellent job identify what the hope to achieve, how they plan to achieve it, and what the potential outcome will be. The roadmap is easy to follow and walks voters through each of the stages that will occur and what the expected activities and results are at each stage. As ISDR/GL is a public institution and the management committee will receive the funds to implement the project, they will be subject to an annual audit, providing confidence to voters that spending on the project can be confirmed. The team also explicitly commits to providing community updates by the proposer team, and as a WADA affiliate is easily accessible by Cardano community members. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_66", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 14, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is a second phase of a previous proposal that was funded in the cycle 6.

However, it is unclear to me how the proposal intends to address that problem. Furthermore, after reading the team's referenced proposal that was funded in Fund6 in combination with the current proposal, it is not clear to me that the proposers understand Atala PRISM. Their first proposal references using the Yoroi to pay for university expenses in ADA. While that is a valuable activity for the Cardano ecosystem, it is has nothing to do with Atala PRISM. Similarly, the idea of issuing NFTs to participating Alumni (referenced in both the previous proposal and this current proposal) has nothing to do with Atala PRISM. The proposal seems to be confusing the concept of a \"digital ID,\" which would be a simple digital representation of a traditional ID, with a DID creating using the Atala PRISM software. I am forced to give this proposal a one-star rating in spite of some of the potential of their ideas due to the fact that it has nothing to do with the challenge. Furthermore, their incorrect use of the Atala PRISM terms seriously undermines their credibility.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There are numerous references to ISDR/GL, but that term is not clearly explained. It took me some googling and clicking through of the various links provided in order to understand that ISDR/GL is an educational institution. The proposal does not clearly explain the links between any of the proposers and that educational institution, so it is difficult to assess how successfully the proposers will be able to influence the school to use any Cardano technology.  The proposal requests $1,000 to host a meetup and brainstorm on applications of DID. Given the team's apparent lack of understanding of DIDs, I am skeptical regarding their ability to facilitate a meetup on the topic. But furthermore, I am not confident that a broad-based meetup open to any students and faculty is a productive way to generate DID-use cases. Most importantly, it isn't clear why $1,000 would be needed for a meetup.  I have similar concerns about all the budget line items. It is not clear why $2,000 is needed to host a blockchain conference. It is not clear why the team is confident that Heads of Institutions would attend.  A QR code is referenced for the first time in this budget line item but is not clear what this means or where it is coming from. It is not clear how $1,500 would be spent on an instructor surveying students about ID-based obstacles, how this line item relates to the other line items, or what this might have to do specifically with Atala PRISM, and the stated problem of promoting DID standards and interoperability.  The proposal highlights a risk that the public institution of ISDR/GL may be prevented from participating in a blockchain based solution. If the purpose of the proposal is to deploy a blockchain-based solution to this particular institution, it seems that the very first step should be to determine the feasibility, before requesting any funding. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the proposal states that a management committee will receive the funds to implement the project. This statement raises more questions than it answers. Who is the management committee? What do they manage? Which project will be implemented? I can't imagine how anyone could make a serious attempt to audit the proposal based on that statement. Similarly the statement that \"video and other digital products will be produced\" is hopelessly vague. The only bio provided is that of the Chairman, Frederic Samvura, whose LinkedIn headline states \"Now I am too busy with a growing family to face any new challenge,\" which does not provide a lot of confidence in his ability to take on this proposal.
