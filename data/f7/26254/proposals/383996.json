As the Kountable system is already up and running in 6 major African countries, this integration could likely be quick and immediately provide value to the Cardano ecosystem and its users. The trust built by the proposers throughout the area will reduce barriers to adoption and increase the reach of Atala Prism by brining in new sectors. I appreciate the proposers' inclusion of the previous work they have done in this space, including its success, as well as their identification of the SDGs which will be addressed by their solution. This evidence of previous impact and attentiveness to global issues will likely resonate well with voters. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is hard to definitively tell if the proposal will be implemented successfully. The existing product highlights that the company behind the proposal has experience and success in addressing the \"last mile\" problem of reaching rural and developing communities with necessary resources. However, the plan presented, while exciting, needs to be further developed and better explain how the Atala Prism integration will be conducted. It is not clear what is entailed to integrate Atala Prism into the existing program or how long that would take. Unfortunately there is also no real timeline for the work, neither is there a budget breakdown. For $50k voters deserve more than just a lump sum amount with no indication of how that number was reached or how it will be spent. Given the lack of critical information on these issues I neither agree nor disagree that it could be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, there is no real information for voters to audit the progress or success of the proposal. While the idea is clearly there and the company's track record suggests the proposers would be able to solve it, there is no way for the Cardano community to identify or track the outcomes. I appreciate the KPIs provided as part of the SDGs, however, this does not explain how the integration of Atala Prism would aid in achieving these. As the company clearly showcases their success in the \"last mile\" problem it could be inferred that many of these KPIs are not specific to this project but rather the company's operations writ-large. Moreover, as highlighted above, the lack of any indication for how the budget will be spent and on what causes me some concern, with voters likely to be weary of this approach. In order to increase the score, I would encourage the proposers to more clearly articulate how the community can be involved or informed of the progress and success of the project.
