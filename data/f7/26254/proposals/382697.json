This system is based on a familiar recognition, which analyzes the interaction of users online and offline. How is this possible? I would like the proponents to better define how this tool works and in terms that are understandable to all readers. The BrightID system is said to be based on Etherioum (is it an Ethereum-turned cryptocurrency?). Something that worries me a bit here is this: \"the only thing needed to authenticate a person's uniqueness is an image and a name that can be changed at any time\". How does this system guarantee that your information is inviolable, since it is so simple to define the identity of its users? I also think I'm not very clear on how this junction of BrightID and DIDs would be. Would people using BrightID automatically have DIDs generated? This couldn't be an involuntary process, right? How would this adoption take place, how would the explanation be made about what Atala Prism is, how to convince these people of the advantages of having a decentralized identity also in Cardano, since they would already have another one? The authors of the proposal justify that this solution would be interesting for cases in which populations have suffered from disasters (generated by natural or human causes). But why, exactly? The authors have one of these examples (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Decentralized-Autonomous-Iddir/381135-48088), which is very positive, but even reading this proposal I cannot understand how this new BrightID + Atala Prism functionality would be utilized. In general: several doubts arose when I read the proposal, I don't think it was possible to fully understand its impact on the Cardano ecosystem. However, I believe that yes, it could be something very interesting and that would align well with the objectives of the challenge if the proposal were described in a simpler way and answering the doubts that I pointed out here (maybe other CAs have other questions or even the same ones).", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Little is said about the team that makes up this project. There are 3 authors, but the information mentioned in \"relevant experience\" seems to me to say about only one person... I would like to know what ITN is (in \"Run ITN\"). I think this proposal lacked a more adequate presentation of the members, understanding: their names, what they have done so far, areas of academic training and professional performance and especially how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem and Atala Prism. The team that proposed this idea is the same team that developed the BrightID platform, right? This gives us a certain security about the capacity of their work, but in no way, unfortunately, guarantees us that they have knowledge and experience in Cardano and understand well about Atala Prism. Therefore, I do not believe that much confidence is passed in the team to properly execute the proposal. About a roadmap, it doesn't exist here, unfortunately, the authors were careless and did not explain at any time what activities would be developed in order to achieve the final result (the integration between their platform and Atala Prism). It is essential to have a timeline of activities to understand the development process, who would do what and so on. And as for financing, it is all geared towards paying the professionals involved, at a cost of USD 30 per hour (a very fair amount, in my opinion). Is it possible to partially understand where the money goes, since it is not defined how many hours each professional would work (it would be 100 hours for each, since there are 3 people)? When they say that the value would change with the input of the developers, why, and how much would it be? I believe that we still have a number of open questions about how the money would be used, that is, it is necessary to give a more detailed explanation of this. Unfortunately, therefore, both in terms of staff, script and budget are superficial and need a lot of improvement.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, this is the most incomplete part of the proposal. The authors spend most of their time describing what BrightID is, but they don't map out a roadmap, as I mentioned in the previous topic, and they don't define KPIs either. Thus, no information is provided on how we could follow the development process of this project; also, with the absence of KPIs, nothing is defined that can be tracked as partial/final results. Without such information, the proposal is not auditable. I suggest that the authors develop these two things (a detailed roadmap and KPIs), and from that establish a direct and frequent contact with the Cardano community, so that it is possible to verify if what was promised is being fulfilled. I think it would also be interesting to do a user survey. Those who already use the BrightID platform made their DIDs in Atala Prism, and if so, what did you think? Have their expectations been met, have they been interested in our blockchain to the point of getting involved with other ecosystem activities? This is just a qualitative suggestion. In addition, you need to define numbers: how many people have acquired DIDs, how this number grows, according to the passage of time, etc etc.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 13, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal identifies the problem of depending on centralized entities to create identity for oneself.
