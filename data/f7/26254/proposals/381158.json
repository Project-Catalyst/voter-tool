Oftentimes, authors have certain technical knowledge and use acronyms in their proposals so that it is not 100% understandable for all reviewers to read and understand. I would like to emphasize the importance of \"equalizing\" the understanding, which is done here. In relation to the project: I believe so, it is something that aligns with the objectives of the challenge. This challenge seeks to further encourage the adoption of decentralized identities promoted by the blockchain Cardano, and is a continuation of the challenge proposed in f6: Atala Prism. The idea here would be precisely that, to promote the use of decentralized identities across the territory of Latin America, by offering a basic course. The author justifies that, for the most part, people from this location are unaware of its advantages, and the objective of this proposal would be precisely to take such information to the population. I believe this is also good because it not only achieves the objectives of this challenge, but also relates to the other challenge of this same fund focused on Latin America. The author argues well on the topic \"why is this important?\" the validity of your project. There is no need to repeat here the points he mentioned, but in fact, Latin America is a continent that unfortunately is very unequal, while some people earn a lot of money and have all the technology at their disposal, others still have a routine of explored work and do not know/understand the benefits that some technologies (such as the one in question) can offer. So I believe the project would have a high impact if funded.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author provides a good explanation of what exactly his project would be, and how it would happen. It tells you what the details would be and also provides a script, which is quite detailed, but could be even more. It breaks down activities based on the passage of time, listing in topics what would happen in those intervals. In my view, it would have been even better if he had done such a split monthly, that way we would have a complete view of how the project would unfold over time. However, what is informed is enough for us to be able to visualize it satisfactorily (although not perfect). Regarding the team: I believe the author does not detail this part properly. Starting because he doesn't present himself properly, we don't know what his area of \u200b\u200btraining is, previous experiences and how he got involved with Cardano. He gives us his linkedin, where we can get to know him, but it would be important to have a minimum of detail about who he is and what he has done so far in the proposal itself. The author introduces some partners, but what happens is the same thing, he provides a link through which we can find out about their proposals, but I would like to know their names, training areas, etc. I don't think it would be important to have a little r\u00e9sum\u00e9 from each partner, not as much as it is important for us to get to know the author well. We managed to find out who they are, but this basic information should have been included in the proposal itself. And about the budget, I found the 24k value to be fair for what the project purports to be. This value is divided into a few topics, which makes for a good understanding of how it would be used. However, I believe that, once again, there could be more detail. For example, in the first topic \"Introductory course and workshops: $4,000\". Would all workshops cost the same price? How exactly would this money be used to run the workshops? Content created, hosting, etc... Anyway, I believe that the author provides us, in general, a good overview of the budget and the process, even if there is a lack of detail, the part that left most to be desired in my opinion was really the team presentation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You can audit the project based on the information provided in the \"project details\" topic. We can also monitor the activities described in the roadmap. About the results, it is possible to monitor them through the topic \"how is the success\". In other words, the author of the proposal provides us with enough material to understand what would happen, how it would happen, in which order and vision, which final products. This makes your proposal easily auditable, as long as we choose technically prepared people to do this. Some community members could be chosen to participate in the Atala Prism project; if they were natives of Latin America, it would be even better. I also believe that because it is a very complex project and full of aspects, it would be important for the author, together with his partners, to collect information about the progressive results, and not just the final product after several months. He could give this feedback to the community, in order to update everyone on the progress of his proposal.

Although the initial implementation is limited on membership and workshop certificates for community member, it could be expanded in the future for other purpose e.g. commercial, club, and loyalty pass, ID card, etc. The limited scope of this proposal is understandable given the budget requested is relatively low and only 1 team member responsible for the implementation.

My only concern is with only one person overseeing the whole project, there is a high risk of failure in case Dany is unavailable for executing the project (e.g. he got sick).
