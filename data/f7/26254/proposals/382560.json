Unfortunately, I could not come to a definite conclusion hence the score of 3. Whilst I can see how the translation of ATALA Prism resources from English to Japanese will indirectly lead to an acceleration of the development of DID, it is one-step behind the Challenge's directive to develop & implement solutions with ATALA Prism. This means a more direct relationship with ATALA Prism itself, not the educational step which could potentially lead to the development and implementation of solutions. The more I read the proposal the more convinced I am that this should be submitted under the Multilingual Resource challenge. As it is, unfortunately I cannot provide any level of agreement in terms of its impact nor alignment. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As mentioned, the team behind this proposal are credentialed Cardano participants who spearhead the promotion and communication of Cardano in the country. They have presented their expertise and background, though none can be confirmed with links to a career-profile. They will need to be accepted at face value. The plan presented, from the collection of materials to the education of developers and engineers are clear over the six-month span. However, the $50000 amount requested leaves a big question mark as to providing value for money. Distributing parts of the amount as $5000 and $3000 monthly incomes for 7 and 3 people, respectively, do not come with rationale. I am unsure if translating services into Japanese attracts a higher salary in Japan but my ignorance out of the way, I question the need for seven people prior to the collection of the materials. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Translating resources from one language to another will always be an auditable project since the work and the outcome are closely related, especially for educational materials. In addition th proposers added a google docs link which presumably would be the receptacle for translated material prior to general consumption. Another aspect for auditability are the materials required to educate the develops and engineers, which I presume may be slightly different to the version for public display. As mentioned, the proposing team consists of very active Japanese Cardano Community members, SPOs and IOG representatives, each with their own active twitter accounts. These may also serve as communication channels for any questions related to this proposal or for any announcements they wish to make with regards to their progress.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 24, "ne": 13, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal problem statement and solution are aligned with the challenge. This proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the \r\nCardano ecosystem by translating documents including DID and ATALA prism materials into their language for onboarding new experts and teachers thus helping their community grow.  Therefore the key metrics and goals of this proposal are aligned with the outlined challenge settings. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provided evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the project. \r\nThe proposer also knows the required manpower and resources to successfully implement the project. \r\nThe budget presented is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable terms. \r\nMoreover, the budget requested are reasonable to achieve the set goals. \r\nFurthermore, this proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation.

In this way, new professionals would understand what, after all, the ecosystem is and what its decentralized identity system is, and with that, new members would certainly be added to the community. It's also very positive how proponents put current problems into context - so we're more focused on what they need to solve. This proposal solves the objectives of two challenges: the present challenge, by Atala Prism, since, as I said, new users would be joined, and it would also directly benefit Japan, disseminating our blockchain technologies there, as the specific challenge about Japan search. It is possible to understand 100% of what is intended to be done through the list of activities found in \"detailed plan\", and I assure you, this is one of the most positive proposals for the Cardano ecosystem that I have evaluated so far at f7: introducing the Japanese market Atala Prism , NFT and various technologies relevant to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the detailed plan, we have the main activities that have just been developed, such as commenting on impact. Proponents also provide a roadmap that temporally organizes the activities. However, this script should be more detailed, in my opinion. For example: \"5~6th month: Engagement expansion\". How would this expansion take place, what marketing strategies would be developed here? About the team, I think this part is perfect. We have the names, main roles and linkedin profiles of those involved. In this way, we get to know the team well and understand its specificities, and they are certainly capable of successfully executing the project, since the professional activities of those involved are well diversified and include specialists in Cardano (ambassadors and SPOs). Finally, the budget is also explained in a very satisfactory way, we know how the amount of 50k, which despite being high, makes sense for this proposal, will be used. How it will be divided and why each part corresponds to each percentage of the final amount. Ultimately, the only improvement I can identify here would be an increase in script details. Otherwise, it's all very good!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Through the detailed plan, current issues and KPIs we were able to audit this proposal very well. Current problems would serve as a guide for us to monitor whether the situations previously encountered have been remedied, if the project was able to meet the needs of the context. With the detailed plan, it is possible to monitor if the activities that were promised are actually being done by the team members, and how they are being done, that is, if everything that was planned became reality. The KPIs serve to analyze the reflection of this proposal in Japan - there are two, as the proponents point out: the amount of translated materials and the audience reached with the \"learn to win\" program. This last part is something that the team itself should analyze, collect data and present to the rest of the community. As it is a project aimed at the Japanese target audience, it would be very interesting for some member of the community from the country to accompany this proposal and establish continuous contact with the rest of the community. He could have a closer view of what was happening, and, knowing the specifics of the country, would better understand the results achieved than someone outside Japan. Furthermore, the autability is great.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 10, "ng": 17, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposers want to translate AtalaPrism and DID related materials in japanese. This proposal perfectly fits the challenge and will lead to increaced decentralization and asymetrical growth. It will be a great value added for the cardano ecosystem to bring along more japanese people into the crypto space and cardano in particular. The KPIs and goals align with the challenge settings as mentioned. The team seams prepared to face any challenges and a couple of those challenges like obtaining the documents is being worked on already.  This proposal will add something missing in the ecosystem and that's localization in a native language. I think there should be more translations to bring the whole world along quicker. As a developer myself, I'm no expert in these matters but I don't see any logical roadblocks at this point. Overall a great proposal that's worth doing. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers add evidence of their credentials and I was able to verify most of their skillsets using the provided materials and links. In my humble oppinion this brings credibility to the whole project because the voters can see the team is legit. The budget could have been broken down better, because it's nott clear exactly how the funds will be dispersed, but I can appreciate the effort put in. Having said that I'd like to see a better break down with rationale given behind the hourly rates, because that would make them comparible and verifiable. As I said I'm no expert in this field but even so the timetable seems reasonable for the work that will be done, given they manage to aquire the documentation that needs translation. There's a sensible plan for implementation and there are a lot of details on how every step will be taken and implemented. The resources necessary to implement the proposal are listed and valid.  Consideration of risk is one of the reason I believe the project will be implemented successfully because it shows foresight and consistency.  I think it's a feasible proposal that has a high chance of being implemented. Good luck to all the team members! ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The learn to earn programe is the thing that makes this project tracable and it's success auditable. The mentioned KPIs are reasonable measured in translated documents and reached people that know about the project although that's not as important. There's a roadmap that seems reasonable.
