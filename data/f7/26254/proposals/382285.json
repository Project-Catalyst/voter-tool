Despite Atala Prism not yet released, this proposal aims to get ahead of its impending deployment. It is presented as a 'research-focussed' project and is forthcoming of the risks inherent in such a venture. I would have given it top-marks had the author acknowledged the possibility that IOG themselves may in fact release such a schema (and how this then impacts the project), in the same way some of the comments indicated in the proposer's Fund 6 proposal. What would have also improved the impact is if the proposer indicated how it would manage to market the WIKI-like end product to the audience and projects who may benefit from it. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "5 - I agree based on the output of the Fund 6 venture that there's a very good likelihood for success in producing a WIKI-like documentation, at the very least for activities 1 and 2. Hopefully the success of building this schema is widely shared across the community and more importantly with the projects who would benefit from it, that the 3rd activity is something that becomes a living works-in-progress as more sophisticated uses of DIDs present themselves in the future. The proposer has a Linkedin profile though does not have a picture so there's an 'unknown' element. That said, efforts for its Fund 6 venture speaks well of the credentials.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I agree that this proposal is very clear in its goals and have presented the intended pathway well enough for the general public to understand. Since the schema will be presented as a WIKI-like document the audit points are obvious and tracking its progress would be clear. Where this proposal could further improve is with an explanation of the way this resource is going to be shared across the community members who would need to see, utilise and hopefully add to the schemas. It would be a pity if such a resource is produced, but lacks visibility and prominence. In a former life I assessed tenders for a Higher Education institution and its not uncommon to see proposals that are research-based, to explore possibilities prior to making a much larger investment. This proposal presents very well in my experience.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 10, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal problem statement and solution are aligned with the challenge. \r\nThis proposal also clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by creating documentation with standardized credential models that can be augmented by Atala Prism community.

The requested budget is very low and the idea of calling for assistance with researching and documenting the different models makes a lot of sense.
