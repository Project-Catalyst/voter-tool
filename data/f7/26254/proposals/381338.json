Digital Identity will be paramount in future economic transactions and solutions which emphasises personal ownership of data will likely be the most desired aspect for successful adoption. This proposal aims to assist in the acceleration of this challenge hence my agreement to its impact and alignment. Where the proposal failed to gain the highest score is in its inability to clearly explain how this will be accomplished. There's a lot of high level statements but not enough granular details to explain what is being built, how the collection of personal data will be conduced (particularly biometric data), what are the legal ramifications for collecting fingerprints, face scans, iris scans, etc. and how all these collected personal information ties in with 1-Click fulfilment (and whose?). ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Whilst the team members are named on the proposal and their respective qualifications published in LinkedIn being accessible via the iamx.com website, I am unsure of this project's feasibility because there is no form of a plan laid out. There are 'summaries' of goals and benefits which are very much described at a high level and in point form. Whilst this is fine for a brief summary, it does not present well in a proposal where $93000 is being requested. In order to raise feasibility, I suggest this proposal be re-written with a clear timeline of an executable plan. This will provide voters with confidence that there is a beginning and an end and that each of the stages in-between have costings which are clearly explained. The proposal listed outcomes and benefits to an individual, the state (Ghana) and the ecosystem, but it got too far ahead of itself without any substantial information on how it will get there. It may also benefit from an explanation as to why Ghana? The iamx team as far as I can gather are based in Germany. What are the existing relationships with Ghanaian entities which makes this country ideal for the pilot? ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The $93000 requested fund has no clear breakdown of what makes up this amount, which is essential to any audit and examination of any project. Furthermore, there was no plan laid out to explain how the team will kick off activities, who and what roles participate and where/when it ends. These missing, and very critical aspects are the reasons why I rated it so poorly for auditability. My suggestion is for this entire proposal to be rewritten with clarity that would easily inform a voter who may just quickly peruse a proposal prior to voting for or against. It may also benefit the proposing team to either consult with other successful proposers or look at previous proposals to gain insight as to what elements are mandatory in order to have a measure of success with funding requests. The iamx website displays an association with WADA Alliance so I additionally suggest engagement with their teams who have successfully been funded. They will definitely know which pertinent details are necessary to gain traction in Catalyst. I am almost insulted by this proposal given the status IAMX has been given by IOHK themselves, being 1/3 teams listed under IOG's Identity Ecosystem section. The personnel of IAMX are credentialed people but no effort seems to have been given in preparing this proposal as most of the content was lifted from their website. IAMX has an active pool and are active on twitter so in that sense, there are channels from where they can be held into account by the community.

Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a very important problem regarding DID: the lack off accessibility of identity itself and the cosequencies from it. It approaches this problem with a valid solution that will both benefit the Cardano ecosystem and the people that suffer from a lack of identity. The solution provided is very detailed and well-made. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they and their project partners will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

The idea can be defined by the following passage: \"provide free and solid biometric identity, owned and controlled by the holder\". In theory this is great, but where does Cardano come in, where does Atala Prism fit in? Unfortunately, during the description of this project, the proponents focused on explaining the product but not on making us understand how it would benefit the Cardano ecosystem. At no point is it said that the decentralized identity would be stored on our blockchain. There's not much else to say, unfortunately. There is no point in offering so many advantages to the final customer, who would have these services free of charge, from what can be inferred, and not benefit those who would be financially supporting the idea... I suggest that the proponents clarify this issue better, because I have read the proposal completely and it is still not clear to me how this bridge would take place.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "We have and do not have information about the team here. I'm gonna explain. Are some companies mentioned that would be part of the project (IAMX AG, Zug, CH), would the executive board be the leaders of these organizations? Would a total of 25 people be involved in the project? It would be essential to know who they are, individually. Names, positions, how they would work on the project, professional training, who would be responsible for the development in Cardano... It is positive that they clarify the industry sector and the business model, but at the same time, some information is somewhat loose, such as for example, we only have contact information for these companies (IAMX). It is very positive that they anticipate the risk of so many different aspects, such as software risk, product risk and so on. This demonstrates a lot of experience in the development of this project. However, it is essential, in my opinion, that we know the characteristics of the members individually, this is what builds greater trust in the team: a more humanized notion about who we are dealing with. About the script: totally absent. The team provides us with a lot of relevant information about the project, such as benefits for customers, risks, objectives, etc., but at no time are phases and activities to be carried out to achieve the goals determined. It is not possible to understand how the development process of this project would take place. And finally, in terms of funding, nothing is said about how the 93k orders would be used! It is essential to share the money, how much would go for each thing and because, it is a very high value and without any explanation that justifies it, it is very difficult for the community to judge if it is a fair or exaggerated amount...", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The best part of the proposal. The team is willing to provide some very relevant information that would serve as a way of auditing the project, even though they have not traced a roadmap (through which we could monitor whether the activities were being carried out as promised) and KPIs. This information is: the objectives (indirectly, I would say they are the KPIs of the proposal); the results (they could also be called KPIs!); the benefits (through them, we can monitor if what was planned for the client was actually carried out, in addition to conducting a direct survey with the public to understand their degree of satisfaction) and risk analysis (here we have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe problems that would be faced and you can monitor whether they were avoided and/or resolved). It's the part that became clearest in my view, both the team could gather such data and wash it to the rest of the community; how much a local resident who was already part of the Cardano community could make contact with the team and take the information to the rest of us.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 11, "ng": 13, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal includes some technical jargon but is severely lacking in real substance.

Of course, we are all excited about the possibilities of digital identity, but this this proposal doesn't really offer a detailed solution to any problem and does not communicate any technical nuance. The project summary includes many commendable goals that are appropriate for the challenge but doesn't go into detail about how these goals will be achieved. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Frankly I'm confused by this proposal because the quality of the the team as listed on the website is very high, but the content on the website and in the proposal are severely lacking in detail and not convincing. The proposers do go into some detail in the comments section of ideascale when responding to questions, but these responses are similar to the proposal body in their tone. Their ISPO stake pool has 4M in delegation so they must have some trust from the community.
