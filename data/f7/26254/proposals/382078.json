Building an open source identity wallet that is operational with Atala Prism Decentralized IDs and verifiable credentials would be an amazing way of accelerating decentralized identity on the Cardano blockchain. The fact that the team includes four members from the first Atala Prism Pioneer Program cohort makes it even better. What are Atala Prism pioneers readying for - if not for community-led projects like this. The team did well to capitalize the words OPEN SOURCE in their proposed solution. It's a key contribution that will make the impact even bigger. Initially, they will create a modular framework with the foundational building blocks of an Identity Wallet for individual users. What does this mean - anyone will be able to build and run it on a mobile device. I especially like the fact that they are already considering an updated development plan in order to proceed into future funds. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Way to go with the presentation of skills, experience and technical know-how. If you like to know your developer team, this is how to present it. I won't go into the details - but as they themselves state they have  a cumulative total of 100 years of software development experience. The budget breakdown also includes estimates of developer velocity (peak and mean), as well as a development rate for the budget and a precise breakdown into 7 components (from Architecture design to Overal test and debugging). Yes, the budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and seems suitable. The team's credentials seem to be airtight for a project of this scope, there is a 390-hour work total evnisaged with a total duration of 13 weeks. The pan is not only sensible, but the team will ensure transparency of operations during implementation thanks to the inbuilt project tracking component. It's a green light from me. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It's really a pleasure to review proposals that are able to zoom out and provide outsiders - not only a way of understanding what the team aims to achieve, but also of verifying what they set out to deliver. This team has done a massive job - thinkin up, writing up, reaching out to other teams and distilling their vision to ensure maximum clarity about the details and about the big picture contribution. The proposed open source identity wallet - is not just \u00e4ny wallet\". The team has expounded on its planned functionalities and what the design will support: Customizable / Extendable Identity Wallet Features, Privacy / Security Features, UI / Usability Features. The team has listed with whom they partnered so that the wallet solution can serve their communities, customers, and developers. They have included a risk assessment and in terms of Clarity and Auditability - KPIs have been provided. Furthermore, Jira users can be created for follow up and audit ability. Additionally, bi-weekly reports will be published with project progress, major milestones and risk assessment. Intermediate progress will be reported as Sprint Burndown, a KPI metric that shows the progress of each development sprint. Additionally, the development will be managed in a public Github repository where periodic commits will be pushed and that allow the community to audit and validate the work. What can I say.

To make this proposal more relevant to the Cardano community, please consider the following suggestions: I suggest changing the idea description because it is essentially not clear and adds too much value to readers who are attempting to grasp its scope and purpose. It is not meant to be taken the wrong way, but clarifying the applicable use cases or giving more practical examples of what is the main value of an open-source credential wallet to different industries or to the overall Cardano community will be beneficial. Some ideas get into the execution phase if are more concentrated on adding value and value streams. Overall the idea is very good and the level of details shared was extremely positive and that's why the score will be high. Well done!\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal will be implemented successfully based on the experience and plans of the proposing team, though I suggest more information be included within the proposal regarding the relevant experience of the proposer in managing initiatives of this nature, as well as a more detailed plan and budget for the different tasks and activities described.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal has value, and its implementation would have great benefits. If an open-source identity wallet that operates with Atala and verifiable credentials improves over time, more thought might need to be given to verifying ROI. I understand we need to work with these changes but also identify the life cycle of each technology implementation and the returns. In 5 years there may be a better deal in terms of power and performance than the current one. For the community to be educated about the use of funds in a sustainable, reasonable, and practical manner, both the advantages and disadvantages may need to be stated more clearly.

Additionally, the team has done a lot of groundwork to partner with other proposers in the challenge, who would clearly benefit from (and in fact require) this wallet in order for their projects to success.  The team has also had significant success with having past proposals funded, and experience developing large-scale collaborations with IOG.
