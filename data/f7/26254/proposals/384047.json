However, the proposer seems new to the Cardano community (just a guess) and therefore unaware of many of the existing initiatives in this area.  Because IOG is not rolling out Atala PRISM as a top-down initiative, but rather empowering individuals to create solutions that best fit their own communities and needs, many proposers are creating and developing Atala PRISM solutions that are tailor-made to the communities that they inhabit and know best. While a broad survey of the Cardano community could be extremely valuable, I am not sure it is essential to the process of developing Atala PRISM solutions.  Furthermore, it is not clear to me who would benefit from the findings. Would developers who had not previously planned to build DID applications come up with new ideas based on the results of this survey?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer does not give a lot of detail about her background or experience. From googling I was able to take a guess at her LinkedIn profile. I would be interested to see more details about what it would mean to conduct an ethnographic study. I would also be curious as to how the proposer plans to reach respondents, and motivate them to respond. It would be interesting to see metrics around how many responses she is targeting or anticipating, and why that number would be meaningful and representative. There is also no distribution plan for providing the results of the survey to anyone who might be impacted by them. Currently IOG does a survey at the end of every Fund, and the AIM team was recently funded to run an incentivized survey of Fund6 voters. It would be helpful if the proposal referenced these already existing surveys in order to have a plan to perhaps coordinate surveying activity to maximize the likelihood of participation by targeted respondents. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the budget amount is not large, there are no metrics supporting the request for 1,000 per month. I can't envision what the milestone would be at the end of the first month so that it would be clear that work had been performed.

What is the meaning of words \"more communal\"? - will be a question that an outsider will ask first. It is about \"to describe something that is shared by a group of people\"? If so, it's an adjective that has no comparison grades as something public can't be more than what it is already. If it has other meaning it will be wise to make the statement more clear than what it is now. \"Implementation suggestions\" has no meaning as well for an outsider who reads the proposal.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how an ethnographic study can be performed for the Cardano Network as this is more like a generic name for an ecosystem.
