This speaks well of the proposer, his vision and his ability to conceptualize the problem and the solution. Speaking about the problem statement - bang! This proposal goes directly for interoperability with Hyperledger Indy in order to open doors for the expansion of the Cardano network in terms of interacting with the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem. This challenge does ask proposers to think how can Atala Prism exchange credentials with Hyperledger Indy (due to its significance in terms of use for credentials) - and the proposer delivers a  solution that will provide an open-source code to give Atala Prism two layers of interoperability with that framework. In terms of impact - great. In terms of implementation vision for the proposal - even better. The plan is detailed, the solution seems spot on, the key metrics of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. I've been a CA and vCA since the start of Catalyst and have never skipped contributing my 5 cents in a funding round. This ranks among the best written proposals and its deliverables (the  DIDComm v1 communication layer and the Mapping mechanism to convert Verifiable Credentials both ways) are well defined and will allow the exchange of credentials between Atala Prism with Hyperledger Indy, while remaining flexible for implementers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, this proposer leaves nothing to the imagination. I mean, skills are there and documented, experience is there and documented, the budget is reasonable and broken down into components, a timeline for delivering the proposed solutions is given. The proposer goes well into detail to clarify the technical aspects of his proposal and does it in a stellar fashion. I especially comment the proposer for going into a risk assessment and making it public. The proposer states that during the developing of this proposal, two concerns/risks (1. can enough time be allocated to the development? and 2. can cope with the technological challenge?) were identified and came up with mitigation plans in case it is needed. Aside from those two risks, I see a third risk - that the proposal might slip under the radar and not be funded. OK, lightness aside - its a five-star proposal. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditing and clarity. The \"Transparency Twins\". Will they enjoy this proposal? The proposer suggests to use Agile management based on Jira Cloud tools for implementation, plus he states that additionally, a bi-weekly report will be published with project progress, major milestones and risk assessment. Risk for the community - addressed. The team proposes that \"as a commitment to the transparency of the allocated funds, we expect payments based on above deliverables without the need of advance payments.\" Furthermore, intermediate progress will be reported as Sprint Burndown, a KPI metric that shows the progres of each development sprint. Additionally, the development will be managed in a public github repository where periodic commits will be pushed and that allow the community to audit and validate the work. OK, I rest my case. The Transparency Twins love it. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 11, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal identify the problem of Atala Prism adoption and interoperability. They will ad value to the Cardano ecosystem by making Atala Prism interoperable with Hyperledger Indy which in turn will connect Atala and Cardano to an already huge existing working product.

The budget is broken down into 2 parts of the project that needs to be finished with reasonable time dedicated to each part.

Tracking the progress of this project will be easy as he states he will provide weekly reports. There is no user based KPIs so it will be hard to track the performance of this project. You can ad Github downloads as a KPI, that way people can see if your product  is being used.
