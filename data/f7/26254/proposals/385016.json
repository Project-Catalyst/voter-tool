It is true that examinations are a big part of the education system and a major obstacle for students and administrators alike, but this is likely too limited. Having a DID solution on Cardano would surely be utilized across the entire educational career of the student, where their exams, courses, degrees, credentials are saved and stored. Unfortunately, in this case the focus on examinations may be too narrow. I would encourage the proposer to continue to develop this idea and resubmit in future funding rounds once there is a more tangible solution to the problem identified. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposal is more of an idea in its current state and lacks a tangible plan on how it will solve the problem identified. While a \"solution\" using Atala Prism is likely ideal for the situation described, it is not fleshed out enough to give voters confidence that it is in fact feasible. In fact, I am not entirely sure what is actually being proposed as the solution of how it would be implemented. There is also no justification for the budget or a breakdown of how it would be spent. I appreciate that the proposer does provide some of their background but this is not bolstered by any information other than their word. I'd suggest that when/if the proposer resubmits to include more information on their credentials, including linkedin, websites, or previous examples of work. Another way to increase the score next time, could be to consider outlining what work has been done to explore the willingness of governments or academic institutions to move in this direction.  ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No, the information provided is not sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. As mentioned above, the proposal is more of an idea at this point and is not developed enough. There are no real metrics of KPIs that can be measured against and there is no product or tool being presented that the community can view. When resubmitting, additional information on what, when, and how you plan to build a solution will be necessary. The proposer may benefit from finding a team who is working on a similar solution (student credentials) and try partnering. It is clear the idea is here but there is just some more thinking required before the community can be confident to fund it.
