While I do not contest the idea that a framework may be useful, it is unclear how the framework will be used to accelerate adoption. The proposal also suffers slightly from assuming that the framework, once designed, will be adopted and used by a wide variety of jurisdictions and countries. For example, the proposers mention that a trust framework is the initial step to achieve this adoption, however within this same challenge there are many other proposers who are ready to built and implement a solution with existing systems, in many jurisdictions across the globe. What is missing here in comparison, is a description of what sets this project apart and why it will have success where others have failed. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is somewhat likely that the proposal could be implemented successfully, however there is not enough information to give full confidence that it can be achieved. While I appreciate the problem description, it is the solution that is less developed. For example, the proposer mentions the \"Trust Over IP Governance Metamodel Specification\" but gives no explanation for voters on what this is, or why it is the preferred method/tool. It very well may be the right option but that needs to be articulated better, how did you come to the determination? What other options did you look at and exclude? I value the experience of the proposer as a member of the Cardano community but it is unclear whether they have the right set of technical skills for a governance framework, if you need to hire more people have you identified them? How will you identify them? \r\nI am giving this 3/5 not because i don't trust what the proposer says but because I am left to take their word for it rather than reaching that conclusion myself. Providing these details would certainly increase the score. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, I do not believe there is enough information here to audit the progress and success of the proposal. While the proposer mentions that once drafting is complete, they will be put for review, but there is no indication of who these reviewers will be, or whether there is an opportunity for community participation or oversight. The roadmap and timeline seems reasonable but there are no real indicators provided for what success will be measured as. Having the documents completed and reviews done are a good start but how many will you do, what will the final product look like, how many reviews will you conduct and by how many people for each document? Will the framework then be made open source for the community to take and run with? I would encourage the proposer to continue with their efforts and consider exploring some of the points made herein, including identifying how the community can be more involved to help with its success.

They will ad vlaue to the Cardano ecosystem by accelerating  DID adoption which in turns accelerates Dapp innovation. No metrics were provided to compare with the Challenge. A few metrics can be assumed and they might well be in line with the Challenge, but it is necessary for the proposer to state these metrics as they will show what the proposer deems important and may influence voter decisions.

He goes into great detail explaining the current problems we face and explains in 2 sentences each of the documents he proposes to write. So it is still not very clear how these documents will help current institutions adopt DIDs at a quicker rate. If you spent the same amount of energy explaining your 2 documents as the section you wrote on the current problems you would have significantly improved this proposal. He hasn't considered any risks. Not being aware or prepared of any risks will slow you down when they surface.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The roadmap he provides has the completion of draft documents and reviewing the documents as milestones. No KPIs has been provided. Providing more measurable milestones and KPIs will enable the community to better track the performance and progress of your project.
