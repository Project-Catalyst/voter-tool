Gaming is a major industry that is constantly evolving. The introduction of collectable NFTs and p2e games will only increase as the blockchain technology continues to grow. By integrating Atala Prism into the gaming engine Revelar, players and developers alike can maximize on the data-protected individual sovereignty offered by Cardano. If successful, this proposal could also accelerate adoption of Atala Prism to other game engines and make Cardano the go-to DID solution in gaming. By essentially developing a \"how-to\" guide other community members would also be able to adapt and apply the knowledge learned to their own games, creating an iterative development loop. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully. The revelar game engine is already up and running providing an excellent use case to integrate Atala Prism into gaming, and increasing the feasibility of the project being successful. The team does a good job at outlining the exact steps that will be required and presents clear milestones on the path to achieve their objectives. I am would have liked to see more of the technical details on what is required to integrate Atala Prism into the game engine, but as the budget is so low it seems implied that it will not be too significant. Voters may feel more confident in the feasibility given that the dev team is not requesting funding to learn Atala Prism but instead in only requesting funds for what it will deliver back to the community. This implies an extra level of commitment as it represents the longest component of the timeline. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The proposers do a good job at highlighting the problem and proposing a solution to accelerate the adoption of DIDs. They also provide clear milestones and KPIs which the community will be able to track and measure. The three deliverables included (Community article on how to incorporate Atala into a game; Community article on testing results found; and Published use case for asset verification in a game) are all tangible documents which will be subject to community scrutiny, meaning that their completion can be indicated by a yes/no. In addition, by including a \"public delivery date\" voters can also have confidence that they will be able to easily know if the project and its components were completed by the deadline.

The authenticity of NFTs can even now be anonymously checked by verifying the policy ID, therefore game developers don't necessarily need DID for this service. As for the issue of tying assets to players and not wallets, on the cnft.io marketplace, for example, a single user can add several wallets on his account and list any NFTs from any of the linked wallets and remain anonymous, as there is no personal data exchanged between the user and the marketplace at any moment.\r\nThe only point to which I agree that DID would indeed be a valuable asset is for the age verification process, as that would add an extra layer of anonymity to the players.

If training devs to learn Atala costs $0, then who are those devs and why will they be volunteering their time?\r\nThe scope of the proposal is not too grand and neither is the budget, and while I am not completely convinced about all the use-cases they have detailed, I can see it being an experiment worth taking.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While the budget is splitted into 2 main parts, I would have liked to know more what exactly each part means and what they have estimated for.
