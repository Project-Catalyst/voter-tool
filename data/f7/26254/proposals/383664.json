Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies a valid problem regarding DID: the lack of usecases, applications and skills of Developers regarding it. It approaches this problem with a project based dev training which will both help implementing DID into projects and training developers with ist implementation. This will for sure benefit the Cardano ecosystem by both accelerating DID and providing new opportunities for ist developers. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing, and the related business seems serious and credible, it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they and their project partners will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan.

The plan intends to use some material already established from Haskell courses and Plutus program. Partner projects is a great way to include practical examples in teaching PRISM/DID and all proposed partner projects are proposed by Wada as well this would be nicely synergistic. Potential issues with this approach are that not all/not enough of the partner projects get funded or there are delays in the other projects leading to delays in building course materials from them. All partner projects are also fund 7. \r\nTime scales to complete the work but there is a possible risk as mentioned that the schedule is shifted if partner projects are delayed. \r\nBudget seems appropriate for this activity.\r\nMy technical knowledge is a little lacking but proposed curriculum appears sensible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Good KPIs chosen to easily asses reach and success of program. 3-12 month roadmap beyond course material completion is also simple to assess.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_902", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Design and implement project based dev training curriculum to allow developers to learn through creating real solutions that integrate DID.", "experience": "Wada Cameroon Hub: 3 Haskell/Closure/Java Senior Software Engineers and Architects (12+ years teaching experience) passionate about DID/SSI*"}
