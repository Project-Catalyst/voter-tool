This measure is very similar to the ratings of a product on a website. There is empirical evidence that that high-rated items with a large rating can be considered as good. Therefore this protocol may support trust infrastructure in small-value transactions. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposer claims 8 plus years of experience in .net development and Kotlin.

Hence, I can bring in some competencies in evaluating the budgets in this category on their credibility and accountability. In addition to this, I'm a catalyst member and CA for quite some while and have generally a good understanding of the different topics of the ecosystem and of how the proposal process works and what good proposals need. The proposal identifies an important problem in the challenge that needs to be adressed. The solution seems beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem, is explained comprehensibly and matches the Key Metrics of the challenge well. Scalability should be provided considering the makeup of the system planned.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is relatively new to Catalyst and does not provide verifiable credentials, thus it is difficult to assess whther he is up to the challenge.

He's able to explain the technical details regarding this, especially on how PRISM/SSI terminology is being used for both counter parties (the seller and the buyer).
