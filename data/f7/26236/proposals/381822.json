This is very useful for voters and also CAs/vCAs. Also, the proposal itself is very well written and explained, although a bit long - a problem that is diminished by the already cited summary. Even though, it has a lot of information about side projects, related to the bigger Social Design Academy and Voltaire Assistant projects, that give a good context, although are a bit out of the scope here and makes it more difficult to understand exatly what is included in the proposal. Although, after careful reading it's possible to understand it. This proposal aims at researching and building a Proof of Concept for a new funding model for Catalyst based on a Circular Data Model, refined by multiple workshops with Catalyst experienced members and aiming at building the best design and UI/UX possible. This mechanism could be used for rapid funding as well, as mentioned in the proposal, but since this is based on research we can not know exactly how this will look like, and also how the decision making will take place, i.e., how the community would choose which projects to receive funding. Two thirds of the budget aims at the mentioned research, while 1/6 for documentation and 1/6 for building the PoC, although it seems that the PoC was added later and not included in the final proposal budget. This proposal is very well aligned with the Challenge, and also research is important to make things in a very good way, instead of just start without even eny refelction, and if this is implemented sucessfully, the benefit for the Catalyst and Cardano communities will be huge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind the project is very well known in the community and they are responsible for many sessions and workshops throughout all 2021. They've been actively contributing to improve the ecosystem. The design review team is also very skilled and experience with Catalyst. I believe that the research part of this proposal is very likely going to be delivered successfully. There is a list of progress to be tracked, but it doesn't match completely the list of deliberables outlined in 'Deliverables' section, which makes it a little bot more difficult to understand when each of the deliverables is going to be actually delivered, and if there is an order for them to be delievered, or not. The budget is presented as a lump sum, and it doesn't explain in details why $30k is needed for the research, for example, so it's difficult to assess if the budget is appropriate or not. Also, the total budget does not include the budget to build the Proof of Concept, I believe due to a human error, and this might make it more difficult to achieve all the goals of the proposal. Although, even if overall the proposal lacks some of the mentioned topics, looking at the other proposals by the team and what they have been doing in the community, I believe this has a high chance of success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents a good set of information about what is going to be developed overall. On the other hand, it lacks a bit of connection between the different information presented there, which makes it difficult to find the information about when the deliverables of this proposal are going to be delivered, exactly. For example, the 'Deliverables' list is not well connected to 'Track Progress' list. There is also a SDA roadmap that adds relevant information, but doesn't add much to the auditability of this proposal specifically. The success definition if vaguely provided, with a wide time frame of 3 months, which makes it more difficult to audit as well, and some KPIs to measure the success of these proposal could have been included. Since this is an research proposal, in its core, it's really difficult to come up with some of these metrics, but it's also necessary to make it auditable so the community can track the progress of what is being done.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 11, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This project seems to be a vision to rebuild the way project catalyst is run through new governance software for both the current catalyst funding rounds and also a rapid funding mechanism. However the TL;DR really is that clear on what will be delivered, and the long version is more of a mission statement than a clear project plan with deliverables. I feel the proposers have good intentions and want to research some interesting things, however its not clear what they will deliver and how this meets the challenge goal of increasing the speed of funding. It seems to be more of a project to research how to change governance within Catalyst.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has appears to have good experience and is clearly very motivated in the space. The main aim of the project is to research how to produce the outcome they want. However the project description lacks a succinct plan and description of what will be delivered. It is thus hard to give high ranking to whether this will be successfully delivered. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The deliverables and budget section is a very small part of the proposal, with the majority covered in 1 sentence. It would be nice to see this broken down with timelines so progress can be audited.

It claims improved speed amongst a portfolio of benefits but does not go far enough effectively.  The core goal per the brief: \"Increasing the speed of funding is critically important to allow important projects to move rapidly from volunteers to paid professionals. While volunteerism is strong in our community (and a strength), the ability to pay people for their time will accelerate and dramatically improve the time and energy people will be able to devote to Catalyst.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no doubt a DAO will be implemented as the team is competent and accomplished. there is also no doubt a design community will be organized as well, but will the entire thing successfully implement? to this assessor, it is unclear, as the proposal is so massive and so varied, its unclear that all of it will come to fruition thereby entirely delivering fully on the promised value.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Success is described, KPIs, milestones, action plans, roadmap are aligned, \r\nspecific, measurable, publically auditable, and time\r\n fenced, therefore the information is sufficient to audit success and progress towards it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_701", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A Fund Builder with Social Appstore deploying side-treasuries to onboard new teams through fast, linear and asynchronous funding tracks.", "experience": "10yr+ Sr. UX/UI Designer / ML System Engineer.
