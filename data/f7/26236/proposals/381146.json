One thing that was not so clear in the proposal is that if the idea is to incorporate the proposed mechanism within Catalyst, i.e. using Catalyst funds as well, for example in a separate challenge, or it would distribute funds from some other sources, such as DAO members. The proposing team adds plans of scalaing up the project, and also already foresees some possible challenges and provide possible solutions. The mechanism to distirbute funds based on the Moments tokens seems to be quite interesting and looks like they put a lot of thought on it, and although its hard to predict the success of this mechanism, some tests will probably be made in order to assess if this will work or not and it should adapt accordingly. The market and acquisition plans seem good but a bit too optimistic at start, but it's better to aim high and get good results. I believe this is one the of the best proposals submitted within the Rapid Funding Mechanism challenge in this Fund.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team provided their background, as well as LinkedIn profiles to verify what has been stated in the proposal. As they are the manager and tech lead of the project, it's very likely that the team will be well prepared to lead this project to be successful. Also, the skills presented and required for the team are well stated and it seems to be enough to develop the platform. The roadmap is very detailed and provides clarity on what will be developed with month, and it seems realistic to what it being proposed. The budget seems appropriate, although the audit part of it might cost more than what was stated ($10k), since this service is still scarce in the ecosystem and it's quite expensive. Also it looks like there is no budget allocated for the tech lead, only the product management. The proposing team presents a very good and detailed analysis of the proposal risks and challenges, and suggests possible mitigations in a good manner and most of them make sense, although some are difficult to assess beforehand. Based on all this information, I believe that this proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team presents a very detailed roadmap with milestones and steps every month up to the final delivery, which makes it quite easy to audit this proposal and for them to provide the required reports to IOG after funding. The success metrics are algo very well explained and can help to measure the impact of the proposal, as well as the KPIs, which are very easily trackable and very relevant to the proposal scope, and also aligned with the challenge goals. The fact that the project is going to be open source only adds another layer of trust to it. The auditability of this proposal is very high.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 12, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This is a proposal to set up a DAO for funding small (<$10k) proposals with a quick turn around. It seems to rely on people wishing to put money into the DAO to provide the funding. Actual funding is decided on a 1 person 1 vote basis, where every living person on the planet can apply for a vote token. What is not clear is the benefit to the funders? What do they get for the funds they provide? It seems they get DAO tokens, but why do these have value? Is it just a feel good factor that you gave Ada to a project you liked? Without a clear case for why bidders would give Ada to projects, its is not clear how this project would scale.\r\nMore importantly for this campaign, how are the funded proposal held accountable and how is their impact measured. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have the technical skills to build the smart contracts and have clear roadmap for developing these. Building the technical backend is only part of the process. It would be good to see a marketing plan on how the project will attracts voters, projects, and most importantly bidders who would be providing the funding for the projects. It would be good to see a clear outline of the value proposition to bidders as for this to scale they need to continually provide funds. It is not clear to me this has been done.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a clear roadmap against which technical delivery can be measured. It also has a good set of metrics with goals attached to them for measuring success in terms of projects submitted and funded and the time taken to fund them.

It is very hard to see the bridge between dream and reality.\n\nSounds like everything is very much thought through by the proposer, to the last detail, but therein lies the issue: a DAO is supposed to be governed by its members, to evolve via collaborative exploration and discovery. It's hard to see people getting behind such readily chewed idea that they were not part of developing.\n\nSomething like this is needed. I just don't think this particular idea is the solution. I therefore disagree this is fully aligned with the challenge or required to make the Cardano community better.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Combined ask of all the DAO-NET proposals is a whopping $544,200 USD - potentially the highest in the history of any Catalyst fund. While some of the proposals appear to be \"nice to have\" add-ons, this one is one of the core proposals without which the others won't work as expected. Likewise, if one of the other core DAO-NET proposals doesn't get funded, this one might be useless. In the proposal itself, the \"Sybil Defense DAO\" is mentioned as pre-requisite (and there are potentially others). The sheer scale of these proposals is so massive that I have hard time believing a team of two people can pull it off, no matter how efficient and smart the project manager was. It says in the proposal that \"Product Manager and Lead Developer are required to participate in every proposal\". Whether this single $80,000 USD proposal is feasible, it's hard to say. Neither agree nor disagree.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although there is a lot of detail in the proposal and everything is very much set up to be an exemplary proposal, according to CA guidelines, it is still a bit vague how the goals will be reached. Sure, the proposal promises open source software and lists measures but there are no goals set nor a process outlined how to reach them. For example, the proposal talks about using Fund6 voters as early adopters but doesn't say how they are contacted and what are they supposed to do. How are the 1,000 members and 20 proposals reached? Most likely the proposer has answers to all these questions and he will keep the community in the know after being successfully funded. Right now it's just so centred on one person (or two people) that it's hard to say whether this is auditable or not. I neither agree nor disagree.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 11, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is spot on for the Rapid Funding challenge. The idea is to have a separate DAO which will facilitate small proposals, up to 10k in under 7 days. It will run in parallel to bigger Catalyst. The value added to Cardano will be a faster turnaround, self-sustaining DAO.\nMetrics and deliverables are clear, precise and concrete.\nVery well written proposal overall and in line with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is written with all the details covered as per Catalyst best practice: experienced members with verifiable links, clear budget for personnel, timetable, deliverables, success, technical details on the implementation and even risk mitigation. I am fully convinced that the team can deliver as presented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has a clear roadmap, deliverables, quantifiable and measurable metrics. It will be easy to make a follow up on the promised deliverables. For example, after 12 months we need to have 40k in ADA funded, 50k members etc.\nThe proposal also perfectly addresses the Challenge with a well written and concrete proposal. Being a CA/vCA since Fund2, we do need a good separate model for micro projects and this proposal has great potential.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_160", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 2, "ng": 20, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge. Our goal here is simple: to work on new ways to promote the distribution of the Catalyst treasure that are faster and more efficient (as well as auditable). The idea presented here is the creation of a DAO, aimed at discussing this issue and proposing solutions. The team provides the project's git hup, where we can see in more detail what they want to do (however, I went to the link and couldn't find out that much; maybe the intention is to fill it in as time goes on). I found it interesting how the proponents express their intention to involve more PEOPLE in this process. I, for example, am participating in Catalyst and already have 3 funds, but for me the distribution of the treasure is still a distant and somewhat confusing subject. If the members of the community itself have more control over it, I believe that this destruction will increase in quality. It is also positive that they leave it open for anyone to participate in the DAO, just prove your identity (it would be very interesting to integrate this platform with the Atala Prism DIDs, in the future). The functioning of the DAO, as I understand it, is based on: do participants mint tokens, through smart contracts, can the funding acquired in the round be used to fund future proposals? That's what I understood, I may have been a little lost. But anyway, it's an idea that fits like a glove with what we're looking for in the challenge, so I'll give it full marks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script of this proposal is very rich in details, they do what I consider to be ideal: they divide the phases by month and list a series of activities that are developed within that period of time. With this, we can perfectly understand what the development of the process would be, understand what small steps need to be taken in order to obtain the final results. The creation of a DAO to try to launch alternatives to the financing of Catalyst is an ambitious and complex idea, but with the action plan provided - very specific - it becomes something possible and palpable to happen. About the team, we have a total of 4 people here, 2 of which are already known and 2 still need to be hired. About acquaintances: their description is quite adequate, despite being short, it is assertive. That is, we have the basic information to understand who we are dealing with, and we can deepen this knowledge through the attached linkedin profiles. It would take 2 plutus developers, I would like to understand how they would be selected. I believe that the Plutus developers are key people for the realization of several proposals, from what I noticed evaluating. Is there a way to bring these professionals together in order to distribute the work and select who would be best for each type of project? Regarding the budget breakdown, the amount requested is quite high, but it is in line with the market. It's about the salary of professionals, and also something about the smart contract. I would like to better understand what \"Smart Contract Audits\" would be. However, in general, this topic of the proposal is also perfectly contemplated, in my opinion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Again, bidders deliver everything. We have a lot of information here that makes the proposal auditable. Starting with the topic \"Challenges/Risks\". Here we have some challenges that can be faced during the practical realization of the project. I tend to evaluate proponents who include risks as people who possibly have experience and a very broad view of what they are dealing with. Anticipating problems and anticipating possible solutions is essential, and this is done here. Through this topic, we can monitor whether such things have happened and whether they have been properly resolved. The proponents also include several topics about risks: they talk in depth about this part of the proposal. Through the detailed roadmap, it is possible to audit the project development process. By the definition of success, we have direct information about what to expect as the final product of this proposal (see that this is the basics of auditability and should be included in each and every proposal, but these authors go further). It would be important, as I say in most of the proposals, for this team to establish direct contact with the rest of the Cardano community, in order to update us on the progress of things and also the final results. One idea is to gather data, after a long time of activities in DAO (1 year, maybe), and bring it to the community.
