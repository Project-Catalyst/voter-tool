Starting with the fact that it is something very broad. The bidder wants to create a discord server to discuss and with that solve several Catalyst problems, cited on a website we couldn't open (an error message appears). At no time does this specifically refer to faster, more efficient and more transparent ways of distributing the Catalyst treasure and remunerating professionals involved in the various activities of the ecosystem, as the challenge seeks. It seems to me that the proponent wants to solve many things at once, but without a focus and a detailed action plan it is not possible to be sure that any of these things will actually be solved. It's like promising a lot, but not presenting an argument on how to deliver. Apart from the fact that there is already a space in the funding funds to report problems; That wouldn't be a new thing, I think. Therefore, no, the proposal does not address the objectives of the challenge and does not seem conducive to being funded.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proponent claims to be quite active in the community. However, what would \"Cardano Evangelista\" be? The fact that he is the CA and administrator of a discord server (which one?) unfortunately does not make him prepared to solve problems, as such problems would be of different natures and it seems to me that we have an author who understands very well about the bases of Cardano, but that does not necessarily show technical preparation to solve different situations. I think it would be more appropriate if he set up a team, with professionals from different areas of knowledge, that is, developers, designers, advertisers, etc., in this way, probably, the range of options could meet the needs of the problems addressed. It would also be important for us to know what his funded proposal was, he makes his profile available on ideascale, but it is not possible through the page to infer what his successful proposal was. Regarding a script, unfortunately there is also no information here. We don't have the establishment of phases to be accomplished, we don't know which steps the proponent would take towards success, we don't know which activities would be done, in which order and why. There is no way to understand the process. The funding was also not justified. Why 9k? Would it be the bidder's salary? But relative to how many hours of work? How long would this proposal be developed? It is not pleasant for me to say this, but this topic of the proposal is quite helpless: we do not understand why the author would be prepared to execute the proposal; there is no script; there is no justification for the requested money.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "ALERT: this bidder copied and pasted, in the \"Key Metrics to measure\" part of the proposal, what is in the challenge description. That said, there's nothing to review here. He didn't think of his proposal in a unique way, he didn't elaborate ways to audit it, he just used the ready-made models present in ideascale. There is no way to audit this proposal. The creation of the discord channel would be the main activity here, the ideal would be for the proponent to gather the main debates and information said on his channel and take this content to the rest of the Cardano community, or even some community member to participate in the channel to perform live tracking.
