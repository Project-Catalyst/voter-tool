As we've seen, Catalyst Circle v1 struggled to get some initiatives done because it was depending on the volunteerism of some of its members and also member from the community. This proposal will allocate enough funding to solve some of the problems sensed by the Catalyst Circle, although its budget will not be enough to Fund bigger problems, such as the creation of a reputation model to Catalyst, but its better to start small and evolve. The impact of this proposal as a seed for funding future governance initiatives can be huge if its delivered successfully, as it can scale up very easily if the community sees value on it. Maybe even the budget of $7k per 'group' is enough to pay for more than one project execution, depending on the size of the projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team behind the project are Catalyst Circle member and Admin team. Both teams are highly engaged and capable of delivering this project, as they are leading the governance initiative and keeping track of what's being done, respectively, and they are the best match to lead this. Even though there is no roadmap in the proposal, by its nature it is not necessary and the steps for the rapid funding support the Catalyst Circle are clearly detailed and appropriate to reach the proposal's objectives. The risk of not finding good projects to solve the raised issues, or to not use all the budget, is well discussed and it is proposed to save the funds aside for future Circle initiatives, which seems quite appropriate. Also, the proposal adds some budget for unexpected costs, which is important when trying something for the first time, as this initiative will probably take more time than what was planned. The proposing team also leaves space to adjust the roadmap and plan based on Catalyst evolution, which is crutial since most things in Catalyst are constantly changing. Finally, the admin team members responsible for auditing proposals is already working on some other auditing and open source initiatives in the community, which makes me believe that the money will be spent in a fair and transparent way.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear plan on how to execute the proposal, even though a road map is not presented in an usual manner, it is possible to understand how this proposal is going to be implemented and since everything is going to be registered in an open source environment (CC GitBook), it's completely possible for the community to track what's being done and to follow up with the progress. The success KPIs of the proposal are also not explicit, but they are mentioned in the text, which would be the number of projects funded with this treasury, which is currently 1 per group, but more might be achieved.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_31", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 14, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This is a great proposal to give each group in the catalyst circle $7000 in funds to chose one problem and then build a team to solve it. These groups are already out there looking at the pressing problems in their areas and it makes sense to delegate a small amount of funds to them to solve problems. The only question I have is, is the amount too small? But we can always build on that next round.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst Circle team is highly experience and connected within the community.

The problem is time.  And time is in function of the necessary (yes, necessary) hurdles to conclude: a) the proposal submitted for Rapid Funding corresponds to a real need in the community b) the proposal can effectively address that need.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal has experienced people in charge and the Catalyst Circle is a trusted body in Cardano's governance structure.  Its ideas evaluation technique (described in the proposal) is a process curated by many iterations in the Cardano Governance environment.  Potentially that technique can be a great contribution to a bigger problem:  we need an effcient methodology for discovering and processing ideas, in less time and with fewer obstacles. And of course, with less risk, because  It's not a secret that discovering truly effective ideas is a business with a low probability of success (and that fact is a reality beyond the control of humans, include the Catalyst Circle).   However, it is an unavoidable job for any organization seeking to evolve.\r\n\r\nBasically, I think the proposal says: \"let's give the guys their funding. They know what they are doing.\"  Meanwhile, how to detect, evaluate and fund ideas with real impact potential, with a minimum amount of obstacles but with the maximum possible risk reduction, yet screams for a solution.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps the solution to the Rapid funding problem lies beyond the Catalyst Circle itself. Perhaps we need deeper integration of the Catalyst Circle's expertise and experience into the overall operation of proposal funding across the Catalyst Project. And perhaps endowing the Catalyst Circle with its own funds may mean alienating a body that can change for the better the way proposals are evaluated and funded across the hole Catalyst Project.  \r\n\r\nI believe that the Catalyst Circle is precisely one of the places where an efficient methodology for processing ideas can emerge.  \r\n\r\nSo, perhaps the funds are needed not to find a Rapid Funding Mechanism, they are needed for the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself, which in its transition could teach to the hole ecosystem a better way to evaluate and select proposals. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "-  In terms of funding, of course, they will be safe with them. But it seems to me that the implementation of the proposal corresponds to the evolution of the Catalyst Circle itself and not precisely to the search for a Rapid  Funding Mechanism.  However, the Catalyst Circle is a governance tool in our quest for governance independence.  Therefore, the exercise of providing funding to the Circle does not deviate from the needs of the Cardano ecosystem.  We need the Catalyst Circle to evolve as a decision-making body.\r\n\r\n- As with the many other proposals submitted at F7, provide information about the proponents and their work. Likewise, external links to that information.
