Even though this might be the case, since some platforms are being developed but it seems like no one is fully completed yet, this goal is not completely aligned with the challenge goals. This challenge's goal is to create alternative and faster mechanism for Catalyst itself, to accelerate how funds are distributed. To closest that exists in this proposal related to that is the example of 'GoFundMe' campaigns, in which funds are immediately available to the campaign creator, but even though this wouldn't be using Catalyst funds. Nevertheless, such a project would have a good impact in the Cardano ecosystem, and this solution, if properly developed, could scale up with ease. The proposers should have included some KPIs about the impact of the challenge in order to enable its evaluation. If the proposal doesn't get funded in this round, I would suggest to look for another challenge with better challenge alignment with the proposal goals, and also to add a section in the proposal explaining this aligment to make it clearer not only to the assessors, but also to the team itself how well aligned the proposal is. Also, some other projects in the ecosystem are trying to build a similar platform, in Fund 7 many proposals have similar ideas, so it might be possible to find some collaboration.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The background of the team is just briefly mentioned under the 'Relevant experience' section. I've worked with one of the proposers and I know what he is capable of, but more information about the team itself is missing. Some references such as examples of past work, LinkedIn pages and other kinds of information to make it easier to understand their background. Also, it states that the budget is going to be used to hire addtional people to run the project, but it should explain what kind of people they are looking for, and explain how many people are going to work on the project in total. This is also related to the proposal's budget, which seems to be quite short to what is being proposed here. It mentions that further money will be raised by small feeds collected from tipping and percentage of funds, but to rely on this to build the platform sounds a bit risky. The proposal should include a detailed roadmap of what is being developed. It currently only states that the project would be complete within 30 days of funding, but without explaining the scope and what needs to be done - taking into account that they mentioned that the platform is already partially built - it is quite difficult to trust that this will be delivered within the mentioned timeframe. It also mentions that it will hire some people to work on it, and to do that and develop everything within 30 days doesn't sound very feasible. For such a platform, a website or app will be necessary, but this is not discussed in the proposal and it's not included in the budget or development plan as well. In order to improve it's feasibility for a future Fund, if not funded this round, the proposer should add the items mentioned here, and/or alternatively look for advise on writing a proposal, because the idea is good, it just needs better writing to improve its chance of being funded.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, this proposal lacks information regarding its auditability.
