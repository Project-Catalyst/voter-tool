It is a truly ambitious project. However, the challenge briefing clearly states that this challenge is about bringing about \"...more and better solutions to manage your DAO with Cardano than with any other blockchain.\" What is KONMA? It is \"...a Decentralized Autonomous Organization driven by Blockchain Technology with features like transparency, security, and decentralization.\" Hence, on a first pass, it is not clear how the proposal effectively addresses the challenge as it describes and justifies the creation of a DAO as opposed to being a DAO-creation infrastructure proposal. This puts the proposal at an initial 1-star rating. \r\n\r\nHowever, the proposers do write under the goal section that success is \"...A fully functioning DAO to help govern Konma and its Dapps\". They also hint that they are aware that the challenge is about making Cardano the best choice for DAO creation by writing \"Once the DAO is designed and developed with the help of the community, it will further help Konma bring in more DAOs to the Cardano ecosystem and govern various dApps under Konma and other collaborations.\" However, it remains unclear how why the creation of the Konma DAO is going to achieve this other than by being a good DAO that was built on Cardano and hence inspires other to just use Cardano too. \r\n\r\nNow, if we take a generous interpretation and assume the source code is open, then this project could become something that is turned into DAO infrastructure that would help organisations around the world launch. Giving the proposers the benefit of the doubt and assuming that this is what they indeed intend to do, then the problems that KONMA solves could be easily be leveraged for DAO-making infrastructure. \r\n\r\nFeedback. I suggest the proposal team think carefully about the challenge description and what it asks for. This challenge is about DAO infrastructure and not about funding for the creation of DAOs on Cardano. Given the problem statements in this proposal, it seems like the proposers are quite concerned with governance and how that is ineffective. Hence, I suggest a starting point could be to develop a DAO launcher platform that specialises in decision making. That is, you develop a number of voting protocols that DAO creators could pick between (direct democracy, representative, some mix, etc) as they launch their DAO. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is some indication that this team has relevant experience in web3 development as well as development on other blockchains. Some further independent digging helped me find some LinkedIn profiles where the team could be assessed. The start-up has existed for a few years and the websites are quite professional. They are clearly well-versed in the blockchain space and one had gone through some EMURGO blockchain course and gained a certificate. +1 stars\r\n\r\nHowever, there is not much indication that they are aware of the challenges with working on Cardano (Haskell and Plutus) nor do they seem to indicate that they are aware of the Plutus Pioneers or Prism Pioneers programmes which could give them the skills needed to succeed in this (strong recommendation for next round). If this was indicated then another star would be added. \r\n\r\nThe fact that they intend to deploy this as open-source is an indication that this could be the basis for DAO infrastructure. Hence, the proposal is given another star. +1 star\r\n\r\nFeedback. To make a credible case for your ability to execute this proposal, it is vital that the assessors and the community are provided with easily accessible information that helps us verify the skills of the team. For you, this means providing LinkedIn profile links and Github repository material.. Another piece of feedback is to aim for a lower budget amount. The more money you ask for the higher the bar is set in terms of providing the community with evidence. Projects asking for more than $30-50k should have some minimal viable product or a very strong proven track record. Hence, asking for a smaller amount to write a whitepaper and establish partnerships is advisable. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers clearly lay out weekly goals for the project and have a very elaborate budget that is broken down into hourly wage components and estimates of costs. This puts them at 5 stars. However, I'd like to note that, going forward, there is a lot of room for improvement on the transparency side. The gaps described below means the proposal lost one star. \r\n\r\nFeedback. Some of the costs are not broken down into components. For example, the marketing costs at $10.000 is significant and not justified properly. It is also worth noting that the hourly wages for development are set at US levels which is not clearly justified given that the team seems to be based in India (meaning that they budget 120 hours for DAO development, a mere 3 weeks for a full-time developer - this is not really realistic to be enough given the many features that they seek to have). It may be the case that the proposers are asking Emurgo to develop these features but that is not clear in the proposal. Further explanation of what is meant by \"compensation for early boostrap\" would also be desirable.

All of this would start with the successful implementation of this DAO. So it has to be recognised that the potential impact of this proposal is big.

The proposers aim to evolve it to a \"Web3\" entity, and the purpose of this proposal is to build support for governance via a \"fully functioning DAO\" on Cardano.  There is a note regarding intellectual property that Konma DAO will remain a product of Konma, with \"rights reserved\", trademark, etc.  However, the proposal also says something to the effect that MIT open source license will be used, which presumably means that others could benefit from it as well, although perhaps only after modification and customization for their own purposes.  This makes me feel that this proposal perhaps does not fit the Challenge goal perfectly of delivering *tools* for managing DAOs.  Nonetheless, it may offer some value.  There is also some suggestion that Konma can bring other DAOs into the Cardano ecosystem, though I find the discussion of this too vague to be compelling.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has some experience with Web3 hackathons, creating smart contracts, but no apparent background with Haskell or Plutus, and they plan to outsource the work in this regard; they hope to work with either EMURGO or MLabs.  There is not much material to convince voters that they proposers have experience in other important areas, for example DAOs, governance, etc.  The roadmap provided lacks much detail to assess.  The first priority is apparently to acquire Haskell/Plutus developers, and then design what they should build.  Strangely, the last two weeks (23 & 24) are simply stated as \"ICO\", which has not been mentioned elsewhere in the proposal.  The bulk of the proposal is heavy on jargon and light on details, which makes it difficult to assess what the project would even like to achieve, let alone how feasible it is that it will be achieved.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Again, the roadmap is fairly vague and lacks detail, making it difficult to see how the project can be accountable.  A few KPIs are listed, but without any quantities (the reader/voter has no idea what would constitute \"high\" values of the proposed KPIs).

Only entities with the name \u201cKonma\u201d will remain Konma's. But the code, usability and so on will remain accessible to the community \n*Our aim here is so that no one uses the name Konma, without our consent and knowledge * \nWe have plans for various DAO\u2019s (NFT DAO, charity Dao, Trust Fund DAO etc). These will also consist of \u201ctools\u201d to manage such DAOs. \nWith respect to \u201cbringing other DAO\u201d we are highly collaborative with other NGO entities . for example Trees X Konma. Planting trees and afforesting in India. This entity will be made a DAO, an NFT DAO in specific, as such any other collaboration will also be made a DAO \n\nFeasibility\nResponse:\nHaskell devs are quite scarce , hence our collaboration with Mlabs and Emurgo. The confirmation with Mlabs and Emurgo arrived after the proposal submissions and we did not have the chance to make changes. Our guidance arrives from Mlabs and Emurgo as well as other DAOs we have researched.  Please get in touch with us for new updates, as we have updates on a daily basis. If nothing works with Mlabs and Emurgo (worst case scenario) our mitigation strategy is to employ devs as such and commence work . Any token would need to go through an ICO phase, either stealth launch or fair launch . week 23 & 24 will consist of Quality assurance , final auditing and the ICO phase.\n\nAuditability\nResponse:\nThe discussion forum for the DAO will be in Konmahood, as such a safe space for proposals and voters to come in consensus for further development . this will have a certain number of people present our KPI will be associate to the tribe running the discussions, hence as we grow we expect more in number and at this moment it is hard to pinpoint . the quantitative analysis is directly proportionate to the number of members present in the tribe"}, {"q0": "This is a DAO for their platform, Konma, which is a decentralized marketplace ranging from food to life-style products.

For example, the feature of being able to vote for the next DEX swap token, vote on community made proposal for Konma, etc. This is a rather important aspect since creating a DAO is complex, hence narrowing it down to identifiable items (of goal and achievement) will help the development to be more focused on the objective.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics and KPIs is well defined, the roadmap is laid out in week interval, and they also have a website to check on.
