I think this fits the Challenge goal of developing tools for managing DAOs perfectly.  I am giving the highest rating for impact because I believe that successful development of this project can greatly enhance the Cardano community, both by improving the Catalyst process, resulting in better and more effective decision-making, as well as by establishing tools that will be valuable for more projects on Cardano.  The latter benefit fits the Challenge goal of providing reasons for DAO creators to gravitate to Cardano instead of other platforms.  As someone who's been concerned for some years about the abysmal state of discourse and decision making, and interested in technological approaches to improving them, I believe that the benefits of successful development and adoption of tools that enhance discourse and decision making could extend well beyond benefitting the Cardano ecosystem, but could benefit society in general.  Of course, this wonderful outcome would help to drive awareness and adoption of Cardano too.  The proposal is to improve UI/UX based on learnings gained from already-completed experiments with the previous version.  This includes building mobile apps, which would significantly enhance uptake.  I am wondering if the proposers are familiar with loomio.org, which has a rather similar backstory and ethos, and significant but not total overlap in terms of approach.  I'd be really interested to hear the proposers' thoughts on the comparison between the two.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is to improve on a well-established project with an already-existing version, and comes from proposers with a strong track record demonstrating the ability of the proposers to work together and get stuff done.  There is no clear indication in the proposal that anyone in the team has experience with Cardano smart contracts, Plutus, etc.  We might consider that this is not a requirement in the immediate future, as this is work is slated in the roadmap for September, 2022.  That said, I do think that a plan for eventual integration with Cardano smart contracts may affect UI/UX decisions, so I would suggest that this is at least considered early on, bringing in someone with the necessary expertise in case the team does not have it.  The lack of explicit discussion of this issue is the (only) reason for not giving the highest rating for feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a road map for the coming year, a breakdown of costs, and some key metrics.  The road map is only at a high level, with a few words per quarter.  The bullet for Q1 2022 is bolded and emphasized, but it is not clear what this indicates.  I might interpret this to indicate that this bullet is the entire scope for the proposed funding, which seems roughly consistent with the cost breakdowns (except that these include mobile apps while the bullet point mentions only \"web app\").  With that interpretation, it seems that subsequent phases, including Gamification, Delegation and Smart Contract Integration would be out of scope for this proposal, and presumably would be covered by future proposals.  This would also mitigate my concern above that there is no indication of experience or expertise around Cardano smart contracts.  However, it would also raise the question of whether Catalyst should be funding work on a project that does not have a Cardano-specific connection, even though this is intended in future.  The key metrics appear reasonable to me in general, but less clearly useful for accountability of this particular proposal.  One reason is that timeframes associated with each key metric are imprecise (e.g., \"after MVP launch\", which is not specifically mentioned in the roadmap or elsewhere, making it difficult to assess when that might be.  Other metrics are similarly associated with vague timeframes relative to future Catalyst Funds (which phase/date?).  That said, they are reasonably specific and measurable, and reasonable interpretable to reasonable timeframes.  I'd be interested to know more about how the metrics (exposure and onboarding) were chosen.  It's particularly curious that the proposer aspire to add only 2% of voters onboarded during Fund 10.  I would have thought they would hope for \"gaining momentum\", with a larger increase.  Despite all of these concerns about how the proposal is positioned for accountability, I am giving an \"Agree\" rating based on the proposers being well known in the ecosystem, and the fact there are concrete artifacts that can be reported and monitored, even though the proposal does not spell this out explicitly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Proposal addresses the problem of decentralized decision making being hard on current platforms.

With my own experience in trying to organize debates and processes to reach consensus, I can say the proposal clearly identifies a very real governance hurdle which is a viable problem for this challenge to be solved.

If we do believe that a smart contract will get enough votes to democratically encourage discussion in drafting a document and that this will be additive to the Cardano platform then this is a solution that could work.
