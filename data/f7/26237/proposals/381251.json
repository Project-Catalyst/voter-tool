Although the end-product may attract more users to Cardano, it is unclear to me how it contributes to solve the challenge's question (i.e. How can we make Cardano the go-to choice for DAOs to manage themselves?). I would also hope to see how the proposer quantify the impact of this project: what pain-point a mutual aid DAO will resolve? How crucial is that pain-point? How does it add value to the Cardano community?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal highlights an experienced team backed by community and economic leaders, but there is no further information such as profile pages or links to assist the community to gauge if their experience is truly relevant to the project. In addition, I'd hope the team can explain the operating model more clearly. For example, having some flow chart to demonstrate the dynamics of participants in MADAO will be very helpful. At this moment, it is not clear to me why I would purchase MADAO: if I want to help someone, I'd just send ADA directly to them; if I want to donate to a common pool, (1) I would not hope to get it back; (2) if MADAO matches my donation, where does the money to match come from? If MADAO mints to match without having an economic activity to substance the value, the value of MADAO will decrease, hence the matched value will be lower as well. In short, it's a complicated structure and I'd recommend the team to construct a whitepaper first to clarify both technical aspects and the operating model. The proposal offers a realistic timetable and budget to carry out the project. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer lays out a road map with milestones of product features to achieve. I had difficulty visualizing how success will look like, though. My recommdation is to clarify the problem statement, articulate the solution to solve such problem, and identify some metrics to measure the progress and success of the project.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_684", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 5, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal for a MADAO clearly establishes how it will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem however it does not address the challenge of providing tooling and creating a more desirable ecosystem to attract DAOs to cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Funds requested are in line with the scope of the work required. The team does not have the requisite technical skills but is attempting to onboard someone who does and this has been built into the budget. It would be good to see risk management incorporated into the project and potential pitfalls addressed.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The only definition of success given is consistent growth. There needs to be clearly defined metrics with which to determine if the proposal is on track and the allocated funds are being utilised effectively.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_745", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal suggests a mutual aid DAO that govern a UBI based system along with a service / product marketplace that DAO members use to exchange on. Wealth inequality and poor system economics are a large problem in current society so finding solutions that help to prevent and reduce these issues could be of high impact to both the Cardano ecosystem and the wider world.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly hard to gage whether this proposal can be executed well to have significant impact. If there are members of the DAO who are more in need and receive a larger reward from interactions within the marketplace then they become the net winners of that ecosystem. On the other side of the fence will be members who contribute more than they receive and in that scenario it is hard to prove that this is a sustainable approach.\r\n\r\nWithout further sources of proof, example implementations or thorough analysis on the problem the proposal team are trying to address it is very difficult to state that this proposal will have high impact. In its current state it is more of an experiment than a solution - which as a proposal is fine and to be encouraged. However in general more information is needed to gage whether this system makes sense for all stakeholders under different scenarios and whether that impact could be sustainable and meaningful to the community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are four team members listed in the proposal though no sources to help verify their backgrounds such as a LinkedIn profile. No developer is listed in the proposal which is needed for the execution of the proposal. The team provide a high level video to explain the MADAO which offers some minor insights. A breakdown of budget is provided between the main areas of execution with hourly rates suggested for the different roles. It is hard to gage whether this proposal is feasible without more supporting evidence on the background of the team, any previous work that has been executed or a developer who can showcase they have the skill set needed to execute the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadmap is provided for execution of the proposal with a very basic outline of the what success looks like deliverables for 3 to 12 months - 'We aim for consistent growth. As our project progresses, we'll update the KPI metrics we devised with new goals.'\r\n\r\nThe clarity of the proposal is acceptable but have been a higher quality. A big reason for this is the natural complexity of mixing topics together such as UBI, tokenomics and marketplace dynamics. Trying to understand whether this proposal makes sense as it stands is difficult. As an advisor I greatly appreciate the altruistic nature of this proposal and would like to see this type of project succeed.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to see more KPIs specific to the tokenomics of this proposal. How can you gage whether this ecosystem is working or not? At what thresholds would the DAO need to make changes to certain parameters? Are there values from other ecosystems or projects that would be good targets to measure against? Visualisations on graphs of this could be effective to show how one variable change impacts others and what that means to the sustainability of the model being suggested.
