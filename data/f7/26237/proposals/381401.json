The general DAO-NET infrastructure is an ambitious deployment platform that not only considers the legal framework but also the wider need for funding of DAOs as well as various aspects that will allow DAOs to integrate with the real world with all its legal compliance requirements. This specific requirement of identity proving mechanisms is particularly important and is something that will definitely lead to DAOs opting to use Cardano over other blockchains. \r\n\r\nFeedback: perhaps include a description of what Sybil attack is. Another thing that could elevate the proposal is more emphasis on why exactly it is important to be able to be robust against Sybil attacks. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers include links to their LinkedIn profiles and list relevant experience adding up to 29 years of IT consultancy/software development. Of course they lack team members with the necessary background but they are clearly identifying what roles they seek to fill and exactly what the skills they are looking for in those team members. This indicates that they have done proper background research and a clear awareness of the limitations of their knowledge, but more importantly, and ability to identify what is needed to solve this. The timelines is transparent and broken down into monthly goals. It is hard to assess to what extent this is realistic (third party audit in May 2022, and testnet in June 2022) but with a very solid team it is possible. There are always delays in complex processes so five stars are given because the plan and the many details convey that they are serious about developing this solution - and I am convinced that they indeed will do it, even if June 2022 is an ambitious target. It also contains Risk Mitigation analysis. \r\n\r\nFeedback: given the many proposals that are a part of DAO-NET, and that each one of them is budgeted to independently be able to be executed I would suggest that you also include a short description or some form of contingency plan that explains how you will be able to off-load some of the work associated with coordinating all of these projects (assuming you are able to recruit capable developers who do the actual grunt work).

Lastly, KPI measures are listed in terms of measurable metrics, for example that 6 DAOs use it by month 6 and that there are at least 1000 DAO members using it.

I really like the idea of this project being open source, because the ecosystem really needs this right now. Your proposal is in line with the challenge settings considering it's tooling for daos. The authors managed to convinse me in the value they will be bringing to the cardano ecosystem. I know Dwayne Collard is an active member of the community and is a voice of reason in the telegram channels.  The key metrics are really well thought through and are pointing in the right direction to measure adoption. Currently I don't see anythig missing in this proposal.   As a developer I was a bit concerned about finding the right people, but then I saw they started looking for people at the end of november and will have separate teams for their different proposals and each proposal is a standalone project. So no worries there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are plenty of links left to verify the team members credability and I really like the structured way of this proposal, saying what the needed skillset of the future team members and showing what they already have as well as what they're looking for. I can appreciate the transparency that brings. IMHO this brings credability to the peorject in the eyes of the voters (me included).  The budget is outlined clearly and is broken down well enough to be understandable by everyone reading the proposal. The execution plan seems very reasonable, although it depends on whether or not they will be able to find those mentioned team members. As a developer I believe the timetable is realistic to do the mentioned work. The fact that it's open source adds to the credability of the project and helps it to scale if necessary. I also love how there's a plan for self funding down the line. Not many proposal think in that direction and this is what separates the long lasting project apart from the short term ones in my oppinion. The plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal along with a very detailed list of possible future challenges along with an even longer list of mitigations for those challenges.  There are resources linked in the proposal for anyone that wishes to read on about the more technical part of the project.  Overall I have no doubt that the project is not only feasible but it will last. I will vot for you!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's no shortage of information for the community to follow along with the projects development. There's a linked github repo where all development will happen, so that's more than enough for anyone looking at the proposal to follow along with the growth of the project. The metrics and KPIs are on point, and there's a succinct definition of succes. Roadmap - check, milestones - check and a time horizon to bring all the parts together. The problem and solutions statements make sure to explain in an understandable manner what the proposal is all about.   Overall a great idea, a great proposal that will be auditable by the community.

It would be great if the team could connect the roadmap and budget to the deliverables, at the moment the budget is mainly allocated to pay for labour (Developer @ $4k for 6months) , if the budget (labor) is connected to the roadmap and deliverables the team can track spending over time versus performance. My one concern is the size of the ask, $94,400 \u2013 I would advise the team to break down the budget to run from catalyst fund to catalyst fund (roughly 3month period), the catalyst community in past have supported projects over multiple funds (example MinSwap)", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_358", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 3, "ng": 18, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create a DAO to develop secure, open source Sybil-resistant anonymous authentication solutions for DAO Net and other DAOs.", "experience": "An experienced team of Blockchain developers, Plutus pioneers, SPO operators, Community Advisors and Solutions Analysts."}
