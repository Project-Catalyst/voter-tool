The role model for this proposal is the Klima DAO but the goal is to learn from this case and to improve the approach. This challenge is asking for solution that will help to make Cardano the go-to-blockchain for DAOs. Comparing the challenge setting with the goals of the proposals I don't see a full alignment between challenge and proposal. However, if this proposal will be successful, it will be a positive story for Cardano and may increase or accelerate its adaption. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Behind this proposal is an experienced team, that has proven their skills in several projects. The presented plan is detailed and covers various topics with clear deliverables. However, the underlying mechanism of this DAO could be explained more specific to fully understand the scope of this project. The budget is broken down into details and seems to reasonable. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\r\nThe team doesn't provide metrics and but answers how success look like. To audit the progress and success of this proposal I recommend also to add a documentation source.\r\nThe team hasn't reflected about potential challenges and how to overcome them. Overall, by the given information this proposal is not more an idea, than is a ready-to-go project.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal suggests a climate change DAO on Cardano that will use algorithms to for buying and selling carbon permits. It aims to out perform Kilma DAO and achieve $200 million in credits purchased. The purpose behind this proposal is notable and one of value - the world faces an increasing environmental issue that needs resolving.\r\n\r\nThe proposal team suggest the usage of Cardano ecosystem over Ethereum will provide large benefit due to the saving of gas fees. No mention is given as to what other features are important for their own DAO that can be implemented and how they will be developed. No sources are provided that help to show evidence that the gas fees in the context of Kilma DAOs usage of Ethereum is a large problem and whether that change on Cardano is actually significant. The algorithms mentioned are not defined in any depth - will this be a custom solution or use something pre-existing, what factors will the algorithm consider, does the team have any background implementing this? It is ultimately unclear on what meaningful differences this proposal is suggesting over existing market solutions and whether it will truly have a large impact to the ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal adds a website link with the team information. The team information add a description but no supporting sources such as a LinkedIn profile. Only the main proposer Jeffrey's LinkedIn can be found on the website with the background stating - 'Department of Philosophy, including courses in moral theory, environmental ethics, aesthetics and philosophy of law.'  \r\n\r\nDue to a lack of evidence that the proposal team has any deep experience in the environment, DAOs or smart contracts it is hard to state that this proposal has a high chance of feasibility. More information and sources are required to give any confidence in the proposal team. The proposal budget is broken down and $7,000 is allocated to the algorithms and Plutus code. Due to a lack of explanation on both the algorithms and Plutus code it is hard to agree that this task has been well scoped and budgeted for considering the complexity of the task to be performed.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "A roadmap has been provided and a definition of success. The definition of success outlines that completing the proposal tasks will be the main factor. Further clarity is needed in the proposal what is needed to be developed and why that is better than existing solutions. The team has stated the IP from the meetings will be open and any educational resources. It does not mention whether the code will also be open source. It would be good to know how the proposal team plan to support the ecosystem with any of the DAO tooling that they state needs to be developed and how others could benefit from that tooling providing it is open sourced.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal has the potential to provide considerable impact not just for the Cardano ecosystem but the world as well. Developing a DAO that focuses on the buying and selling of carbon-based assets on the Cardano blockchain could go a long way to truly justifying Cardano as the only \"ecologically friendly chain\". While the Klima DAO on the Ethereum blockchain was a big success, there is a much greater opportunity to use that same innovative approach on Cardano with likely more significant outcomes, given the broad community focused on progress, and the lack of overhead necessitated by the Ethereum chain. This project is also linked to the SpaceShip Earth DAO proposal and would be the first flagship project on that entity. Given this cross pollination in a very important area, there is likely significant impact for the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the plan and experience presented it is highly likely that this proposal would be implemented successfully. The real gem of this project is that it's not really creating something from the ground up or introducing a brand new idea, but rather is replicating a known structure that has had great success (Klima DAO) but doing it better by using the Cardano blockchain. This implies that they will be able to build on the lessons learned from the Klima DAO project and identify which areas can be improved upon so as to ensure this project is more successful. The links to the team site and knowledge base of the proposers is very welcome and gives extra weight to the likelihood of success. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In general I believe that there are opportunities for the project to be audited appropriately. The proposers do a good job at explaining why a Cardano Climate DAO could outperform the Klima DAO and offer a well structured solution. I appreciate that all of the recordings and templates will be open and available to the community. However, I am giving this a 4/5 because while I do value that there will be a board of directors which will oversee the project development, what is missing is community involvement in that board. Have you considered reaching out to Cardano community experts to participate? Identifying and including better in- and off-ramps for community participation would increase this section to full marks. Exciting project and look forward to the results.

While the idea is noble and I commend it, it does not fit the challenge metrics of building tools and making Cardano the preferred choice for emerging DAOs. To incentivise others to choose Cardano over other blockchains, it\u2019s important to show that Cardano has more tools at their disposal that are easier to use, and is an environment suitable to DAOs that are working towards developing new solutions and ideas. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "While the team has provided links for their previous work and skills, the plan description is not clear and very generalised. Engaging the Cardano Community in this project would be noble and of course pragmatic, but to do it just to, as they have laid it out in the proposal, \u201cengage in this duel\u201d between \u201crival communities\u201d is not fitting to the Cardano community\u2019s values and is not a sincere desire that drives innovation. I would suggest resubmitting to a future fund, with the feedback from the community incorporated.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap is well written and for a long period of time (20 months), but there are no clear KPIs and also very important for such a proposal, there is no mention of possible risk involved during this long interval. While the budget is divided on specific tasks, it is not detailed enough and unclear why some portions of it require a certain amount of money. I recommend re-submission with clearer metrics.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_20", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 6, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "The Klima DAO made history by buying $100 million worth of carbon credits.
