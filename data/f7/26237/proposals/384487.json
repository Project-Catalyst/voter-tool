Perhaps you are referring only to very large companies, which would stand to gain from these new technologies - I fail to see how this would help a small local transportation business. Also, when using acronyms, especially from the blockchain / tech space, try to explain what they mean below, or to reiterate your problem statement later on so that non-technical people too (which will be the majority of voters), can understand what you want to say.\r\nThe solution sounds clear to me as well, but like the problem statement, it suffers from not explaining why these companies need this upgrade and how it would help them. Unfortunately, I did not find this information in the detailed plan either, only a statement expanding on what the DAO would do, in general terms (\"educate and incentivize the adoption of new technologies, promote efficiency and good practices\"). This all sounds great, but the proposal needs to explain how the DAO would do this, or give examples of how success here looks like. With the information above missing, unfortunately I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, as it fails to specify concretely how the DAO will operate and how the proposal aims to set it up.
