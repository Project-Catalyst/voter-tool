As to whether or not this proposal addresses the challenge, this is not very clear simply because of the sheer scope of the proposal. The challenge aims to provide tools that will provide DAOs functionality or attract DAOs to Cardano. This proposal is not to construct tools but is for the complete building of a DAO which is part of a bigger project of creating essentially a decentralized package delivery system. There are however several aspects of this project which would most likely be very useful for other DAOs in the ecosystem. The incorporation of a DID, the creation of a native token pegged to local currency, and the creation of a tokenized CO2 incentive system would all require tools that would be useful to any number of new DAOs. Since this project is partnered with the WADA network I believe the knowledge gained through this project would be shared with other projects in the ecosystem and therefore meets the spirit of the challenge. Given that rationale the real world lessons learned and tools used in this DAO application would surely have a significant impact. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears to have the required skills and are active and visible members of the Cardano community. The amount of funds requested for developers combined with the ambitious nature of the project seems to be low. The plan is very well described and the budget clearly allocated with realistic timeframes. The proposal is short on technical details. Some rudimentary form a whitepaper would have been useful to look at how some key technical difficulties would be overcome. That said the value of this project to the ecosystem is likely to come from the innovation involved from solving the technical difficulties. The proposal team already has one local partnership and has thought through some of the business model risks and incorporated solutions in their model. I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap seems well thought through and hits key points that need to be addressed. The auditability section shows milestones that the team hope to achieve including a more complete roadmap which is good to see. The milestones are realistic. A list of key metrics is included but does not show specific KPI targets which would be good to have to form a more quantitative measure of successful implementation. There is no specific mechanism mentioned where the community can go to measure the progress although the team is active in the community and would have many ways to make progress visible. I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_935", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 10, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This team aims to build a decentralized system for deliveries. From this standpoint this proposal isn't fully aligned with the challenge setting, which is asking to make Cardano the go-to-market blockchain for DAOs. However, the team fairly describes how a successful implementation of this DAO can be used as a role model for other initiatives. Therefore I see this proposal within the challenge. The same is for the impact. The team is able to show a potential positive impact of this proposal on our ecosystem in general.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Behind this proposal is an experienced team, that has proven their skills in several projects. \r\nWADA has participated in various community events and has shown not only his expertise but also his attitude and willingness to improve the ecosystem around Cardano.\r\nThe presented plan is very detailed and covers topics like market research, technical aspects, and clear deliverables. Also there is a strategy about how to enter the market with this idea (many proposals are missing this aspect). The budget is broken down in detail and from my experience and perspective fair priced. The detailed plan and the experienced team convinced me, that there is a high likelihood for a successful implementation. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team provides metrics and has defined how success look like, so we can audit this proposal. To improve auditability of this proposal, I recommend adding a documentation source, where the community is able to track/observe the progress of this proposal.\r\nThe team has reflected about potential challenges and how to overcome them.

DAOs are a powerful tool in this respect. I want to bring in my personal knowledge and experience on various governance models into action by assessing proposals in this challenge. Creating a DAO for something that is currently basically only done by big businesses will not only be beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem, but also will help the delivering people to get their fair share of that essential part of infrastructure. It will connect people and give them a huge perspective, such it can be said to have a big impact. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan. It describes the resources used and every imaginable detail is shown. This is a great example of a good, feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well-defined, detailed metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

However, it needs to be a little more clear on what kind of infrastructure to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposers describe what could be a product of a DAO, yet it isn't clear what a DAO is and what kind of a DAO it is trying to make. Will the tools they make be general-purpose enough to apply to different areas? Or is it meant to be specific to failing areas lacking delivery services infrastructure?
