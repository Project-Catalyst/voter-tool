The impact of the project is high since having access to talent within the specialized world of DAOs is currently not a simple task and yet is essential for growth. Having a simple and effective tool to acquire required talent would be a distinct advantage for Cardano, would promote sustained growth, and is easily scalable. Skilled people interested in the DAO space will ultimately go where they can find work. Therefore I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has all the required skills in order to make this project a reality and provided a lengthy bio and Linkedin profiles to verify. At the time of writing this assessment the Linkedin profile link for one of the team members was down however a quick google search was able to provide all the required background information. The proposal is very clearly broken down into workable segments with what seems like appropriate timeframes for completion of each segment. The budget is also broken down in a way which shows how the money will be spent and appears to be reasonable and realistic to accomplish the stated goals. One concern is that the requested funding only covers the first 3 months of a project with a 12 month timeframe. This project will require ongoing funding as well to maintain beyond 12 months. This is addressed in the risk analysis section by stating that future funding would be acquired by one of the team members. Upon review of Kathleen Olstedt's credentials and experience this seems to be very likely to succeed and this was also included as a goal within the proposal milestones. Overall the plan is detailed, realistic and describes well how it will be executed and therefore I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap with all the included milestones is detailed, well thought out, and seems realistic to achieve. The metrics and KPIs for defining success are present but are not very specific. This is understandable in a sense since this is a new tool in a new space, but some specific KPIs are required to properly access progress. For example one metric is that over 10 DAOs would be attracted by the project to Cardano. How would this be judged? At least one contract filled by the proposed tool per DAO perhaps? Unfortunately this is not quantified nor are most assessment metrics. Additionally there is no stated avenue to check on progress. I'm sure this would not be a difficult thing to implement for this team but clearly defining a place where progress updates could be verified would be helpful. All that said the goals are well established and although not quantified, they were qualified. Most importantly they were not ignored in the proposal. Therefore I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_935", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This team want to build a DAO for DAO-related jobs and tasks.

As someone who is excited to see Cardano grow, and especially for it to become a/the key ecosystem for DAOs in future, I think the proposed project has great potential to help scale up DAO activity in the Cardano ecosystem.  As a bonus, I think the background of one proposer (Governor of H.E.R. DAO) makes it highly likely that this project will also positively impact the Cardano ecosystem in terms of inclusiveness and diversity, which is really needed.\r\n    ", "q0r": 5, "q1": " Both proposers have impressive and valuable experience, background and connections in many relevant spaces.  I was initially concerned, however, that the team appears to lack technical ability to execute on the project.  I was also concerned that Milestone 1.3 is about recruiting for technical talent, while Month 2 includes Milesstone 2.1, which includes identifying the appropriate tech stack, *after* recruiting technical expert/consultant.  Presumably we can infer that this person will not necessarily build the prototype, but rather \"consult\" on design, stack, etc.  I also assume that the Budget item called \"Technical Architecture\" is intended for paying that consultant, though this is not clear from the proposal.  With the benefit of doubt and given that the Budget is only for the first three months and it is clear that further fundraising and recruiting will be required beyond that, I feel more comfortable that the proposers can feasibly execute on the proposed project's first three months.  I also think that the proposers are well connected and therefore well positioned for recruiting when the time comes.

Furthermore, I think the proposers could make the case that the deliverables can be documented for accountability and transparency.  However, the proposal's definition of success and KPIs are more focused on later stages of the project, beyond the currently proposed three months.  Furthermore, those KPIs are stated rather vaguely, with little discussion of how they can be measured or what measured values would be considered \"success\".

Two months at $2,500 / month for an outside technical resource to develop the architecture would seem to me to be a major barrier to success.  Personally, I would rate the likelyhood of success as perhaps a four or a five if it had a higher proposal amount that reflected what would seem to be a more realistic estimate of the technical aspects.  It's entirely possible that the architecture is either more simple than I surmise, or that resources are more readily available to do this work than I have experienced.
