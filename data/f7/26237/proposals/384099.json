The impact of the project however is difficult to ascertain with the information given. The premise is that somehow an NFT-FT fund will allow for better governance but the model for that is not clear. In addition the example used (Krause House) does not appear to have any obvious plans to do anything beyond a DAO that uses social utility tokens. In order to rate this higher I would need to have a better explanation of how using NFTs to limit the number of people involved in the governance of a project would function. Why would you need or want an NFT to accomplish this? How does this improve current models? The economic case for NFT-FT funds described in the proposal seems obvious but the governance case is not and need more of an explanation. For these reasons I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has listed that they have experience however there was no links or references provided to verify this information. The project is broken down into workable intervals. The stated goals themselves in those intervals are short on details. A \"whitepaper\" would be very useful even if if was short to explain how the technical aspect is going to be accomplished. There is a Gitbook page set up and a discord as well, which is very positive, however there is currently no additional technical information available on either of these that shed more light on feasibility of this project beyond what is already in the proposal. The funding request breaks down the cost in hours of programming time. An additional step of breaking down the programming time and cost required for each step in the roadmap would help show that the cost has been carefully thought through. Overall it seems that this proposal has taken some steps to explain how it will get to it's stated goals but is missing some important components. I neither agree nor disagree\r\nthat it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadmap has been included and the timeframes seem realistic. There is no formally stated method to verify progress however due to the nature of the proposal a simple github page should suffice to accomplish this and is well within the stated skillset of the proposers. A stated aim of having the code audited also creates a very effective means of evaluating progress. The identity of the auditor and the expected cost would be useful information to add here. A simple but relevant metric of success is listed and this metric should be relatively easy to verify. Given these factors I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_935", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is a great implementation that mesh the Fungify's NFT liquidity pools with the structure governance and access, because I think this implementation will be core for the Cardano community developers that have experience on Pluts programming and will help great adoptions and allow to growth in the future.\r\nThis proposal is well written and clearly demonstrate  the experience and the team's commitment, guarantees solidity in deliverables, support transparency and accountability for all Cardano community.  This is an important proposal to integrate new conceptual smart-contracts devloping and connect them with the real world business industries.\r\nThe proposal clearly articulates the contest, the problem (new developer ecosystem to write and test smart contracts) and how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for all of the stakeholders.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer team  is well skilled about the whole context of the proposal as fungify web site demonstrate ( https://sicks0sicks.gitbook.io/fungify/ ).\r\nThe scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it's convincing.\r\nThe proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones and a defined time horizon, also in technical realization.

The idea is to greatly enhance the available functionality for NFT holders, allowing improved liquidity, using NFTs as collateral for loans, etc.  While it is not explicitly stated, I assume that the the project will be made available in open source, allowing others to use it to launch their own NFT-FT pools.  If this is the case, I think it clearly fits the challenge goal of developing tools for managing DAOs, as well as creating points of distinction from the \"same old, same old\" in other NFT ecosystems.  Another possible interpretation is that the proposers intend to run a *service* using their development, enabling others to launch their own NFT-FT pools on this service.  This would arguably also meet the challenge's goals (one could consider this service to be a \"tool\" others could use).  I'd give this top rating if it were more clearly stated that the plan is to open source the tools and allow others to use it.  I find the linked Fungify gitbook a little confusing on this.  In particular, the paragraph talking about fees (no fee for adding an NFT, 5% when retrieving, where this fee goes, etc.) seems more consistent with a service under the proposers' control than if the tools are open source, which would allow users to experiment with different policies, fee structures, etc., which seems more consistent with the \"experimentation\" vibe of the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": " The team appears to be strong technically, with Haskell/Plutus/CS backgrounds, with funds set aside in the Budget also for a front-end developer.  Beyond mentioning this, there is no specific detail in the proposal in support of these claims.  I could find linkedIn pages for both proposers, which would have been nice to include.  I am happy to take the linkedIn profiles at face value, and they do indicate educational and work experience backgrounds roughly consistent with the claimed skills.  Also, my understanding is that the Plutus Pioneer Program's official participants received class NFTs.  If a Catalyst proposal isn't the place to flaunt those, what is?! :-) The proposal indicates that the project is well under way, currently doing \"intensive internal testing and final touches\".  I do not see links to github repos or anything like that, but if we again take the claims at face value, they indicate good progress that increases confidence regarding feasibility.  My main concern is that there are many non-technical aspects required for success.  In particular, recruiting and onboarding projects to experiments with the platform is literally the only requirement to achieve \"success after 6 months\" as defined in the proposal.  As a fellow geek (PhD, Computer Science), I certainly understand the focus on the technical aspects, but I also know that it's easy to underprioritize other important aspects of a project by being overly focused on the technical core.  I would suggest slightly growing and diversifying the team, even if it means taking some of the funding originally budgeted for the core developers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers describe success after 6 months as \"5+ projects experimenting with novel governance models enabled by the Fungify V1 protocol\".  I think that's a reasonable measure.  For shorter-term accountability, the proposers note that progress can be tracked towards that.  I think that's a less compelling mechanism for accountability in the shorter term.  First, there is no mention of how this information would be discovered and disseminated.  I can only think that it would be via status updates and periodic progress reports from the team, but this is not specified or offered/promised in the proposal.  Furthermore, even if the project is wildly successful, it will likely take time before progress towards success is reflected in term of the proposed measure (projects experimenting with Fungify).  I would prefer to see more specific mechanisms for reflecting progress in earlier stages.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Fungify's NFT liquidity pools and governance contracts will enable exploration of novel governance models and empower NFT groups on Cardano.", "experience": "We're two first cohort Plutus Pioneers and Haskell developers with degrees in Computer Science"}
