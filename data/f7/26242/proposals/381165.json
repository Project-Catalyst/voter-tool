If there is no community empowerment or sense of belonging; adoption wont follow", "funded": 1, "upvotes": 41329002, "downvotes": 18054775, "votes_result": 23274227, "votes_cast": 129, "f6_no_assessments": 3, "f6_rating": 4.111111111111112, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The problem to be solved here is clarified in the first few lines: in fact, in Latin America, the adoption of decentralized identities is still very low and this problem needs to be addressed. What is proposed here is to do a kind of research, to understand the specifications of the public and drive the adoption of DIDs. I believe it is a very good way to promote the use of this technology, because there is no point in wanting to \"force\" a certain group to start adopting such technology without it adapting to their needs. It is very positive as the author of the proposal defines some acronyms that he adopts in this proposal, in this way there is a kind of leveling between all readers and the CAs and vCAs can understand more fully what is said. It is also a positive point as the author specifies which research methodologies he would use (in total, 3), this allows us to have a more solid view of the type of activities that would be carried out from here, and not just an abstract understanding of the research of public. In summary, I believe so, it is a proposal that would generate a positive and relevant impact if financed, meeting the objectives of the challenge well, benefiting both the inhabitants of Latin America (by creating technologies that are more necessary to their needs) and would increase the adoption of technologies of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author of the proposal has little detail about himself. It would have been better if he had included some information about his background (we know he's from the economics and politics area, but it would be important to understand if he has any work related to Cardano, how he got to know the ecosystem, etc.). However, it is possible to solve these doubts by accessing your linkedin profile. However, in my opinion, the ideal is always to include a short description about the proposer, a brief history and focused on this person's relationship with Cardano + the linkedin profile. It's great that he has several partnerships, the networking is strong, 4 organizations are mentioned that certainly add a lot of value and trust to the general team. However, I also think it would be important to know a little more about the people involved here, individually. Who from d-EdTech would be involved, for example? About a script, the author does not provide a traditional chronological script, but divides the work into 3 parts of approximately 3 months each. We can understand what would be done in each of them, which constitutes a roadmap, in a way, although such activities could have been even more detailed. The budget breakdown is made available according to these parts, and you can understand clearly and directly how the requested money would be owed, what each part would be used for and what percentage of each respective part represents the whole. Finally, I would like to say that in terms of feasibility, we have excellent information, although not perfect, which conveys a lot of confidence in the team, in the process and in the funding requested.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is extremely auditable. I think this is because the author divides the work into parts and lists some activities developed in each of them, giving us the possibility to accurately monitor the process. He also dedicates two topics especially to auditability: what success looks like and key metrics and goals. There is enough material to monitor this project, both the process and the results. But one thing I thought about here: how will we have access to the final results of the research? The author states in the metrics/goals excerpt: \"Share insights with partners and community to integrate and adapt findings to your own needs.\" Through which platform? I think it would be interesting to define this question better. It is super important that the community, especially members from Latin America, can have access to such information to validate it, as well as other developers of Atala Prism technology. Furthermore, this is just a personal question, because the author provides us, as I said, with everything and a little more of what is needed to audit this project very specifically.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 14, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Distributed Identity solutions like Atala are new and the use cases are not clearly understood or appreciated around the world. The project aims to carry out a research project to identify and analyze the requirements for DID from a LATAM perspective. I feel the situation can be extrapolated to any part of the world. Research in any form can produce material that will help in taking better business decisions, therefore this is a viable and a required project. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proper has more than ten years of experience with excellent management education. The idea presented also has a sound rationale, and the proposal will likely be implemented in earnest. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Research projects are inherently difficult to audit and measure the quantum of success. The methodology suggested is viable and the team behind it has experience and qualification. The budget also looks reasonable and justified.

But, in what language these reports will be delivered is not mentioned. The objective is everyone in LATAM can access and understand these reports clearly.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget plan's elements are not described in detail in each post. Is the proposer going to hire team staff? How's the hiring process? Who will be the experiment's target? How many users are needed in those experiments? From how many countries? The proposer doesn't have any blockchain-related background and is not active in the Cardano community. The time frame plan makes sense, but it needs to coordinate several people at once to deliver the project.  And this research can't be one time only, but a continuous project as the DID technology itself will keep developing.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The reporting period is only every three months. But, to give LATAM communities better insights, it should have other channels to show the progress in detail. Not to mention, the proposer should be active in the Cardano communities to better communicate his works. In that case, the proposer can gain respectful insights from other community members to polish the research even better.

The final insights reports available for the community will also be available in Spanish and Portuguese. With respect to the reporting, there is a report update every two months aligned to the key metrics and goals, schedule and budget.\n\nThe research project will be carried by the proposer in its entirety, however I will receive support from one Research Assistant (RA) in Brazil and one in Mexico, along with the feedback and/or suggestions of Atala Prism Pioneers partnerships and mentors.\n\nSince this will be a web-based research carried out in the Crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, we can access most of the countries in Latin America. However, using the Scientific Method; in order to select the countries and segments properly we need to identify the at least the specialized literature in the region and then start with an initial batch for example with the capital cities in the most populated countries or a general approach for raw findings in all 30+ countries. The experiment is intentionally divided in 2 batches to consider the exploratory analysis first and then continue with the larger research should the results prove to be worthy of further study.\n\nFinally, with respect to the sharing and reporting channels, I am recently starting to become more active in Cardano Community and Discord channels. Along with sharing the insights in Cardano Forums and our Partnerships, we will be feeding the Cardano DID Community which is proposed as a joint effort in our Latam Community DID  proposal where we will display current campaigns, insights and an invitation for others to join and use our standardized approach. https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Latam-Community-DID/381158-48088\n\nThank you for your consideration.\nBest,\nDaniel Bonfil"}], "solution": "Understand the needs and values with a statistical base in order to align the solution to the interests and requirements of the community", "experience": "Msc Economics focused on Quantitative Finance, Incentives and Blockchain\nJanuary 2022: PhD in Management focusing in Community Policy"}
