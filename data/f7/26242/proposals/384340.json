Its impact is clearly identifiable and explains not only the local contribution but also close to the European market by export of tomatoes. It is true that the direct link with the Catalyst community is not clearly stipulated, but can be deduced from the many explanations and the contribution of this solution to the Latam ecosystem of catalyst. In addition, the KPIs correspond to the challenge in the sense that it is a question of Add 30 small farmers to the network.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": " \r\nMany detailed explanations whether on the stages of the project, the information of the partners, and those of the participant are really precise, and seem to have been written with care, with the intention of a good overall understanding of this project, of its objectives and its concrete implementation. There are several links providing access to articles providing additional material, as well as references. The budget seems realistic and is also very well explained and detailed.

It would also bring a major positive impact on Cardano, receiving into its ecosystem new members who are different from crypto's usual market(small farmers as opposed to tech nerds.)

It is an impressive proposal but I feel it could be improved by including past achievements. This project is quite grand in scale, with the successful operation of farms on one hand(training, installation, sales, creation of network) and the creation of a dApp on the other hand. Hence, sharing proven experience in delivering such a project would be beneficial for the proposer.\r\n\r\nThe hourly rate for Emurgo developers seem low. Is it possible to get good devs at $10/hour? I am not experienced in hiring devs but I highly doubt it. What about the costs of staff who work in technology education workshops? Where would the funding for that come from? \r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasoning above is the reason for my rating.
