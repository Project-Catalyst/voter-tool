I evaluated the proposal they submitted in F6, to translate content into Swahili, I'm happy to hear that they got the funding. I faithfully believe that this proposal is self-worth and speaks directly to the objective of this challenge, which is to disseminate the contents of the Cardano ecosystem to the natives of Latin America. The authors already have a job of disseminating news and content related to our blockchain, so they are already experienced in creating, translating and articulating both written and audio content. The fact that they have already done a project that aimed to translate the existing content into a different language, the fact that this is already happening and that it is receiving positive feedback is the best proof we could have of how this pair generates work with impact. and fully meets what we are looking for in the challenge. I think that proposal could be summed up by the passage they wrote: \"We're building a network of contributors who share complicated technical ideas to everyday people and deliver relevant news in quick bites.\" From this excerpt, we can infer what the goal is here, while detailing the proposal we understand what would be done: written/audio content, content for beginners and also for people with more experiences and also interactive, that is, the site's readers can leave comments suggesting new articles or just giving feedback on what you've read, which very well follows Cardano's philosophy that working collectively is always better. Therefore, I believe that this proposal will have a high impact and fully fulfills what is requested here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe the authors are well prepared to carry out this project successfully. They give us a short description of who they are, and also attach their linkedin profiles, where we can do a more detailed analysis of their trajectories. And, of course, they already have experiences in similar projects, firstly they already have a website ready with various contents, and also (as I said) they made that proposal of Swahili translations successful. With this, total security is transmitted to them and in their ability to carry out yet another successful project in the field of translations. They provide a roadmap, measured in months, in which we can observe what would happen over time to reach the final goal. The good thing is that the platform here is already ready and it was designed in advance to have its contents translated into several languages, what is missing is, literally, translating. Although they will inform you how much content would be translated in the part where they explain the split of expenses, I would like you to give more details about this part of the translation itself. For example, how many translators would be hired? How would they be selected? Exactly how often would these content be released? We know that there are about 30 articles, that is, 30 translations, in an estimated period of 6 months. So I would like to know how they intend to distribute the release of these translations, and also how they would bridge the gap with native Spanish speakers, because so important when generating the translations is to make them known to the target audience. Regarding the financial division, I believe the information disclosed was sufficiently detailed, we know how much money would go to each part of the project. But, I repeat, it would be essential for the authors to set aside part of that money to invest in some type of advertising, perhaps establishing contact with some group in the Cardano ecosystem that is already well established among Spanish speakers. Because of these details, I believe that some things could be improved, although everything is going very well.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the specific case of this proposal, auditability is simple, in my opinion. The authors establish the milestones of success, by which we can have a broader idea of \u200b\u200bwhat is intended here. However, we are also aware of details such as: how many articles would be translated, in which formats, and the estimated average size for each production, so it is even better to follow the project progress for less. What I suggest to further improve the auditability is that fixed frequencies of the translation release are established, for example, 2 articles translated per week, and also a dissemination plan. Thus, it would be interesting to elect some members of the ecosystem (preferably Spanish speakers) who could meet with the authors periodically and monitor if everything is being done according to agreement, taking this feedback to the general community. In this way, it will be possible to be absolutely sure of the correct progress of the project, establishing solid auditability. In summary, we do have elements that allow the proposal to be monitored, but in my opinion others need to be added for the monitoring to work optimally.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 10, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "https://www.lidonation.com/ is a website that focuses on educational articles about the cardano ecosystem. They have already a site up and running thanks to previous successful funding rounds. The proposer wants to add the Spanish language on the website. Since the website is up and running, the only cost will be content creation which will mostly be translated content. The Spanish speaking audience can benefit from this content to learn the ins and outs of the cardano ecosystem. This will certainly have a good impact on the cardano ecosystem.
