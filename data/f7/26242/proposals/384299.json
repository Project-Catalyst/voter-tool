The problem here would be that the mainland does not have as much blockchain activity and access is difficult for beginners, which is true. However, all the information presented here, in order to solve such problems, is given in a very superficial way. We don't know in detail how Seedstars works; I watched the video, in which the message was conveyed that, basically, Seedstars is composed of distinguished professionals who are eager to make a difference and go further in their areas of expertise. All right, let's understand the profile of the participants; but what do they do, exactly? In the relevant part of the experience, the author of the proposal states that the group helps investors through training and investments. But it is not possible for us to understand in detail what this help is like, and it would be important to understand the impact of the proposal as well. We don't really know what they do, so it's a little difficult to understand what these actions would be like in Latin America, what matters would be dealt with at the meetings, in which country (or countries) it would take place, what the target audience would be (probably they would be businesspeople who do not know Cardano) and so on. It's not even clear how Seedstars is directly related to our blockchain, not much security is passed on this bridge, so our confidence in the project's impact is also shaken. I think it would be necessary to reformulate the proposal, including 1) links where we could learn more about the Seedstars group, its daily life and actions 2) how they know Cardano 3) how this proposal could dialogue more specifically with Latin America. Would they think about the specifics of the public, the needs of the demand?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The description of the team members even has detail, but it is insufficient, in my opinion. We can understand the main roles of each team member and what they would do in this project, but we don't know very important things, such as: what they have done so far in their areas of expertise (a small curriculum) and especially what is their relationship with the blockchain Cardano. The only two people who cite Cardano (indirectly) in their descriptions are Paula and Romulo, but it is not possible to understand very well how they got to know the blockchain, how long ago and what they study and/or work within the ecosystem. I would like this relationship to be further clarified, and on a deeper knowledge of each, this could be resolved if they attached their linkedin profiles (if they have one). About the script, it's quite detailed, although not ideal. It is positive how they determine what activities would be carried out and with what objectives, but such activities could be much more detailed. For example, in month 1: \"reach out to the community and reach out to stakeholders to initiate engagement in the initiative\". How would they reach the community? By the way, what community is this, exactly? From what country, age group, education level? How would this contact be established? Similarly, there is a lack of detail to understand the specifics about the activities of all other months. It is a problem that they define such a long interval between: \"month 3 - month 7: Execution of events\", and they have left such a gap in this part of the project in terms of detailing the most important activity of the proposal, the execution of events . We would need to understand a number of things. I understand that their idea is, after funding, to define where the events would take place and what the issues are, but for us it would be much better if these details were established beforehand and presented. In this way, we would have much more confidence whether the investment would be valid or not. And about the budget: it lacked a lot of detail; for example, in the following part: \"comm, PR & Marketing = $15,000\". What would \"comm\" and \"PR\" be? Why is 15k ordering for these parts? What would the marketing campaign look like? This would be very important for the success or failure of the project, so it would be important to understand it deeply. Likewise, we cannot understand why each amount was chosen for each thing, it would take more explanation and depth to convey the notion that yes, the amount asked would be fair.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is quite valid when they say that after each event there would be an analysis of the activities and their results, and this would be shared with Catalyst (wouldn't it be with the Cardano community, since Catalyst is our funding program and not necessarily us? ). But we do not know who would make these reports, how they would do it, and what would be the contact platform between that person and the Cardano community. In the end, they also promise to carry out a general survey, which would analyze the project's impacts for Cardano, Seedstars and Latin America. More detail would also be needed to understand what would be done here, how this analysis would be constructed, based on what statistics and how it would be presented to the community. It's great that they propose to perform the auditability, because most authors/teams don't have this concern, but the way the information is passed on to us, we can't understand in a solid way how these feedbacks would be done. Therefore, I suggest that they include in more detail how the analyzes would be done, and so that we can be sure that the proposal will be properly auditable. From the information proposed during the script, I do not consider it to be an easily auditable project because, as I said, the script does not have very detailed activities, thus making it difficult to know exactly what we should be monitoring.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The identified problem starts from a false premise as \"the blockchain\" being a niche world, thus the statement of what problem is to be solved remains vague. Since 2009, when Bitcoin was released in the wild :), the use of blockchains has exploded via the creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. Today, is hard to find a real world use case that cannot fit into the blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the solution aims to give people the knowledge they seek about the blockchain through training, workshops and events but is unclear what are the benefits for the Cardano ecosystem, in particular.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team has four members and each of them has a role assigned and there is a brief description of their experience.

The proposal aims to give the necessary info and expertize to onboard SPOs in the Latam region? etc.).\r\n\r\nThe plan doesn't describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal.

The proposer addresses the problem of blockchain being reserved to those who possess the expertise and is quite a dark realm for those who don't dwell much on technology. The proposer appears to rectify this inadequate outreach amongst the crowd. The proposer states to provide a series of workshops and events in order to foster the creation of multiple hubs and eventually drive varied contributions across the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, looking at the bright side, this proposal could be the key to providing a lot of resources to the masses which lacks the required expertise to excel on the blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan howsoever being a great initiative, is deficient in multiple sections. The proposer provides the readers and voters with a detailed monthly agenda, however, the success definition for these milestones seems to be missing. The team however appears to be well versed with the requirements and to have the essential expertise to make this proposal a reality. The possible risks and obstacles involved are not being mentioned and there is no information provided with how the team expects to reach out to the people. Thus, I feel the proposer has overestimated the plan a little, and keeping the time horizon mentioned in the manifesto in mind, I strongly feel the funds requested could be rectified and a portion of it could be requested in the further rounds showing the progress as a shred of evidence. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer writes a separate section on how the auditors could track their progress and monitor the success. The team plans to provide regular reports for the same purpose. However, stating a few foreseeable KPIs that the community could look forward to could have added more weightage to the proposal. Metrics such as estimated number of active users of services, the monthly increase in the percentage of new members enrolled in the courses and events, the number of contributions that are initiated and etc., would have provided the readers with a rough estimate about the outreach and impact this would have on people especially in LatAm. Hence, I feel the missing details on key metrics make it tough for the readers to assume the success and impact rate of the proposal, and similarly, it would make the audit process difficult to compare its outcomes to the challenge's outcomes.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 5, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses perhaps the most relevant issue regarding blockchain community growth, that is reaching non technical people who does not have expertise regarding this subject. Their intent to promote series of trainings, workshops and events in Latin America could certainly help increase awareness in this region. However, based on the information provided on this proposal, and their website, the contents of such events does not include the Cardano ecosystem specifically, it talks about blockchain in general. Surely, increasing awareness about blockchain in Latin America would increase awareness about Cardano, but not directly. Their KPIs do not match the ones indicated in the challenge, because they don't measure Cardano community growth, increase in transactions processed or formation of new SPOs. The KPIs indicated in the proposal only measure the events success. For that, I cannot agree with the impact of this proposal on the Cardano ecosystem in Latin America.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal shows a 4 members team, managers of their respective areas, and their responsabilities. All 4 positions are already delegated, but there is not information provided about their experiences and skills.  I could find links to the LinkedIn of 2 of them on seedstars website, Romulo and Alejandra, but not of Paula and Camila. There is a timeline with tasks and objectives that seem feasible, judging by the seedstar's website informations, content and previous events. They are requesting 15 thousand dollars for Comm, PR & Marketing but do not specify how it will be spent. It is not informed which Software & Tools will be used. Therefore, there is need of more detailed information to justify the request for 10% of the challenge total budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides a timeline with tasks and a time horizon, but the objectives are not quantified, so it is not possible to measure the success of each step. There are KPIs that measure the events and reports success, none of them regarding Cardano, but they do not have a specific goal, so it is not possible to know what success mean in this project. For a better auditability, the proposal needs measurable objetives, specific goals for their KPIs and include KPIs related to the Cardano ecosystem, like Cardano community growth, increase in transactions processed or formation of new SPOs.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_951", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Series of trainings, workshops and events to the actors of the ecosystem on Blockchain, using our Seedspaces to create community.", "experience": "Seedstars is helping entrepreneurs in +90 Markets with capacity-building programs and investments.
