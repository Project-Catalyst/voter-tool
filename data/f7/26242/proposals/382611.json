The current objective would be to help small entrepreneurs/companies to fund their businesses through crowdfunding. The author problematizes the context of the problem well: Latin America is a very extensive and diverse territory, it is difficult to stand out and also start from scratch, there are not many financing opportunities and small businesses need help to be developed well. Therefore, I think the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating a platform that can help companies to create/sell/manage their tokens is very relevant, and this would certainly benefit the Cardano ecosystem, as it would increase the circulation of assets minted in our blockchain. It is positive that the authors explain how they would be able to use their platforms: not only for a single audience, but for start ups and investors in general. They are also concerned with making it very clear how the proposal achieves the challenge's objectives: promoting investment in ADA in Latin American entrepreneurs, benefiting at the same time the continent and Cardano. I believe it is a proposal that meets what was requested very well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The duo of authors seem very well prepared to carry out this project, they provide us with very detailed and varied information about who they are, what they have done professionally so far, their connections with the blockchain Cardano (which are strong, which is a very positive point) and their linkedin profiles, giving us the chance to know even more about their work. With that, we have complete confidence in your preparation to successfully execute this proposal. Through the topics \"general milestones\", we can have a notion of how the development process of this project would take place. However I found this information very superficial, the authors spend a lot of time talking about the need for their initiative and also how Token Allies, the halving and pledge model, etc., would work. But, unfortunately, they don't pay that much attention to the script. The activities are divided into 3 phases, which are the quarter of 2022, but there is no in-depth explanation of each step, on the contrary, we only have a sentence explaining what would be done... But we would need to understand the details, such as, the order of things, who would do what, subtopics I would say. It is not possible to have a good visualization of the process based on the details provided. And about the financial division, I believe there was also a lack of detail. For example, there is a part that the authors say: \"-$7,000 will go towards server costs, legal services and marketing\". How much would go for each thing? It's because? What legal services would be needed? How would marketing strategies take place and why would they cost how much? I believe that there is no lack of detail when it comes to the salaries of those involved because the information is already self-sufficient, but in this second topic, yes.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This part of the proposal was very well covered, the authors were concerned with establishing success metrics and KPIs, thus we have precise information to be analyzed in auditability. I think it would be interesting if the team presented the partial results to the community, such as the launch of the beta version of the platform, and gradually brought more and more of this feedback; we need to understand exactly if the promised financing was fulfilled, if the Latin American businessmen were, in fact, benefited, in other words, if the platform is having a proper functioning. Another way to measure how the proposal was developing would be through direct contact with businessmen and investors: has this initiative had a real impact on their lives? if so, in what way? What could be improved? It would also be interesting for the Cardano community, especially in Latin America, to use the portal and test first hand if everything that was planned was delivered. So, I believe so, it is a highly auditable proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 11, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses directly the challenge.
