The idea here is to create a platform that serves as a bridge between people who can't get a job, as the authors explain, students or initiates, and companies or other specified people in hiring their services. This already exists on some platforms, like Workana, as they explain, but the idea here would be to build a more \"basic\" level platform. This would greatly benefit the local population, because it is a fact that the number of unemployed is large, especially after the pandemic, or even informal employees who are often exploited - poorly paid and so on. Therefore, it would generate opportunity for the target audience. And in return, this could benefit the Cardano ecosystem because the authors would employ some payment solutions involving blockchain, such as smart contracts. It is not clear in the proposal whether there would be the possibility of payments in ADA in the future, I would like this question to be resolved. Overall, I believe it's a high-value proposition that benefits our blockchain and Latin America a lot, meeting the challenge's objectives very well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team members don't set an exact roadmap to follow, so we don't get a full understanding of what needs to be done. It's a fact that we know what their goals are, they spell out very well what they would do: market research, wireframe development, UX testing and so on. What is missing is to relate this to a temporal notion. For example: in month 1, would only the survey be done or something else? How would the schedule work in detail? Who would do what and why? It's different things to know what we're going to do and how. And what's missing here is the how. Establish time divisions, staged tasks, people involved, partial results and so on. About the budget, we are provided with a good detail. We were able to understand why the total amount was asked and how much would go for each part, although some topics could be better explained, such as the marketing campaign and platform patrolling (what would that be?). We are aware of how the requested money would be used, but this understanding should have gone further. For example, when they talk about market research, they ask for $9730, an amount divided equally into 3 months. Which cities would be the target of the survey? Who would do the research? And in relation to the team, I think the details provided were very satisfactory, it is possible to know with certainty who are involved through information such as their names, training areas and linkedin profiles. The observation I would like to make is: it could have been better explained how the relationship between professionals and the Cardano ecosystem takes place. Sure they are enthusiasts, but what do they do in the community, exactly? Do they program in Plutus, participate in Catalyst...? Such information could have been clearer, in order to increase confidence in this team even more.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal is certainly of high value. We can understand the goals very specifically based on the content provided in the KPI topics. They not only establish what would be the objectively expected results for the 3, 6 and 12 month periods, but also provide a great deal of detail about each of these time periods and their respective expectations. This gives us a lot of material to monitor. It would also be possible for any of us to enter the platform and verify that everything is all right, that the services that were promised were being fulfilled and so on. Direct contact could be made between the team and the Cardano community to demonstrate partial results; I advise this to be done at shorter time intervals, because 3/6/12 months are very long intervals. These contacts should be made monthly or at most every two months, I believe. We could also establish direct contact with the platform's users, to understand if their needs were being remedied, if they would have any complaints or if the system would fail. In other words, in general, understanding what could be improved in the user experience and also how the platform impacts their realities - this would be a very practical way to understand whether the funding was worth it or not.

The onboarding of unbanked, every-day citizens and workers is a promising avenue for Cardano to become a household word.  Bringing Cardano to the masses and encouraging adoption by regular people is very much in line with Cardano's goals.  The concept of integrating SPOs into a system connecting labor and those looking to hire through a platform based on Cardano is promising.  Combating inflation as well is a solid goal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposer team have qualifications and experience in relevant fields.  Have shown that they have the capability to build websites/platforms.  Team seems to have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish.  Onboarding potentially millions of new users daunting task with only three team members listed however, which would explain the \"platform marketing and scouting costs\" as there would definitely need to be additional assistance hired to carry this out.  It appears likely that the platform as described would be built and functional.  Success would largely be related to adoption in this case, but the potential benefits from a successful implementation of this proposal are significant, and as they have planned for marketing/scouting, there will be engagement to encourage adoption of the system.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are several meaningful dates and data points which may be audited.

It aims at offering LatAm informal workers a Cardano-based job finding place. \r\nWhere this idea is smart is that the apparent drawback of the informal nature of jobs in Latin America is used as a lever to grow LatAm Cardano Community: it offers workers to protect from inflation through an access to cryptocurrency in general and ADA/Stable coins in particular. Proposers also claim that this workplace could enhance income levers for regional workers, without showing evidence of this expected effect.\r\nThis proposal has a potential to have a large impact on Cardano LatAm community growth, as it targets potential 140 million informal workers.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The targeted workers are well identified under a sociological approach. It gives confidence in the ability of the platform to reach a quick early adoption. \r\nA roadmap is broadly provided in 3 milestones, leading to an MVP after 1 year. 90% of the funding is allocated to building the main web platform. \r\nThe proposer does not include many details about the challenges to be taken. I consider that proposers have required skills to effectively make business design and market research. Managing software and web development may be a challenge as none of them has experience in software development.
