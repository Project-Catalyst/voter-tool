Brazil is an emerging world power from every perspective, so this is of interest to the community. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that Cardano's quality content is available for its population. The team intends to develop Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) that will be open to the public for free and presented in Portuguese. The fact that it is only intended to be available only in Portuguese could be considered a low point. However, considering that Brazil has more than 200 million people, it makes up for it. To me, it seems pretty clear how this proposal is related to the challenge setting. There is only one flaw that I see: one might assume that if people are exposed to educational content, they will be more inclined to join the community, however, it is not possible to determine whether they will actually become members. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the evaluation of the feasibility, the author of the proposal has done an excellent job. A section that makes this proposal stand out is the brief description of the contents of the different modules that this course will have, not only the work put into putting together the proposal is noticeable. But also, that the team has a person with experience in educational methodologies. As for the rest, all the checkpoints are there, you can verify the skills and experience of the team members, and the budget is very clearly defined and with values that are in line. The only point that is not explicit in the proposal is the evaluation of risks that prevent successful implementation. After doing a quick risk assessment I found one that I consider critical. The team proposes a success metric as \"Dropout rate\", the proposal should have described what are the actions that the team will take to ensure that these ratios are maintained as planned?\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In the auditability section, the team was once again able to provide excellent work. Four major elements have thus been outlined in the roadmap. Each section outlines the deliverables that the team plans to achieve, so that the community can monitor progress against the plan according to the development process. Additionally, I would like to congratulate the team for its ability to present the impact metrics in such a clear and concise way, which, to me, makes them a good fit for the problem they are trying to solve.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 14, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Great feedback! I agree with everything that was presented. The comment about \"dropout rate\" was a great suggestion that unfortunately we didn't think of in time to put in the proposal text, and we should definitely create ways to prevent people from dropping out.\n\nI strongly agree about the potential size of the audience in Brazil and I think it is a great audience to attract for Cardano, but there are also other Portuguese speaking countries that may consume the course content.\n\nAnd about people being inclined to join Cardano after being exposed to the content, I think it's more about them understanding blockchain and this whole universe to be able to make decisions on their own, so that they can create projects with it, and grow the community as a whole. It would be amazing if everyone chose Cardano, but more important than that is for people to have enough information and education so that they can choose the network that best suits their needs and also their political, personal, ethical and integrity decisions. It's about them being able to choose their network regardless of whether the network is famous, or can generate quick profits, or any of that spurious stuff."}, {"q0": "The problem at hand is addressed in a detailed and effective manner. In summary, it is said how Brazil is an economic power that could add a lot to the Cardano ecosystem, if it received an adequate direction. This would need to be done through various initiatives, and in this proposal we have a great idea to solve this problem. The proposal fits perfectly with the objectives of the challenge, because it seeks a free course, in Portuguese, that explains the faces of the Cardano universe (including technological and social ones, as the proponents report). This makes perfect sense and meets the challenge, as it will provide quality material, in the native language of the residents of Brazil (the largest Latin American country), giving them the opportunity to learn about Cardano and work with it. In this way, both the continent and the ecosystem would undoubtedly benefit. New opportunities would be given to our Brazilians, new people trained to work on the blockchain number, as well as an increase in transactions and, probably, our projects. That's why I believe it's a great proposal and will very likely produce great results, if financed. The knowledge of the course offered in Brazil is free of charge is another positive point, it is that it is often a fact and I live in the Brazilian custom), because a certain elitization of Brazilian facts. Making this activity accessible to everyone is also allowing people from different social classes and purchasing powers to have this opportunity to improve their lives through employment opportunities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my opinion, this project is in good hands; will be carried out by the team of startup EveryBlock Studio, a team that claims to have been in activities since 2019, promoting projects related to Cardano. They sound to me like very experienced and qualified people to create a course and teach classes. They build confidence in their work since they provide us with examples of some of their previous work, as well as links to other proposals on f7. It is extremely positive that the team has presented its members in an individual and very detailed manner. This allows us to have complete confidence in their abilities, and to know more deeply who is who, what they do and so on. In addition to the long details, linkedin profiles are provided, where we can get to know them even more deeply. About the script: it is possible to understand very well what would be done and how. The team has a lot of details about what the course would be (and wouldn't be), what the target audience would be, what modules would make up the course (including their order and specific details about each of them). All that I said is about WHAT will be done, essential for understanding the proposal. About COMO, a lot of information is also provided, the script is divided into months, and each month has a list of necessary activities. With this it is possible to understand 100% of the process that will be developed here. Finally, regarding funding, the team also clarifies how the requested money would be used. It is divided into several parts that make up the whole, from marketing, video editing and paid hours of the professionals involved. That's why I'm giving this topic the highest rating.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is highly auditable, the team provides us with specific KPIs that serve to track the results (is what was promised being achieved?). In addition, there are other ways to monitor the development of this project. As they explain exactly what would be in each module, it is possible to verify that the modules are being built and passed in the way it was planned. It is also possible to check if the activities that were promised to be done each month are happening, and how they are being performed. Therefore, I believe the team provides us with enough information to very accurately audit the proposal. It is enough for the community to establish this bridge and make constant contact with the team.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 15, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Nowadays, there are plenty of blockchain content but really not much in portuguese whereas Brazil has a great potential to be explored, as it is explained in the proposal. Therefore, blockchain courses focusing on Cardano in portuguese are indeed necessary and should have a great impact. Imporant to notice that there are other proposals in this fund aiming to ellaborate courses in portuguese but I saw none in the MOOC format, which is becoming more and more common, as the course is always available and the student can do it self paced. I also see a great alignment with the metrics of the challenge and awareness regarding blockchain and Cardano might increase the number of latin americans joining Cardano at the same it could expanded to other parts of the world (with translations). Another thing that will amplify this impact is that the course will be free so it can reach low income students (with Internet access). The proposal is also very well written with complete information and already has all the content that will be taught in the course, which makes it much more easy to assess its impact.\n\n I also liked the target audience was already clearly established. The only point that could be improved here is the bullet that says \"Potential Cardano\" - It could be better explain who are these potential users (STEM students, people who work in a given sector, etc). Defining a bit better this audience would make it easier to communicate with them. One suggestions here would be to include low income/poor students, as this is a major reality in Brazil, and blockchain/technology as a whole have a great potential to improve their lives. It would be aligned with UN SDG 1,4 and 10, at least. To reach this specific audience, some specific communication (and support) would be needed though.\n\nStill in communication, it could be also better explored here how the course will be advertised to attract new people. The MOOC platforms have plenty of courses and for it to get some spotlight, a proper communication with key audience is essential. It could include, for instance, marketing campaigns in social medias.\n\nMy last two suggestions of improvements is regarding self sustainability of the course and interaction with students. To the first, I'd include in the proposal how the course would be self sustainable/funded in the future (as it is supposed to be free). It could be imporant to mention if the intent is to include ads or be crowd funded, for instance. \nIn regard to the latter, I understand the MOOC model, but it would be imporant to include also in the scope of the project the creation of a channel of contact with the students to answer the questions or having debates among them. It could be as simple as a telegram channel, a twitter or instagram account. I'm not sure if the MOOC platforms have features that allow this but if so, it is really important to explore them!\n\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In general, the project seems really feasible. The team is part of a start up that already works with similar projects and developed products for Cardano. The people on these teams have in the proposal their experience very well described with Linkedin links to verify the information. There are 2 people already commited and their experience is solid in blockchain/programming/technology and diverse and seems enough to run a project like this.\nIn the startup website is also possible to check more on the company itself and the people who work there.\n\nThere's also a very sensible and time-framed plan described here  with the tasks that will be worked on in each period. Important to notice here that 4 months to fully develop and publish the course is really good. The budget is brokendown fairly and the total amount is not a lot. The only thing that I'd do here to improve it a little bit would be to distribuite the values in the timeline as well.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs are well defined and sensible and with time-framed target, which is great. I'd only add here some KPI to measure the quality of the course (I really appreciated the drop out rate being measured). It could be done with survey with students, \"exams\" before and after the course, feedbacks, etc. I understand that the number of enrollees can also be an undirect way to measure quality - I'd only add a more direct way to make sure this is being achieved. Other possible KPIs (but harder to measure) could be the number of (former) students who join catalyst and submit proposals, have their proposals approved, develop apps, etc. This would help to verify the impact in the ecosystem.\nThere are also some milestones that could be extracted from the timeline, I'd just highlight the most important one for the proposer (which for me seems to be the last one in each period of time).\n\nLast, as to risk management, I'd include here challenged on meeting the proposed timeline, delivering a course with a high quality, not reaching its target audience, project costing more thant it was estimated and not being self sustasinable in the future. It would be imporant to see some mitigation strategy for these itens but I see  it can be better ellaborated later in the project.\n\nIn general, project seems really feasilble and theres a specific section for definition of success which summarizes its audtiability very well.\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 13, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "On-boarding new users is always a difficult, but a self-paced educational course made by Brazilians for Brazilians can make the process much easier and enable the team to reach a much larger audience.
