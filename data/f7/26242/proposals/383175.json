The team exemplifies some of its achievements so far and argues that it needs funding to continue carrying out activities and developing new projects. They provide a little history of what has happened so far and explain what would be done in each part of the ecosystem (twitter, telegram, instagram and etc). I can't really define my opinion, I believe the impact will be positive, because once new projects are created and existing projects are perpetuated and improved, the Cardano ecosystem will certainly benefit. However, in relation to Latin America, specifically, this relationship is a bit abstract. It is true that it is a DAO from Latin America, but it is not very clear to me which countries are worked here, who are the people involved, how, exactly, they are benefited... I am not saying that this proposal is not in line with the objectives of the challenge, because it is a Latin American group carrying out various activities that would promote Cardano in that place. The problem is precisely that there are many activities, many different things happening on different platforms, so that it is not so possible to deeply understand each one of them. I cannot visualize exactly the gains that would be obtained. Perhaps the impact would be clearer if, in addition to listing the activities carried out on each platform, the proponents explained which groups of people would be involved and how they would benefit individually. In general, there is a lot of information that is confused, in my opinion, and does not generate a full understanding of the impact that would be generated for the continent and for Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "About the team, I think that during the description of the proposal it is not very clear who they are and what activities they develop. However, in the end, they attach linkedin profiles, but the best way to get to know and understand each member was through the website provided (https://www.aldea-dao.org/about-eng.html). There, we have individualized information, photos and a short description of each team member, which, together with linkedin profiles, generate a great and deep understanding of the team, thus ensuring confidence in their work. However, it would be important, in my view, to understand who exactly would do what. As I mentioned in Impact, it is a proposal that encompasses a number of things: varied and diversified activities. What would each of these members do? For example, on the youtube part, they promise the following: \"create simple animated educational videos explaining the main concepts of blockchain and Cardano\". Who would? As in the example cited, they could have informed who would be pending for each of the other tasks. In this way, we would have a full understanding of who would do what, which would generate a more organized perception of the process. And speaking of process, we are not provided with a detailed roadmap. Again, I say: because there are so many activities and so different, it would be important to organize some steps to be carried out. For example, phase 1: focused on youtube and linkedin (hypothetically). Person \"X\" would do activity \"Y\" to get result \"Z\". What we have are the expected results for 3, 6 and 12 months (I'll talk more about this in auditability), but that's not an explanation of the process. That part leaves something to be desired, unfortunately. It is always essential to understand the parts that make up the whole, especially when this whole is so complex, as is the case. And finally, speaking of funding, I believe this part was very good, they share how the money would be used according to the platforms. For example, we know how much it will take to promote \"Twitter, Instagram & Telegram\" activities, and why that amount is required. In the same way, it is understood how the other parcels would be used. In short, I believe that in this topic what was most needed was the presence of a highly detailed script. Otherwise, we have a lot of confidence in the team (although it could be better directed who would do what) and a great understanding of the budget.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think it's a very auditable project. As the proponents themselves state: \"the key metric here is how much DAO grows and community participation in its future iterations.\" We need to monitor how the public is engaged in the various social networks and whether, as a result, new Latin American members are entering and remaining active in the Cardano ecosystem. My suggestion is that the team itself take charge of collecting and analyzing such data; these data must, of course, be disseminated in a simple and direct way to the rest of the Cardano community. Some infographics could be made, some visual presentation that would gather data from a certain period of time (monthly would be great, I believe), and such graphics should be sent to the community, either through participation in a Town Hall or some community members could be selected to promote such monitoring. It would be interesting for the proponents to create a detailed roadmap with the phases to be completed, oriented in time, so that we could analyze the process and not just the results. As it is already a very active and experienced group, I believe that they are capable of gathering the promised information (data from the media), creating new qualitative facets that would increase the quality of this follow-up and establish a bridge between them and the community, in order to disseminate the results.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 14, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal is within the objectives of the challenge.

I believe that creating broadcast content would help us to make our niche bigger and bigger in LatAm. Clearly, if the objectives are achieved, it would generate an impact in the community in general, attracting new participants.\r\nThe project is reasonable, but it is important that we know the productions, perhaps in their next \"Iteration\" they will decide to create a specific site for \"grow aldea\" where we can know the progress of their productions.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project is perfectly auditable, both during and at the end of the projected term.

The Team is already collaborating with other SPO and Developers in Latin America which shows their passion towards building a vibrant community hub for that region. I could see how their effort can be used to  onboard new users to the cardano ecosystem. In my opinion , I believe the problem statement and the solution can be improved  to capture and articulate  the Idea very well.  The problem statement recognises that there is an ongoing effort in solving the problem , one would expect the proposed solution to bring in a different approach to solve the same problem.
