In fact, in Latin America, the adoption of Cardano is still slow (which justifies the importance of the present challenge) and when it comes to DID, it is even more so. This creates a great need to invest in this area, which is what the proposal in question seeks. Providing digital services to leverage the activity of other companies or even lone users is one way to make such an investment. I found it very interesting when the authors talk about several possibilities in the parts \"if you...\", because that way we have a good visualization of which strategies would be traced. The inhabitants of Latin America would certainly benefit from this initiative, as they would have their identities circulating in a virtual way, with the objective of achieving various advantages and not just focusing on an action. For example, at universities there are usually websites where students can download their academic transcripts to prove their affiliation with the institution. Why could this not happen, for example, also for an internship search? I think it would be that kind of activity developed here, and the blockchain would benefit as decentralized solutions would use Cardano to work through Atala Prism.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "What would need to be done to carry out the project is very detailed, from the feasibility study to the implementation of solutions. About the understanding and order of the activities themselves, I believe that everything is quite adequate. However, something that I think would be better was if they had included the time each of these activities would take. Most proposals establish phases, this was very important here, because we understand well what would happen but not when it would happen, that is, when each thing would start and end, which is essential for a full understanding of the activities. About the team: The Fairaway company seems highly qualified for the project, because they have professionals from different areas and also already have experience with decentralized identity. In addition, they have a strong network, which is undoubtedly important for any project. However, it would be more appropriate if each member were presented individually. Know who's who, their names, professional roles, how they relate to Cardano (individually), their linkedin profiles, etc. That way there would be a clearer understanding of who they are, increasing the level of confidence in the team. And about the financial division: there was a lack of detail. For example when they ask for 8k for \"customer acquisition review\", I don't quite understand what it means or why it would cost that price. I missed further explanations.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe the authors even intended to propose an auditability, but this was done in a very superficial way. They establish quarterly success metrics, but information is too short, which does not allow for a deep understanding of what is planned for results. I think it would be more appropriate for there to be continuous monitoring of this project, in other words, some members of the community, preferably Latin Americans, closely monitor the progress of all stages. The first step towards this would be to define a timetable, which is missing from this proposal, by setting dates. Through this follow-up, they could provide feedback to the Cardano community, in order to clarify whether what was promised is actually happening. It would also be interesting if the Fairaway team itself conducted a survey to find out how the adoption of decentralized identities is going. Is everything going as planned? Are people using DIDs? What was the impact of this project on your academic and/or professional lives? I believe that a more detailed analysis of the team itself with the public could be done, and such information should be disclosed, for example, in Town Hall, dialoguing with other projects in Latin America such as the LATAM Catalyst School, for example.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 12, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I agree that performing market research and then deploying a solution based on a finding is a proper step. \r\n\r\nI find this challenge in accordance with the challenge goal.\r\n\r\nRating given 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the experience and skills stated plus visiting the website, which looks awesome, I am confident they can implement the proposal successfully.\r\n\r\nAlso, the team consists of 6 members, which seem to possess the expertise in relation to the proposal.\r\n\r\nRating given 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "More details would be welcomed about planned studies.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the stated roadmap can serve as an orientational subtask checklist, and the budget is divided, so this can be audited too.\r\n\r\nThe success is described so the final outcome can be compared to the plan.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see some other metrics e.g. new users etc.\r\n\r\nRating given 3.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_54", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 7, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge is possible but lacks explanations of how it will be done, what resources are needed, or how they will be applied.

Onboarding users into Cardano through something as fundamental as recruitment is a good way to attract people and maintain them as users.
