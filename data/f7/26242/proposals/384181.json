It's great that the team has already launched the idea on f6 and has received funding, this conveys confidence in their ability to successfully execute it and also in the process itself, ie the idea has been previously evaluated and approved by the community , so I don't see why your quality content and your needs have declined. It is also very positive how the team provided the link to the proposal in the previous background. I believe that this form of publicity is very efficient to reach people who have no contact with the Cardano ecosystem, because it is difficult to get people's attention and convince them to look for more information like that at first. I think it's more worthwhile going to them than promoting campaigns that might perhaps persuade people and polls and orient themselves to our blockchain. Also, there are people who have no acquaintances who already participate in the cryptographic world; to reach this audience, in particular, it is more efficient to promote this type of advertising \"old fashioned\" than to plan events, dApp that they seek to attract, etc. that they probably wouldn't even know about. So I think it's an idea that can greatly benefit the local population of Latin America, as they would get to know the technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, and obviously the blockchain itself as new people would join.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is very rich, they break down activities based on quarters, although I always think it's better for authors to do a smaller time split (eg monthly), I don't think the quarterly split was a problem here. I think this is because there is a lot of detail in each of the quarters, a lot of activities are listed, so that we have a rich understanding of what is being done. However, regarding the financial breakdown, I think it could have been more detailed. The team reports how much money would be needed each quarter to carry out the activities, but it would be more interesting if this money had been explained individually from each activity. In this way, we would have 100% understanding of how the requested funding would be used. It's not that bad, but it could be even better in my opinion. And finally, as far as the team is concerned, I believe that the level of detail is quite satisfactory, we know the names of each team member, their main professional roles and links to their linkedin profiles, giving us the possibility to get to know them. them more deeply. It is essential to have a member (Gon) specialized in blockchain, to ensure technical security in technologies relevant to the Cardano ecosystem. I think the only part I think should be improved is the financial explanation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately the team does not set aside a space in the proposal specifically for measuring KPIs and establishing project risks. This would give us material totally focused on auditability, since we would know exactly what results are expected as a whole for the project, at the stage in which it is found. However, as they provide a lot of detail in the script, it is possible to verify whether the proposed activities are actually being carried out; this is the way we have to monitor the proposal, making it auditable. It would be interesting to select some participants from the Cardano ecosystem to accompany the project, preferably from the countries selected to receive the monitors. They could have more constant direct contact with the team and check that activities are being carried out as planned. Such feedback would need to be passed on to the rest of the community, this could be done either by the team itself or by those people monitoring the process, through written reports or through the participation of a Town Hall. I believe that yes, this topic is covered even if it was not emphasized as much during the detailing of the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 11, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "First of all, i note that this proposal brief is quite long and voters will struggle to read through all of it when there's hundreds of proposals to chose from. So this would benefit from a more succinct brief. The specific problem this proposal is tackling is the lack of access by local entities to advertising platforms, which is identified further down the proposal but is not well reflected in the \"Problem Statement\", again making it difficult for voters to quickly grasp the purpose of this proposal. This proposal fits well within the challenge and even though it's focused in Chile the proposers demonstrate the ambition to expand further. As a local activity with small budget, this is off course will initially only have a small impact, but testing the approach at smaller scale first makes sense and sets a good starting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal seems to be backed by an experienced and motivated team. The experience evidence is available for most users, except for Ian (engineer) and Matias (UX/UI desing). Given that a lot of the project is reliant on design/manufacturing and UI/UX design it would have been relevant to demonstrate experience of these two members. A timetable for implementation is presented, with the objectives at each step well explained and with realistic timings. The only worry i have from the plan is the requirement to design and manufacture your own OOH displays, which seems like a lengthy process, a bit more details in this area would be re-assuring. The budget breakdown is a bit lacking, with only estimates for each quarter presented, rather then costs by activity and man hours required. The proposal is also lacking in description of technical details in some parts e.g. you mention that you will provide a \"easy to use platform\", but what will this platform be based on ?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A number of relevant and measurable milestones for each quarter are presented as well as relevant KPI's such as number of users added and OOH displays activated.
