In short, yes, I agree. However, it seems to me a very general description since the same statement can be said for many other sectors. They plan to solve this problem by building a community to promote the adoption of Cardano in the Private Sector, through the creation of an LLC and a DAO. Although there is a great deal of potential to be unlocked if a community of people with desire and passion for Cardano could be formed in the Real Estate industry in Latin America. Unfortunately, there is no mention of the expected impact of the implementation. They mention \"success metrics\" that are more implementation milestones. As feedback, I recommend that the team submit the business plan described in the proposal as an attachment. This would improve your proposal and the chances of being awarded funds.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "If this proposal is to be implemented successfully, I believe the team should gather profiles containing various skills and experience. This includes expertise in establishing and managing DAOs and Blockchain knowledge, real estate, legal, marketing, etc. Sadly, no links or documents were provided to verify the experience described in the proposal. It is impossible to assess the reasonableness of the budget without a description and breakdown of it. I recommend to the team that for future Catalyst cycles a detailed description of the team's skills and experience be included. Additionally, I recommend you provide proof of your skills described in your proposal. Likewise, it is imperative that a detailed, itemized description of the budget be provided.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer mentions that in the next four months they will advertise in 5 Latin American countries, and they have already visited their artists there. Due to the lack of clarity regarding the impact they intend to achieve, it is difficult to evaluate whether such a first milestone is reasonable. I consider the three milestones to be more like milestones than success metrics, so they are not very auditable in my opinion. After the expected impact and implementation milestones have been clarified, I also recommend that the team for future catalyst cycles include a reporting structure to the community not only on how the \"steps\" have been completed but also on how the proposal is impacting the community during implementation.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 12, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "It start from a valid and noble premisse/problem statement but the solution doesnt make it very clear what really is and to what extent the impact is expected in solving the problem.\r\n\r\nIt says it intends to create \"Realtokers\" community but it could mention what the community will do, how it will attract new member, what are the acitivities developed in there and mos important, how the tokenization of the projcts will happen.\r\n\r\nThe terms in the final deliverables could also have more details. For instance, when is mentioned \" Build business relationships to strengthen Cardano's adoption for your businesses.\", I wonder other will be considered a streghned business relationship to the proposer. It should also say how to get to it - a proper plan.\r\n\r\nThe proposer could also try to quantify the impact a little bit. It could have been menionted here how many people are target and should join this community, how many projects should be tokenized, etc.\r\n\r\nOne extra suggestion would be  to add more details here is the communication plan both to attract the private sector to the project and to advertized the tokenized projects. This is an essential part in a project like this.\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The team experience mentioned here is too vague and could have more details - both of the team as a whole and the indivuduals on it, with their resumes and possibly links or ways to verify their capabilities.\r\n\r\nAthough it says they have delivered a business plan in 1Q2021, no plan is exposed in the proposal whatsover. It should have here a time-framed schedule telling thow the team will achieve the goals listed in the end of the proposal, maybe divided in a planning and execution phase.\r\n\r\nthere's a high level budget breakdown but more details on it could also be offered. Since the budget will be allocated solely to travel, it could mention how these trips would be carried out: how many days, how many meetings, who they are going to meet and how the money will be divided into tickets, meals, tranportation, how many people would go in these trips etc. This would help to understand the rationale behind the number and check its fairness/plausability.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There are some 3 final deliverables but no metrics with targets or intermediate milestones. It could include as metrics, for instance, how many companies they finally engaged in the project.\r\n\r\nThese final deliverables also could be provided with more details or a more straighfoward way to measure/evaluate them. Saying, for instance, \"Publicize the project across Latam \" is a bit subjective and can have many intepretations of done/success. One way to better detail it would be \"create at least 2 marketing campaigns  to be shared in 4 defined social medias, pay top 3 selected influencers to share the project in their instagram, reach X number of people, talk to at leas 4 different companies in meetings to present the projects\" Etc.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 11, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The issue being low adoption of Cardano ecosystem in LATAM's real estate sector.
