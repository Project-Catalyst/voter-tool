Although it has already been explored in other ecosystems, the team plans to address this problem by creating an educational platform that utilizes the Learn-to-Earn module can have a significant impact on the CARDANO ecosystem. Despite being an ambitious project, the team cleverly separated it into 5 major phases which allows to the community to assess the impact the team plans to have in each phase. However, one aspect that could be improved in this proposal is that it would begin having a \"real impact\" after 2 years since that is when it is planned to have industry connections and teachers participating. I would recommend the team to include as a deliverable of the MVP (12 months) a pilot test of the MVP with success metrics as a result of the test. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team members have managed to assemble a very diverse set of skills and experience across a wide range of disciplines. Referrals on LinkedIn were provided, so experience can be verified from that perspective. One critical point I'm maybe missing from the proposal team is a person with educational / pedagogical background, they describe in the proposal comments that they count with advisor with such relevant experience but sadly the didn't provide nor description nor reference links to it. They did and excellent job regarding the budget description, also regarding the identification of future risks that attempt with a successful implementation.  \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They did a very good describing the five phases from the short term (3 months) to the long term (after 3 years), each with a brief description of what will take place. The team took things a step further by explaining to the community exactly what would take place in the short term, including recruitment, development, and research actions. Furthermore, the team identifies in detail what metrics of success they expect to have, which I consider relevant, particularly from year two because these will be the ones that have a tangible impact. Another element that adds auditability is the open source nature of the platform. This will allow the community to understand in detail how the project is progressing and in which direction it is heading. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 15, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal dialogues very well with the goal of the challenge of encouraging development in Latin America, through the creation of an educational platform focused on technology, which would certainly help in the question of the continent's educational precariousness and employment opportunities. However, I would like the authors to make it clearer how the Cardano blockchain would fit here, certainly within the technological teachings our ecosystem would be much addressed, as well as the use of DID, which also relates well to a challenge from the previous background ( Atala Prism). Despite that, I felt a lack of assurance about how this project would bring feedback to the Cardano community; I know this feedback will exist, but it would be great to have details of that. Regarding making a difference on the continent, there is no doubt that such a project is very necessary and promising, the authors could also specify which target audience they aim to reach in principle, in which Latin American country, in which age group, etc. Another detail that I was in doubt about would be the cost of courses provided by Ayllu Academy. What currency, ada, local currency would they be paid for? What would the average price of courses be, and who would this profit go to? It would be interesting if we knew better how this more financial part of the platform would work, although I know they are details, but relevant details. As a whole, the project matches what is required in this challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved here is certainly qualified to carry out the project well; we know who they are, their names, a brief history of their backgrounds and previous experiences, and also their LinkedIn profiles, where we can get to know each of them in more detail. It would be interesting, however, that the authors had shown a greater interest in being concerned with the usability part of the platform, that is, building a UX design that was simple and ergonomic, to further enhance the benefits of the project, by making the target audience has ease of navigation. Another thing is the question of marketing, it is not clear if they intend to hire someone who is professional and in charge of carrying out this part of the project, or even a team of publicists, how would this publicity, etc.? It's a huge project, so it needs a lot of publicity to reach the public. Regarding the steps that would make up the entire project, the authors specify very well what would happen in a given period of time. It is always beneficial to draw a timeline of activities to be completed, in parallel with the success achieved over the months, as they do in great detail. And in relation to the budget, it's also explained in a lot of detail, so we have a solid understanding of how the money asked would be used, which parts would cost how much and so on.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This part of the proposal is very complete, we have the KPIs needed to understand if the project is achieving what it intends, we know what the team's ambitions are, even in relation to the number of students on the platform. I found it very interesting how they drew up an ideal scenario, that is, the context in which everything would be happening in the best possible way, which involves self-sustainability and so on. I also suggest that there is some communication channel between the team and the Cardano community during the execution of the project, as it is huge and involves several aspects (programming, design, education, marketing). There could be periodic meetings or even the delivery of partial results, with which we could assess the progress of things.
