The project proposes to solve this issue by conducting a Hackathon for individuals and companies in Latin America to gain knowledge of Ethereum and Cardano through the Milkomeda Protocol.

Although the project clearly benefits the community, I would be interested in knowing how many developers the team plans to reach through the hackathon.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Milkomeda and dcSpark make a solid team and this can be easily verified. Almost exclusively, the requested budget will be used for the prizes to be awarded at the hackathon. As a result, I am not concerned about providing a detailed breakdown of the budget.
