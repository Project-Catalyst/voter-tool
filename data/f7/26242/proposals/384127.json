Would there be any fee for uses? If so, there should be some free slots for low income people.\r\nSecond, what content (or syllabus) will be provided here? What formats (texts, videos, podcasts,live  lectures) would be used? The languages the content would be available should also be mentioned in the proposal in order to better assess its impact. Also, how would the community interact with this platform? Would it be possible for people to submit or request content? would there be a place for discussions? All these information should be available from start.\r\n\r\nLast, before developing the platform, theres a paid learning step to the proposal. it makes the project take much longer to deliver value to the community (1 semster of delay). There are other proposals to develop learning platforms with quicker results. One interesting thing to do is develop the platform as the proposer learnes in his, sharing how this processs is going and bringing questions and discussions back and forth between his course and and his e-learning platform. If he was already a teacher, as described, this interconnection wouldnt be hard to do.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Theres one single person dedicated already to this project but with apparent little knowledge on what he intends to teach (this knowledge would be developed in the first stage of the project).

The proposer should also be more clear on the type of content that will serve as learning material, whether it will be articles or videos.
