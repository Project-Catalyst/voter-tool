Therefore, restricting mass adoption.", "funded": 1, "upvotes": 40386235, "downvotes": 17771005, "votes_result": 22615230, "votes_cast": 170, "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.0, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "I think this idea is cool, but it's not essential. Taking payment in ADA and having it automatically converted to local currency would be very practical for local Latin American sellers. On the other hand, I see some issues here: starting with the fact that converting ADA into other currencies is not something that involves a lot of \"time and money\" to be done, as the author of the proposal says. I do this quickly through Yoroi wallet and Binance brokerage, the total process between sending my ADA to Binance from brokerage to my bank costs me around 2 units of my local currency. And it doesn't take more than 20 minutes to do it. Therefore, I believe that the core of this proposal is not as fundamental as the author claims. We also have the fact that it is sometimes more advantageous to expect the ADA to be valued to convert than to convert at the exact moment we receive the cryptocurrency. I'm not saying wait months as this is not feasible for traders. But in a matter of a week, the currency could appreciate a lot. And I believe that those who choose to work with the ADA are aware of their voters and seek to make the best possible use of it. The author gives us very good explanations about his dApp, so that we can understand well how his activities would work in practice. I recognize that it would be a project that could greatly benefit the Cardano ecosystem, but due to its high price of 156k in financing and the possibility of doing the same things without creating a specific dApp, in addition to the factors I have reviewed above, I believe that the same money could be used on different projects with more valid ideas.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script is divided into phases, each phase being very well explained through subtopics. In relation to this part of the proposal, I believe the author provides us with a very good amount of detail, so that we can have a very solid view of the process, that is, what would need to be done in parts to carry out the project. About the team, the author informs us which professionals would be needed, but from what I understand, he has not yet defined who the other team members would be. There are no details about anyone other than the author. This is complicated, because there is no way to build trust in people you don't know. It would be important for the author to define a team, or at least 80% of it, and properly present each member: names, roles, previous work, etc. In this way, confidence in your ability to successfully execute the project would be conveyed. And about financing, the author explains to us based on topics how the money would be used. However, I believe we would need more detail here. For example $6400 for 6 months of app server. Why does it cost so much? What would the server be? More than 28k for the project manager/development leader: why is this role so expensive, what would this person do in practice, what would their day-to-day work be like?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author sets metrics to be achieved 6 months after launch. In this way, we would have something to monitor as the semester progresses: were the promised results really achieved? However, as this is an expensive and complex project, I would have liked monthly goals to be followed. In this way, we could carry out closer monitoring and at shorter intervals, increasing the quality level of this auditability. We can also follow the process through the information provided in the script. I think the author himself could be in charge of gathering this data located in the metrics and presenting it to the community (as I said, monthly would be better). Also, two or three professionals could be chosen to monitor the process, people from the Cardano ecosystem who have a sufficient technical base to understand the functioning of the technologies developed here. Therefore, I believe that yes, the author provides us with auditable information, it is enough that they were more in-depth and that the community kept in constant contact with him/her team, in order to periodically monitor the progress of things.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 11, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The issue being not practical to accept ADA as a payment for a merchant in developing countries which is restricting mass adoption of Cardano for payment.

This project, with the training of a team for its implementation, would also allow the integration of new people into the community. This coordinates with the objectives described in the metrics. However, the reflection of this project in terms of its impact on the Catalyst ecosystem is missing, and some explanations would have helped to certify the participant's awareness of this process.

Also information about how the participant plan to find additional people for the team. \r\nEspecially since, unless I'm mistaken, the budget requested represents about 30% of the total budget of the challenge, which is well detailed in technical terms and details of the procedure, but really lacks information.

Also other applications like Adapay do not allow conversion to stablecoins or fiat currency, a feature that cardway finance has.

What could be confusing for a voter, is the fact that there is one team member at this time and all other team members are to be hired. The proposer gives a 2 month time for the team to be built and the prototype to be implemented, which is marginally feasible. Maybe consider extending the project horizon. The budget, however, is outlined clearly and seems to be reasonable to achieve the goals set. The timetable is stated clearly, the only thing to be added would be the public launch.
