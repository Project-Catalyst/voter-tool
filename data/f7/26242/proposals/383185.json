The issue raised here has its roots in the history of Latin American politics. Corrupt practices. Therefore, it would be beneficial to find a way to facilitate the organization of communities in a decentralized manner. The team is seeking funds to develop a platform utilizing AtalaPRISM's features to propose, improve, and vote on new legislation. In one year, the target is to register 1% of the Brazilian population, which would amount to approximately 1.15 million individuals, which is exactly what the challenge requires. However, the proposal claims that this prototype complies with the laws of Latin America, but it refers to Brazilian laws only. It would be interesting to describe what legal basis of this mechanism in the rest of the region.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposal fails to present not only the description of the team's skills and experience, but also the reference to verify them. As part of the budget, they propose to hire people with relevant skills, but I would recommed to the team that at least one core team member should have a technical background. Budget-wise, practically the entire amount requested is intended for payment of professional hours, and in comparison with other proposals within this challenge, the costs per hour are considerably higher; therefore, I would also recommend that the proposer present the criteria used for cost allocation. the author of this proposal states that laws were rejected in the past because digital signatures were not accepted. Thus, based on my reading of the proposal, I do not understand if some previous validation is required in order for governmental entities to recognize the validity of the votes that come out of the platform. For future catalyst cycles, I recommend the team to take in consideration to provide a clear statement that this concerns were considered. \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal presents 3- and 6-month milestones, but in my opinion, these milestones should be described in a way that allows the community to understand what the activities will be, for example, instead of saying \"social media marketing\", I would recommend the team to describe what platforms will be used, what type of activities will be used and how many will be carried out. I believe that this proposal is the community factor is indispensable, so it should be part of the core of the strategy of this project. Regarding the success metrics that I consider relevant are number of citizens registered, number of proposals created, number of students and local lawyers participating, number of voters, among others, which I consider appropriate. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 13, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Regarding the impact, this proposal is very strong. The idea is to create a platform on which Brazilians can browse popular initiatives, viewing those that already exist, voting and curing the ones they wish. The initiative is closely linked to the Cardano ecosystem as it intends to use AtalaPRISM as a source of identity, which would greatly enhance the security of the data involved here, using blockchain to store the information present in the action. I thought it was a very strong idea because, in fact, security and privacy is fragile for this type of action, in fact, there is no platform that is complete for carrying out these consultations/votes, and it is also an urgent matter in the country . Brazilian politics is extremely troubled and permeated by a lot of corruption, I believe that if the population had more autonomy in managing their own initiatives, it would be a major benefit for the country, thus favoring an important Latin American location, as the challenge seeks. In other words, regarding the relevance of the project for Brazil and the benefits it would bring to Cardano, I believe that everything is quite clear, the question here is: how would Brazilians get to know this platform, how would they learn to use it? It needs to be simple, because one of the things that discourages people to get involved in politics is the fact that everything is too bureaucratic, and I worry how the idea would reach a local population so unfamiliar with the blockchain. I think there was a lack of clarification in relation to the practical part of the idea, the authors dedicate themselves to arguing well as to why all this is important, but they do not explain exactly how the daily use of the tool would take place. I also believe that the asking price is very high, I understand that the project's complexity is intense, (I'll look more closely at the budget issue in the topic below), but it will take a lot of analysis by the community to choose to invest so much in a single project, however highly interesting it is, as is the case.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The staff doesn't provide much information about who they are. They attach a website, which gave an error when I tried to access, and make a short description about the areas of expertise of the members involved in the relevant experience part, but it is not an exact detail of who they are, because we don't know who does the that for example. We also do not have any in-depth information on each individual professional, it would be necessary to understand a little of the feedback from each one, that is, their previous work, their training, how each one of them connected with the Cardano ecosystem, and so on. Regarding the description of the steps, there is no detail either, the total period of 6 months is divided into two large parts and each of them has a short list of what will be done in the period. The problem is that it's really very short, so we don't have a detailed understanding of what's going to happen. I would recommend that the authors divide the time by month, and within each month explain better what would be done, that way we would have a complete picture of the whole. Finally, with regard to the funding itself, I believe the authors provided enough detail for us to firmly understand how this money would be used. Too bad, I continue with this thought and reinforce that there could be even more detail in some parts of the financing. I think it would be essential for them to mention who would be each professional here and what their work routine would be like, in other words, what tasks would the advertiser do for the marketing of the project? How would the construction of the UI/UX that the designer would do? I thought that the values, as they were high, needed more information about each professional and their activities, I do not think it is disproportionate, but that more detail would be needed in order to convey security in the investment. In general: we don't really know who the team is, the phases are very summarized and the financial division is present and very detailed, so I believe it is necessary for the authors to increase their proposal in detail.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Success metrics are the most detailed part of the proposal (apart from the argument about why it is interesting to generate such a platform). With that, we have enough information to monitor the project's progress. I believe that as this is a very particular project in the area, it would be necessary for some members of the Brazilian community to closely monitor the progress of things. It's 6 months of complex and expensive activities that need to be monitored and passed on to the rest of the Cardano community, I suggest a small group of Brazilians engaged in blockchain and with a political sense that is enough to monitor the progress of the project. You don't need to be so professional about it, but it is a fact that, unfortunately, many people in the country have no political involvement, this is a cultural characteristic of Brazil, some people are very engaged but I believe that most of them are a little extraneous to what happens in this scenario, so it would be interesting for people who were going to exercise audibility here to have an interest in the subject, even to generate more energy in following the project and making this change come true.
