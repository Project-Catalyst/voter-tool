The idea is to analyze opportunities and objectives associated with the various projects involving Cardano in Latin America; It is positive that the team is made up of people from the continent, which promotes greater understanding of local issues. It's also a good thing for a team to be specialized in the manufacturing business, but I think it would be better if they convey more confidence in handling other types of businesses as well. Do they have enough technical training for that? In short, the authors would do a kind of consultancy for projects involving our blockchain, which would certainly benefit the continent as well, while some projects would be better conducted and would bring profits both for their entrepreneurs and for territoriality; as for the Cardano ecosystem, as it encourages the adoption of our blockchain technologies. I would, however, like the authors to become a little more specific as to the exact location in which they intend to work, which country in Latin America? These and other issues are the best explained, but in general, it is a proposal that appears to have impacts and take good care of the challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team provides us with a lot of information about your project, which includes key activities, potential customers, and many others. This gives us the indirect possibility of understanding what would be done, how it would be done and for what purposes. However, I found the explanations quite technical and not so easy for people outside the industry to understand. It is positive how a linear timetable is drawn, that is, a step-by-step guide to how this would all happen. They organize the whole into phases, but don't detail each one very much. Regarding the team, they seem very capable and well prepared, we have the names and main roles of each one, as well as their linkedin profiles, where we can get to know them more intimately. However, none of them claim a direct relationship with Cardano, this worries me a little. How did they get involved with our blockchain, what are your experiences here? They say they have a funded proposal on f6, it would be nice if we had a link to it to understand exactly what has been done so far. And in relation to the financial breakdown, I believe that everything was done properly, the amount requested is divided in part and each one of them is detailed, so that we were able to understand well the need for the $7,500 in financing. I think the only things I could suggest would be a little more detail in the script and a clarification on the team's relationship with the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I believe that the team is concerned with providing a lot of precise information that includes the project's auditability very well. They split the time between January through March / April through June, and give 4 KPIs for each half. In this way, we have objective data that allow us to monitor the proposal's success. In addition, because they present very richly what they will do, how they will do it, about their customers, etc., right in the first part of the proposal, and also provide a script that specifies which activities would be done each month, it is possible to analyze the process, and not just the results. I believe that, in the case of this proposal, it would be more interesting to schedule meetings between the team and some members of the Cardano community, and through direct contact we could understand how each part is progressing and subsequently the results. I think this because it is not a simple project, whose results are merely quantitative. It is also a qualitative analysis. Anyway, I felt that the team addressed the issue of auditability very well and yes, it is possible to safely monitor the process/results of this proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 12, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": " Relation to personal qualifications: Since I don't have any direct personal connection to any Latin American country, I can only assess the non Latin America specific parts of this proposal.  I however have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal clearly identifies a problem within the challenge; the existance of different risks and opportunities in each part of the world that also exist for Latin America and the neccessity to properly analyzing them first before just jumping into them with a one-size-fits-all solution. Working together with locals in order to assess the local situations and structures seems like a really smart approach to this that will both add value to the Cardano ecosystem and bring benefits to the local population..\r\nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings very well, and have a lot of potential for self-empowerment and organisation.\r\nTaking a look at the makeup of the proposal,  I am positive the proposal will help a lot towards scalability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "DLT360 has so far shown (with their proposal from F6 they currently govern) that they are a serious and competent project partner for catalyst.

As shown, the feasibility is very high, as it shows the roadmap along with the development plan, detailed step-by-step explanations, milestones and partial deliverables, progress and some a way for the community to quantify the success of a proposal.
