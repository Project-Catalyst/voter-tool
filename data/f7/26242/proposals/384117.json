If successful, this project would certainly benefit both Latin America and the Cardano ecosystem, since, for the continent, it would promote an economic incentive through project financing, and for our blockchain, it would bring new users to use our technologies and thus would expand Cardano's reach. However, I have a few hours of work to do here. First, we don't know many details about the course. We know the main thing, which would be Cardano and Catalyst. But what are the specific subjects of each class? How long would each class last? What platform would the videos be hosted on? Would the course be free or paid? What is the total duration of the course? We don't know the details that say about the most basic part of the project. I was also wondering how these face-to-face meetings are concerned, if two of the three team members are living in Europe. Where would these meetings be? What is the average number of students they intend to meet at one time? How long do these face-to-face meetings last? In general, I liked the idea, but I think it lacked detail. The impact is certain, but to have even more security in it we would need to understand what exactly we are talking about here.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team involved does not seem very capable of executing the project successfully. Benji and Viktor study business in France; and Paco is a journalist. They claim they are all new to the community. How then would they have the necessary preparation to promote this course? They don't prove to us that they already understand the blockchain well, they would be able to create classes with quality content and in-depth on the subject. I think the idea would work a lot better if they hired someone who was already in the community in time, who already worked with Cardano and who had mastery of the technical parts. I don't understand exactly what business students could do here, I understand that Paco's role would be to publicize the project (I'd like to know what PR is), but unfortunately this team doesn't give me confidence to work with the creation of a course . I think, as I mentioned, they could include people who specialize in the blockchain and then, yes, split tasks, so that we could understand who would do what and then we would have the necessary confidence. About the script, the authors include some steps that would be necessary for the development of the project, but I believe there is a lack of detail. We were unable to visualize in depth what the process would be like. For example, in the first step, \"create a course\": all those details that I mentioned in the previous topic come to mind, about subjects, duration, platform and so on. In \"promotion and marketing\": it would be necessary for them to detail which universities they intend to approach (we don't know which country it would be, probably Argentina, but this is not explicit), how it would be and how it would be and how it would be and how the marketing strategy would be in social networks, etc. And finally, when it comes to finance, something similar to what we see in the stages happens. We have basic but not detailed information. Each of the topics could be better explained by the authors.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The authors provide information that can serve well to monitor the project, but it is all about results. It would be, in short, the scope of the course: how many students were taught, how many proposals they launched post-course, formation of post-course hubs, etc. But it would also be interesting if we had the means to evaluate the process, and not just the results. Therefore, I thought that the information provided here is a little superficial, only covering a part of the analysis. It would be great for the team to stay in contact with the rest of the community, to gather the data they select here in a report and present it to the rest of the community, during a Town Hall, for example. It would also be great if any Spanish-speaking community could participate in the course to rate it and bring that feedback to the community. In other words, I think that there is a principle of auditability here, but it should be deepened.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 10, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The stated problem and solution is very well aligned with the Challenge, as it aims to raise awareness levels of people in Latin America about Cardano and Catalyst. The solution approach has a high potential for positive impact because, according to several researches around the world, younger people, specially men, are more likely to engage in cypto/blockchain activities. In my experience as a brazilian from Rio de Janeiro, most, if not all, college students have at least heard of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, but the majority of them don't know how to be part of this technology, or don't understand the benefits they could obtain from it. Providing a course in spanish about Catalyst in business schools should probably arouse interest among those students, creating value for the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem, for themselves and their countries. They are the next generation of business leaders and all this information about Cardano and Catalyst will give them means to build new business and social infrastructures ready for the next decades. The KPIs perfectly match the challenge's indicated KPIs, as they pursue attracting new members for the community and supporting them making new proposals in the next fund cycle. I would only suggest adding a KPI to measure the quality of those proposals, based on scores given, as indicated by the challenge. I think it is a great idea and could be expanded to include other fields like engineering and economics students, as well as a portuguese version for brazilian students.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They already have a team of 3 Latin American business students that can relate to their target audience. There is a detailed description of the working hours needed, a clear step by step plan with specific actions and deadlines, the budget makes sense and takes less then 1% of the challenge total budget. They identified the risks and offered possible solutions to mitigate them. I just missed information about how the course will be conducted, such as in person or online, live or recorded, on which platform or place, free or paid, as well as information about the skills they have that will help them build an effective course. Anyway, I strongly believe it is completely feasible. Adding those mentioned informations would make me give the 5th star.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They provided a roadmap with milestones and time horizons. However, I think there could be more specification about the course, such as duration in hours and what to expect from its content. That would make it easier to track the course development progress. Additionally, they could specify which Universities they will be promoting the course at start to give step 2 a better progress tracking.
