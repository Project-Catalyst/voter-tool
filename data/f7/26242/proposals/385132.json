In an effort to address this problem with technological as well as historical aspects, the team proposes a series of solutions such as the development of \"Smart Contracts\" throughout the distribution network, IoT devices, and data processing for insurance companies, among others. Although it may seem an ambitious project, the team includes a flow chart explaining how they expect to be economically sustainable. In summary, if the implementation of what is proposed here were to be implemented, it would be a huge success not only for Cardano, but for the entire industry. The possibility of scaling into other areas would be limitless. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a very detailed description of the skills and experiences of the team members, along with references to their summaries on LinkedIn, additionally presents a link to the website of their startup - Wseeds - where among others you can see a prototype of the sensors. There is also a budget section, where clearly identified items are shown, as well as a clear description of how the project will be implemented. I think the items in the budget section are appropriate. As I will describe below, there are several aspects of feasibility that must be improved in order to ensure community security. (1) I would like to point out to you that it is not entirely clear if your startup is still theoretical or if they have already had successful experiences in the field of IoT solutions. If the latter is the case it would have been interesting to present data on the successes to date. (2) While the budget has positive aspects the team should provide more details so that the community can accurately evaluate, for example, $15000 is requested for the development of smart contracts, the hourly cost and estimated contracting time needs to be presented. (3) There was no mention of the possible risks to successful implementation, and it is clear to me that a project of this magnitude would encounter many on the way. In particular, I would have truly enjoyed reading about the benefits and limitations of Colombian legislation in this area and how you are planning to handle them.\u00a0\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal clearly describe 4 deliverables, the first one is the improvement of the sensors they currently have, the second one is to improve the platform, the third one is to have an automated greenhouse (Exciting!), and finally the market share they plan to gain. Although timelines are presented being the minimum 3 months and the maximum 12 months, I think I could have done a better description of this.\u00a0Although I understand the complexity of the proposal, I would recommend presenting a Gantt type graphic element in the Town Halls if funded or for future Catalyst cycles proposals. Another aspect that I would recommed to improve auditability is to consider switching to open source and the second is more of a recommendation is to explore the solutions that SingularityNET has for improving their IA models.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 18, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "We are so grateful about your comments.

My main concern here is lack of initial focus and efforts splitted, considering it is a start-up, with not much resources. Of course business models has to be tested but in the beggining maybe it will be better to focus in only one (commericalizing the technology/service or the final product)\r\nI like theres an illustrative example of the value chain, it makes it much more eeasier to understand what is being offered\r\n \r\nAnyhow, It is also not clear how the proposal itself really impact the challenge. It says it is a Colombian start up but it doesnt say which country it already is presented nor which countries it intends to expand, if funded. Having this business/expansion plan clear here would make it easier to evaluate its impact. Moreover,  offering the technology applied or the final product not necessairly make the people more aware of it or make the community grow. Theres an education step on what is behind the application, to those who are going to use it, in order to make them understand and interested about blochain and etc. This step is not clear here as well.\r\n\r\nLast, I see it also lacks an economical analysis on the the price of the final product. How much more expensive it will be? are people willing to pay for it? If not, the project will not be economical feasible although the technolgy is amazing", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Theres an already committed team working on this, as a start up, which may validate their capability. The team resumes are verifiable by linkedin links.\r\nTheres a solid plan to develop the tech but I miss more details in the business/expansion plan, specially if we are talking of funding a company. Some activities seems to take a little longert than it should also (example, it says it will take 6 months to \"Create video-publicity for the project\" which is a lot).\r\n\r\nBudget breakdown is fair and sensible", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are mmilestones for the development/validation stage of the project but and some metrics in the business development/commercialization phase but there could be some sales ramp up expectation to assess it over time. These metrics are not time related.\r\n\r\nLast, regarding the risks, this project is both about technology and market development. This makes it really risky as the technology might not work and the costumerss might not want the product. An initial cost benefit analsysis should have been done beforehand.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "This is a really complete feedback.
