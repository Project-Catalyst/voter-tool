This alone is totally aligned with the Cardano spirit. A nano/micro credit solution has already been implemented in the traditional manner. In the process of securing debt funds and improving lending capacity, they plan to utilize the benefits of ISPO implementation. ADA holders are expected to be attracted to their business model by offering their native TOKEN on Cardano. In 12 months, they expect to have 2000 ADA holders with more than 100M ADA staked in their Stake Pools. Its target population is those people whose socio-demographic characteristics make it difficult or prohibitive for them to access the benefits of the traditional financing system. However, from a decentralization standpoint, I suggest the team to improve the proposal features. For example, describe if in the second / third phase of the project the team is considering the implementation of a smart contract to operate the entire proposed solution. This would increase alignment with what Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem is looking for. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fact that the business model has already been in the market for 8 months and has shown excellent results gives us some insight into the team's capabilities. Also, adding excellent partners such as MELD, VENT, and ADABLUE will allow them to use Cardano's features to improve their business models. Regarding skills and experiences the team provides both a brief and appropriate description and reference links to their profiles. A simple budget is presented, almost entirely devoted to development. It would be ideal, however, if they had also presented the cost of a development hour, the profile they are seeking, and where they intend to hire it (considering the cost of a development hour varies greatly depending on the context in which it is hired). The absence of references to the people or contacts of the mentioned partners is also an area for improvement. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Rather than presenting implementation milestones, the team decided to present a description of deliverables, the first one after a month and the second one after six months. From an auditability perspective, I think the team should have made a greater effort to describe to the community what the steps or activities would be during implementation. Nevertheless, I must give them credit since they have provided an excellent description of the metrics of success of the project. A total of eight metrics are presented, divided into four time periods, with the first taking place at the beginning of the month, and the last following 12 months.

It does not only help grow the Cardano ecosystem in Latin America but even helps relieve human suffering. Every individual that doesn't have to go to greedy loan sharks is a success story. Perhaps the next step is to turn the loan sharks in to ADAentrepreneurs. :)\r\n\r\nAlready Grameen Bank proved that unbanked and underbanked communities are trustworthy and now this type of modern \"Collaborative Credit Scoring\" mechanisms help popularize that fact.\r\n\r\nI like the team's ready-for-collaboration thinking: \"We can even facilitate our credit scoring to other Cardano dApps who can benefit from our credit scores.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A solid team with 10 members publicly listed in LinkedIn, a reasonable expansion roadmap and already existing product. What more can you ask? Well, you can ask partnerships. They have even those. A word or two from Ken Olling (MELD) would have helped legitimize the said partnership but I guess we'll just take your word for it. \r\n\r\nThe only open question remaining is this: What can the ISO/ISPO participants do with the native tokens? In the comments section the answer is \"Our token will be used by our users to get endorsed to get the loans in stablecoins / fiat\" but what will I do with the token if I'm nowhere near in Latam region? If you can answer that convincingly, I might just become one of those ISO/ISPO participants.\r\n\r\nLater the plan is to move the off-chain microloans on-chain but the team needs to come up with a sidechain or state channel solution to make sure the fees are kept to the minimum. They reveal in the comments an interesting detail: \"we are lending even bus tickets\".\r\n\r\nRegardless of these possible caveats, I am confident in the team to implement this initial plan and to find answers in the open questions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Although there's not much detail about the deliverables and KPIs, it's a fairly straightforward plan: employ one developer to set up the stakepools and another one to take care of the native token minting and distribution. The team hasn't budgeted anything for themselves. This tells me the company is already well-funded and functioning (running on 5% profit margin). Auditability comes from the fact that results speak for themselves. It is indeed the Cardano community who literally votes with their wallets whether or not to participate in Kashin's early steps.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 6, "ng": 11, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This would, if carried out properly, align perfectly with the goals of both this challenge and Cardano as a whole.  By providing opportunities for persons with need for small loans an opportunity to build credit where no useful/dependable/fair credit system exists, Cardano will be entering into a market in which it may very easily become a critical financial system while simultaneously improving the lives of members of the society.  Additionally the setup and operation of stake pools connected to this endeavor will increase decentralization of Cardano into Latin America.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the information provided by the proposers team, it appears that not only do they have considerable experience in financial management and app building but they are planning to integrate Cardano into an already-existing successful lending infrastructure, including an existing app already utilized by persons in multiple countries.
