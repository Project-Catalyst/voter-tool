The Catalyst School is already a milestone for the Cardano community, it is a high value project that helps a lot of new people who have the design to enter the Catalyst process and don't know what to do. Until then, I believe that, if not all, most of the School's activities were done in English, which is a barrier for those who do not speak the language. Providing workshops, with different themes, from how to be CA, vCa, proponent, what is Catalyst, etc., in Portuguese and Spanish will certainly facilitate the accession of new members from Latin America, and with that greatly favor the continent , as you seek the challenge. Among the proposals that I evaluated, this is one of the most likely to have an immediate positive impact, because the results would start to emerge from the moment the workshops took place, in the next 2 funds. In addition to benefiting the continent, it would benefit our system as a whole, as it would bring in new members, which is also related to an f6 challenge, if I'm not mistaken, it was something like \"Value on boarding\", which was intended to bring new members to the community and engage those who are already part of it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Without a doubt, the team involved will be able to successfully promote this project. I think this because, as I said before, the Catalyst School is already a reality, it had several proposals launched in f6, and most of them financed. They actively participate in the funding processes, executing their projects, their members have a marked presence at community events, such as Town Halls, and also have active communication channels (youtube, telegram, discord, etc.), through which they can articulate. . In this way, I faithfully believe that the project is in good hands, it is enough that the new members involved also have a high level of commitment. In terms of the script, they tell us exactly what would be done, when and how; what are the goals for the total time (24 events for 2 funds); what expenses would be necessary for these things to become reality, in a detailed and precise way. We know who would work with what, for how long and also the hourly wage rate. We know what topics they intend to cover in each workshop, although there is always a chance that this roadmap will be modified slightly based on community feedback. The script is so precise that we also have a notion of time, that is, in which week each activity would take place. Speaking again about the financial part, I found the fair value, although high, they justifies why this value is requested and how it would be used according to the project's needs. For these reasons, I believe the team clarifies very well 1) what will be done 2) how it will be done 3) when it will be done 4) for how much it will be done, so I found no room for constructive criticism.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We know very well what's going to happen and who in what order, so it's easy to track and monitor the project. I think it would be interesting for the School to make available reports of what is happening, what small results it is getting and show them to the rest of the community, so that people who do not speak Portuguese/Spanish can stay on top of the situation. It is positive how they set out in detail what their success metrics would be, that is, how we can understand if the project is achieving what it intends to do. It would also be interesting if some member of the community could participate in the workshops (naturally, someone who speaks the languages \u200b\u200bworked here), or even commenting during a Town Hall about how the project is joining. I believe that for it to be successful it is also necessary that we monitor advertising, that we can obtain data on how this project is being disseminated, because the key to the issue here is to demystify Catalyst for those who do not know or know and do not understand. And this can only be done through strong publicity. However, all I said here were suggestions, I believe the team was careful enough to provide us with content to monitor and perform auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal fits well with the objective of the challenge, by proposing a way where catalyst members who speak Portuguese and/or Spanish can register to participate in workshops, where they can discuss with each other about different stages of the catalyst, thus facilitating an increase in the level of Latin American users of Cardano through a debate between individuals from different branches of the Cardano ecosystem, without the difficulties generated by not having command of the English language. According to the project's organizers, one of the project's success measures is the number of users involved in these workshops, being a factor of great importance to provide a broader debate that allows users who are starting to have a better idea of \u200b\u200bwhich path inside from the cardano ecosystem he prefers to follow, and what is the best way to do so, and for the veterans it will be a chance to \"inspire the novices\" and learn even more from other veterans present there. Therefore, the proposal sees the skewed growth in the challenge as an evolution of the current members, but not as an expansion for people outside Cardano, but due to the high level of organization present on the catalyst page and on the gitbook (https://chianca. gitbook.io/cs-latam), and the simplicity at the base of the project, which justifies its low cost, makes the latam project very plausible, realistic and in line with the challenge's objectives.

In addition, the functioning of the project is well explained with the exception of how the classes will work, I know it will be a joint process between the members themselves so that they exchange knowledge with each other, and even if you agree that it will generate an improvement in the quality of users already registered at Cardano, I do not believe that the way the project is planned (focusing on improving registered users) will attract a considerable amount of users to the Cardano ecosystem, but it will definitely improve the level of existing users, and in question of financial control, all expenditures are very well documented and a very affordable financing is also being requested for the time the project will run until it needs more new financing(2 funds). project operation directly on the proposal page.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of monitoring, everything is already posted on the proposal page, including what the money received will be spent with, and how events with up to 6 months after funded will work, and although it is said that the default schedule may change according to the community feedback and needs, if the gitbook page(https://chianca.gitbook.io/cs-latam/) is frequently updated, it will be easy to follow the project functioning.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_928", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal meets the objectives of the challenge, because encourage members of the community to be more involved in future funds.

Which will result in at the very least, an influx of proposals from this region. Increasing awareness through education of the opportunities that Project Catalyst provide will most likely unearth a large number of developers, entrepreneurs and think tanks whom were previously oblivious. Add to that, the format of education is a direct and proven copy of the global Catalyst School, who has developed numerous materials on how to submit and create quality proposals. One huge factor that should be taken account also, they will provide all these education in their local language.

Compared to what they tend to achieve, the number of proposer and the duration of work, their budget is a bit low. Again, confused how soo many hi-performing individuals are always submitting low numbers. There seems to be something off with the general Project Catalyst process. Their timetable though is on point because it considers that education is gradual process. Unfortunately, there are no risk and challenge assessment.
