In other words, the objective of disseminating knowledge about our ecosystem would certainly be achieved, I just think that there was still a need to explain better how the dissemination of this channel would be done, how would these videos reach Brazilians? Because it is as important as the content itself to guarantee how it would reach the public, I am Brazilian and I guarantee, almost nothing is known about Cardano or Catalyst around here, a strong dissemination plan is essential to achieve the goal of this project in a good way. successful. Regarding the importance and relevance of creating videos, it is indisputable how necessary and positive they are. I also really liked the fact that the videos are subtitled, both in English and in Portuguese, breaking the barrier that this project would only benefit Brazilians, and also the care that the author takes in intending to make a written version of each video, to further ensure that your content is solidly understood. If the issue of disclosure is highlighted, I believe the impact will be huge and extremely beneficial to our ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately the author provides us with little information about himself; we know that he is part of Escola Catalyst (a project that I admire a lot), his training areas and how he built for the Cardano ecosystem (SPO and translator). However, I felt a lack of detail. How long has he been working in the community, examples of previous work, whether involving our blockchain or not, what is his role in the Catalyst School, and so on. He has attached a website for his pool, which, although I think is still under construction, is very well structured. Another point that needs to be improved would be the question of a script, the author does not inform us which steps would be followed to reach the final goal, we know there are 10 videos and we have an example of one ready, allowing us to visualize what the final result would be. . But it is important that we know how often these videos would be posted, where the written files would be available and above all (in my opinion): how the dissemination plan would be. Blockchain, cryptographic universe and Cardano are subjects far removed from the daily lives of most Brazilians, so let's think of an efficient way to disseminate this content? On the currency division, I believe we have enough information and in a satisfactory level of detail. We know what each part of the funding would be used for. So what I think was missing here was: 1) knowing the frequency of the videos 2) understanding exactly which team would be involved in the project, in addition to the author, there would be translators, design people to assemble the animations, etc., how they would work , how would your remuneration 3) the marketing plan.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think this project is even simple auditability and the author provides us with several ways to monitor the proposal. We know what the contents of each video are, so we could see if they are actually being released like that, that they would be subtitled in Portuguese and English, and that there would be written documents accompanying each production. If we knew the frequency of posts and where the author intends to disseminate this content, we would have even more tools to work on monitoring the project. The author has invested a lot in tracing metrics to measure the success of his proposal, KPIs in various aspects, establishing milestones that he intends to reach with this. We do know the main objective and small goals that allow, in a progressive way, to carry out monitoring. It would also be nice if some Portuguese-speaking community members would follow up and give feedback to the community. So I believe that auditability is the strongest point of this proposal, as the author gives us so much information about it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 14, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea is much valid and certainly can help increase portuguese speakers engagement in Cardano catalyst process. Problem statement and solution are clear. I liked that all the content they intend to create are already stated.\r\nA few point I'd add to the proposal.\r\n1) The great majority of the catalyst content is english. Videos explaining the processes can help the entrance but non-english speakers would still face barries when really getting in contact with proposals or submitting them. Does this project have in its scope any goal to help overcome these further barries? If not I would consider  the true impact of this proposal not very high as a lot of content to cover catalyst process already exist in eglish (-1 start/score)\r\n2) What would be the communication plan within Brazilian (and portuguese native speakers as a whole)? Brazil is a very diverse country and it would be nice to see here what is its target audience, at least at first, and how to increase as it evolve. For instance, the project communication can start in universities of the main cities and evolves to high school students and employees in given sectors. Important to mention that not only the target audience is important but also the channels need to be considered. (-0,5 star/score)\r\n 3) Ive seen a lot of proposals in last fund related to create educational videos in other languages to expand the reach to non-english speakers, very alike this one. It would be great to assess if some synergies could be made with these funded proposals and how to leverage theirs lessons learned (especially in relation to item 1 and 2). In the same sense, a further phase of this project could guide/help other proposers who want to do similar initiative with their language (elaborate a document or video with guidelines, provide some sort of consultancy, so on).\r\n4) Id open some space for interacting with the enviroment created. Have Q&A, maybe in extra videos or in the podcasts, have space to audience propose topics for the videos, receive feedback, and so on. This is easly adjustable with the current proposal, it would just need to add some extra flexibility.\r\n5) Last, regarding the content itself, maybe it will be important, before even speaking about Cardano/catalyst, explain the concept of cripto currencies and blockchain. Understanding this is the foundation of the whole process and one step behind the first episode proposed. (-0,5start/score)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "About the team, it seems to have only one person so far with experience in Catalyst but not clear if experienced in teaching or content creation. In this sense, I'd assume it would be necessary at least two extra people to edit the video and make sure they reach a their educational purpose (and also to add extra hands on scripting, translating, etc) (-1 star/score)\r\nAs for a plan, theres no clear schedule on when it is intended to launch each of the 10 videos (frequency) and how much time each of the steps in content creating it would take. (-1 star/score)\r\nLast, regarding the budget, it is clear and breakdown seems fair.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Good kpis already established. It would be nice to have some targets on them, it could be even targets evolving with time (for instacnce, increase viewers by 10% each month until month X, etc).

(-1 star/score)\r\nAlso, some milestones could be added but for this it would be necessary a more detailed schedule, which the proposal doesn't have. (-0,5 star/score)\r\nNo risk assessment was done. It would be interessting to have risks mapped on video quality, really engaging non english speakers in cardano, not reaching target audience and plans to mitigate them.

There are a growing number of sources to learn of Cardano but non cater to the Portuguese speaking individual. This further adds weight to the alignment of this proposal is to the Challenge. General make-up of the total Portuguese speaking population are also given, which are in the figures of hundreds of millions. These number further justifies this proposal on the basis of potential adoption. On the basis of the populations behavior though is not addressed.

There is also a link to the proposers SPO, though only 4  (four) individuals has delegated to it and only contains a 1K pledge. Perhaps the intent was to show the proposer has skin-in-the-game. Budget is clearly broken down, though some posts are unclear. There is mentioning of a post for text and subtitle. Without further explanation, one could ask; 'What is the point of having text and subtitle, are they not basically the same thing?' Besides this issue, the budget is quite reasonable.
