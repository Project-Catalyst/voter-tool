While this may not be a specific problem to Latin America, it is a widespread issue in the music business, I would agree that if the team can develop a viable way to harness Cardano features, it could be a life-changing solution for the artists and revolutionize the music industry in general. This problem will be solved with a SAAS solution (which is proposed in the DAPPS & integration challenge), and the budget request is for a validation concept of that solution for Latin America. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Though the names mentioned as \"partners\", or \"close contacts\" are very important people, and they can be verified without submitting references. The information presented about the proposer is very limited, which limits the ability to verify the skills and experience described in the proposal. Since the purpose of the budget is for the hiring of high-level music executives in Latin America, I can understand that there is no budget breakdown. The hiring of music executives is expected, and although I cannot guarantee their budget is adequate, I understand that these are values that are handled in that context. At this point, for me there is much risk associated with the proposal's dependence on the funding of other proposal. Therefore, I cannot agree or disagree regarding feasibility at this time. I recommend focusing on the \"Dapps & Integrations\" proposal once you have an MVP and evidence of implementation. I am sure that the community will fully agree to allocate resources for testing the concept not only in Latin America, but also in other regions. \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The author of the proposal mentions that, if funds are allocated, he would immediately contact these executives to make a proposal to validate the concept of the application in Latin America, however, there is no mention of when the community could have the result of this exercise. Based on the main proposal, the first pilot of this application will be completed within 3 months. In that case, I would expect the proponent to wait for the pilot to be successful so that, with an MVP in hand, they can approach the executives and make a formal validation proposal.\u00a0In my opinion, all of these factors make it difficult for the community to track this proposal. It is also mentioned that a metric of success \"could be\" to reach an agreement with one Latin American record label and have them upload their library of content to the application. I would prefer a metric associated with the number of artists onboarded to the application (who have not yet been able to leverage the benefits of platforms like Spotify) as this is more associated with the stated problem. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 12, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "While this proposal has the goal of implementing a music program for individuals to use in latin america, I do not quite understand how this project will attract new members to the cardano community. What are the incentives for users of the new platform to use this program over a reputable established service, such as apple music or spotify? Is there something in it for users that they can't get elsewhere? What can this proposal do to better the lives of the people who use it? If the proposer could address some of these questions, it would greatly strengthen the proposal. (score given: 2)", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has only provided that they have over 20 years of experience in the music industry and that they have a friend managing a big latin american artist. However, this information alone does not give me confidence in the capabilities of the proposer because they did not specify what kind of experience they have with the music industry. Do they know the inner workings of record labels and the streaming business? Additionally, do they have the computer science knowledge to develop a platform for this project? The answers to these questions are not clear in the proposal's current state.\r\n\r\nI also do not know what the breakdown of the funds will be -- they are asking for a big sum of money, so it is important that they provide information on how it will be used.  The proposer could potentially elaborate more on what the executives will do for the project. I understand that they have another proposal in a different challenge, but including some more information on this proposal would help voters better understand this part of the multi-proposal project.\r\n\r\nThere are also not many details in this proposal about the workings of the project. Again, including some information from the other proposal would be helpful for voters.\r\n\r\nOne concern that I have for this proposal is the concept of the charging the wallet a fee per stream. Doesn't this concept punish people who stream more music? If a person were to listen to a significant amount of music and then have to pay a fee each stream, they would effectively drain their wallet of funds. I can't see people getting behind this business model. (score given: 2)", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has provided no good metrics to measure the success of this proposal. I did not notice any KPIs provided in this proposal to help voters have confidence in the project's auditability. I do see that the proposer linked their other proposal that is connected to this one where they listed only one key performance indicator: getting def jam on board. I do not see this as a viable KPI because it is so incredibly variable. One singular KPI that relies heavily on the decision of a group of individuals cannot be a reliable measure of success -- it either succeeds or fails with no possible in between.

However, the proposer makes no point over here regarding the impact it could have on LatAm as a whole. With the likes of Spotify and other huge giants who already allow people to publish their works, the additional impact this particular proposal could bring is not something to look forward to. Moreover, the proposer also makes it clear to have submitted a proposal based on the same application in another challenge, which seems like a better match to the proposal. And how exactly would this Dapp uphold the strength and capabilities of Cardano in particular? And why make a music app that is decentralized? What are the vulnerabilities that the current music apps face having been deployed under conventional networks?

I strongly recommend the proposer provide more details regarding the marketing and publicity approach that requires 30k USD for the community to gain trust and credibility in the project.
