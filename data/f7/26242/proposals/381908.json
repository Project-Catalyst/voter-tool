I think this because: the idea here is to renovate land, that is, work on land giving back its qualities, land that was purchased via token at Cardano. What would benefit the ecosystem in the part of creating new assets in the blockchain, smart contracts and etc, but the amount of funding is too high for only these activities to be done in the ecosystem. In my opinion, the project would need to invest more in giving Cardano a return. I believe that this project would greatly benefit the Latin American location, not only for the act of land renewal but also for the generation of jobs with the project (many employees here would come from Latin America, especially those who do on-site activities). In this regard, there is no doubt. But, as I said, it would be necessary to better measure the return to Cardano, we do not know exactly how many tokens would be generated, how many people would, on average, be attracted to the ecosystem and such details. That's why I think it's not a project that meets very well what was asked in this challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "No information about the team is given. It is a fact that several professionals would work here, as we can see in the expense division part. But who are they? We would need to know each team member individually, names, roles, relationships with the Cardano blockchain, and so on. The more details the better, unfortunately we don't have any details about it here. About the script, I believe it is average, some of the steps are better explained, such as Q1 - 2022, while others, such as Q4 - 2022 are summarized in just one sentence. We know that there is an action plan here, which makes us understand very well what would be done. But it would be interesting if this information were well related to a schedule, that is, that each little part fit into a step of the process, in a temporal and organized way, so that we had a more solid understanding of the whole. And about the financial division, this was the part that left the most to be desired, because the asking price is very high and the parts are not explained. For example, they ask for 50k for a promotional campaign, but they don't explain anything about it. They don't say what type of campaign it would be, the means it would be launched, which target audience, which professionals would work... 50k is often the asking price for an entire proposal, so if they ask for this for just a part of the project, it would be needed a lot of detail. Unfortunately, this part of the proposal leaves a lot to be desired.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The auditability is good, we can do it in several ways. First, by monitoring whether the activities mentioned in the action plan were actually carried out, and in an adequate manner. Second, through impact analysis; they are dedicated to establishing the expected impacts for Latin America. In this regard, it is quite possible to carry out an analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, on the expected results: this could be done both by the Cardano community and by the project team. And finally, some topics are drawn that are directly related to the results and ways of analyzing the proposal (I could say that they are the project's KPIs). In other words, the team gives us several ways to monitor their proposal, but they also need to let us know when the farms are audited by the organic products certification institute. It would be ideal if a report were drawn up with each visit and presented directly to the Cardano community. That said, this is the topic that was best covered in the proposal, in my opinion.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 11, "ng": 7, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea is exceptionally compelling for me, in part because it contains many components that on the one hand correspond to the spirit of Cardano and Catalyst and on the other hand have a strong social / environmental component. The proposal involves tokenizing land in order to enable regrowth of land using proven ecological methods. This will address the issue of farmers not being able to ensure a healthy regeneration of land between harvest seasons. This proposal is very relevant to LATAM as food exports to developed countries represent one of many countries' main sources of income. In addition, I understand how this proposal can encourage new users to join the community. However, I must say that it was not possible to evaluate the alignment of the metrics since they were not included.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team describes in detail the skills and experiences in their web page that was provided as a reference. They have also described achievements with their \"land-management and forest regeneration\" method in previous years, although references would have been helpful to verify these results. An action plan is presented; however, I find it to be very general, which makes it difficult to evaluate its feasibility. Another aspect that could be improved in the proposal is the description of the associated tokenomics. Although there is a brief description of the token utility, it is crucial to provide a detailed description of the logic behind the generation of these tokens for a proposal like this one, which is based on the generation of this economy to contribute to the purchase and regeneration of land. Regarding the budget, I believe it is also imperative that for future Catalyst cycles, the team concentrates its efforts on improving this section. Although it is very positive that the topic has been broken down into identifiable areas, some of them need to be better explained. An example is the line item for \"Developers to launch the token\" which is estimated at $60,000 but does not explain the cost per hour, the number of developers needed, or for how long the developers are needed. Another example could be, the item for \"Promotion campaign\" would be estimated at $50,000, in which case you would have to provide answers to questions such as: How many professionals are you planning to hire? Which methods will be used for promotion? What is the expected result of this promotion? Unfortunately, no answers to these questions are provided. Lastly, I would like to mention another issue with the budget that I find is that actions are described to ensure auditability, but it is not clear whether or not these actions are considered as line items within the budget. Especially periodic audits by external agencies tend to be very costly. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Finally, we arrive at the section regarding auditability, which has its highs and lows. Although some of the milestones described can be confusing, I consider it a positive that it lays out a roadmap until 2024 with details about what can be expected every quarter.  Furthermore, the community will be able to access all the costs associated with the project, including contracts on chain, external audits, and images of what is happening in the farms. There is another aspect of this proposal that can be improved: the description of the success metrics. Although some of the metrics presented can be analyzed, it is necessary to make much more effort in this regard, especially considering that 37% of the budget allocated for this challenge is being requested.
