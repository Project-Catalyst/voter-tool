As I understand it, the project here would consist of drawing up a mapping of the various projects involving blockchain in Latin America. There would be a kind of data collection and analysis, with the objective of understanding in a general way how Latin American investment and entrepreneurship is in relation to blockchain. However, I have some doubts about the usefulness of this. Starting with the fact that at no time, during the description of the proposal, the team quotes Cardano, emphasizes specifically on how our blockchain would be targeted, explains how such research would happen, what kind of data they would analyze, where the results would be presented . I also found it a little confusing to understand what the events they talk about at the end of the proposal are about: \"With this, after each event the status of the activity metric will be shared with Catalyst\". At no point during the proposal description was it explained what these events would be, I imagine they could be conferences with the aim of exposing the research done, but it would be essential that we had full understanding of all parts of the proposal. I also found it a little difficult to understand what the intention of such research would be, the authors claim that they would understand what is missing in the development of projects with the aim of improving them. However, this is quite abstract, each project that involves Cardano has a specific bias, I don't understand how a single group would be able to promote solutions for different types of projects. I think that Latin America would be benefited, while the projects developed there were contemplated with this kind of consultancy, benefiting the people involved and perhaps maximizing the results; the Cardano ecosystem would also benefit if the projects directly involved our currency, our blockchain, NFT and other ecosystem technologies, but as I said before, they don't directly cite Cardano at any time. That's why I think the proposal doesn't seem to bring the impact we're looking for, it doesn't clarify very well how the activities would be carried out, whether the studied content would only be known to the team or there would be some kind of exchange between the entrepreneurs, forming a network of connections. .. There are several doubts.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team provides us with an individualized description of each member so that we can get to know them and understand well what their work is all about. What I missed was, in addition to knowing their names and roles in the project, a brief history of previous work and mainly: how do these professionals relate to the Cardano ecosystem? What are the ways they dialogue directly with our blockchain? Usually in projects we have at least one person who has technical knowledge about our blockchain technologies, but that doesn't happen here. It is positive that there is a person whose role would be to monitor the KPIs and a person specialized in marketing, but it would be essential that there was also someone from the technology area. As such, the team does not convey much confidence in its ability to carry out the project successfully. Regarding the script, here we have the establishment of activities that would be carried out based on the months - but I believe that this part lacked details. Each of these topics could have been explained better, the explanations are very superficial. For example: in the first month, what would happen would be basically a field preparation. Analyze what would be done and how. But who would work on this part, what methodologies do they intend to adopt, what would be the weekly mobilizations? Likewise, there are some doubts regarding the activities developed in the other phases. And about the budget, it's the same: they even provide an explanation, but it's very short. \"Communication, PR and Marketing = $12,400\". Why this value? How much would it go to communication, and to PR, and to marketing? What would be the marketing strategy used? The total amount requested is relatively high, with more than 1/3 destined for this part of the disclosure... it needs more detail to understand what was actually going to happen.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team does not establish direct KPIs that would serve to monitor project success. What we have here is, at the end of the proposal, a somewhat confused explanation about some events (as I said in the first analysis topic, it would be important to understand what they are about: their content, who would participate, where they would happen...) and also on the preparation of a report at the end of 1 year of work. But since we don't know what these events are, no confidence is conveyed that activities would actually be monitored. I think an annual report is a very big thing, it should be done monthly. Since we have a person on the team (Paula) who would work directly with KPI control, I think we could have a more detailed and concrete auditability. In addition to the monthly reports, some type of contact could be made with the teams of the projects that were analyzed. A kind of gathering of feedbacks, in other words, so that we could understand how these consultancies positively impacted their projects, what difference, in practice, the project in question is bringing to the continent. In the reports, it would be essential for the authors to clarify how the activities have specifically benefited our blockchain, as this is somewhat uncertain in all the details of the proposal. In general, I do not agree that this proposal is easily auditable through the information provided, I cannot see direct ways to evaluate the process or the results based on what was presented to us.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 12, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": " Relation to personal qualifications: Since I don't have any direct personal connection to any Latin American country, I can only assess the non Latin America specific parts of this proposal.  I however have an understanding of budgeting, both due to my past engagement as a treasurer in a political organisation and my current work as a project engineer, which will give me a good grasp of realistic budgeting of projects. The proposal clearly identifies a problem within the challenge; the lack of mapping of blockchain ecosystems in Latin America. Changing this will surely aid in the adoption of blockchain and Cardano in those countries and thus be both benefitial to the Cardano Ecosystem and ist users. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. From ist makeup, if done correctly, this project will aid towards scalability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers could be looked up and seem to have credible credentials thus are probably up to the task. The proposers define the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal, however are a bit scarce on the resources beyond that and the exact implementation plan, especially beyond 4 months. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is probably reasonable to achieve the set goals, depending on the scope the research will actually have.\r\nThe proposal offers a quite short timetable and roadmap to complete the work. No risks and challenges, neither regarding general implementation nor the eventual need for additional funding, are discussed. Feedback: mak a detailed implementation plan that considers a longer timeline and possible risks.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Well-defined, metrics and an auditable roadmap are presented that define the success of the proposal.

Theoretically, by having such a resource, it might encourage people to engage and participate. However, I'm not convinced will encourage as much participation as hoped for. As someone with 10+ years in an education/adoption role in a Fortune500 company, resources alone will not translate to action. You need to have a plan in place to activate the resources to get people to act upon that information. I do not see this in this proposal. In fact, there seems to be mention of a lot of research work on 'who' and 'what' and 'how' people know about the ecosystem, when it really ought to be the other way round. That being said, this could have huge global impact for the region if it could be relied on as a resource for not only information on the ecosystem but a searchable way to engage with the right people for any future potential proposer. I'm not sure that this proposal, in its current format, delivers that. \r\n\r\nThis idea has the ability to be scalable to the rest of the global ecosystem.. if the execution was tweaked. \r\n\r\nI worry that voters will not get a clear understanding of what and how the proposer is proposing to deliver change and engagement. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I feel like the resources/spend is out of balance for this proposal. There seems to be a lot of spend on collecting and analysing data from market research, when really, there should be more emphasis on the ecosystem and what exists so that more money/time/resources can be spent on activating that information to encourage participation. Along this thread an interactive system/report would be much more effective in engagement, rather than a static one. $800 dollars/2.6% of the budget allocated to the technology, seems low. Unless that does not include build and maintenance? The proposal isn't clear on this point. The rest of the budget seems reasonable however so perhaps there just needs to be some clarification on this output point. \r\n\r\nThere also seems to be little by way of action plan once the report has been published. I would like to see more detail beyond this point as I feel that's where the community is going to get the greatest return. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While the headline KPIs seem relevant, it would be better to benchmark it against an actual goal. So for number of # of downloads - how many are they aiming for? This will help voters ascertain 1. whether it's an effective use of funds, 2. the ROI and 3. the success of the proposal. I would like to see this for every KPI however, appreciate that their \"TOC\" methodologies probably don't encourage this kind of long-sighted goal setting.
