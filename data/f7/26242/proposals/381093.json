As far as I can understand from the description, I believe the Cardano community in Latin America will greatly benefit from its implementation, since beyond the intention to carry out a series of events , they are also aiming to create a decentralize governance framework that will strengthen the organization while making it sustainable over time. From an impact point of view, I would say tat the metrics are aligned with the challenge. In particular, the one refering to having 100 active LATAM members and supporting the continuation of this challenge in the next 3 funds.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To be successful with this type of proposal, more than having expertise in a particular field, you must also demonstrate a passion for Cardano and Catalyst, and this team has demonstrated that passion. Even so, they managed to condense a good mix of skills and relevant experiences, and although not all of them included references, the majority of them have a high level of recognition in the community, so that was fine with me. Concerning the budget, I would have liked to see a description of the profile of the individuals who will be hired full-time (if it is going to a member of core the team, this should have been specifed), and a description of the tasks that these individuals are expected to perform during the next three months.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is no explicit section that discusses the planned roadmap, however the team describes a number of previously executed activities, as well as the number of events planned for the following year, which, in conjunction with other success metrics, allow the community to evaluate the project's progress. Another element that contributes to auditability is the fact that all activities will be recorded in their GitHub account. A recommendation I would make is that the team not only present an estimate of the number of upcoming events, but also a calendar of the dates on which these events will occur, and make it available to the community.\u00a0\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal seeks to bring a powerful decentralized alliance of organizations, projects, governments and people together with the aim of driving adoption of Cardano and its opportunities among the 33 countries in Latin America (LATAM).

By proposing a general governance of the Latam Catalyst community, it aims to reach out to the community of stakeholders, but also to engage the ambassadors of Cardano and thus generate collaborations between the communities and promote Cardano and Catalyst adoption in Latam.
