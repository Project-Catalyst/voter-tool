It would be beneficial if the proponents explained in detail what bootcamp is, I didn't know the concept before and had to research it, but it was still a bit confusing. In theory this is a very good thing, because it would benefit 3 very important topics: 1) generation of employment opportunities for Latin American women, responding directly to the objectives of the challenge. 2) new people to work with and spread the Cardano ecosystem. 3) would help fill the gap of women in the ecosystem, which is easily noticeable. However, some details left something to be desired in this proposal. Proponents promise some things but don't really explain what they would be like. For example, what country would these women be from? In which language would these teachings be taught? How would the selection process take place? Would the course be completely free? Who would this specialist in psychology be, and how would she accompany the 30 selected women? How would this community support happen? In my view, some very important questions are left open, undermining our understanding and confidence in the project's impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The bidders are a couple who have some important information about who they are. The details about Daniel are extremely complete, as we were not able to get to know Maria do Carmo that well, with regard to the information given in the proposal. However, this project needs a series of other professionals involved. Although they claimed that they would partner with the NGO Laboratoria, we do not know who from the NGO would work on the project and in what roles. Would it be necessary for us to have more certainty about, for example, would there be people specialized in teaching here? Who would be the psychologist, who would do the marketing, the design? A better understanding of the other participants would be needed, the proponents were. No roadmap is given, so we don't know how long this project would be developed, through which phases, how long each thing would take, in what order they would happen and why, etc etc. It is not possible to have a preview of the process. And about the funding: it's a very high amount, 70k to teach 30 women! Although there is an explanation of how this money would be used, it is very superficial. For example: 5k to advertise the bootcamp. Why this value? And how would that announcement be made? Another 5k for sealing. Again: why so much? What kind of selection is this and why does it require so much money involved? In the same way, the other topics should have been better detailed. Overall, both the team, the script and the budget division leave something to be desired.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Some KPIs are provided that would help to monitor the results, ie whether what was promised was actually delivered. The first KPI doesn't make sense to me: \"knowledge: 0 to 5,000 talented women in tech aware of Cardano Bootcamp\". How would that be measured? It's a very complicated statistic to define. The others make sense and are good. However, as there is no roadmap, there is also no deeper way to follow the actual development of the project. If we knew the steps to be taken, it would be possible to establish sporadic contact with the proponents and monitor whether these activities were actually being carried out on time and in the planned manner. Therefore, I think it is possible to establish an auditability, but only in relation to the final product and not to the process, which is equally important.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 17, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Women are under-represented in the Ecosystem, and the proposal aims to improve that. I believe this is relevant for the community because diversity in any organization promotes factors such as creativity, better decision making, flexibility, respect, and improved brand image. From what they described, their solution would involve conducting a Bootcamp with Laboratoria for 30 women in Haskell and Plutus, which aligns with what the challenge is looking for. I particularly like how they rely upon the experience of such an NGO that has already worked with similar projects and also has a base of developers. Their goal is to have 30 female graduates by November 2022. Would it be interesting to know what the profile of the selected women would be, and from which countries these women hail? And what criteria will be used to select them? It would be interesting to know how they will capitalize on the knowledge acquired by the first cohort of graduates. Will they become part of the educational staff in the future? Mentoring could also be provided for the development of future proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal does a great job describing the characteristics of the two leaders of the project. Daniel and Maria manage to combine skills and experiences that combined with a partner like LABORATORIA, make a very strong team. For this project it is essential to have a deep knowledge of Haskell or Plutus, which from what I understand will be the mentors they are planning to hire. So the cherry on the cake for this proposal would be to have someone on the team or as a partner with such experience, however, I believe that there are many people in the community who can join this initiative. A detracting element regarding feasibility is the way in which the budget was described mostly because even thoug it was broken down into identifiable items, it would have been of great value to present the hourly cost of the professionals to be hired.Also, I am missing a description of the potential risks or challenges of implementation. Given the self-paced nature of this bootcamp method, I identified a critical risk: dropout rate. As a result, it would have been beneficial if the team had included in the proposal actions to reduce or counteract this risk.  \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With regard to auditability, the team has provided a successful description. There is a roadmap in 5 phases, which I consider to be well explained, and enables the community to understand what will happen at each stage of the implementation process. Also described are five indicators of success that can be used to evaluate whether the project is having a positive impact at every stage of implementation. I have no other words but to congratulate you for such a thoughtful proposal and I wish you a lot of success. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Latam Women Cardano Plutus Bootcamp as a proposal would have an impact to the community as it would help the community to grow its diversity within the Latam region. It's aligned with the challenge by providing an opportunity for more people, particularly women to get trained to program for Cardano stack.\nDiversity has an effect to the numbers (people involved and trained) and scalability (expansion), and this experience if successful would be a reference to the Cardano community in other regions of the world, where this approach would be replicated to allow more women get involved.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is formed by two people who have experience in IT for one, and the other one has been involved with the Catalyst for a long time now.

The proposal is well aligned with the challenge objective. It could have been good to show and explain how it will scale over time, maybe include a potential revenue model (investing in students becomes more and more popular from other projects I am working on), and show how the graduates will be integrated into the Cardano ecosystem (how many of the 800 companies mentioned are related to Cardano?). The budget is quite significant so I believe more info re the course and placement post-course will be important to evaluate the impact.

It will have been great to share more details about the course even starting with the syllabus.  More info about the selection process and candidates would also be helpful. The roadmap is clear and reasonable. Missing some risks and challenges assessments.
