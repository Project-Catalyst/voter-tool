Indeed, theres a lack of courses on this subject in portuguese, to Brazilian students, and the Syllabus seem very robust.This is well defined in problem statement and solution proposed is reasonable, fitting within the challenge.\r\nA Few points of questions/to consider:\r\n1) I understood this course will be fully online. It is great because it has a greater reach. if it would be in person however, a stronger Brazilian community/network could be built among lecturer and students. I'd consider having at least a few sessions online. By the way, it could be clearer if there will be more than 1 sessions per year of if its going to be a single one.\r\n2) I loved this course will be free to studentsnts. This make the proposal much inclusive! However, no selection criteria is stated here (wheter if its going to be by qualigication, family total income, etc). Anyway, I'd dedcate at least a few slots to low income/poor students, specially in the favelas regions. This would be in line with UNs #04  and 10 SDG which is being nowadays much appreciated in projects and organizations to help decrease inequality.\r\n3) Id also develop more in the proposal the communication plan. If the intent is taking blockchain knowledge for those who dont know about it, a communication plan to reach people outside this world is very important. I'd include in the plan campaings in the universities, schools and offer this to companies. it should be both online and \"offline\".", "q0r": 5, "q1": "one person, already committed, with teaching experience and knowledge in blockchain seems to be enough to run this project.\r\n\r\nThe plan is clear and distribuited in the months.\r\n\r\nTheres a budget breakdown through the project phases/months, which is good, but more details on how the money is going to be used would be good. For instance, how much it is going to pay the lecturer only ? how much it is going to be used to ellaborate the material for the course? how much to aquire the tools (mic, computer, camera, softwares)?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are some metrics but some of them are poorly defined (for instance, student feedback itself cant be a metric, it should be better defined, as numer of positive feedbacks - consider even creating a NPS on this. The same for exams results).\r\nThey also dont have time-related targets, which would be essential to follow up with project evolution.\r\n\r\nThe kpis in the plan arent really kpis - they are more activities of the project schedule. Some of them milestones at maximum - points in time with 0 duration - as the \"Course closing\"  but they could be highlighted here.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo risk management was done. Id include as risk not reaching target audience (or not enough audience) or poor course quality.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 10, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "As a Brazilian, I can confirm that there is a lack of these courses around here. The proposal seems to fit in the challenge, making Brazilian students, which are very creative, aware of Cardano. However, I have some points to add: 1) I've seen that you are a professor in UFPE. Are you thinking about having just and online branch or are you interested in having some students from UFPE as well? This may have impact in the extent of people you reach; 2) How much is it going to cost? Since you are a professor in a Federal University, you know that we have several brilliant students but with a very low income, some of them having several problems to access the classes during this COVID situation. Therefore, if it is overpriced you won't have a great number of people attending it; 3) I imagine that, in order to keep this project going, you will charge for these classes and make it running, however I would like to see it more explicit;", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is well written and I have no doubt that a Professor with such curriculum willing to pass this knowledge beyond will be capable of conducting this proposal. However, I've some considerations: 1) The budget could be more detailed; 2) I would like to see more money addressed to marketing \u2013 to reach more people; 3) It needs a more clear approach about continuity: are you going to charge, how much, if not, what are you going to do if you do not get funded, etc;\r\n\r\nThere is a huge risk associated with costs/attendance here that should be considered and it must have a focus on the feedbacks (positives and negatives) in order to be successful.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I'm missing some real metrics here: # of attendance, # positive feedback, maybe # of proposals submitted by the students after the course, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides that, the roadmap and the budget seem fair.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 4, "ng": 14, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal 100% addresses the main goal of this Challenge effectively.

The perfect vessel to further the word of Cardano. Initially I had questions regarding how will this proposer acquire the materials on Cardano for it seems the proposer is quite new to the community. Sure enough though, the LATAM Cardano community came in numbers to support the proposer with all the materials they needed. These interactions are recorded in the comments section.

The 3 (three) month timetable to implement this proposal is clear and has an adjoining detailed action plan that further ensures confidence all goals set by the proposer will be achieve.

There is a link from LinkedIn which gives us additional security or not security in the ability to implement this great idea. The knowledge, skills and knowledge of Cardano blockachain do not stand out on both links that are placed in the proposal. Perhaps the lecturer himself will learn through the lecture what is the best school for both the one who teaches and the one who listens to the lecture. The budget is clearly presented but in my opinion $2500 per presentation with preparation of the presentation is unreasonable. These are too high costs per presentation. The plan is well developed but no risks are covered or mentioned. What if students do not come to the lecture or a small number come or the lecturer does not have the necessary skills to deliver the knowledge? One-month lectures are the perfect time frame for the realization of this idea because the lecturer has plenty of time to organize and prepare.
