First, it would like to create digital certification using Atala PRISM in collaboration with their ministry of education. The applications that would like to be developed, might be useful in other parts of the world and could be copied. Second, this proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by implementing Atala PRISM technology and therefore increase the adoption in the local community (Chaco Province, Argentina). (Rating given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It would be great if the proposer could include the LinkedIn profiles of their core team member. I have checked their website (ECOM Chaco SA) & company LinkedIn profile. It's quite valid. I would like to know if some of their members are part of the 1st cohort Atala PRISM Pioneer Program or not. If not, maybe they could try to participate in the 2nd cohort of Atala PRISM Pioneer Program to get some knowledge on the SDK & get support from IOG Team. \n\nThe budget and number of man power are well described in the Google Sheet. The requested fund is acceptable for this challenge; actually they could ask more considering the scope. On the other hand, the proposal is missing on detail technical road map, such as: what will they build/deliver each month. For example: UI/UX, backend, and end-product, instead of only saying \"15.000 Educational Certificates generated in the first 3 months\".\n\nThe proposal also missing conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how. I would like to know what programming language that they will use, how they will connect with the Atala PRISM Node, and maybe adding some simple chart for explanation how their application will work in general. Furthermore, the proposer has not considered challenges and risks that they will face during implementing the project if funded. It's quite helpful for community, to know what are the risks/challenge that might appears during the implementation. (Rating given: 3)", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I could not find any KPI/metrics in this proposal. Adding a KPI that could be easily tracked by the community will add more auditability. Another point, maybe the proposer could add GitHub or any link, so that the community could track the progress of the development or product. \n\nMaking the roadmap more detail with specific milestones could give the Cardano community better understanding what will the project achieve every month. In conclusion, the progress of this proposal is quite hard to assess by the community without those additional information.

The idea is to create a system, in Spanish, where people who have digital certificates can interact and take advantage of Atala Prism decentralized identity technologies. This would certainly benefit both the certificate holders, that is, inhabitants of the Latin American continent, providing them with all the advantages that our decentralized identity system can offer; how much would be great for Cardano once a number of new users would be integrated. This is interesting because a kind of migration would occur, that is, people who do not necessarily know Cardano and believe in blockchain would have contact with Atala Prism without necessarily having to be \"convinced\" to do such a thing, believe in its benefits, etc. As the Cardano blockchain is something relatively new and not very well known, especially in the place in question (Latin America), a large part of the work is often getting people introduced to the ecosystem and educating them about its various advantages. Since the target audience here is already involved in another system of digital certificates, the migration would take place in a more organic way and without the need for great disclosure. This for me is a positive point and a more practical way to bring new users to Cardano - through a migration, and that will certainly make new people stay and maybe even recommend Atala Prism to acquaintances. For these reasons I will give it a maximum score in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It's a little difficult to understand in a deep way who are involved here. We know that this is a company with state participation, Ecom Chaco. We also know that there are about 15k certificates that they have already generated, coming from students in the Argentine province to which they belong, and that these certificates are stored in 3 different locations. However, it is not possible to know the specifics of those who work at Ecom Chaco. Who are the professionals and what exactly would they do in this project? How are your work routines? Among all those involved in Ecom Chaco, who would work on this project? Unfortunately, the idea we have of the company is very general. It would be more interesting if individual information about each person involved in the proposal were made available. This would certainly increase the degree of trust in their work, because as it stands we don't know how they would be able to bridge the gap between their company and Cardano. In the spreadsheet available, we were able to know that there would be 9 professionals involved, from various areas, including two blockchain developers. But it is not possible to understand if they already have people defined for each position or if they would still be selected. Ideally, they would be presented, as I said earlier, mainly blockchain developers - how to ensure that they have the technical capacity to integrate Atala Prism here? A suggestion too: subtitle the attached video, which is in Spanish, most CAs, vCas and Catalyst voters don't understand the language. About the roadmap, it is quite superficial, the only thing we know is how many certificates are intended to generate per quarter. But it would be essential to understand which small tasks would be performed monthly in order to obtain such products. It is not possible to understand the process, only the expected results. Unfortunately this isn't much of a script. And about the budget, unfortunately I found it confusing. The attached spreadsheet has a total of (approximately) more than 4 million, I believe in Argentine pesos, which converted would be approximately 24k dollars. But it would be better if they paste a caption clarifying this conversion. Furthermore, it is possible to clearly understand how the money would be used, basically, it would be the salary of the professionals involved, divided in a time by months. In summary: on staff and script I think an improvement is needed, but on the budget, just a clarification in relation to currency conversion was what I thought was necessary.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, it is not possible to audit this proposal, at least I don't see any clear ways. The authors do not have any information regarding how to monitor the development of the project. The only thing that comes close is that they tell us how many certificates are expected over time. So it's the only way to monitor - was that amount generated? But this is very shallow. They do not establish KPIs, that is, ways to directly monitor whether the promised results were achieved or not. As there is also no roadmap, there is no possibility of monitoring whether the proposed activities are actually being developed and in an adequate manner. Basically, everything we are told in the proposal is: what would be done, how much money each professional would receive monthly and the number of digital certificates expected to be generated each quarter. This makes it possible to track only a quantitative facet - it was also critical to look at things in a more qualitative way. In general, it is not clear how this integration with Atala Prism would be. I suggest that the authors elaborate KPIs, clarify more about such a bridge between what they already do and Cardano, and a specific roadmap of tasks to be accomplished. With this, qualitative ways of auditing the project would be generated.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 26, "ne": 17, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "It is the objective of the project team to develop its own interface with ATALA Prism which will be implemented in a region of Argentina. Specifically, they are looking for a way to validate digital identities and documents for educational institutions. They plan to issue 50,000 document certificates within the next 12 months. In addition to being of great value for Latin America, this would also be yet another successful application for Cardano in the implementation of DIDs. The alignment with this challenge's objective is evident to me.  \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Positively, the team submitted a file containing a detailed explanation of the budget items. Analyzing these figures, I only have a doubt that the same amount is allocated to the front-end developer and to the blockchain developer. I would appreciate it if the team had addressed this concern. Unfortunately, the team fails to provide all of the necessary information to assess the feasibility of the project. For future Catalyst cycles, I would suggest several improvements: (1) Although a reference to an operating company is included, it is necessary to provide information about the individuals who will be participating directly in the project as well as references to verify their abilities. It is important that this information be included in the proposal. (2) It is noted that this company has participation in the state of Chaco. However, I consider it necessary to provide references where this claim can be independently verified; (3) It is essential that a concrete implementation plan be presented which provides a clear indication of what will be required to successfully complete this project.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team presents a roadmap that includes milestones at 3, 6 and 12 months along with 15,000, 30,000 and 50,000 certificates generated as success metrics.
