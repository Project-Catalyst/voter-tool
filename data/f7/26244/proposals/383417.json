The English-speaking population across the globe is only about 20%. To tap into this other 80% which certainly has ample potential would be a mammoth task. This problem statement is met with a beautiful solution in the above proposal, where a multilingual platform is provided with multiple languages for non-English speaking people to get a hang of Cardano and blockchain. The existence of a \"Beta\" version of the same provides the community with more confidence. This proposal could lead to a lot more contributions to the Cardano chain and in turn driving forward its extent across the globe. The infusion of non-English members into the network needs immediate attention and this proposal seems to do the trick to a fair extent. This platform could bring businesses and developers together nourishing a huge number of new collaborations and relations worldwide.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal comes with a detailed action plan and the provision of the \"Beta\" version already available could provide the team with the required trust of the community. The milestones and success definition at the end of 3 and 6 months do not seem to be a overestimate, and the team put together can be seen to have the essential skillset in order to drive this proposal forward towards a fruitful destination. The fund requested also appears to be doing justice and does not consume a large portion of the total funds which provides a lot more proposals to be funded. The mention of the need for further funds during F8 shows that the proposal has long-term plans and wants to take it stage-wise, which has to be commended.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As wonderful as the initiative is, the well-defined metrics make it even more intriguing. The proposer makes a clear mentioning of the measurable KPIs such as the increase in businesses onboarded, increase in people opening ADA wallets, numbers of developers introduced to the ecosystem. These metrics are essential indicators to track the acceptance of the platform and its impact. In addition to these, the 6 month KPIs which hope to onboard 1000+ members, 60+ hubs and many more will be clear indicators of success for the auditors to consider. The introduction of a new token 'GERO' seals the deal. Hence, the provided KPIs are plenty and apt for easy monitoring of the implementation and the overall success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 13, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Dear CA 751, Thank you for reviewing our proposal, much appreciate. Best regards, Carl, Lisa & Dave"}, {"q0": "I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge because it aims to build a huge hub with 60 languages translated for non-speaking English users. Its goal is to be the single resource for Cardano and Catalyst information delivered in a multilingual interface. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- Since the solution was written using AI to translate 60 languages, I can't find any specific AI technology will be used in the proposal. \r\n- $2000 for hiring people translate the website into 60 languages is practically low. \r\n- The proposal should give some more exposure of sources to collect information about Cardano/ Catalyst to translate from.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Roadmap with milestones is the best part of this proposal since it's clear and detailed.\r\nKey metrics to measure success haven't been filled. \r\nKPIs after 6 months launching 60 language-hub with just 4 members/ hub is a humble figures. \r\nTherefore, I think the team should work more on the proposal.

So the entire platform can be accessed by 60+ Language Speakers. The 60 human translated pages, will be single landing pages for each language, in the first phase we will only human translate 60 pages only. The sources of information are being published on the platform. Regarding the 6 month target, we believe it is better \"to under promise & over deliver\", best regards, Carl Henry"}, {"q0": "This proposal is extremely well presented and align with multiple aspects of the challenge: Increased participation from Technical, non-technical people individuals aswell as  companies/organised groups. The Beta version of the platform should be a great confidence builder for voters. Demonstrating a truly global platform with translation in multiple languages. The proposer has gone above an beyond what one would normally see from a prototype. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A relative modest budget ($9636) has been requested taken in context of the overall challenge fund ($350k) & compared to other proposals in this challenge. The commitment shown by the proposer to date develops trust and the very detailed budget breakdown look reasonable (I validated the translator costs and timelines against fiverr.com). Named resources have been identified although these are not verifiable, ideally the proposer could have added linkedin profiles to the budget lines. The proposal also provides a vision of the future , ie a DAO, supported by it own native token. This will be part of a Fund 8 proposal.\nI can see the hub becoming a great resource for non-technical individual and business. My only feedback to the proposer would be to put some focus on onboarding developers and understanding what they actually want or need from this service.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timelines provided are sensible (as described in feasibility note) therefore the auditability of the deliverables is straightforward, ie build the website with translation and pathways for the 3 target groups.\nMeasuring the value this service adds to the ecosystem could do with some further work. The proposal has a target of onboarding 1000+ new members in 6 months. This should be achievable based on the outreach the proposer seems to have. Breaking this down and providing targets for each of the 3 target groups would have made the metric more specific and the proposer could then have explained how they will market to each of these groups.
