According to the team, there is a lack of philosophical discussion about Cardano, so there is an entire segment of the population we are not reaching. In order to address this problem, they propose that people build and promote discussion about blockchain and Cardano in communities such as \"Philosophy in Pubs (PIPs)\". I find this extremely interesting, since in this case the community has been established with a robust organization and the purpose of this proposal is to introduce the entire blockchain universe from a philosophical standpoint. The objective and metrics of this proposal are aligned with those required by the challenge. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I have nothing but praise for the team. Each point is addressed in detail. The project is led by two very well known and committed community members. Despite this, there is an excellent description of skills and experience as well as links for verifying them. The level of detail provided in the \"project detail\" section provides the community with an understanding of the implementation steps involved. There is also a high level of detail in the descriptions of the budget items, addressing all aspects of the budget. Finally, the team describes an entire section that indicates what risks are identified at the time, as well as the countermeasures to reduce or eliminate them. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are five phases identified in the proposal, with an estimated close in December of 2022. From the description provided, we are able to understand what will be taking place during the project implementation. The success metrics were also described, which were accompanied not only with a description of the metric but also with a prediction of the timeframe for achievement. As an aspect of improvement, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there are some metrics that could be improved as they are very general, which makes it difficult to measure, for example, \"Building sustainable and lasting connections between catalyst and PIPs\" What does this mean?, and how can the community audit this metric?, another example would be \"Increased awareness of Cardano in as many as 30 other communities\" What does the team understand by \"increase awareness\"?Lastly, another element that confuses me is that both of these metrics mentioned have an assigned time frame of \"after 12 months\". It is difficult to know when the team expects to achieve these success metrics.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 17, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea is good (outside the box, I would say) and the proposal is very well strcutured.\r\nDeveloping the tools and \"evangelizing\" are usually the main drivers in the proposals but discuss social and philosophical implicantions of new technology should be as important as. It allow us to see it in a more critical points of view and grasp both the positive sides and its drawbacks (as every technology has), bringing even better proposals in the future, that could potentially address bad implications.\r\n\r\nI liked it will be translated in other language, a whole set of content (toolkit) will be available for those who also want to learn in its own country/city andthar  the idea is to expand it to other cities in the UK, which combined amplifies proposal impact.\r\n\r\nAs minor suggestion, I'd have included the number of people they intend to engage, at least in the face to face meetings or the number of people that usually attend the regular PIPs sessions\r\n\r\nAll in all, the proposal does address the challenge, engaging and scaling up local commmunities, possibly bringing new members, and has a potential to raise different and fruitful discussions.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Theres an already committed team with experience in such acitivities proposed.

My only point is that it seems quite an expesive project.\r\n\r\nIn a summary, projects does seem feasible with a sensible plan, clear budget allocation and a team with required capabilitiesand experience to make the bridge between phisophy and Cardano. Its imporant to mention though that the engagement of the PIPs are essential for this project - but that is clearly a challenge mentioned and mitigated in the risk management", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project has really good time-framed KPIs with target which helps to evualuate the progress as it evolves and have a reference wheter success was achieved or not. Some milestones can also be extracted from the timeline proposed.\r\n\r\nThe risk management part is really well done with the main risks mapped and a mitigation strategy in place. \r\nI confess when I started to read the proposal my main concern was that the PIPs may not engage with this project and that would ruin everything here.

Plus, the contribute of these new commers will be great since everything need to have philosophy base to develop sustainablely.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal presents well the team has skill in peer facilitator and community engagement.
