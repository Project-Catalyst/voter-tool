The proposer has identified a problem that clearly fits into the challenge. The Community hub that will be built will help the introduction of cardano and the blockchain technology in general, to the local community. This can add massive value to the cardano ecosystem as many profiles, such as developers, community advisors, to say the least, can join and participate  in the growth of the cadano chain.I think that once a successful implementation of this project is achieved, scaling will be a matter of opening similar projects. This project has been written in a clear and concise way.(Rated 5)\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It's quite clear to me that this project has really high chances of a successful implementation, based on skills and evidence provided by the proposer. Wada is a reputable organisation that has conducted a lot of good projects in the cardano ecosystem. That alone can increase the confidence in the feasibility of this project. But the proposer has  managed to add details about the team needed, and an understandable budget breakdown. Since I can't verify the prices, my judgment on the budget is purely based on my intuition. Nevertheless, I didn't identify a plan in case additional funding is needed for this proposal. I think it can be a good improvement of this proposal. But, a detailed plan of the project has been provided in addition to the way they intend to achieve it and the resources needed as well. Nevertheless, I'll recommend to the proposers to add the challenges and risks they may expect upon successful implementation of the project.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is a highly detailed and auditable project according to the informations provided by the proposers. The roadmap provided in the proposal and the milestone are reasonable based on my intuition. The Metrics and KPIs that define the success of this proposal will be easy to measure in the future.

The proposal identifies an important problem within the challenge which by adressing it, will provide training opportunities in a new region that will bring great benefits to the Cardano Network and the local people. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community.

The problem is how to promote underprivileged students in Ghana to receive a modern-oriented education.

So I appreciate the feasibility of the proposal.\r\nThe proposal gives many reasons to choose Nalerigu to implement this proposal, demonstrating the professionalism and dedication of the proposer to the project. The proponent has done a lot of background work and thought through the ideas that underlie the proposal, which adds to the feasibility of the proposal. In addition, there are detailed plans, and specific goals are set, that bring about the successes that this group has achieved.

Nalerigu is a growing community that currently lacks acces to basic ICT services and this project aims to address that. \r\n\r\nThis project is aligned with the challenge and helps to educate non-English speakers and onboard new users that would otherwise experience barriers of access (such as language) to the opportunities provided by Cardano. The project is focussed in Ghana locally however the WADA group are running a number of initiatives across Africa and it's likely the emergence of these projects and their success stories would lead to some pilot projects that could be implemented in other emerging economies throughout the world. There's also capacity for well organised initiatives and community hubs such as this to attract greater investment and grow in size that way. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The WADA team in Ghana have demonstrated a track record of delivering locally focussed projects aimed at improving outcomes for youth in their region. They have run several meetup events and hackathons already and have an established reputation within the Cardano community. Given this it's likely this project will succeed. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan is to set up a space with required utilities. Within 3-6 months the ICT hub will be up and running with recurring events designed around the needs of community. The budget is really detailed and timeline is similarly detailed. The project plan is really clear. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes an evaluation strategy for how the community can audit the progress of the project. The issue with the deliverables is that most of them are future based outcomes as a result of the opportunity being delivered, and are somewhat opaque as a result. It might be better to tie the KPI's directly to deliverable outcomes from this project eg. Completion of build ICT Hub in Nalerigu or Delivery of ICT training and Cardano workshops to X number of young people in Nalerigu. There are some metrics along this line but again they aren't quantified.\r\n\r\nIdeally a project like this would have direct employment outcomes locally, so measuring the number of jobs this funding would create now would be advantageous, rather than looking at future potential employment data. \r\n\r\nThat said, collecting data into the future and keeping track of and documenting the impact of a project such as this would assist in attracting additional support and funds from outside of Catalyst and Cardano community, which would widen the scope of understanding as to what it is that Cardano is achieving.

Nonetheless, the budget component spells out motivations trainees who will be assessing the facility, but has not clarified how there will be sustained funding for the project. For instance, will trainees pay for receiving training? If not how will the training be sustained? How will the project fund refreshments as motivation for trainees always? How will the facility be maintained if need be if trainees are not paying? So next time clarity should be made on project continuance or sustenance.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer outlines a road map for the project which is great. Metrics are also outlined which will help measure success or else failure of the project which is also great. The proposed solutions will impact the target community greatly. But I think what is lacking is the expected impact per stipulated period. For instance, if the project is successfully running, within what period do we expect job creation, and how many jobs withing the period? At what period can it measure the impact of the project and what will be the key milestones per period? I also missed out on expected difficulties and how to mitigate those difficulties.
