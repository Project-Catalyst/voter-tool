The goals and end product of this project has a deep humanitarian foundation, aiming to create equal opportunities for people around the world who does not have the same privileges as many others. A concept which is (in my experience of the Cardano Community) very much aligned with the core values of Cardano. The problem statement clearly focuses on a set of 400 marginalized individuals and aims to give them education, potentially providing a better future for them. What that entails is a little bit unclear in the description of the proposal, even though some parts are very tangible. For example, providing internet, educational material, teachers, the creation of a digital hub is crystal clear. But the curriculum and what this education includes could be further specified. As a teacher I would love to have seen an example curriculum included in the description. At the moment, I am unsure if the educations goals are to teach the participants how to learn functional programming, or how to write a cartoon series. This would optimally be described in the detailed plan in order to increase the comprehensibility of the proposal and project. Overall, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It would benefit the proposal greatly to have some information about the core team within the proposal. If the Kenya government ministry of youth is involved (along with ICT education advisor for girl education challenge program), it speaks of substantial credibility and competency in following the project to completion as intended. Sadly, there is not evidence that can further verify those claims in the proposal. At least regarding the core team members, it would be nice to see some provided links (LinkedIn profiles, earlier affiliate projects, etc) that could verify the competency of the team. Included in the attachments is a superb table of the budget allocation, which is one of the best I've seen so far in the last two funds as a Community Advisor. It is reasonable and detailed. Explaining the details of the curriculum and the actual education would also provide necessary clarity (in order for us to understand the project better) in the proposal (as mentioned under 'impact'). I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal includes a clear roadmap in the form of an excel sheet (provided in the attachments) and even though I would've liked a bit more detail in the different milestones it tells the reader what it aims to achieve during what timeframe. There are several KPIs presented in a structured and chronological way, but here it would also be beneficial to provide more detail on each KPI. By adding a few numbers, it would possibly increase the clarity of the proposal. For example, is the project targeting the same 400 people? In that case it would be clearer to present each measurement of success as part of the roadmap milestones instead of under the KPIs. I might be misinterpreting the information, but to me it is unclear if the project aims to find 400 new participants after each KPI-milestone. If the proposal also included a short text on some potential challenges that could arise during the development of this project, it would increase the trust me as a Community Advisor have for the teams credibility and competence in carrying this project through. Also, there could be some links to social channels included in order for the community to be able to follow the progress of the project.

However, the information required to make a full assessment of the feasibility aspect of the project is still lacking. The proposal leader is described briefly in terms of his or her skills and experience, but no references are provided to verify these statements. The team has attached the budget, and after evaluating the items included, I must admit that I believe most of them to be appropriate except perhaps for the Plutus programmer. It is stated that $2600 will be allocated, but I am not sure what the role of the person will be. Is the person responsible for training the girls directly? If so, how much does each hour of training cost? Another aspect that I have missed here is the description of the risks that may threaten the successful implementation of this proposal. For instance, what is the expected dropout rate? And what measures is the team contemplating to reduce this risk?\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The success metrics provided seem appropriate to the team's expectations (even though they are not conforming to the criteria for the challenge as noted in the impact section).

What worries me a little is that the theory is perfect, but I don't really understand how that would be done in practice. It is not detailed in the proposal things like: what content of these workshops; in which schools (or universities, but I believe schools - which would also be a problem, because this type of teaching is a little difficult and advanced for those in elementary and high school. who are already dependent on the world of technologies, at least ); who would give these classes, how would the training of professionals be carried out; how often these classes would take place; how success would be measured, that is, how common taught women get inserted into the Cardano ecosystem, so as to measure the proposed benefits for the blockchain... Too many details. I'm also a little worried because it's such an ambitious idea to introduce the blockchain into a community that, unfortunately, gives so few opportunities to study and work for women. Maybe it would be more important to guarantee primary education to then invest in something more specific, you know? It worries me if this idea, despite being wonderful in theory, in practice is viable for the current situation in which these women find themselves. It is indisputable how we need to invest in their education, but I don't know if that would be the way at the moment.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, we have almost no information on this research topic. Starting with the team, we don't know who they are, what they do, what their relationship is with the Cardano ecosystem, a small curriculum of what they did before, because they would be qualified to execute this project, in particular. It would be important to present them individually, to say their names, maybe their social media profiles and all that information I mentioned. Nor is anything said about how the financing money would be used. Why 30k? It would be necessary to understand what kind of expenses this would cover: teachers' salaries, their qualifications? Space rental? Transport and food for students? A monetary incentive to take the course? Disclosure costs...? There is no way for us to understand the need for such financing if nothing is explained to us. And about the script, we also don't have any kind of division of stages, phases that together would result in the project completed and the objectives achieved. It would be important that we were informed which activities would be carried out, in which order, by whom and why (and that each one was properly detailed). Unfortunately, the author of the proposal spends a lot of time explaining why the project would be important and what the expected results are, but does not explain at any point the process that would lead to this. We have a very superficial notion of what would happen based on the expected results: the organization of classes, teacher training, contact with students and so on. But without the exhibition of activities, there is no way to visualize the development of all this.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "This is without a doubt the most complete part of the proposal. Many KPIs are enumerated so we have plenty of information to understand what is being expected and details of possible outcomes. This makes the proposal easily auditable because there is content to be monitored. It would be even better if there were a detailed roadmap here (that way we could analyze the process, not just the end) and also a budget breakdown so that we could monitor whether the money was being used as promised. I believe it would be essential for the team to partially present the results to the community. I think this is because there are numerous KPIs, so it would not be advisable to measure everything at once. Here we do not have a temporal notion of how long this project would take to develop as a whole, but we could think, for example, of a monthly follow-up from the community to the project, together with the team. It would also be interesting if, for example, the results of these teachings in the lives of young women were evaluated. Did they get opportunities from the project? How was the impact? This information could be organized and reported to the rest of the community, through Town Hall, for example. If successful, this project would be achieving many of the Cardano ecosystem's objectives: it would bring people together around the subject (forming a hub), bring new members to the community (which relates to the challenge of f6 \"value on boarding\") and also would benefit Africa (meeting the challenge of f5 and f6 \"grow Africa, grow Cardano).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This seems to be a meaningful idea to the world community in general, and the blockchain community in particular.
