Although these arguments are valid, they may not be applicable in all situations. The team plans to address this issue by creating an innovative version of \"hub\" with the main feature of mobility, where the focus will be on onboarding processes for individuals who are completely new to this technology. Likewise, I consider both the problem and the solution to be pertinent, as well as the success metrics that are being proposed to be both suitable and in line with what this challenge is seeking. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA has consistently and successfully provided value to the community throughout its history. Josh is the leader of the organization. References to his LinkedIn profile are provided, however no details are provided regarding the team assigned to this proposal. There is also a detailed description of the implementation plan, which allows you to understand the required actions. The team then breaks the budget down into 5 identifiable components. However, I must admit that from my perspective a greater effort could have been made. As an example, regarding the \"team cost\" item, the community will need to know the number of people assigned to the project, the description of their roles, and the hourly rate assigned to each. One area in which I must compliment the team is the section about risk management, which not only identifies possible barriers to success, but also suggests countermeasures that can be taken to mitigate the identified risk. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, the team has provided excellent descriptions of the sections that are relevant to assessing the auditability of the proposal. It provides the necessary information to understand the immediate actions following the allocation of funds, as well as an overview of the two-year roadmap. In my opinion, this section is appropriate and consistent with what the team is seeking. In the next section, the success metrics are evaluated, and again a great job is done, as the metrics are linked to milestones over time. The only aspect I miss is the establishment of objectives for each \"Key Metric\". This is critical for the community to be able to audit any time during the entire implementation phase. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 12, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": " Relation to personal qualifications: As a year-long activist in both party-politics and non-party related political (grassroots) groups I know how important decentralised communities are for democratic and economic empowerment. This knowledge gives me the skills to assess proposals in this challenge. The proposal identifies an important problem within the challenge which by adressing it, will provide a perspective to people in regions with weak infrastructure and give them Accessibility to the Cardano network and other services, aiding in onboarding an entire new group of people and giving them novel perspectives. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align excellently with the outlined challenge settings.\r\nSince WADA is a great multiplicator and keeps establishing,  it can sure be said that the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "WADA are a really active and established part of the Catalyst community. Without a doubt they will be able to successfully implement this proposal. The proposers know the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal and basically have a large group as their support network. \r\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items and is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable and roadmap to complete the work and a very detailed, rationable and transparent implementation plan.

This seems like an effective solution to the problem stated which is the high cost of brick-and-mortar hubs and subsequent risk of abandonment i.e. inefficient use of human and material of resources. This fits perfectly within this challenge and, if implemented properly is highly scalable as multiple mobile hubs can be deployed across the world on demand and would significantly drive the adoption of users on the ground level. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The lead for this project is identified and demonstrates experience to manage the implementation of this project. We know that other members of WADA will assist on this project, but ideally more team members could have been specified, especially members of the design team and engineers, as their role seems critical to implementing this proposal. It is not clear what format these mobile hubs will take, is the intention to make use of existing local venues, or to deploy and actual full mobile vehicle unit or tent, or both ? This is important to know, at least for the first prototype you are designing, as the associated costs vary greatly depending on the options. It is also not clear were the first prototype will be deployed, somewhere in Southern Europe ? The proposal describes a detailed roadmap, with quite ambitious timelines (lunch of the first CMH within 60 days), but this seems feasible given the WADA team support. The budget requested seems appropriate and is itemized, although it\u2019s not very clear which section of \u201cNear-term Roadmap\u201d + \u201c2-year Roadmap\u201d this intends to cover. The proposal presents an appropriate assessment of the risks.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadmap is presented with clear and verifiable milestones.

Relevant and ambitious success criteria are described, although could be more specific on what \u201chaving contact with the Cardano Mobile Hub\u201d means.\nThe nature of the problem is well introduced by the proposal, and likewise the solution is well articulated, including the description of use cases, target audience and impact on the ecosystem.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_125", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 5, "ng": 16, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal reminds me of the proverbial phrase involving a mountain and a prophet with the former deciding to climb it instead to present an alternative to the status quo. I provide strong agreement for its impact and alignment and for thinking out of the box. Communities, especially in Africa may find it more difficult to gather at a stationary meeting point; distances may be too far to travel and may be costly, or worse yet, transport is non-existent. What an ingenious way to solve the problem but to bring Cardano to the people instead. That this was presented by the WADA Alliance to me raises their pursuit for innovation even  higher whether this proposal gets funded or not. Commonly and in a pandemic-ridden world, cynics would say, well why not do it online instead? But therein lies the conundrum which brings Cardano to the African continent and is the reason why World Mobile is gaining traction. The proposal's presentation seems polished and aside from the specific requirements in terms of mobility and engineering, which is part of the initial steps anyway, it clearly explains the goals, the rationale behind the solution and the way forward, past the funding requested in Fund 8. Polished. Congratulations. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned, the WADA Alliance have successfully established four community hubs already and this is essentially the basis for my strong agreement with regards to this proposals feasibility. There will have certainly been lessons learnt over those processes which gives the confidence that giving a hub legs, pivots the difficulty to its mobility, as opposed to the establishment of the hub itself. Since this is a WADA Alliance undertaking it comes with the growing resources in terms of personnel, knowledge and experience that their leader Josh can rely upon. And as serial Catalyst proposers, funding winners and deliverers of projects they have a proven track record for the feasibility of their projects. The plan presented seems to be well-thought of starting with a pilot CMH with engineers and designers to come up with the hub-on-wheels rubric. Their near-term roadmap contains goals which are very doable (although with the current logistical issues we're having globally for equipment this timeline may need to be extended) but what impresses are their plans after this pilot where the idea, once proven, is expanded to a level that is self-funding with no reliance on Catalyst in the future. What essentially is being proposed here is not simply a truck with antennas for internet connection where people can gather around but a way to traverse that last mile where Cardano ends (with World Mobile's help) and people live. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The strongest point for this proposals auditability is WADA Alliance's eagerness to update their websites about any projects they are undertaking whether within or without Catalyst. I am sure we will see the progress of this mobile hub on their socials. In terms of this proposal's six-month timeline, there is also a mention of a new website specific to the CMH and the development of tracking capabilities, which I presume will pinpoint locations where the hub is parked. Their target audience at the beginning consists of universities, government locations, other hubs and conferences. Overall, a good proposal. I wish you success and possibly growth of similar mobile hubs in other countries and continents proposed by other Catalyst participants.
