I generally agree that this proposal is aligned with what the challenge seeks as it will directly create a new hub. However, because no specific metrics are presented and the \"incentives\" described are very generic it is very difficult to accurately assess the impact. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While it is unfortunate that the author did not meet the minimum requirements of feasibility, from his description it is clear that the author is aligned with the values of Cardano, as it seems to me that it is a great idea to generate a hub in Kyiv. However, there are several areas that need to be addressed, including: (1) The following three \"managers\" are mentioned; a description of their profiles and links to their resumes would be beneficial. The roles that these individuals will play should also be described. As a physical location will be rented, it is necessary to describe whether or not you already have an agreement with this location. Do you need licenses? Permits that need to be considered? It is also unclear from what date the site will open. (3) this challenge seeks among other objectives to add new users to the ecosystem, I recommend that the author focus on how this will be achieved.\u00a0\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, the proposer also does not mention the minimum requirements for evaluating auditability, although it mentions a time frame within which it will be economically sustainable after 6 months, but more details are definitely required. Is there a potential Go-Live event? What will be the details of the different events that will be held? Will there be a reporting structure for the community members? Also, it is necessary that the author include success metrics that the community can audit at any time during the implementation process.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 9, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "\"Building a physical place, located in the center of Kyiv for Cardano Hub is quite interesting and can help people connect with each other directly to build projects for Cardano.\r\n\r\nBut if the proposal is only for a physical place, it could be geographically difficult for a lot of people.
