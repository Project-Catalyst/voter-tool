It's probably true that more networking would be beneficial to the ecosystem.\r\nThe solution seems to be incomplete, it only says \"starting with informal meetings\". From the rest of the proposal, however, one can infer that the proposed solution is to organize meetings in Houston and to set up a Cardano Hub there. Try to be careful to add the solution to proposals in the future, as it is important to grab the voters' attention from the get-go. They must see quality in the first few sentences they read.\r\nThe plan makes sense to me. Texas and especially Houston does seem to be turning into a business hub, potentially even strong on the tech side, especially since Elon Musk, Joe Rogan and other big names started moving there. Trying to establish a Cardano community presence there seems like a very good idea. Kudos to the proposer. They have also outlined the benefits that would be brought to Cardano quite well. Introducing Plutus to the crowd there could have enormous potential for us.\r\nI find that the objectives of the proposal are ambitious, but reasonable, as well as the metrics (2 meetings in the 3 months after funding with 50 unique visitors sounds very doable). If I may make a suggestion, perhaps setting a target for social media followers would be a good idea as well, so that we can track that too. Even though the solution is unfortunately not clearly formulated, I believe this is a good idea with a good action plan and I strongly agree that it effectively addresses the \"Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs\" challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'm sad to say that the proposal falls short in this category. The proposer has only mentioned that they have held leadership roles in organizations serving specific communities of interest. Voters will want to know who exactly you are and what you've done, so it would have been great to add some credentials here. A LinkedIn page, a Youtube channel, even a Twitter or Facebook account would have gone a long way to put a face to the name and show people who would work on this. Also, it would have been good to learn what organizations you are referring to and what your responsibilities were there.\r\nThe budget in my opinion is very reasonable and is also broken down in an understandable manner. The one more thing I think could have been added here was a section addressing possible risks. That shows voters you are really serious when planning this. For example, what happens if new lockdowns are enforced in the following months? A possible solution is to hold the meetings on Zoom, or hold them live but with fewer people etc.\r\nDue to the lack of personal credentials here and the missing risk analysis, I can only give 3 stars in the \"it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully\" section. I would have liked to give more, but this is crucial data that is missing.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In my opinion, this proposal is quite clear in what it wants to do and the roadmap it provides, along with the KPI's, are satisfactory. Not only has the proposer set realistic goals for 3-6 months, but they also demonstrate that they are thinking ahead, hoping to get funded once more after 12 months and scale this initiative even more. I think it warrants 4 stars for clarity / auditability. The missing star is due to the fact that the solution is not clearly outlined at the beginning and the proposal is a bit lacking in information about the proposer themselves. Hopefully in the next one, we'll see all of this.

Given the recent actions taken by Texas towards promoting blockchain initiatives in the state, it is a major opportunity to give Cardano a spotlight in this new scenario. Reaching more people and businesses would certainly add value to the Cardano ecosystem. However, the final objective of having 200 members by the end of the year could be more ambitious, as it does not explore the full potential on this new blockchain capital. Perhaps, setting up more monthly meetings in different locations across Texas could improve the reaching potential.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is very brief about his relevant experience. Having held leadership roles in organizations should make him fit for setting up this hub, but it is vague concerning which areas of the organizations he was leader in, which industries those organizations were operating on and which specific communities of interest they were serving. Besides that, there were no words regarding neither which skills he has that could help him implementing this proposal, nor which skills would be needed. In the same way, he also does not specify the type and number of team members required to accomplish his goals. The budget is spectulative and does not detail what the coordination means, how the marketing would be done, what is the platform that he wants to set up and if there would be rent costs for the meeting places. The implementation plan could have more details about how each step is going to be done, such as which social medias would be used and which kind of content would be published, what kind of spaces the meetings would be held in, how he expects to attract people, encourage ambassadors and the timeline for those steps. On the other hand, the proposer indentifies as a teacher and proposes to include classes to the hub activities. That could be a powerful way to increase reaching with the average non-technical people, which is a key point in this challenge. Adding the details mentioned will certainly increase this proposal attractiveness.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is not a clear roadmap, as the steps are not detailed on how to be executed.
