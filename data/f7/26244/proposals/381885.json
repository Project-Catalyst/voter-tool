This time around, the proposal team brings up the issue of a shortage of skilled developers to develop for Cardano. In addition, other aspects of the African context are presented, which reinforce the need to resolve this problem. ABCD's mission is to become the leading blockchain solution provider in Africa, as explained in detail in its five year strategic plan. They request funding in particular for this Catalyst cycle so that they can launch the first cohort so that format, content, attendance level, etc, can be tested. Which is completely aligned with the challenge settings. Regarding the success metrics, they are very well defined. However, it would be interesting to define the objectives for each metric to be able to make an estimate of the impact. \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Joshua and Gwendal are the founders of ABCD, which was born with Cardano and Catalyst, and therefore shares many of the same values and visions. From what I understand from reading the proposal, they have already released the first cohort of 14 blockchain developers, so it is expected that they will be able to do it again. There is a much more robust proposal this time, with a vision for the short, medium, and long term, and for that I applaud them. The team identifies in an excellent manner its main objectives, scope, stakeholders, barriers, and expected results. By doing so, the community can make an informed decision regarding feasibility. As a point for improvement, if I may, it would be the way that the budget is defined. Although there is a justification of the elements contemplated to reach the final number, I believe that more effort should be put into this process. As an example, it is stated that the cost to train one developer would be approximately $1500, however, it is stated that it is planned to train 25 developers for a total of $37500. Therefore, I would like to ask you, where will the remaining funds come from? The cost of administrative issues such as follow-ups, meetings, and licenses are also unclear.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Though I commend you for having a long-term vision with annual plans, there is a lack of information regarding the auditability aspects of this proposal. Particularly in light of the fact that according to the budget section, the training cycle generally lasts between four and five months. What will happen during the remaining months of your annual plan? For the deliverables, the key metric is the inclusion of 25 individuals in this cohort. Upon closer examination of the metrics, although very clearly defined, no objectives are provided for each, making it impossible to evaluate the proposal from the perspective of auditability. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 11, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Developing developers in Africa is a great idea to develop blockchain and Cardano in Africa to solve current problems there. But I really haven't seen the proposal's difference in developing developers in Africa since developers in Africa can totally take Cardano courses for free. I'm a native of Southeast Asia but I can still learn Haskell and Plutus through Cardano's free courses. Meanwhile, the proposal needs funding for developers to learn. I still don't know if the purpose of developer funding is incentive money or course money.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "\"The experience of the team behind this proposal goes well with organizing events, building community, and making a website well suited to creating programs and courses.

In my opinion, what attracts developers to develop careers with blockchain and Cardano is their own career opportunities and financial development. If the proposal focuses on telling them about these things, it would be better than just creating courses without giving them a reason why they have to become blockchain developers.\r\n\r\nBesides, the proposal also does not set a target of the number of developers who complete the course and are tested enough to be able to execute projects, it will be difficult to know if the project will be successfully implemented after being funded.\"", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_645", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "One of the key objectives of this challenge is to bring new developers into the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal meets this perfectly by training and supporting devs in Africa.\nThe initial cohort is visible on their website with bio's (https://www.abcdevs.com/hire-blockchain-developers). This should provide the voter with confidence that the proposer has proven capability. This proposal is to put another 24 devs through the programme.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The people running ABCD and their role in delivering this proposal is made clear as is the role of their training parter, EMURGO.  Although LinkedIn profiles are not provided they are relatively simple to find so the claims in the proposal can be verified.\nThe costs involved are clearly set out and the course costs can be validated on the emurgo website (https://emurgo.io/education). A small overhead (c$5k) is retained for supporting devs over 5 months of training.\nA clear (multi-year) roadmap has been provided showing the ambition of this organisation.\nOverall a very transparent and honest proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics have been well thought through. Not only does the proposer look at the short term metrics , ie how many developers have been training but they are also delivering additional value to the community by tracking post training activities ie employment of the devs, salaries, projects and partnerships initiated.
