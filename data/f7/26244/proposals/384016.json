West Africa is a wide region (17 countries) and it is unclear if the proposer is aware of the existing Cardano hubs in this area (Ghana is the first example that came in my mind). If the proposer aims that region, it is recommended to find a country (couple of but not more) whose inhabitants are interested to gain knowledge about Cardano ecosystem and no hub is already assembled. \r\n\r\nIf the target audience is identified the proposal can have a good starting point for its path to success.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect that is unclear represents the language in which the materials will be presented. An assumption can be made (French or English I presume) but is not clear if the materials will be presented in one or another or in both.\r\n\r\nIf the assumption is valid, that people in West Africa speak French or English language and not in their original dialects than, the proposal fits in the challenge objectives, otherwise it needs to be rephrased to comply with the campaign requirements.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the statements of the proposer the team that will implement the project have the necessary experience for doing this job. It is recommended to sustain the statements with links to trails/evidences (links to social media, projects completed etc.)\r\n\r\nIt is unclear what is the number of events that will take place. In the proposal it is stated that the pace is bi-weekly but in the end the number of total events is 26, thus making the pace twice a month (a year has 52 weeks). This aspect needs further clarification.\r\n\r\nThe budget is broken down into items but additional information is required as is necessary to present how many events will be held online and how many are estimated to be face to face, as additional funding is required for the last category (venue rental, catering etc.).\r\n\r\nThe proposal doesn't offer a realistic timetable to complete the work. (i.e. week 1 - team assembling; week 2, 3, 4 - topic preparation, audience gathering for the meeting, events holding; week 5 - impact evaluation, feedback analysis, adjustments/improvements phase etc.)\r\n\r\nThe proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.

Furthermore I didn't identify a comprehensible timetable to track the work completion. Altogether, this proposal lacks the details needed for me to give it a positive feasibility vote.
