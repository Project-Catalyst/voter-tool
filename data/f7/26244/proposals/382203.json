By adding these reinforcements, the proponent is seeking to extend the reach of its community, which is aligned with the challenge's objectives.

The plan defined to implement this proposal is clear and sufficient for me. This budget request covers the next three months, and it is broken down into seven clearly identifiable line items, and there is enough information provided to enable a proper assessment. As the amount requested varies considerably depending on the local context, I cannot determine whether or not the requested amounts are appropriate. Yet, I understand how they will be allocated, and from that perspective it seems that the task was successfully accomplished.    Finally, I would like to add that after analyzing the complementary proposal [https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/China-Info-Hub-Continued/382197-48088] I have a concern. While this proposal focuses on requesting funds for video editing, I am not sure why there is a line item dedicated to \"video editing\" in both proposals. It would make more sense to me if the amount requested for that item is presented only in this proposal.
