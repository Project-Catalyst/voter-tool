By doing so, blueprints and playbooks will then be developed that can be used to deploy similar communities in different cities. The impact per se of this proposal may not be large simply because it is based on establishing a community with relatively few people, but it will serve as the pilot and will lay the groundwork to begin building a knowledge base for the future. The team states that they will need to submit a new proposal for future challenges to give the project momentum. Overall, I agree with the allocation of funds. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team describes the qualifications and experience of each member of the team, each of whom has considerable experience and a reputation within the Catalyst community. The implementation plan is straightforward, and all steps the team intends to take are well understood. However, when it comes to the budget, although there is a very specific breakdown of the elements that compose it, the cost is not associated with each item. As a result, it is not possible to make an accurate assessment of the justification of the amount requested. In spite of the lack of a section on the potential risks to the success of this proposal, the experience accumulated by the team gives me confidence that this first phase will be successful. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a very good explanation of the roadmap; it was structured for three months, and there will be extensive explanations of what will be happening in each month. Despite the fact that the criteria for success are not completely described in the proposal, based on my reading of the proposal, I detect two main deliverables, (1) forming a group of 20 to 30 people in Berlin, and (2) creating a playbook to consolidate all the good practices for building local communities. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 25, "ne": 13, "ng": 11, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Catalyst swarm is a successful concept, bringing it to the real world would really have wonderful ramifications. Catalyst swarm with real-world experiences could really support a lot of contributions doing wonders to the Cardano ecosystem. With the detailed plan as proposed above, the team has complete faith in the proposal. Berlin being the primary target audience, could easily help the swarm spread its influence in all directions across Europe and eventually across the globe. With the potential collaborations as mentioned in the final piece of the proposal, there is no doubt that the new faces in the ecosystem get quality guidance and support them in their contributions to the network. The workshops and events in addition to the playbooks being available to all will no doubt drive a lot of confident and talented traffic into the network.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the well-narrated action plan and reasonable deliverables, the chances of the proposal being successful are very high. To add more to that the familiar faces such as Felix and Dan the community has very little doubts regarding the expertise the team would possess. The detailed budget plan and the very practical fund make complete justice to the proposal. The team's hint of applying for additional funds during further rounds shows the long-term determination and passion the team carries along with them. Having provided the above rationale, I strongly believe that this proposal is one of the notable ideas under the challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With such an elaborate manifesto in hand, there lie very few doubts about the proposal. There are clear indicators that the auditors could use to measure the progress of the project. The open-source nature of the playbooks, constant meetups and community events and discussions, the increase in the inflow of network traffic, and contributions especially by the collaboration partners. However, the lack of quantitative KPIs to understand the number of newcomers, number of active users of services might add more insight. It is quite understandable that still being in its preliminary stages and being a very people-centric proposal, such metrics are quite tough to be defined. But dainty more information on the metrics would make this a complete proposal in my opinion.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_751", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 11, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This idea in this proposal is a good one. Creating a local community  hub in Berlin is in complete sync with the challenge problem. The proposer has properly articulated how this proposal will add value to the cardano ecosystem. In fact the local community hub will attract people with different profiles who can join the cardano community and help build the ecosystem up. The proposer has mentioned eventual additional funding in fund 8. Based on all the information provided in this proposal, it can have a pretty good impact.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has some pretty notorious names known in the cardano  community who are part of the team. Although I would suggest to the proposer to add linkedin profiles or other resources to back his claims, I can give them a pass given that Victor corcino who is a member of the team is very credible in the cardano community, specially for those involved as CA and VCA. I would also suggest to the proposer the add a budget breakdown of the 45000 requested. The proposer planned to add a budget breakdown in fund 8, but my question is how did they calculate the actual budget. Apart from that, the proposer has provided a timetable until april 2022 with all the details and expectations. The plan is laid out with as many details about the proposal. The only thing remaining is a successful execution which is likely to happen based on the information given in this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project is auditable for me as there is all the information necessary to track its progress.

I think that your suggestion is not yet a bit of evidence or validation for your statements in this summary. will you be targeting individuals? like during the seminar, you just gave the main ideas in theory, but in reality, you haven't mentioned.

How about your strict? above all the concern is that you are requesting a capital of 45000 USD without showing us a clear funding sheet is it reasonable?. also you are missing the documents for community verification about your statements and the proposed team. You need to explain more clearly about the budget, the experience of the team clearly, the proposal will bring higher feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed team has come up with a specific roadmap in real time.
