The proposal addresses this aspect quite well in their detailed plan as well as in problem and solution statement. \r\n\r\nDesigning a simple easy to integrated UI/UX is as important as integrating well designed solution from the beginning. This is in align with Cardano's strategy which has allowed Cardano to stay in top 5 or 6 crypto currencies the entire time since its inception.\r\n\r\nThe proposal solution clearly   also mentions which ecommerce platforms they are targetting as part of this solution. This therefore, for me is very well in align with the challenge settings. Hence full stars from my side.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team of this proposal has given good description of the team members experience, however, a public link to their profile would have been better. \r\n\r\nThis, however is compensated by the public github link to their repos which also has link to their twitter profile.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen that they already have integration with  A pay merchant account for their ticket sale app, so clearly they have good experience working with integration of ada pay solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan, in terms of timeline, is well outlined, which gives good overview on when team expects coding/testing phase to be finished.\r\n\r\nProposal has also identified the integration platforms and how this integration will look like. However, i would be a little bit more interested in getting into technical details (oops i am a developer myself) of why 3 engineers would need 200 hours each for doing the backend work of integrating with ada Pay solution. To me JS engineer budget looks more than what it should be, but this question can be kept for review times. Overall, This proposal asks for more than 40% of the total budget allocation, and i think the budget is a little bit over the roof.\r\n\r\nAlso i noticed that programming language is written as Java (node.js). I think what proposer meant was to have either Java or Node.js or both, but from the text it looks like they are using Java which is also called Node.js ? \r\n\r\nAll in all a well written proposal but imo still there are some room for improvements. Hence, 4 stars from my side.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of this proposal as team of this proposal has good experience with blockchain tech (as visible by the GitHub activities). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we can see that community will have the opportunity to clearly see in how many months which feature sets are to be expected. This provides a good feedback loop between the team and community.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i think it should be fairly easy for community to audit the progress and success of this proposal, hence I strongly agree.\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal has a very strong and clear alignment with the fund challenge requirements.
