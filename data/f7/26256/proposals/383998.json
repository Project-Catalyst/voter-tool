The idea is noble, and has good use case I believe. But clearly the idea does not belongs to this category, and would be more fit into dapps and integrations challenge.\r\n\r\nIf, however, this idea is a fit to this challenge, then it would have been nice if proposer had mentioned how adaPay solution will be integrated with RAEDA. I am totally missing this connection in this proposal writeup. This points to either of following  two things \r\n\r\n1) The proposer does not have a good clarity on how the Cardano/Coti integration  works \r\n2) The proposer assumed that reader can infer from the given writeup that there will be some sort of integration with AdaPay.\r\n\r\nIn either of the cases, I think this is not a right fit for this proposal. For me therefore, i will suggest to proposer, to have a look at other challenges and put this proposal in next round there. I am sure you will have much success with a high chance of getting funded in future. Good luck", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal has given an attachment where they have elaborated on the team which consists of good share of experienced individuals.\r\n\r\n Additionally, The metrics section and long term goals given explains that team has a good vision in terms of how success for them will look like. \r\n\r\nIf i consider this proposal alone without considering the fact this is not perhaps the right place (challenge settings) for this proposal, i still find plenty of room for improvement. The proposal successful implementation in itself will require, imo, some other partnerships, especially with external dependencies, such as internet infrastructure in Africa. I believe this is a long term game, and projects such as world mobile token and blockchain promotion pace would be a big factor in representing the success of this proposal. \r\n\r\nI think the proposer should also cover up the success definition with respect to infrastructure within Africa. For Cardano community this is a very important area to know about, as local people/community such as the proposer have a good knowledge and experience on it. \r\n\r\nTherefore, in my opinion proposer should try to cover as many dimensions as possible. This will only increase the likelihood of your proposal being funded in the future. \r\n\r\nFinally, given all the above points, for me I neither agree or disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully (considering this point alone and not that this proposal is not a good fit for this challenge)", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal mentions that they are developing some sort of system where users can also access service through crypto payments. However, i could not find any information on the development/programming/testing roadmap for this digital solution. \r\n\r\nAlthough, the proposal gives a good outline on budget breakup but if RAEDA is going to be a digital product, then i believe someone has to do the coding and implementation for it too. The milestones are mentioned but budget breakdown does not mention anything about developer's man hours.\r\n\r\nAs a senior developer myself i feel the success of this proposal depends a lot on the quality of developers who will implement this solution. However, the in depth information about what is the development plan, what tech stack they are using, what kind of functionalities/feature sets they are working upon, what are their plans for scalability of their solution, who and how will the QA (Quality assurance) be done? Such implementation details are missing which are very important for the success of this proposal and community would like to have a clear roadmap on this.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to the proposer is having a look at previously funded projects where they have given all these details. This will allow you to have a good understanding on how you can provide community good confidence on if a proposal can be  audited properly and eventually the success probability of this proposal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I disagree that there is enough information available here to sufficiently audit the progress and success of this proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 9, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal is certainly an intriguing one and clearly could do wonders especially in a continent such as Africa where mobility is an ever-existing issue as the proposer mentions in his problem statement. However, I strongly believe that this proposal does not do the required justice to the challenge at hand. The campaign brief mentions the need for an ADA pay plug-in, even though the proposer mentions to be working on a unique payment platform, they make no mention of how this platform can be scaled across to other platforms. I feel that this proposal could fit other challenges such as \"Nation-building Dapps\" or \"Dapps and integration\" as the proposal concentrates on one particular application that could add value to people's lives and to the ecosystem rather than providing the community a payment plug-in that will increase the Cardano transactions and adaptability as a payment medium. Hence, I feel despite being a great proposal it is not being submitted under the right challenge therefore, I score a 2 out of 5 for the impact and how well it addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer mentions having already done a fair amount of work in the direction of the proposal. But, there is no narrative regarding the detailed plan they intend to follow for the proposed idea to be achieved. The submitted proposal also does not include any description regarding the members of the team and their experience except for mentioning the roles. In addition to that, having requested an overall budget of 40k USD which is about 2/5th of the alloted 100k, there is no breakdown of the budget available for the readers. There is no action plan or documentation about the possible risks and drawbacks and their mitigation plan. There is no flavour provided about how the success would look like and how much value it could add to the Cardano ecosystem and COTI in particular. All in all, with a lot of details missing, the proposal seems very much incomplete and places a lot of doubts in the minds of readers. Therefore, I disagree that with the information available, it is very difficult to assume that this proposal would meet the expectations of the campaign.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer does not provide the readers with what are the possible metrics that can be used to assist the auditing. Also, there is no phase-wise success definition to track the timely progress of the proposal. The proposer has not provided any KPI that matches the required KPIs mentioned in the campaign brief. With no clear milestones and time horizon defined it is very difficult to track the proposal and its success. Having gone through the proposal, I feel even on successful implementation of the proposal, there is no plausible evidence to say that their payment platform can be leveraged by other merchants and web applications for the payment procedures. There exist no visible metrics in the proposal to identify the number of users using this payment method and how smooth it is. A piece of dainty more information regarding the payment success rate, cost of quality, scalability, and user experience will bring in more value to the proposal altogether. I strongly suggest the proposer to work on a more elucidated plan and re-submit in the further rounds.

By providing mobility that is fair and easy to use to the people of Africa you solve a big problem. Now my concern is where is the link with the challenge. We look for ways to integrate the ADA Pay plug-in. You talk about developing a system where users can also access services through crypto payments. but as it stands now the funding requested for this proposal does not include this service. You also don't define that this crypto payment would go with ADA Pay. It's one impeccable proposal and the document attached gives all the necessary info but we are missing the link with the challenge.

Looking at the team we get a full fletched team that is qualified for this proposal. They each have their own unique qualities that are explained short but clear. One thing that would've finished this is if you provided a link to the survey that you guys had taken before this. Everything else is well explained and provides evidence of the hard work that you guys already put into this proposal, but what I'm missing is the model to support these affordable rides and drivers offers.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As stated in the previous rationale everything is provided in this proposal. The timetable is presented and I would normally say one month is not enough to provide a demo version but I assume they already started working on the prototype. risk management is present and nourishes my brain to the point that I see you guys are putting everything in this. One concern I have is the budget. I don't doubt that you guys need the amount but since it's asking for half the challenge funds I hope you guys know you're taking a risk on this. What I would suggest is if this doesn't get funded breakdown your project into several categories and submit proposals for each category.

This is highlighted by the strong focus on the idea rather than detailing how it plans to address core challenge criteria such as testing the plug-in, measuring key metrics, etc\u2026  Furthermore, the proposal has not detailed out core metrics of success even for its own concept. The business model is conceptual and only provides anecdotal evidence for why it is a needed idea.  \r\n\r\nIn order to turn this from a strong proposal in the future, the project team should aim to submit their idea to relevant challenges as well providing more details around roadmaps and how it realistically aims to become the 'Uber for Africa.' For example what is the detailed pricing strategy for the subscription model? Why use a subscription model as opposed to a Pay-as-you-go model?

A clear strength of this proposal is the ability to come up with an interesting concept for integrating Cardano into the real world. \r\n\r\nMy recommendation for a future proposal is to add more detail in the budget breakdown and roadmap section.  The requested funds for $40,000 makes up 40% of the total funds allocated for this challenge. Given that amount, I would expect an appropriate level of depth when addressing how this budget is going to be spent. \r\n\r\nFinally, I am struggling to understand the implementation path that lies ahead.  It is still an idea at heart and there is a strong disconnect of how the challenge objectives will be met through this project (as well as how the business model will be sustainable or successful).

In order to improve the proposal even further, I suggest outlining important information such as a roadmap, estimate of key activities to be delivered and details on budget allocation. \r\n\r\nFurther, having alignment with the challenge metrics would increase the change of a successful proposal.
