Given that the challenge seeks to ramp-up advocacy efforts to lobby and educate politicians, with the goal of producing better laws and regulations favorable to Cardano in particular, the proposed Spanish-language digital tutorial to be distributed to Colombian lawmakers makes sense. The lack of accurate and accessible information about Cardano written in Spanish is a major barrier to advocacy in Spanish speaking nations. Therefore, such a tool has potential utility throughout Central and South America. Given the modest budget proposed ($4,500) and the potential scalable distribution of the guide, the project appears to be a good use of treasury funds. That said, the proposal provides few details explaining why advocacy is needed in Columbia specifically. Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team members possess extensive consulting and legal experience pertaining to Columbia, as well as connections to the Columbian government. That said, the size and extent of this social network is vague. Moreover, it is not clear how the guides are to be distributed to members of congress or their staffs (e.g., via email). From my personal experience producing sponsored public policy research and disseminating these findings to state lawmakers and members of Congress, it is difficult to get such information into the hands of the right people. Such lobbying efforts often require multiple follow-ups with staffers and in some cases may result in requests for telephone conference calls or Zoom meetings. The proposal does not seem to contain any clear plans regarding such follow-up efforts. Moreover, the proposal does not identify which member of the team is the blockchain/Cardano expert responsible for drafting the digital guide. Will this be subcontracted or done by a member of the team?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the development and production of the Spanish-language Cardano guide is easy to verify, the \"Roadmap and milestones\" provided by the team are vague or hard to understand. I would recommend that that team make these milestones crystal clear. Moreover, the KPIs/metrics listed in the proposal are debatable. The bulk of the metrics seek to measure the number of guides sent to members of the Columbian Congress rather than the impact of said guides (which is admittedly hard to measure) or the number of follow-up communications between the team and interested members of congress (which in my experience is the best outcome one can hope for). Informational guides typically are used to start a conversation with law makers and their key staff members, which may lead to congressional testimony or the introduction of legislation (our ultimate goal). As such, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides sufficient information for the community to review future progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_914", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The plan in this proposal is to create an informational chart accompanied by infographics with the purpose of providing Colombian congressmen with correct information from our viewpoint.

It could set the basis of a more friendly environment in Colombian congress towards crypto in general, which would enable an array of possibilities. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team have well documented themselves in the proposal. They are also exceptionally well placed to perform this task. Having a team member who is a former official of Colombian congress enables the proposers to know how things happen on the inside and gives them an edge to plan their approach, which will look professional towards the congressmen.

Going forward to the people who are decisive - congresmen, in this case, may be a great way to educate them. Well-organized, short but informative one-pagers may bring more awareness and really influence further decisions. Such materials should be not only available to Latin America users but later translated and adjusted to other languages and cultures. It's a chance for a global face-to-face education for politicians.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "2 lawyers in the team, one with experience in politics is heart-warming in such project.
