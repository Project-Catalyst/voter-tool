A quick examination of international sources shows that legislators and policy makers do not fully understand the opportunity presented by the crypto space, so I commend the proposer on the idea to develop a framework within the EU to help address this gap. The development of such a framework in this context could have a significant impact depending on how comprehensive it is and through which avenues it reaches the legislative table. I appreciate that the proposer has identified a specific geographical location to ground the proposal and resulting legal framework. Doing so in this way helps voters better understand the expectations and also the limitations of the proposal. The identification of specific pieces of legislation (MiCA and DORA) which will be compared vis-\u00e0-vis the framework also helps focus attention rather than being too broad and overshooting. If the proposal is successful, and the proposer is able to get it to the proper tables and representatives, this project will likely have a significant impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is not clear if the proposal will be implemented successfully. While I credit the proposer for a well laid out plan, the feasibility of achieving the plan is not easily identifiable. Component A (drafting) seems straightforward enough and given the experience listed, likely feasible. Component B (get policymaker and legislative support) however is a significant step yet there are little to no details on how these individuals would be engaged, at what intervals, at what level, and for how long. Governments are often monolithic entities that are opaque and slow to change, therefore to assess feasibility, identifying key players within these institutions at the outset would give voters more confidence that it is in fact feasible. This is even more important as not all government representatives are in positions to move such a project forward even though they are within the government. Moreover, under component B, the proposer notes that constant iteration will be necessary but there is no indication of how this will be sustained, by whom, and for how long. I would have liked the proposer to also provide more information on their background, including links to their credentials; as it stands, we are left to \"trust\" the word of the proposer but this will likely deter many voters. The budget also leaves something to be desired and makes it hard for voters to understand how the proposer reached the specific amount. For these reasons, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal is feasible, but if unsuccessful, addressing these issues in a future funding round would certainly increase the score. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, I do not believe that the information is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. It is unclear how the community would be able to audit the success of the proposal to determine whether it was worth the investment. There are no real KPIs, timeline, or roadmap for how the proposal would be implemented. Given the very murky environment of regulation and legislation writing, it is unclear how the success of the project could in fact be measured. If the document is written and provided to legislators/policy makers, is that success? What if it is accepted but not used? How would the community follow up to find out what impact it had on whatever legislation results? Also, there is no timeline provided leaving voters to wonder how long such a project would take. As a policy advisor myself, I know that these timelines often span years and include many iterations beyond the public eye, however, this is not addressed herein. It leaves me wondering whether the proposer, or the community, could even participate in the way explained throughout. Finally, a significant amount of the money is to complete the work but there is no breakdown for the activities within each component, leaving voters to essentially write a blank check but without a way to track it. While I really support the idea behind the proposal there is not enough information to have the confidence that the community could adequately audit the proposal.

It will also create a legal basis to research and refine so potential options and paths will become clear. You could look at it like a form of legal planning. This is of great importance because if there is no legal framework to operate in, there cannot be large scale adoption.
