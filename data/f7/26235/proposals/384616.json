Given that the challenge seeks to ramp-up advocacy efforts to lobby and educate politicians, with the goal of producing better laws and regulations favorable to Cardano in particular (and the crypto space in general), the proposed coalition of state blockchains is a logical next-step. State blockchain associations are critical grassroots entities that advocate for change at the local and state levels, and it is critical to quickly roll-out more of these associations in areas lacking such groups. An overarching association of associations has the potential to rapidly train and equip local advocates, increasing the bottom-up pressure to reform US state laws. However, I do have a few concerns. First, the proposed association seems to be US-centric. Is it feasible for such an association to cast a wider net? My second concern is that the campaign brief emphasizes the need for favorable reforms that focus on PoS and Cardano in particular, which is nowhere addressed in the proposal. Overall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The members of the steering committee identified in the proposal each possess extensive experience in the blockchain association space and each has been actively lobbying for regulatory reform in their respective states/regions (i.e., California, Texas, and Seattle/British Columbia). The team has sketched a reasonable outline of a plan, but much of the specific details are missing. The legal status of the organization is unclear \u2013 the budget section states that a DAO will be formed but the Success Timeline states the goal to \"form the organization, possibly as a DAO\". Knowing the legal status and state of incorporation of the association would be helpful. Moreover, it is unclear how the budget ($20,000) is to be spent. The proposal mentions the development of training materials, hosting a summit, and possibly hiring a part-time director, but it is not clear how Catalyst funds are to be distributed among these efforts. \r\nThe proposal also states that \"we are asking for $20,000 for Project Catalyst to join as a founding member. We are asking a variety of large blockchain businesses and ecosystems to join and support the effort. Our fundraising goal for year one is $250,000.\" Additional details regarding the success/status of these outside fundraising efforts would be helpful. How much has been pledged? This leads to the next concern regarding downside risk. If inadequate outside funds are obtained, how will this project pivot and what are the critical spending priorities?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From the information provided in the proposal, efforts to launch the association are still in their infancy (e.g., the website is not yet up, the association/non-profit has not been created, etc.). Without additional outside funding (the proposal has a one-year fundraising goal of $250,000), it is not clear that the $20,000 requested from the Catalyst project will be sufficient to startup the organization. This potential risk is not addressed in the proposal. Moreover, it is not clear which deliverables are tied specifically to the requested Catalyst funds, so inferring specific KPIs is difficult. Finally, to keep the proposed association going in subsequent years, is there a long-term fundraising strategy? From my personal experience producing sponsored public policy research and disseminating these findings to state lawmakers and members of Congress, it is both very expensive to engage in these activities and difficult to secure reliable funding.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_914", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 14, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "There are similar proposals like this that intend to create legal resources for the industry to use, but in the EU. The USA will need similar documents to boot up a legal department within the cryptographic sphere. In order to do this, there is a need for lawyers who are acquainted with this technology. To get those, there needs to be training material and networking. This proposal offers to perform that first step by hosting summits with a profound focus on exploring cryptographic policies that would come to the benefit of the entire industry. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget has not been broken down, yet it has been marked as such in the checklist. There is no website yet, but the proposers have made an effort to identify themselves.

However, there is  no real definition of success. Specifying how big of a turn out is expected on the summits could clarify this.
