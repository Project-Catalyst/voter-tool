However, seeing as the goals of the challenge point towards the creation of an environment of laws that are more favorable or less harmful to the crypto space, with a focus on PoS and on Cardano's particularities, I believe a future iteration of this proposal should focus on the lobbying and networking aspect of the challenge, rather than just stopping at the analysis of the regulatory experiments, from which months after the tests have been launched, it can be understood that the most significant result is that financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms can sustain alliances and operate without conflict, unlike what has happened in Colombia in the past. It should also be pointed out that, according to available information in Spanish, the SFC has only approved 4 cryptocurrencies to be paired with the colombian peso during this pilot project/regulatory sandbox: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash, meaning that neither Cardano nor a PoS cryptocurrency will partake in the pilot, with the concurrent absence of evidence derived from the pilot for regulatory consequences that the PoS specifications would necessarily entail as opposed to PoW.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team is clearly very competent and has the necessary experience in the public sector in Colombia, with a consultancy firm already in place to develop the described analysis, and the budget is clearly stated and broken down. Having said that, their main focus appears to be territorial/land registry, with no verifiable experience in the crypto sector, nor in the Cardano community prior to Fund7; I would strongly recommend incorporating this information in a future iteration of the project. Although the end document proposed is surely feasible for the team, there are no clear KPIs that account for lobbying or networking; I would suggest as potential metrics the number of interviews to be conducted, specification of government bodies to be approached (like those that will comprise the Evaluating Committee, such as the Presidency of the Republic, the SFC, the Superintendencia de Sociedades and the Unidad de Informaci\u00f3n y An\u00e1lisis Financiero, amongst others), etc.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided shows that there will be a concise product at the end of the stipulated 3-month period, which will show the success of the proposal. However, as stated above, there are no clear KPIs to be able to measure or audit the progress of the analysis and report. In this case, I would recommend that the analysis be broken down into deliverables that can be used as a monthly indication of the progress made, be it as independent chapters (for instance regarding previous regulation or SFC stances towards the cryptoeconomy, alliances partaking in the regulatory sandbox and their members\u00b4 track record vis-a-vis crypto, etc) or as stated above, as number of interviews held, with their recordings/conclusions being a possible deliverable for auditing purposes.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_787", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposing team has filed 2 proposals that are complementary.
