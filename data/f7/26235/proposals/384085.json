The problem statement is presented in a way that is both easy to understand and connected to the challenge, and the solution to the problem is clear. In basic terms, the proposal aims to spread information in places where a lot of misinformation is present, even though a lot of decisions are made that impacts the whole ecosystem. It is a project that would need time to grow to its full potential, but may prove to be incredibly valuable in the long term. (Which the team seems to have an understanding of). Growing the collaborators with the organization through universities and by lobbying will cover two very important environments in the future: The ones who are part of making decisions, and the ones who will be in the future. If the project can grow to its intended potential, it will be a very worthwhile investment for the community and ecosystem as a whole, both on a micro and a macro level. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The expertise of the core team feature a wide range of skills: Education (on university level), experience of working in the financial sector, and electronic engineering. With this set of competency, it speaks well for a broad understanding of what is needed in order to develop and maintain this project further. It would be beneficial if the proposal featured links to further strengthen the proof of competency for each team member, like for example a LinkedIn profile. Although, this can be found by a few minutes of google-searching. There is a lot of expertise, but it would be nice to have further proof of that in order to make these skills more verifiable. The fact that the team aims to continue developing the organization even if they won't be funded speaks for good commitment of the people involved. The plan for development is provided in the roadmap and is thoroughly explained in detail, step by step. Most of the budget allocation will be put towards the legal retainer, which makes sense due to the complexity of creating a non-profit organization within the US, and considering the year-long timeframe of the roadmap. What would make this proposal even more clear is the inclusion of a larger timeframe, what happens beyond the first year? The proposal states where it intends to be at that time, but what are some possible milestones longer term? The comments section provides us with a little bit of information where the proposer intends to expand their connections to a wide number of universities, but keeping it on a national level. Also, further details in a budget breakdown would be preferable in order to understand the budget allocation. How many working hours are to be split into how many hired people, etc. \r\nAll in all, I agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap provided in the proposal is clear and easily understandable, with a breakdown in 3, 6 and 12 month milestones. What would be nice to include in the roadmap are some measurements of success, or KPIs. How many universities does the team aim to be in collaboration with, during what timeframe? The proposal describes planning to be in contact with a number of blockchain advocates at a certain time, but who are they and how many are they? Where are they based? In order to measure the organizations growth and development, it would benefit to proposal to have some community links included. Where can we follow the development, or get in touch with the organization? Even if such a platform isn't launched yet, it would be nice to see what the team is planning in regards to how the community can follow its progress, in order to increase the transparency. Also, some thoughts in text regarding understanding of potential risks or challenges  connected to the project would benefit the proposal highly. If I as a community member read that the team understands the hurdles of what may transpire and is willing to share that plan with me as a community member, it would increase the trust, transparency and communication between community and organization. Having said that, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

This ignorance can only lead to misinformation and regulation which could harm and not promote technological development. Though this proposal to establish the Immutable Rsch Institute will be more state-focussed, it is the kind of organisation that could still provide information for anyone (even Feds) to learn from. I am currently a member of a major political party in Aust at a state level and have previously assisted in preparing opposition research for the local Member to inform on his vote and I can attest that all information is considered (local, state, fed) if you want to provide the best for your constituents. This proposal aims to establish such an organisation that could help inform the powers-that-be and the quality of the proposers and the manner in which they are looking to a long-term future to support our ecosystem is commendable. I agree that this proposal falls within the goals of this challenge and wish you luck.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers rationale for establishing the IRI is logical and the steps elaborated on to set-up a credentialed organisation is aligned with such institutions. The qualifications of the proposers in higher education, finance and fin-tech also makes them suitable, learned ambassadors for the crypto industry. The plan over the 12 months broken down in quarters is what you would expect and where I would suggest an improvement in this proposal is in knowing whether the IRI will be or will request to be officially associated with the University of Illinois, which would be ideal. The funds requested to establish the institute is very reasonable and the proposers admission that their plans will proceed whether Catalyst funds are secured or not, speaks volumes of their intention to succeed. I agree that there is enough in this presentation to achieve success and wish the team well.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is highly unlikely that the activities of the 3 & 6-month stages can be publicly shared due to privacy and this is very understandable, especially the participation of the IRS. What could be shared as part of the audit is the result of such an application and its eventual establishment as a non-profit organisation. In terms of the 12-month goals, it should make their contributions to the wider crypto discussion more evident and publicly. The proposer has previously utilised Meetups and I have the sense that this may also be an auditable point on their progress, if required. In examining the attached video, I can attest to the honest intent and bona fides of the participants and this provides great confidence that this project should be fine to track. As a person who has worked for a political party and as a voter, I wish you well in establishing such an institute which can only progress our industry.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 10, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is not aimed at creating a lobbying organisation to sway legislative policies.

In this particular proposal the project requests funding to cover for the legal aspects of setting up a non-profit organisation. The organisation itsself is a superb idea and given the competencies in the team and professionality that it holds, it could be one with great future impact. It is just not a great fit for this niche challenge and would fit better in a challenge to scale-up informational hubs.

The latter should be clearer mentioned in the proposal as it only became apparent about 20 minutes in the video. The lectures that are already performed are quite professionally executed and could realise a demand by universities to explain this technology to their students. There is no funding breakdown to explain the requested 15K USD. Not that it seems to be too much, just that a detail in spending reinforces confidence in terms of feasibility. Adding this to the proposal would improve it. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a difference between KPIs and a roadmap. In this proposal, both have been combined in one format, creating difficulties to determine what is intended to do and what is considered a success after each quarterly period.

To ensure confidence in this, the proposal would be improved with a risk assessment ensuring constant hires so the lectures get heard.
