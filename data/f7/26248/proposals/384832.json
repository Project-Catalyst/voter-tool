This proposal introduces a toy for kids and families that can be connected to a bank account and promotes financial literacy. However, since the proposing team plans to use stablecoins for their staking, the team should include how they plan to introduce Cardano to kids and families in their educational program to make it more relevant to the community and to voters. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has an up and running website that gives proof of prior work and would make the feasability for this proposal very high. However, there are some parts of the proposal, that are not quite clear. The proposal asks for the whole fund of this challenge, which would mean that no other proposal in this challenge would receive any funding. The team claims that they created a monopoly for \"learn to earn\" which is actually a quite common theme in crypto communities which I kind of would want a proposing team to know. The team itself has only one team member with experience in crypto and they mention pedagogic partners as well as toy companies - but they don\u00b4t give any reference for us to look this up. So if this proposal basically is about crypto and education, the relevant experience of the team does not quite match a project this large at this moment. The website itself shows a very nice and interesting product, that connects bank account information of fiat currency in a digital tool, which sounds great. The proposing team should make it clear, how it aims to provide payment options and connect staking and banking with crypto currencies through european bank accounts as this is not yet common. The most important thing that I\u00b4m missing in this proposal is \"risks\". Financial literacy is important and if the team is targeting families and kids, the  most important tool would be to let us as a community know, that they will be including the risks of paying with crypto as well as investing with crypto and crypto taxes. I actually think this project would be really great if it used a tool where the kids to paper trading or any other not real way of learning how to manage an account with crypto currencies and DeFi. At the moment, the website seems to focus on teaching kids how to manage fiat money and I\u00b4m guessing that the team would want to include information about crypto currencies and digital currencies. Which is great, but the proposal is somewhat lacking clarity and is missing relevant risks that should be considered. The provided roadmap is very confusing and includes additional funding rounds as well as crowdfunding. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is not easy as this is a big project with lots of steps and the roadmap and budget breakdown is confusing and includes addional funding that is not yet secured. The team did not elaborate about the risks of this project, if not enough funding is secured to build the envisioned product. The team did not include an assessment of the risks that are involved for families and obviously for kids when paying and investing in crypto. It is difficult to pin down the steps of the proposal as it is about education, creating a stakepool, onboarding new families to this brand, developing and producing a wearable for kids to spend money with and so on. It is also at this moment a developing project that focusses on fiat money - the team should provide way more information on how it plans to include and differentiate between fiat money and crypto currencies....", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 19, "ne": 12, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "\"The idea of teaching kids to save money with cryptocurrency and using staking to get interest for the financial future of children in the family is a great one.\r\n\r\nBut when I read this proposal I see that the proposer who is looking for a 200,000ADA fund has exceeded the budget of this challenge.
