In my understanding of the proposal, it is not about widening our community, but to increase the longevity and efficiency of Project Catalyst. With a specific focus on handling the economic side of the Catalyst Circle. The proposal does adress a very important aspect/problem, and provides a potential long term solution by creating a system that will make handling of the Cardano Circles \"Treasury\" more easily manageable and transparent. Both for current generations of the Catalyst Circle, and future ones. The solution that the proposal suggests is a long term one, which speaks of understanding the Catalyst \"machinery\" as a whole and with hopes of optimizing efficiency for everyone involved. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal presents the core team which does seem to have experience within the Cardano Community, even though the current team has no funded proposals behind them. They do seem to be active in finalizing a funded proposal from Fund6, but here it would be helpful with some links or further \"proof\" that the actual team will be involved. Currently, LinkedIn profiles are provided, but one of them doesn't work and the rest doesn't speak for the experience in accounting and business operations. Had the proposal included these, the team would be presented in a lot more credible and clear way. \u2028I am by no means an accountant, but from my experience in managing organizations and communities, I do know the importance of having experts working on the economical side of things. The proposals suggestions to how to manage the Cardano Circle Treasury is presented in a very clear way, step by step. Since the proposal is focusing on a shorter timeframe (3 months), the budget allocation seems reasonable only asking for roughly 5% of the total challenge budget. The budget allocation also includes estimated work hours and distribution of resources, which further increase the credibility of the proposal. I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is very clear and spans over a course of 3 months, basically until next fund(8). In order to make it even clearer, I would have liked to see estimated timeframes on all of the milestones, since the only timeframe provided is the first one (12 Dec-2021). The team promises to have the created system as open source, which is a wonderful way of increasing the transparency of the project. How will the community be able to follow the development, apart from through GitHub? It is somewhat complex to find more \"open\" measurements of success since it is created for a very small and specialized part of the community, but how about sharing the progress of testing the system or development updates via social media channels or TownHall etc? Also worth mentioning is that the team for this proposal might change with the next fund, if I understood the proposal correctly. That means transparency is of utmost importance if the developing team is meant to change throughout different stages. I might have misinterpreted the proposal, but maybe the proposal could present the long term plans in a more clear way? Perhaps include a less detailed vision-plan for upcoming funds (8-9) to invite the community to take part of the long term plan. Lastly, I would have liked to see a short section where the team describes few of the challenges or risks that might appear during the development phase, and how they plan to deal with those. Perspective will always be important in any situation, and hat would lead me as a community member to have even more faith in the proposal. I neither agree or disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
