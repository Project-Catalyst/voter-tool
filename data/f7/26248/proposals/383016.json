The project aims to further develop their already existing information hub, where you can find all sorts of information that is built upon and related to Cardano. Having been active in the community for quite a while it is my opinion that this has an important role to play. Especially now since the recent Alonzo upgrade, Cardano is growing exponentially even though the number of projects are relatively small. The goal of the project is not just to help people navigate the ecosystem, but also attract new people into it. I would agree with the challenges of finding what you seek (as the problem statement suggests), and the solution proposed in the proposal will do just that if it will work as intended. The fact that one part of their development goals is to reach out to people not currently involved in Cardano, helping the community grow is very rarely emphasized within proposals, in my experience as a Community Advisor. \r\nI would strongly agree that this proposal not only effectively addresses the challenge effectively, but that it pinpoints a strong need within the community and the future development in the entire Cardano Ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is well known within the community (with around 75 000 unique visitors per month), and the long term goals are presented in a clear way. It would be beneficial to the proposal if we could know more about the core team members and their individual expertise and experience (along with some useful links) within the actual proposal. Considering that the team already has a working and well received project, it speaks for commitment, understanding about the community and competency from the team. The goals themselves tick many boxes as to what anyone being involved with Cardano might need, from information about stake pools, searching NFTs by category, informing the community about ISPOs and upcoming projects along with a lot more valuable information. The proposal asks for quite a substantial amount, 45 000 USD or roughly 1/4 of the total challenge budget. This will (according to the proposer) be enough to sustain and scale the project massively during the course of one year. Considering the scope of what the proposal aims to achieve, that seems like a reasonable number. In order for the proposal to be a bit more credible, I would have liked to see a bit more detail in the budget breakdown. For example, out of the 45 000 requested, how much will be distributed to platform development? How many developers will be working, and how many hours per week etc. Based on the reasons stated above, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a list of very clear and measurable deliverables on a timeframe over 1 year. I would have preferred if the road map would've been a lot more detailed, breaking down the timeframe in milestones of 3, 6 and 12 months (for example). In this way we would be able to follow the intended progress step by step, even if the project would fall behind schedule the community would be able to follow the process. The fact that the project is active on their social media channels speaks of a good relationship with the community. More importantly, according to the proposal they rely on the feedback they get from both community members and IOHK, which implies the motive of having high levels of transparency and collaborations. Something that is further emphasized at several places in the proposal. From my experience as a Community advisor, I believe it would benefit the proposal further to have some measurements of success (KPI) details. With the addition of an estimated number of unique monthly visitors by a certain time on the roadmap, we would know where the project aims to be and what would be needed for it to be there. (Similar to what I mentioned above regarding milestones)\r\nA short discussion on the potential risks and challenges that might occur during development would also strengthen the credibility of the teams understanding of their project, which in turn leads to increased trust from people observing from the outside. Overall, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
