I've been involved in Project Catlyst since Fund 2 as a CA, but have been in the orbit of the Cardano/IOHK/Charles Hoskinson fan club (cult? - just kidding) community since 2017. Also performed as a vCA and a winning proposer for the Challenge Setting challenge. I've never actually taken part in a team of proposers in a regular challenge - and this proposal actually tackles one of the reasons. It is difficult to partner up with relative \"strangers\" from around the world and invest a lot of time in a project, only to find out that you have some fundamental differences in understanding - that may end up derailing the project two months later. Hence, the proposed cration of template(s) suitable to serve as teaming agreements tailored to Catalyst funded proposals - is a fabulous idea. I see that its impact can be really large - as these agreements will serve as a building block of trust that will enable globally-dispersed proposers and teams to team up easier and waste little time (the most precious resource of all) on building trust. There will be no need to rebuild teams from scratch every time a new proposal or team is set up. Furthermore, these teaming agreements will have an important role in verifying what is going right/wrong during the implementation of a project and will potentially also help Challenge Teams to mediate or advise teams with such Teaming Agreements. Of course, as this is the Miscellaneous Challenge - it is perfectly placed - as it fits in the heart of Catalyst, but nowhere in particular. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As deliverables go the team will deliver universal templates can be used by all Catalyst proposing teams going forward. The budget has been broken down to key components: $3,000 for attorney fees. $1,000 each for two team members for two months.Totaling $7,000. The attorney will obviously need detailed guidance about Catalyst, Cardano and the proposal funding system - and wide varieties of legal niceties that need to be addressed. So its a job that requires a Catalyst savvy team to lead, business expertise & legal expertise. The proposal provides a very straightforward plan for implementation and delivery that shows the team will produce one short form and one long form template in editable format. The templates will be provided for free and will be completed before Fund 8 finalization date, or within two months. The proposer has also considered possible pitfalls and problems - and in the spirit of the proposal - they intend to sign their own project teaming agreement upon notice that the project has been approved for funding. The most significant risk has been considered - whether a suitable legal expert can be found. They are already considering attorneys in several jurisdictions. The team has already worked together on several projects, meaning it is a stable team.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\r\nThanks to the tight deadlines (two months for delivery), narrow focus and identifiable output (understandable to most Catalyst members), it will not be burdensome to audit the implementation of this proposal. If the proposal is not approved this Fund, I would suggest to the team to flesh out key areas that they want to see in the Teaming Agreement Templates and include them in a proposal resubmission. I think that Catalyst needs Teaming Agreement Templates, especially as it will directly benefit Proposers - who need all the help they can get. When I say \"key areas\", I mean defining possible subheadings or headings of a Teaming Agreement Template like: \"Division of responsibilities\", \"Roles\", Decision making process\" \"Remuneration\" \"Communication etc... so that you can lllustrate the breadth of the final product that you have in mind and you might get valuable suggestions from the community. Maybe during the process - you can also invite some comments from the community - before the final version is delivered.

The potential for high impact is sound and would be beneficial to the Project catalyst community. Alignment to this challenge is valid although could have also fit into the improve and grow auditability challenge. However, I am comfortable that this proposal meets the challenge selected. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has provided sound evidence that they have the knowledge and skillset to complete the proposal. The plan is not overly detailed but considering they are outcome is fairly straightforward I feel they are capable of delivering on this proposal. The budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals although I do feel that this may become a larger project in the future, this proposal signifies a good start.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is good and the rationale is explicit, the budget is basic without detail and yet for this proposal I think it is adequate. The one aspect missing for me which would have allowed five stars on auditability would have been to already have an attorney engaged (subject to funding) and this would have allowed a stronger budget breakdown, allowed greater auditable KPI's plus would have addressed the identified risk ( to find a suitably qualified attorney). Failing that a plan on finding that attorney would have been an adequate alternative route for this team to follow without undue extra work pre-funding.

Indeed, people strange to each other working together might generate conflicts but it would be nice to bring solid examples or carry out surveys with previous funded proposers to really assess the size of this issue, and, consequently, the impact of this proposal (specially as it is within miscellaneous challenge).\n\nOther point of concern here would be to add an extra beurocracy to proposers (besides running the project and reporting) and to what extent this document would have legal value considering all regions of the globe, as proposers are all spread out. If no legal value is intended then a template ellaborated by an attorney might be too much, maybe an standard written agreement with responsabilities, rights and liabilities created by proposers (or following a methodology, as RACI Matrix + team charters) could be enough, if the team thinks it would help.\n\nAs a last suggestion, it would be imporant to see here how these templates would be built with the community (i.e. interaction bewtween attorney, the team and community/stakeholders). I see the a very iterative process where regular feedback from users is imporant. Potential to apply an agile method.\n\nAll in all, having the rights, responsabilities and liabilities clearly defined in the begining of a project is key, but it is still not clear the value of hiring an attorney to develop this compared to existing methodologies available everywhere.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the team, theres a good description of both member experience and capabilities, which seems enough and there are linkedin links to verify this. However an external attourney would still have to be hired (although there is a mitigation strategy for this risk).\n\nTheres no clear plan on how the templates would be developed. I'd include a timeline separated in weeks including acitivites like scouting and hiring the attourney, developing the template, validating the template with key users (pilot), expanding it to catalyst as a whole. It would help to make sure all the proper steps are followed.\n\nLast, theres a good budget breakdown but the project seems a bit expensive in relation to its final deliverable.\n\n \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As there's no clear plan, theres no milestone defined. There only 2 or 3 final deliverables, which are good one, but could have some more kpis  after implementation, as how many funded proposers are using these templates (and check their usage increase over time) and some way to assess its final quality. \nI particularly liked the risk strategy put in place here.

And as the proposer clearly articulated in plain-speak, such an agreement establishes clear boundaries for responsibilities and rewards for different people working towards the same goal. This will deliver a good positive impact to Catalyst and could further promote the sharing of workloads and expertise, and could potentially lead to higher quality proposals and funded projects. As a former tender assessor for a university who had never been surprised like this, I provide my strong agreement to its impact and alignment. Good luck", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I do not discount the legal complexity which will need to be navigated by this proposal to ensure delivery of 'Teaming' agreement templates covering the jurisdictions from where Catalyst teaming members come from, however the goals of this proposal is, to put it plainly, very simple and highly achievable. It is a relief that the chunk of the requested fund is reserved for the lawyers to ensure the templates are developed within the legal framework. Casting a legal eye is a must-have requirement in order for such an agreement to be useable. The two proposers have presented their LinkedIN profiles as well as descriptions of real-life experiences which would be valuable in crafting the templates. That they themselves will be the pilot of the 'teaming' agreement should this proposal gets funded reflects the viability of the claimed timelines. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the claims of using this proposal as the pilot for the teaming document makes it highly auditable and effectively, immediate. The team could make their agreement public as soon as project Catalyst announces the winners in Fund 8. Notwithstanding, I assume the presentation of the short and long form templates will involve Project Catalyst and its channels should the IOG arm decide to certify the document for use. My only suggestion is with regards to the team's claim that the template would be open for review by the community, which is another audit point; they failed to mention where this 'report' may be published or sourced. In any case, Len is quite an active participant in IOG Catalyst Telegrams and could be contacted via those channels if clarity or updates are required.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 10, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create template(s) suitable to serve as teaming agreements tailored to Catalyst funded proposals.", "experience": "30y+. in small business partnerships in various tax jurisdictions, having learned many lessons along that journey.
