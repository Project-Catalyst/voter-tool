However, in his solution he states that governments rely on science in their policies, but this would usually refer to either peer reviewed papers that are in highly regarded national or international journals, or internal government papers. So I doubt that his solution would fit his vision of how science can impact governmental decisions. It is also unclear if the page would reward scholars for their peer reviews and how the onboarding process would work and how this proposer would create a digital identity of the researchers on the platform to verify that they are fit to peer review other research.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer wants to set up a team after funding - which means, at the moment feasability is not assessible, since there is no team and the proposer themselves does not have the necessary skillset. I\u00b4m a researcher with more than 7 years of experience and I have gone through several rounds of having my own papers peer reviewed and published in academic journals and I am also an academic peer reviewer myself and I find it problematic to be so casual about the peer review process for actual science papers. Peer review processes in academic journals are generally blind, so the reviewers do not know the authors of the paper. I find that the chance of corruption and creating bias is higher on an anonymous networking platform where papers are connected to upvoting. I do not think that science requires \"upvoting\" and I think this is exactly what causes bias. There is also \"researchgate\", which is an open access research platform that is globally accessible and does kind of what this proposer is trying to set up. The question is, why would this solution be better than the existing one and the other question is, whether it is useful to create an extra space for researchers in the crypto field as this would detach their findings more from general research. I would also want to know, how the papers on this networking site would get published? How will he connect the page to academic journals - which is where researchers publish papers in order to be cited, listed on the academic search engines and so forth. So basically, by excluding the research of some fields onto a networking site, as a result this research will actually be less visible and connected as it is probably not going to be listed in the usual science databases. Generally, what I\u00b4m saying with all these words is - the proposer has forgotten to take most of the issues that go together with publishing research into account and should put more work into making clear, why an extra repository/ social media for researchers in this field would be necessary and how to avoid small group bias and how to make sure that quality standards for science don\u00b4t get affected.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To create this platform, the proposer would have had to mention some of the risks involved when dealing with science. Just stating that they want to change something is not viable. Peer review processes for academic research should require a specific knowledge in this area and in the area of research designs, peer reviewers must be able to detect internal and external validity issues. Since there is no mentioning of any digital identity of the scientific community members, auditability of the project itself is difficult. Other issues concerning auditability are in regards to the budget allocation being just 30%/40%/30% on three categories without giving any specifications. This would be relevant since the proposer is asking for the whole amount of funding of this challenge. Without a team, auditability is also difficult since the relevant skillset can\u00b4t be assessed. Risks have not been addressed.
