The core idea aims to use deep learning algorithms to expand the ways to do non-invasive geographical analysis. It would benefit the proposal highly to include some information on how this would be relevant to the Cardano Ecosystem directly, and how the proposal aims to integrate into/use Cardano. The proposal is very briefly explained and would need more information about the actual product and process in order to be understood and assessed. These two key points mentioned would increase the understandability of the project and strengthen the problem statement. In my experience as a Community Advisor for several funds, having a clear connection to Cardano along with a clear problem statement followed up with an understandable and detailed solution is key while drafting proposals. At the moment due to the lack of information, it is hard to comprehend the scope of the project (timeframes, milestones, costs etc. But), but we'll get to that later. Based on these aspects mentioned above, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal could use a lot more information of the process of development, along with a description on how the geological analysis techniques will be developed and used, and what their impact is in contrast to currently used ones. I am by no means a geologist but I do have a fair bit of experience working as a researcher, and I would suggest adding more detail in the proposal in order to make it more understandable and tangible. Both for people with domain expertise in geology, but also for those without. \u2028It would also be beneficial with a presentation of the core team/proposers who will be working on the project. How many years experience with geology does the team have, does it consist of several members, is the prototype for geological analysis (mentioned under 'relevant experience') used today? Where can we learn more about it? Is the product aimed to be used with academics? More importantly after answering all of these questions, I would suggest providing a verifiable source that can further strengthen the competency and experience of the team members. Maybe through LinkedIn-profiles, partnered universities, etc. Lastly, I would have liked to see a more detailed budget plan included. How much money will be used for development, materials etc. And how many working hours are estimated from start to finish (maybe per week)? All in all, due to the lack of necessary information, I strongly disagree that it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As mentioned before, this proposal would benefit highly from having a roadmap included with milestones on an estimated timeframe. This way it could be audited in a transparent way, and the community would be able to follow the progress during development (preferably through media channels or website of the project). Some suggestions of key questions to answer: How many months/years will it take to develop the initial prototype? How will it be tested and by whom? How long will the testing phase be and how will success be measured (KPIs)? \u2028Also, what happens if something unexpected goes wrong during development? How does the team aim to combat potential challenges during the process? Having a short text on reflections on these questions from the team included in the proposal will strengthen the credibility and perspective of the team, and if those reflections are shared with the community it will strengthen the overall trust and transparency of the whole project. Because of the reasons just described, I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information in its ability to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

The solution, while it does address the problem statement, is too vague in my opinion and again it is unclear what the role of Cardano, or blockchain for that matter, would play here.

The nature of this project requires state permission as well as a high level of expertise in geology.
