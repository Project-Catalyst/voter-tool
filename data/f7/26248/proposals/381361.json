By connecting to and gathering input from both voters, SPOs, potential voters and involving influencers in the process, the Catalyst would receive an incredible amount of invaluable information. Especially since Voltaire is in the works. The proposal feature a clear problem statement, and the solution of obtaining info from a large number of ADA voters is very much aligned. Considering that this proposal could be beneficial on so many different levels in the development of the Cardano Ecosystem (adoption, involvement from voters and decentralization), I believe this is a very good use of the funds distributed. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The core team consists of some of the more well known people involved in Catalyst, and necessary proof of both expertise and experience is presented in detail. Just the fact that AIM has provided the Catalyst community with invaluable assets like the CA-tools and voter-tool is heavy proof of the commitment and skills of the team, along with a strong determination to develop the whole machinery of Catalyst. Having several proposals funded from previous funds also strengthen the credibility and competency of the team. \u2028There is a very detailed plan provided in the proposal, there is even a \"prologue\" section explaining the background and reasoning behind creating it, which is quite rare from my experience as a Community Advisor. The budget allocation is somewhat substantial asking for 25% of the total budget for the challenge, but considering the amount of outreach and possible impact that the proposal aims to achieve, I would say that this amount almost is too small. Especially since almost half of the requested funds will be distributed among the participants of the survey, the community. The proposal feature a somewhat realistic timeframe of roughly 5 months, which might be a little ambitious considering a big part of the process is involving a very large amount of people from different areas. Due to the help of the network, influencers and experience of the team, It sounds very achievable despite its ambitious timeframe. I strongly agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A roadmap with clear deliverables, milestones and timeframes are provided in the proposal. Success indicators will be easily measurable due to the statistical nature of the survey, as will the analysis process. Reading through the proposal, the team aims to share the results and process via weekly town halls and channels, where many community members dwell. If the proposal gets funded, it might also lead a lot of new people to attend these town halls after attending the survey. I really like that the team will present the results of the survey publicly first, and then another time after processing the collected data through some statistical analysis (and presenting those results to the public). In my experience as a researcher, that way of processing and analyzing data and sharing it with the community is a very nice way of working, and to achieve interesting results while keeping in contact with the community. Also using the network (SPOs, influencers, voters, CAs, townhalls etc) is a wonderful way to keep the community updated on (or introducing) people to Catalyst. The team show a deep understanding of potential challenges by having perspective on past, present and future development of the ecosystem. All in all, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

The team shares that they got 300 people to provide feedback in their first round of this project. It is not confirmed whether they have prevented multiple people from submitting the same feedback if it was incentivised as there is a reason for people to do that. It is hard to say whether this proposal will definitely have impact as even with other people sharing the survey if the incentivisation is only $10,000 there will be a limit to how many responses that can be achieved. If 1000 responses are achieved then this would be a cost of $50 per response and $10 for the voter. To agree that this would be impactful usage of treasury funds a good break down would be needed of exactly what questions are asked and why with good reasoning to back it up so that the confidence is high that the resulting data set is of a high value. Getting more data on voters is definitely a potentially impactful area of focus so these efforts are worthwhile. Some more resources and justifications on the exact survey questions and data to be collected would be useful for an advisor to have higher confidence in the potential impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team are listed with most of the members including their LinkedIn profile. The team are frequently engaged in the Catalyst community in different tools and parts of the governance process. The budget is broken down into a few key areas. There is no doubt that this proposal is feasible as it is a case of updating the survey, sharing it and measuring the results. The key areas of feasibility to question is the quality of the questions and data that is collected, from what has been provided it is not clear whether  the survey has been broken down into all potential focus areas and then analysed for their usefulness in the survey. The team does state they will seek out expert advice and recommendations from those with professional experience crafting high-quality surveys. It would be good to have more information on who they have in mind for this as this can really determine how feasible the proposal is in being executed well. It would be good to see a lower overall budget for this proposal that upon completion helps to showcase an effective survey structure and quality data responses. Once this is easy to confirm in the community it could be integrated into the voting process more closely where there would be less friction in getting responses. Currently the feasibility of getting responses on a larger scale is unknown for this proposal and poses a moderate risk as the team will want to get enough voter responses to justify the cost.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal is well structured and has high clarity that is made easier with the previous example they have from fund 6 to give context. Some success indicators are provided however they are appear to be more completion milestones than anything. In terms of auditability this is where it would be great to see more specific KPIs on areas of the data they are analysing which showcase the value of the survey. This would give a lot more confidence that the team fully understand and can articulate all the different relevant data components of the survey and what they are looking for to analyse. The proposers mention the results and data will be public that will be good for the community to audit whether this approach should be continued in the future.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal brings contributions for future improvements of the Cardano ecosystem.
