Huge opportunity exists for NFTs that help protect natural environments & animals.", "funded": 0, "upvotes": 16355369, "downvotes": 19596400, "votes_result": 3241031, "votes_cast": 85, "f6_no_assessments": 4, "f6_rating": 3.583333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"q0": "The problem statement is presented in a reasonable and clear way, and in alignment with the challenge brief since there isn't a challenge that are heavily focused on NFTs this fund. Currently, there are numerous NFT markets but not many have been emphasizing use cases outside of the art aspect. Even fewer have decided to focus on the support and wellbeing of animals and environment, making (in my opinion) the direction of the proposal attractive and a unique contribution to the Cardano ecosystem.  From my understanding, the proposal has the potential and intention to work both on a local and global level, inviting both organizations, community members and retail investors for involvement in the project. As stated in the proposal, the project has the potential to be varied on many different levels, from organizations to individuals all over the world. Especially when focused on a topic that is highly relevant and have a broad spectra, sustainability. The proposal also inspires a broad set of use cases within the same topic, within the same platform you could choose to support an endangered species (maybe through partnering up with an organization) or support the local animal shelter in your home town. The scale of the proposal is massive, which may explain the substantial amount of funding. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The 7 core team members cover an impressive area of complimentary expertise and experience in the field related to the proposal. Both from the perspective of being active members and contributors to the Cardano ecosystem, and having decades of experience with working in the field of environmental development and animal rights. Sufficient information on each team member is provided through their respective LinkedIn profiles. Having already gone through the process of creating a functioning platform (DignifID) is increasing the trustworthiness and credibility of the team. \r\nAs stated before, the budget is rather substantial being a bit more than 20% of the total budget for the challenge, but it makes sense considering that the proposer wants to launch a multilingual (fantastic addition) NFT minting web portal AND multilingual marketplace web portal within the time frame of 3 months (More on that later). The allocations of the budget is presented in a clear way, and the fact that their previously created platform (DignifID) is helping to cover the costs of the launch leads me to believe that the team has planned for sudden changes in the budget allocation. \r\n\r\nThe 1 year-project plan is laid out in a clear and structured way, but I would have liked to see more detailed information about the different stages in the plan. Adding information about where the process of creating the platform and tool currently is would make it easier to assess the feasibility of the proposal. Out of the information provided in the proposal, I'm assuming that the development is underway, but it would be nice to see some further clarification included in the proposal. One addition that would benefit the proposal greatly is a more detailed budget breakdown of the budget allocations. For example: How many people will be working on external marketing and comms service, how many working hours per week? How many active team members will be working on the project and for how long? The budget allocation is fairly clear, but an estimate of the scope of the working hours should make it even clearer, in my opinion as a Community Advisor. \r\n\r\nAlso, how does the outreach look like? The proposal does give a hint of ongoing contracts with associated actors through their previous platform (DignifID), but it is unclear if they aim to use their connections from before or are in need of a completely new base of connections. The information provided lends me to believe that the main outreach will be through organizations at first, and then being in contact with people through them. (Which is in itself a pretty smart idea). Overall, I agree that this proposal will be implanted successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a roadmap with milestones included, presented in a clear and understandable way (with 3 months, 6 months, 12 months as timeframes). In order to increase the audibility, the proposer could have added some KPIs and metrics that would help people outside of the organization to better understand if the milestones are achieved or not. For example, how many users does the project expect to host after 6 months? How much of the NFT revenue is allocated into the protection of animals and the environment, and what is the expected traffic after 3, 6 and 12 months of uptime? Is it concentrated on global spread right away or is there a plan for extending or developing from a few local areas/organizations?  I believe that answering these questions would invite the community to audit the growth process more clearly. \r\nIn order to further increase the trustworthiness and credibility of the team and proposal, I would have liked to see a list of potential risks and challenges. From my understanding of the NFT-space, it is full of organizations and artists minting animal-themed NFTs. How do the proposer plan to emphasize their underlying unique selling point (sustainability, environment and animal wellbeing) as much as possible, in order to separate themselves from 'Bored apes' or 'Stoner animals'? There is a whole lot of potential in the idea and values behind this project, and I would've liked to see examples of how this project would emphasize the strong core values behind the product. Overall, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.
