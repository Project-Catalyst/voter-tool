After carefully reading through the values, goals and processes on their website, I would say (from my experience in working as a researcher) that the DAO follows good academic standards and procedures. Cardano already has a reputation of being thorough in its research and development, and from my understanding and opinion this proposal/project helps Cardano being more of what it already is and aims to be. More peer reviewed research will not only increase opportunities in collaborating with universities, but also expand and develop blockchain science as a whole, while strengthening the credibility of what already has been researched. It is a slow process, but a process focused on long term survivability and development. The requested funding is pretty substantial covering 50% of the total challenge budget, but with a long term perspective, it seems like a worthwhile investment. This of course depends on if the project aims to apply for future funds. I would make a case that this proposal belongs in the miscellaneous challenge more than the DAOs love Cardano-challenge, since this is focusing on an actual DAO, and not a tool developed for making it easier for DAOs to be integrated into Cardano. I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses this challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The core team (of 9 members) does seem to have a good understanding of the Cardano ecosystem and in the Academic field. In my experience of academia, having team members of many different academic levels (and universities across 3 continents, which the team states it has) is beneficial in order to cover many different levels of outreach. What I would have liked to see is a detailed presentation of the core team and maybe some examples of their partnering universities. Maybe my limited experience of decentralized organizations is creating misconceptions (I will stand corrected if that is the case), but decentralized does not stand for anonymous. One aspect that speaks very well for the level of feasibility of the proposal is the fact that the project is already up and running, with partnerships from several other Blockchains (The Harmony network, to mention One. Pun intended). If the project suffers from challenges during development and scaling, it does not solely rely on the potential funding it would receive from the Cardano Ecosystem. \u2028I would also like to see a more in depth of the budget allocation included in the proposal. Currently, the only information included is the total funds (100k, 50% of the total challenge budget), and that the team aims to use those funds to cover travel costs and attendance of conferences. Which is really good, but I'm having a hard time believing that the whole requested budget will be allocated to that. Possible inclusions could be: How much of the requested funds will be allocated to attendance of conferences? How much will cover website development? Will any of the funds go to the core team? Or will most of it be allocated to fund further research papers in Blockchain development (the latter is hinted at in the proposal, but could be presented more clearly with estimated numbers included). The goals, plan, development and processes are very clear after reading through their documents on their website. All in all, I agree (albeit barely) that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully (since it is already a working project aiming to do more of than it already does).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The deliverables are clear and reasonable, it mainly includes giving PhD students possibilities to present their works at numerous conferences (with a focus on underfunded universities and institutions) and creating research grants for researchers wanting to do research on blockchain related/cryptographic areas (Specified on the website clearly). The milestones  of the project is basically only is described as increasing the scale of these concepts, which I believe (as a researcher and Community Advisor) is good in its simplicity. It would further strengthen the proposal if it had included some details on measurements of success (how many students to conferences, how many partnering universities in what timeframe, how many papers or projects funded, etc.)\u2028Since the research will be peer reviewed and that audits are common practice in any academia, it will be possible for anyone (even outside of the community) to follow the progress and development of the \"fruits of labor\" coming from this project. The website contains really good information on transparency/audits that seems legitimate and credible. \u2028Lastly, a discussion on potential risks and challenges of developing this project would increase both the credibility of the team (perspective is beneficial in any project) and minimizing the risk of potential pitfalls during development. Conclusively, I agree that the proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

I've been involved in Catalyst since the early Fund 2 as a CA, and then as a vCA and proposer. I've been in the Cardano orbit since 2017 and have been following relatively closely the evolution of the research in the space and the name of Dionysis Zindros has been brought up many times by Cardano ecosystem players when citing fundamental research that led to scientific breakthroughs in this space. The main idea behind Cardano is to decentralize everything -  in order to ensure the system remains able to evolve even if a major player is \"taken out\". We all know that the name of Cardano is synonymous with research and strong fundamentals. I personally have been worrying about how to decentralize fundamental research to ensure a pathway to the future that is not 100% dependent on IOG research funding - and this proposal is a sign in the right direction. The proposal has deep significance and importance for the Cardano ecosystem and is able to scale if it proves to be a success. It's not all about research - its also about attracting the best young minds to the best science-based blockchain platform. A marriage of the best with the best. Great idea to propose this Research DAO - as a pathway for funding open peer-reviewed academic research in the field of blockchain science. Why does does concern Cardano. As the proposer states: \"the Research DAO can be used to improve Cardano, as it will be open source and patent-free.\" Cardano is fundamental research ... baked into code and community. We are research in motion.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This kind of proposal could have come from anyone, but it didn't. It came from top level former IOG and Emurgo affiliated and University blockchain and cryptography, data and security researchers. The Research DAO's current governors are: Zeta Avarikioti (IST Austria), Foteini Baldimtsi (George Mason University), Joseph Bonneau (University of Melbourne), Sebastien Guillemot (dcSpark),  Angel Leon (FrostWire), Andrew Miller (UIUC), Dionysis Zindros (Stanford University).The names of the rest of the governors will be disclosed soon. This is a who's who of young and bright minds from the blockchain, cryptography, security and data privacy fields that any blockchain system would want to attract. To ensure independence, the Research DAO's people are from various universities around the world. They are proposing a novel way of decentralizing fundamental research and are willing to try it out through the Project Catalyst system. With the experience and plan presented it is certain the proposal will be implemented successfully - as everyone involved will learn from the project. Failure and success are success in this evolving field, as we need data, models, projects and practical attempts to decentralize research. The allocated budget corresponds to the planned stages of the DAO:  (a) travel grants to undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students, followed by (b)  larger grants to support the development of new research. Critically for the long-term success the DAO plans to establish a continuous stream of grants from funding partners and members so as to ensure continuous operations.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As the team specified, the entirety of funding will be made transparent by means of publication online on the dedicated website https://researchdao.io/. Additionally, the body of research funded by the DAO will be published under an open license for both the papers and the code, making it reusable for the broader ecosystem. As the initial phase will involve funding travel grants to undergraduate, graduate, and PhD students who have been accepted to present their research papers in peer-reviewed conferences of the field (initially Financial Cryptography 2022) - I expect that potential auditors will have an relatively job verifying the details as the involved persons are prominent researchers in the space.
