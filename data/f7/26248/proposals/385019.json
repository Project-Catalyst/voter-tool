From my understanding of the proposal, this is meant to assure that the quality between versions is kept and that the new circle will have a solid foundation to stand on when starting anew. Considering that Catalyst Governance is constantly changing (aiming at decentralization) it is my opinion (as an experienced community member) that this would be very valuable in adding some stability in the people who are chosen to be part of the Catalyst Circle. It would affect the whole ecosystem of Catalyst, and with growing importance in the Cardano ecosystem as a whole affect the whole Cardano community positively. Since the requested funds only takes up 5% of the total challenge budget it seems like a very small economical investment for a long term  investment in the ecosystem as a whole. The solution is directly correlated with the problem statement both on a macro and micro perspective, and details on the process are explained clearly within the proposal. Being experienced community members of Cardano and Catalyst, the people involved have deep understanding of the process and project. Overall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The people involved are all well known members of the Catalyst community. At the time of writing this proposal, ideascale has anonymized the proposers profiles, making it hard to verify the experience and identity of the proposing team. The detailed plan of the proposal provides us with a clear structure and underlying explanations and reasoning for the choices made. I like the idea of integrating CCv1, even though their serving period is officially ended. From the time that I've been involved in Catalyst, I agree with the proposers focus in involving past CC members in order to get a broader perspective and maximize the learnings. Aiming to refine the election process for CCv3 is also a nice inclusion in the goals for the proposal. Budget breakdown is presented clearly with allocations of funds to the members of CCv1/CCv2, all of which are well known within the community. I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A list of clear deliverables are provided in the proposal, along with some KPIs split between CCv1 and CCv2. In order to increase the strength and clarity of the proposal, I would have liked to see an estimated timeframe included in the roadmap. Even though we know that each CC serves for 3 months and that the proposal aims to focus on CCv1/v2 and to some extent CCv3, it would be beneficial to include a clearer picture of the estimated timeframe. I might be missing some information or misinterpreting, but if this proposal will work in conjunction with the Catalyst Circles, it would also mean that information on progress may be included in the weekly town halls? If that is the case, it would be a good way for people to be able to follow the progress of the proposals success, and transparency of the whole project. I also would like to see some reflections of risk management, or potential challenges (and how the team aims to deal with them) that might arise. It would further increase the credibility of the proposal and team behind it, and increase trust in the Catalyst Circle since it would show the teams ability to have perspective. Overall, I agree that the proposal provides me with sufficient information in order to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

In order for Catalyst Circle to evolve and improve as time passes, new members will need to be able to jump right into their tasks and responsibilities without much time for learning on their own.  This creates a need for the former members to mentor and guide the new ones in the way of passing on advice, tips, and suggestions for even what not to do.  It is fair to say that decentralization is the most important aspect to the future of Cardano, and this proposal does a good job of explaining how solving this issue (uncompensated alumni) will contribute to Cardano's future governance.  Everyone's time is more and more valuable these days and it is a great idea to incentivize the alumni to provide their time and effort toward mentorship of new members.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is different than most, in its simplicity for what the issue at hand is, and its simplicity for how to solve it.  There really is no technical explanation required and there are only a few variables to consider.  The budget is broken down into v1 and v2 of the Catalyst Circle, but not as far as how each alumnus will be compensated.  The budget is reasonable and does not take away from other potential projects.  It could be beneficial for voters who aren't aware of how many members there are in the Circle to know how each member will be compensated, but all in all this is a good idea and easy to execute so that future Catalyst Circles will be well equipped to do their jobs.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As stated above the complexity of the roadmap and KPI's for this proposal isn't held to the same standard as most proposals because of the simplicity and necessity of what the proposal is asking for.  However, it may be beneficial to include a required number of meetings with new members for the alumni so that they know what is expected of them and how they must manage their personal time.  I believe that the problem and solution are clearly defined.  It is also clear that the problem has the potential to grow in the future if alumni have no incentive to mentor new members once their time has been served.  We all want Cardano and its governance system to eventually be fully decentralized and successful.  This proposal is obviously one of the first steps that needs to be taken to ensure that happens.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_990", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 17, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Cardano Circle has added value and provided a core base for the community to take responsibility.

It is just a request to the community to pay for the services rendered by Community circle members. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is for paying an outgoing member to mentor the new incumbent.
