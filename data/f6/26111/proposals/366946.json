At first, I thought that it might be on the wrong challenge. However, training multilingual developers to allow them to create content and cooperate with entrepreneurs which don't speak English is amazing.\r\n- I have no idea how the African's countries in relation with English language, but I imagine it might be a bit like Brazil, which it's not the majority of the population which speaks English. Therefore enabling people to dev in it's own language and obligating the trainees to train  is a good starting point.\r\n- It's quite scalable as well, since the course is going to be in English, therefore, the more language the better.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- One point that I'm imagining is that the marketing might be thought differently to each country and, therefore, it might get hard. I wonder if the non-English speakers devs might not know how is the best way to advertise in their country and this might be a problem. Since this is a crucial point in this project (it'll worth nothing if the devs can't create awareness about DLT in their countries to offer the service), it might be good to add a marketing specialist in the team. That said, maybe you'll need more money to make this done.\r\n- How are you planning to continue with this project after the funding? How much the course will cost and how many students it must have to cover all the costs? Imagining that the currency in some African's countries are not favorable compared to dollar, it might be hard to find a worthful value to them.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "- I think it's pretty auditable since we'll be able to see the attendance and the number of different languages involved in the course (info that should be displayed in the platform together with the countries attending (portugues from Portugal is a bit different if compared with Brazilian one, e.g.).\r\n- The only point that might be hard is the individual marketing, since it must be done in each country to each specific public.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal identifies a big problem within the challenge which needs to be solved.
