The argument that development and curation of a \"corpus of graphics and diagrams that illustrate how blockchains esp. Cardano works\", if adopted by the community, could help rapidly increase worldwide adoption seems justified, especially contrasted to approaches which \"only address the Cardano non-English gap one language at a time\".  Missing for me was more clarity on how the proposer aims to ensure adoption to make this impactful and a clearer explanation of how they envision its place in the eco-system.

Additionally, the project seems complex enough as to probably require more of a team, and no information, evidence or acknowledgement is offered on this or plans for this - especially regarding the more \"business\" end.  Being somewhat similar to the proposer, I am aware of my own limitations in these fields and would feel it is more appropriate to make these explicit.  Difficult to assess likelihood of success without further details about how it is planned to be integrated into the community: the given plan to \"Connect w vetted community-contributed/connected graphics to platforms\" and \"Integrate corpus into larger existing service\" are vague.  The budgeting is detailed and seems to have been well-researched with specific figures, however from my experience in projects the other parts of the plan may need to be made to match this level of detail to increase likelihood of success.  Given the evidence, I estimate a moderate likelihood of successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "A suitable timeline is given for delivering elements of the project.
