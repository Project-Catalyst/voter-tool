What is missing is a clear plan for which languages will be supported, thus is is hard to know if the funds requested are appropriate, and to know what they actually intend to deliver.  How many word is the current knowledge base? What does the budget work out as in $/word/language?\r\nIf your site is currently only in English, how are you going to market to bring non-English users onboard? Or do you have a large number of users from non-English speaking backgrounds already that would benefit from documents in their own languages? If so do you have numbers on that?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Whilst conversion of an existing knowledge base into other languages is a simple goal, this plan lack a clear direction for what languages will be supported. At one point Japanese character support is listed, then later Chinese, Arabic and Spanish are discussed. Are all 4 being provided? This makes it very hard to audit progress.\r\nWhat would be success?

Having as much site as possibles in multiple languages would help to reach people who dont speak english. However, I'm not sure on the reach of this specific website. It would be good to have some access figures (totals, by country, etc) just to give an idea on the potential of the impact of this specific proposal (potential audience) - specially for those who dont know the site well.\r\nIf the the method used in the development of this idea presents itself good, it would also be nice to have it well documented and explained to be used in other similar websites (by method here I mean the way the languages will be chosen and the process which how data translatation will be done - will be there a review by others to ensure quality?). Also, not sure if voting which langues it should be translated would be the best way to solely pick the translations. Countries who never heard of this website because its only has a few english speakers will keep with no voice. Maybe the voting system could be combined with  other methods (population size, number of transactions, Cardano expansion strategy and so on)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The CENT team who already owns the site should have enough resource/capability to do the site remodeling but its not clear if the translators will be part of the team or just provide the translation as \"freelancers\".

Maybe having a MVP and sprints to test and get quick feedback from limited users on the site changes  before final deadline (3rd month) would help. There's a total budget but its not broken down so its noteasy to check if its reasonable.

In order to be completely auditable, there is an expectation from the voting members to see how the requested funds will be spent and on what. \r\nWill the $13000 requested be solely spent on site enhancements?

It relates only to multilingual support for the interface of a Cardano data site that provides information which is also readily available elsewhere. It also appears that the proposal may be mainly to allow alternate character sets to be displayed rather than providing translated documentation in multiple languages (this should be clearer). It is also not clear what it would mean for users to set their preferred site language -- what information would be displayed in that language? Some of the proposed functions also seem of limited use: notably it does not seem necessary to build a voting mechanism for users to choose new languages -- this could be done by a simple poll.

We have also seen in comparable cases for other solutions that the Cardano community gladly helps out when asked to help with transation to their native language.

This I feel would have added value to this proposal.
