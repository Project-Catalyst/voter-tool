Once enough content is created you can start doing marketing towards language groups that are ready for it. But we are at step one of a long process, just like the development of Cardano itself took and takes years to complete. In 2017 there were no ( short term ) parameters of success to be shown for Cardano itself. With educational programs it is similar.
