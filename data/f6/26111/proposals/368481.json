The key question however is,  how much will this increase non-English speakers involvement with Cardano. How big is the crypto community in Romania, how will you market to them, how many people do you expect this resource to draw in and over what time frames? What type of content do you expect to produce. Is this aimed at technical or non-technical users for instance?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has the ability to create this type of resource. However the proposal is lacking in detail. How big will  the initial KB resource be, what will it contain and when will it be produced by. How long will the funding cover the production of one article per week for? How are you going to market this to the Romanian community to draw people in?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A more detailed set of deliverables and associated timelines is required for progress on this proposal to be audited. What would success look like for this project? It needs to be more than just production of the KB. How many users are you targeting, and over what time frames? Can you measure their engagement? How many will go onto become active contributors to Cardano or Project Catalyst (as proposers or CA's, or running a SPO for instance?).", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposer identifies the problem of lack of content for the Romanian community and also the difficulty of access for non-English speakers. The proposer presents the solution of creating contents in romanian for the Community. It is not specified how much content will be produced or a deadline for carrying out the work. The proposer does not present a plan to keep the project sustainable after the Catalyst funding ends", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer does not show any evidence of his work and experience to implement the proposal. The number of team members that will implement the proposal is not specified. The budget is not detailed so it is not clear whether the requested budget is reasonable for the demand.

All we know is that he has many years of experience in the IT world and is also active in the cryptographic community.

Does he hold? Does he participate in any pool). It would also be important for the author to show his intention to hire a team, other professionals to help him in the creation and maintenance of the page (wiki) created here. They would be designers, to create a simple and ergonomic interface, content creators themselves, people who had a deep understanding of the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem, advertisers who helped to promote the page, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to retrieve this part of the proposal so that it is satisfactory, it is currently quite incomplete, unfortunately.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As in the previous comment, there is little detail regarding auditability. We know what the author (the team?) intends to do, which is basically to create this content platform related to Cardano in Romanian. And then, distribute that content to a list of interested parties. Right, but we would need to know, for example, how this platform would be created. About which pillars of the ecosystem the first contents would address, how this platform would be presented to the public, whether it would be through an application, a website, I don't know... It was also necessary to know who would be \"interested\", and how the content would reach them. It would also be important to establish other things such as: dates, to understand when each activity in a whole would happen; how would be the division of the money requested in the financing; which marketing plan; by what metrics the success of the proposal would be measured.
