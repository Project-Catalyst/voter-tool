In addition, from the point that the idea is to guarantee the security of smart contracts for users, it would be interesting to measure bugs/vulnerabilities that may occur after the audit as indicators.

Their technical medium articles seems to be pure hype and repetition of what else is already saying. They insistently stick to be a copy of Uniswap, but it seems from the recent concurrency debacle (caused by Minswap) that Uniswap model won't work on Cardano. SundaeSwap, ErgoDex, and Meld cleary provided clear working models, but Minswap keeps insisting on the broken account-based model, just giving ETH maxis more fuel to gon on and spreading false information.

I'm technical enough to see that Minswap runs a lot on the observation that many people in the community aren't technical enough to not know the difference, but the team clearly feels non-experienced. It's not a reason to dismiss them, but I've got to reflect that in star rating by taking at least one star off. What's worse, they admit openly to not have taken Plutus Pioneer course, which would be OK, if they'd be Haskell and Cardano OGs, but with testnet flop it clearly shows it's just pure arrogance.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The description barely covers the actual deliverable work. Minswap on its own is good project, but this proposal misses critical parts and have important questions unanswered. Further, Minswap contributes to the unhealthy trend of community funding audits.
