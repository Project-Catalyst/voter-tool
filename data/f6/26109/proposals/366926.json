", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is reasonably detailed and the team has the capability to deliver. I would like to see more information on the oracles. This cannot work without oracles. Do all the required oracles exist, o rare you going to build them, or are you hoping someone else will?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a detailed plan against which progress can be audited.

Perhaps we should track information on value locking in these contracts over various time frames to measure success. The proposers should also set some goals for these metrics against which the success is measured.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 3, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "In terms of impact, I think that a proposal like this could have an unexpectdly large impact. It took me some time to wrap my head around the concept of Synthetic Assets and then after understanding it - it took me some time to understand the logic behind it. Effectively, the bulk of the global population at any given time has not ability to invest in any given commodity, stock, currency or financial instrument ... unless we create a synthetic asset that fully and faithfully mimics the behaviour of the original asset. OK, you may say, but what if someone tinkers with it? What if they price doesn't match the real world price when you want to sell it? Well, this is where the oracles come in, as the price will not be determined by the issuer or by code, effectively it mirrors the real world price of the asset via integration with oracles such as Wolfram Alpha or other providers of real world pricing data. If this proposal is implemented as planned, it might revolutionize the DeFi space in a novel way - by bringing the flavour of the real world economy to Cardano. I know I've always wanted to opportunity to invest in assets that are unavailable in my jurisdiction and if this Plutus code enables me to do that via a proxy (synthetic assets on Indigo) - we will see not hundreds of thousands of users, but millions and millions. What might be missing - and a proposal of this type probably should include is more information about the legal ramifications of using Synthetic Assets and how they might be/are viewed by the US and other western legal systems. I understand that the team has addressed some concerns in the attached video - calling the proposed token a governance token, however, the proposal itself would have benefited from a clear analysis of the legal aspect - and because of this omission it may be not as strong. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe amazing thing about the proposal wasn't really reading just the text, but listening to the interview with the team. Dewayne Cameron, the Indigo Labs CIO, is more than impressive and has a fantastic command of the practical and theoretical aspects of this proposal. The fact that there is so much experience with Plutus, Catalyst, Cardano and fintech - makes the team exactly what a proposal of this scope and ambition needs. The Indigo Protocol technical documents are already being updated on a weekly basis and are fully available online. The proposed plan involving weekly milestones seems feasible and the budget seems realistic. I would have prefered to see a better outlined budget with more details. The fixed cost for this work of 65 engineering hours which is composed of developer's salary, accounting/taxes and VAT is: $60,000, meaning around $920/hour including tax and accounting - if I understand it well. Maybe I didn't understand well - but that could be attributed to the lack of budget details - and I would certainly advise the proposers to be more liberal with the budget information. Some technical / financial matters that were raised in the comments also seem relevant - and are dealt with in the White Paper on the INdigo web site. I enjoyed reading about the collateral ratio (cr) which is the ratio of the collateral value over the minted amount value. The key is to balance out the demand and supply and the proposers want to guarrantee stability by ensuring that when cr drops below the minimum threshold, the collateral of under-collateralized synthetic assets is liquidated to ensure solvency.... However, I think that with a project of this magnitude the devil will be in the details and design choices that the team will make. I would advise them to measure 7 times before they cut once. I am not sure that the team has considered all the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, I would have welcomed more introspection and the grading of risks - especially as this platform will involve other people's money and any failure will reflect on Cardano. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The very definition of the problem statement is often a clear sign of whether the team has thought out their plan well enough. The Indigo team chose their statement carefully in my view: \"Cardano's DeFi ecosystem will require a scalable Plutus smart contract protocol to efficiently & securely bring real world assets on-chain.\" The inclusion of the word \"scalable\" is critical for the success of a proposal of this ambition and magnitude. The proposal does include an understandable description of the targeted problem and a solution for how the platform will be used - with the INDY token. The INDY token is a critical element of this proposal and it seems too early to be able to determine whether and how will INDY ensure stability. The team proposes to distribute 25% of INDY to itself as a reward for the initial development team to develop and maintain the protocol until stability is absolute. The definition of \"until stability is absolute\" is too loose for me and may provide an easy exit position from the project. I would prefer a clear definition of \"until stability is absolute\" and some kind of plan concerning the divesting of 25% of INDY by the Team. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem and the solution are reasonable. Derivatives/synthetic assets are popular and essential tools in the traditional financial market and have also been important in the DeFi space.\r\n\r\nThe global derivatives market involves values \u200b\u200bof several trillion dollars, with some estimates putting the derivatives market in more than a quadrillion, so there is a colossal demand for this class of financial instrument. A popular example is the Synthetix protocol, which is a dapp that allows the creation of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain and is at over 1 billion USD in TVL as of September 2021.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables, roadmap, milestones described indicate the release of dapp by the end of October, already considering a security audit, therefore within the deadline specified in the challenge.\r\n\r\nIn the attached video it is possible to have more information about case uses and it makes clear the positive value that will be delivered to the Cardano community.\r\n\r\nMy only recommendation would be to include more metrics and KPIs, as the metrics described are restricted to repository metrics and bugs found in the audit. It would be interesting to have some KPIs that could indicate the success and impact of using dapp or liquidity allocated to the contracts(TVL). The absence of this type of metric makes the impact assessment somewhat subjective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is information about the team's qualification for functional language programming (Haskell and Plutus), some team members have already completed Plutus Pioneer. The team also has external technical consultants. The project's CIO, Dewayne, is CEO of Liqwid Finance, one of the promising projects being developed on the Cardano blockchain, and an important and participative member of the community. The Indigo team has been working on the project for a few months and has shown evolution and performance, which can be attested to by public updates.\r\n\r\nThere is a detailed and well-structured plan, the roadmap has several objective milestones. The deliverables are clear and make sense.\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes that the budget will be allocated to developer's salaries, accounting/taxes and VAT, but there is no budget breakdown or an estimate of the hours needed to develop the steps described in the deliverables. There is a breakdown of the hourly load required, but only for the audit (65 hours).\r\n\r\nThe risk of delay due to the reliance on the launch of Alonzo and PAB by IOG was mentioned. I couldn't find details about the oracle model to be implemented and considering that it is an essential component for dapp's viability and functionality, I believe that more information about the chosen oracle model is important to add. There are some quotes about oracles in the whitepaper but they are not very explanatory.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is little information about the oracle model, I am not putting as much weight on this aspect as there is still no solid oracle model on Cardano and this is an issue most DeFi dapps will face in the coming months, but I believe it would be important cite this dependency in the documentation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal describes a well-structured roadmap, relevant and objective milestones.\r\n\r\nThere are relevant metrics for project auditing, but I recommend including KPIs and metrics related to dapp usage after launch.\r\n\r\nThere is clarity in the description of the problem, solution and how they relate to the challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 12, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I've got to admit I was extremely optimistic about Liqwid, but now I'm concerned with the cult of personality and connections between projects.

It is good to see Tweag engaged for audit.  My main concern is that I do not see anywhere in the proposal or the whitepaper anything that addresses the question of scaling.  In particular, if a given iAsset becomes popular and many users want to trade it simultaneously, how will the contracts ensure that trading can happen in a timely way and that the oracle is able to update the price in a timely way?  It would be a good problem to have, of course, but I don't think the project can succeed to scale up Cardano's DeFi ecosystem without addressing these issues, so I would have liked to see at least some discussion of it in the proposal materials.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, there are reasonably detailed weekly milestones and plans to report weekly.
