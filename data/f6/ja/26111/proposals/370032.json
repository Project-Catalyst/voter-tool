I'd add also the source of the survey to verify this number which generated the stated problem.\r\n\r\nAs further suggestions,  there could be an increase in the target audience to look for potential vietnamese people that are not engaged in Cardano yet but could, as, for instance, university students from several areas (programming, arts, business, egineering) or even companies. It would recquire and extra step of engagement with them, probably more laborious and it would be necessary to educate them in Cardano/blockchain/smart contract at first. It could have also more information on the course itself like, saying whether it would be live or recorded, if the record will be available aftewards, basic content, if there'll be a space for Q&A, etc.\r\n\r\nOther thing that would be nice to see is a more detailed \"next steps\" sessions. After first round of courses is concluded, is there a plan to have more rounds? it seems it does but how would it be funded? via another catalyst fund or the intent is to become self funded? if it is the latter, how? These info would help to have some sense on sustainability of the course.\r\n\r\nMoreover, i'd also consider a proper communication/marketing strategy to annouce the course within and outside Cardano community. It should include emails, anoucements in general telegram channels, paid posts in social media, etc.\r\n\r\nLast, thinking of scalability, if this iniative does get funded and is a success, the proposers could have everything well documented and engage with partners in other countries to replicate the methods and lessons learned to other languages of high impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "4 experienced people with diverse background, including development, project management and online marketing seems enough to put the project in place. It was very nice they put references (Linkedin, twitter, etc) to verify the information provided on their experience/background is true!\r\n\r\nRegarding the plan, it is robust and well writen. The only thing that seems not much feasible is translating, editing, and updating all advanced Catalyst content from the official Catalyst information in only 1 month. it seems a lot of work, especially if carried out in parallel with other activities. Maybe some section in the content should be done (or, if this is already the intent, make it clearer in the proposal)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the budget, it seems fair, for all the work that will be necessary in the plan, and with a sensible cost breakdown.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are some milestones that could be drawn out from the plan/schedule and even some metrics related to number of lessons but it doesnt seem to be enough.\r\nIt would be interesting to follow up with the total numbers of people reached in anoucement/communication phase, the number of people attending both basic and advanced course and have an update on the number of \"89% don't know/don't care about Catalyst-an important project that promotes cardano ecosystem\" which motivated the project, after each course round and also the growth rate of Vietnam Cardano community (maybe this course can increase its rate, right?). Some quality indiactors could be nice as the satisfaction or knowledge of the students after the course, which could be measured by a survey.\r\n\r\nAs for challenge/risks, I'd consider really reaching target audicence, keeping the interest after course finishes (maybe some mentoring, a discussion channel or at least a regular follow up could exist aftewards) and not  meeting the proposed timeline, which is very challenging.\r\nThe risk on the quality was managed and mitigated by \"Community Survey about Catalyst Course -->Get Feedback --> Review --> Improvement according to PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) -->Community Report.\"\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The Catalyst Project has to have in mind that reaching more people, respecting and embracing the diversity of people and ideas we have more chances to impact the world with Cardano and improve its ecosystem.

The potencial impact is big due to the Vietnam population (~96 milions of people in 2019 - Statista) - most of these people don't know about Cardano existence because they don't speak English, even less about Catalyst.

And the survey result quoted in the proposal shows there is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nBut that survey result also shows a potential problem with the proposal's impact \u2013 it says that many Vietnamese people not only don't know about Catalyst, but don't *care*. If they don't care, and nothing is done to raise their interest, will they attend the course? There is some attention given to marketing the course in the proposal \u2013 but not really enough, given that this seems to be the main hurdle to overcome. Or, if the proposal will focus on those who *do* care, and are already in the Vietnamese Cardano community- they're already engaged with Cardano, so the impact in terms of the challenge's metrics is not large.\r\n\r\nBut it's very good that the proposal includes time for collecting community feedback and reviewing; this will increase the likelihood of creating something with impact.\r\n\r\nThe proposal addresses similar concerns to the Catalyst School's proposal to work with Eastern Town Hall to train bilingual trainers \u2013 but the difference here is that this proposal is specific to Vietnam, and it doesn't require bilingual trainers, since it's more about sourcing and translating materials for an online course that people can follow at their own pace. This seems like it might reach a different (maybe earlier-stage?) audience from the Catalyst School proposal, which is good \u2013 the two proposals seem complementary \u2013 but for maximum impact, it might be good if this project signposted participants on to Eastern Town Hall's training.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I find it hard to feel confident of this. First, nobody on the team has any background in, or experience of, developing online training, and there are no plans to bring those skills in. Developing training is quite specialised work, so they would need that expertise. I also feel  (as someone who *has* developed online training) that their month-by-month plan is quite tight, and they might have underestimated how long it will take to complete some of the tasks. For example, they only allow 5 minutes per video for post-production and editing, which is not really enough to produce something engaging, and allows no leeway if there are any issues with a recording.\r\nThe budget seems reasonable apart from this; but overall I can't be sure it's feasible.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The audit metrics are not very clear, so I don't feel I can know whether they'll be sufficient.

It's not clear how or whether these types of things will be measured and auditable.\r\nThe team will do a community report/survey at the end of the project, which is great \u2013 but it would be good if they had included some information on what types of things the survey will ask and measure.
