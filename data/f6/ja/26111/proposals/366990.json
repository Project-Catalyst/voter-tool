The author claims to have experience with digital marketing and a type of strategy called SEO, which works by searching for keywords, and through this strategy he would promote his project. However, it would be interesting to explain better how the strategy works. We know that this site will be created, which will operate using keywords that relate to cryptocurrencies, blockchain, NFT, etc., in French. But we don't know how, for example, how this content will reach the target audience. Through pop ups? This, in my opinion, is not a very good idea, because people tend to close pop ups without even reading what is there, often pop ups are also related to malicious content, such as viruses, for example. The author of the proposal is willing to create a lot of content, but I found this promise very ambitious given the few details about the actual functioning of the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We don't have a satisfactory amount of information about the author, he just describes that he understands digital marketing, search engines and speaks several languages \u200b\u200b(which ones?).

In addition to not having a more detailed explanation of who the author is, he does not demonstrate that he has planned to hire more members to form a team. I believe that to carry out this project, it would be important for there to also be a graphic designer, whether for the creation of the website or the pop ups, and it would also be positive if more than one person was responsible for the translation and creation of the content. The author of the proposal does not claim to have experience with the universe of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, which would be essential for the creation of safe and quality content on the subject.

Despite the author explaining how he intends to do in relation to the months, that is, what would happen each month, and how the financing money would be used, I found the explanations a little superficial. For example, who would write the content? And how often would they be created and released? A lot of content is promised, for example, from month 2 to month 3 the goal is to produce 100 contents. It would be important to understand who would draft them and how often they would be published. I believe that the implementation of the proposal could be much more detailed. We have information, but not enough to visualize a full and solid realization of the project, in addition to the fact that the financial amount requested is considerably high, which makes the need for details and full understanding of the proposal even more necessary for it to be able to credibility about the idea is created.
