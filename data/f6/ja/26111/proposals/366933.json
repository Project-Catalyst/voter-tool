Id also consider a criteria for selecting which languages should be tranlated. it would be good to add automatic captions for meetings where you cant find a translator for a specific langauge (of course, the quality of this auto generated caption should be assessed beforehand). Also, it would be nice to have a communication plan on how to reach non english speakers community who dont even know about the townhall. An extra question is how to monetize this idea to keep it running even when it doent get the fund, after being implemented (how to make it self sustainable?).

As stated in the description, in fact, only a small portion of the population speaks English in a more \"natural\" way, that is, as a mother tongue or even a second language (I myself am Brazilian, and I speak English quite easily because I studied when small, but I know I'm part of a privileged minority). A problem I found here was that the proposal is too broad, it promises to do very big things, but we don't know how things will happen in a particular way. For example: what content would be translated, exactly? The authors mention that town halls, forums and proposals should be translated. But during proposal development, translation is focused on town halls. So it would be beneficial if the authors confirmed that this would be the first content for translation and then gave a sense of how, little by little, other content in the Cardano ecosystem could be translated, because promising to translate everything without setting a goal that is easier to visualize is complicated. .. We are told which languages \u200b\u200bthey intend to address, which is a positive point. But because there are several, it would be important to know, for example, which would be addressed first. It was a little vague how the community would have access to the translated content; I believe that every proposal must establish a solid point between what is done and who is intended to benefit from the idea. For these reasons, I believe the impact of the proposal is high, but it needs detailing.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We are provided with little information about the authors. We know that they are translators, and that they have a website, which was attached, on which they intend to develop tools to facilitate the work of future translators. Tools such as: dashboard and direct communication channels between people hired. However, we do not have a deep background about their work. It would be very positive to attach some townhall or forums that they translated, and even introduce us to who the other people involved are, as we are told that there are already translators who were working for free. I think it was necessary to leave this network of contacts a little more exposed in the proposal. The site they have attached is very good, you can see that they know what they do: what we lack is more demonstration.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the applicability of the project, I believe it is the most detailed part of the proposal. We are told what is intended to be done in certain blocks of time (3 months, 6 months and more future steps), and also how the financial amount would be used. About detailing, we have a pretty safe notion, however, that could be further broken down. Let me explain: on the part of the money destined for the website, for example, they ask for 500 dollars to keep a job for 6 months. Okay, but what job is this? I thought they needed to explain more about how they were going to build the site, which despite being well underway, still needs to be filled with more content. Of course, a UI/UX designer must be a contract, because having access to the translations in a simple and direct way is as important as the fact that the translations exist. The self-worth (in my opinion) requested for town hall translations is justified by the fact that future translators are well trained. It would even be positive if some website or content were attached that explained more how the Frankfurt School operates in this blockchain universe, because most of us evaluators do not know its work and would add value to the proposal. It is also positive how the authors establish success metrics, so the community could better track the progress of the project.

The benefit of this proposal compared to others is that they are already doing the work. Having attended many THs with the live translation, the effect of this work is already being seen. To this end, there is no doubt that it would continue to be implemented successfully. Given that this issue will likely persist going forward, the proposers have shown that they are already thinking ahead and have a plan for how to ramp up their efforts. One way the proposal could be strengthened would be by entertaining a discussion on sustainability. Is there a way to get more regular funding for these efforts? While the $ may be good now, submitting a new proposal for each fund may not be appropriate. Providing some thoughts about setting up dedicated funding for the continuance of this work would also be valuable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The reason why I am not giving this criteria a 5 is because I think more information could be provided on how the training (from the Frankfurt school) will improve the translations. While it may help the translators better understand blockchain, I am not sure I see the leap to better translations. Are there particular courses that support live translation skill development? Why did you choose the blockchain masterclass over building the skills for live translation? Also, what if someone becomes a translator but doesn't take the class? Would they still be included? What would the process be for removing a translator? These issues will help ensure that voters can be confident the proposal is successful. \r\n\r\nThe budget seems more than fair for what is requested and may not be enough given the time commitment for the translators.
