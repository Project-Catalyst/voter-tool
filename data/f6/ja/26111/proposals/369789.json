However, there are two questions that I have regarding implementation. First, and more important, there is little detail about the expected content of the web portal. It says the portal will be \"everything about Cardano\", which is not possible. The idea seems to be to have a place where anything about Cardano can be posted, but more detail and organization would be desirable. Depending upon portal content, additional skills may be needed for the team (and there is no budget for content development). Second, the core team includes a web designer (Toma) but not apparently a web developer. However, such skills are easily purchased and there is a clear budget for this -- so this is not a significant concern. Given these issues, I agree but do not strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For similar reasons to those on the feasibility/implementation criterion, audit of delivery could be somewhat challenging. On the one hand, it will  easily be possible to verify that the web portal has been delivered, and in theory possible to assess the content of the web portal qualitatively (although it will be in Indonesian, which makes this challenging for English-speaking assessors). On the other hand, without detail of what the portal will include, audit may be challenging. So it depends what is being audited. The KPI provided regarding search ranking and onboarding may be good measures of success -- i.e. accepting the votes of the crowd (and Google) whether this is a good portal or not.
