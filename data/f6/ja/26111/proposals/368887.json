I understand the proposal as a complementary solution, because even with the support of CAs, vCAs and proposers they would still have to deal with a lot of information in English. E.g.\r\n-CAs and vCAs need to read documentation and maybe watch videos to understand the process (this is still in English) and also need to write assessments in English. Some tasks assigned to CAs and vCAs can be solved with the help of automated translators, which may or may not be feasible for certain languages and situations.\r\n\r\n-Proposers would need a mentor to write a proposal in English (as automated translation may not be sufficient for this) and maybe someone to promote it in English.\r\n\r\nMy point is that the proposal is positive, but its impact is limited by these factors.\r\n\r\nThe goal of supporting 100 people is a good indicator of impact, but I would recommend detailing what kind of information will be collected in the reports so that the impact assessment can be more objective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal contains details that indicate the qualification and suitability of the members for this proposal.
