Or what if the translations are not sufficiently promoted \u2013 in the target languages and countries, ofc \u2013 and uptake is too low? I note there's no specific mention of budget for creating publicity in the target languages \u2013 and this could be important, given that it will need to reach those who probably don't engage that much with existing Catalyst channels specifically *because* of the language barrier that this proposal seeks to address.) \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It's great that the translations will be available on GitHub. And tracking user numbers is a good start.

The proposal is very simple; an automatic translation followed by a human will be used to improve. And you will also need someone to manage the project. The financial divisions are satisfactorily cleared, I personally found the money asked to be very fair and possible. In terms of success metrics, I believe the community will be able to track through the adoption of translations, but it would be positive if any of the authors could counter that amount to give feedback to the community.
