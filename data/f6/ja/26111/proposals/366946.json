At first, I thought that it might be on the wrong challenge. However, training multilingual developers to allow them to create content and cooperate with entrepreneurs which don't speak English is amazing.\r\n- I have no idea how the African's countries in relation with English language, but I imagine it might be a bit like Brazil, which it's not the majority of the population which speaks English. Therefore enabling people to dev in it's own language and obligating the trainees to train  is a good starting point.\r\n- It's quite scalable as well, since the course is going to be in English, therefore, the more language the better.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- One point that I'm imagining is that the marketing might be thought differently to each country and, therefore, it might get hard. I wonder if the non-English speakers devs might not know how is the best way to advertise in their country and this might be a problem. Since this is a crucial point in this project (it'll worth nothing if the devs can't create awareness about DLT in their countries to offer the service), it might be good to add a marketing specialist in the team. That said, maybe you'll need more money to make this done.\r\n- How are you planning to continue with this project after the funding? How much the course will cost and how many students it must have to cover all the costs?
