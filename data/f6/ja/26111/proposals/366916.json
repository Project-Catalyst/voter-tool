This proposal perfectly meets the objectives of the challenge, taking relevant and simplified knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to Spanish-speaking people. It's very positive that the project actually already exists, it's already happening. We are provided with the website link, which is very well organized, by the way, with a great interface design; and we are also told that there is already some content translated, as well as a team of translators into Spanish.

Although everything is apparently right, it would be even more interesting if we had access to their social networks, such as lindekin, for example, to see exactly what their trajectories are like, where they graduated, worked and so on. Despite this, the fact that the site is already available shows us the main thing: they know how to do what they promise. In this way, there is a lot of credibility with the authors.

It meets the 3 requirements that I always look for to fully understand how things will happen next. First, the authors list, in a direct and didactic way, each of their minor goals. Small actions that need to be done for the ultimate goal to be achieved. Afterwards, we have a detailed explanation of how each part of the funding money will be used; each part has a destiny, and we understand very well what they are.
