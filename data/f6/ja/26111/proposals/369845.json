This is definitely a good use of funds. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer here is a proven entity and has successfully delivered training resources in English thus far, so one should be able to have faith that they will be able to replicate this success with the partnership of the right people. My only concern is that the budget is somewhat under-estimated. There is a cost breakdown on what appears to be the training sessions themselves but nothing accounted for pre & post event administration. Assuming this is not free time, it would be good to see this added to the budget. As a professional who has run online events for the last 10+ years in the corporate world, I can safely say that effective preparation and post-event follow-up is essential to entrench 1. the attendee rates and 2. the stickiness of the learning. All of that takes a considerable amount of time - in fact, oftentimes more time than the event itself. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the proposer has done a good job of outlining what they hoping to achieve and what their KPIs might be, but it would be good to see some SMART targets, including but not limited to, actual school session numbers. Additionally, there is little mention of risks or potential challenges - any online event is going to have numerous risks associated (for example, presenter issues, low attendee numbers, technical issues on the day etc etc). While I wouldn't expect to see an exhaustive list, it would be good to get a sense that the proposer has thought through/had experience of such potential issues and has a plan in place to address these as and when they arrive. This will give voters more confidence in the proposal.

Duplicating a model that is working in English to other Languages makes a lot of sense. As a person that worked and lived in many countries including developing countries such as Indonesia, I can appreciate the importance of language and localization to improve reach, engagement, and results. \r\nThe approach of the proposal is also very good guiding relevant members on how to become teachers for their local language and even teach/support them to make a proposal for fund 7. It gives a good example of how to grow a healthy community. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The partnerships between the Cardano School and the ETH make a lot of sense instead of each party trying to do it separately. I actually participate in the ETH and was present when the Cardano School did the CA session, so initial collaboration already working great. \r\n\r\nThe teams have a lot of experience with Catalyst and are already very active members positively impacting the community. The ETH team already has some key team members from local countries in the region. So definitely, the team will be able to complete the tasks in the proposal. \r\n\r\nA couple of remarks: \r\nIt could have been helpful to details the ETH team (like the Cardano School did)  or at least the ones that will be involved. If you already have in mind the 3 selected members it will be helpful to have their names and background and why you selected them.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend having a selected team lead from each team so coordination is clear and simple. Finally, I did not understand why in ETH team in the mission part, West Africa is being referred.    \r\n\r\nThe budget seems reasonable and detailed. It could have been good if you mentioned when the budget goes to the school or to ETH, for example, the project management part. The payments will be done to ETH and the School to specific team members doing the work? I assume it is the latter and in this case, I would have it next to the budget item for full clarity.   \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the roadmap and milestones, they are laid out in a simple way but there are few things that need to be more precise. Does the budget request refer only to the first 3 months after being funded? Why it is written \"end of fund 7\"? Once, I understand what you meant it is then easy to follow up on and audit. \r\n\r\nThe KPIs are in line with the challenge objectives. One thing that would have been helpful is to have some tangible numbers in the KPIs for how many attendees and how many proposals submitted your forecast.  Sharing some reference numbers from the school's current activities would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nFinally, any risks and challenges? For example, how do you choose the candidate to be a teacher? What will happen if there are many candidates?
