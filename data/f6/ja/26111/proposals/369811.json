It's also an interesting approach, and potentially empowering to speakers of target languages, to have quality-evaluation resting with the person who uses the material rather than the person who commissioned the translation. Also, the collaborative approach to design during month 1 is likely to increase impact, as the proposal team are open to input from the community, although I'm not sure if there's quite enough time and resources given to this \u2013 what if community input identifies a major issue that needs to be resolved?\r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure that the project's approach will suit Catalyst, given that many documents are created by a group rather than a single owner, and are intended to be shared with and owned by the whole community \u2013 who, then, is technically the \"owner\" who would pay for the translation? And is there a danger that a service like this might shift the balance so that those who write a document in English might start to say \"Well, if someone wants it translated, they can pay for it\"?  \r\nI'm also not convinced how much people will care about the gamification element \u2013 but I could be wrong, and the point is that it will be tested during the project, so it could turn out to be impactful; and even if not, the project will still work and have a good impact without it. But the issue of translator rewards being worked out based on their evaluations \u2013 how would this work in the early stages, when nobody has any evaluations? Would low initial rewards put translators off, and mean they would prefer to negotiate with material-owners directly, who they may already know, rather than building up their reputation on this platform?\r\nIn short, the proposal *could* have really good impact, but it's hard to be sure -  the proposers could do more to explain the value of its specific features in this specific (Cardano/Catalyst) context. \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers clearly have the needed relevant experience and skill; their past projects look user-friendly and well designed, and seem to have been well managed and implemented effectively.\r\nThere's a very clear roadmap and milestones, which is good in itself, and also helps with managing risk. Still, I would like to have seen some explicit description of what the team see as the risks of the project and how they will mitigate them.\r\nOne obvious risk is how the project would onboard sufficient good quality translators; because when the platform is launched, if there are not enough translators or they are not good, this will instantly damage people's wish to use it. So it's a slight worry that there are no specific budget resources or time in the roadmap for outreach or recruitment to get translators on board. It's probably intended as part of \"developing and testing\" in months 3-6, but it would help make feasibility clearer if it was specifically addressed.\r\nThe budget is well broken down and doesn't look excessive; but it is a slight concern that it is almost all the funds for this challenge, which means that if funded,  it would block out almost all other proposals. But this feels acceptable, since it is a complete and scalable approach that could have a longterm impact on future translation needs, whereas most other proposals begin and end with translating this or that specific material.
