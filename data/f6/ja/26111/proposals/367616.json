There are two big questions. 1) What current sources of information about Cardano will you leverage o translate, as the project doesn't seem to have much planning around new content creation, 2) How well will these automatic content translation services work on potentially technical content in the blockchain space? \r\nWhat is really being gained here over users just applying Google Translate to anything that already exists on Cardano?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has the knowledge to build the chatbot and knowledge base translation side of things. Do they also have experience in the content side (probably but not actually stated)?\r\nThe plan should include more information on what knowledge sources would be used for the knowledge base. There is also a lack of marketing plan. If this is built, how will users in the 58 languages find this resource? Should the budget not allow for things like Search Engine Optimization?\r\nIt is also not clear what is expected for the budget for \"Ingestion, Evaluation, and Translation\". 100, 200 and 1000 ADA per month split amongst all contributors. How much is expected to be contributed for those amounts?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a relatively detailed timeline of deliverables against which progress can be audited. What is really missing though is is a plan for measuring how much the resources is used and how much impact it is having? It would be great to see some goals on visits to the KB and interactions with the chatbot and measure how much each language group is using it. It would also be nice to have some ability to measure the quality of the translations in each language. Could some spot audits on documents in each language be conducted to check they are correct. It seems a little dangerous to just through out some machine learning based translations without any checking on the accuracy of those translations. These accuracy checks could also be part of the auditing, but may required more funding.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As a non-native English speaker I do agree that a scale mechanism to address translations in a more dynamic and automated way shall be reach.\r\nAs a technologist I also agree that a bot with an AI supported auto-translation service could really provide a good solution to address this challenge.\r\nThe integration channels though for people to be able to consume/interact with the bot and the ingestion and maintenance of the knowledge base are complex problems that I think the proposal does not address in detail. What the proposer wrote and it's criteria seems very valid and worth the experiment.\r\nI would suggest to interact more with other projects and veteran people from the Cardano's community to leverage existing APIs to access content and to define the integration piece better in order to make this project a success.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is clear and detailed and I do think it is feasible as it is worded, with specific general milestones. I'd suggest to get deeper into what success looks like in each milestone, as I don't see value oriented goals, just tasks being completed.\r\nThe proposal is based on a continuous service that consumes pay resources from Azure (which is OK) and proposes to pay the community regularly to produce refinement and QA for the auto-translator bot to learn (Which is also fine) but the project does not provides clarification on how all these costs will be sustainable after the time frame it covers with the requested funds. So I see no sustainability mechanism nor a business model indicated. I am guessing that the project aims to apply for further funding in next rounds, but that is not indicated or implied in the proposal and I see this as a major weaknesses to make this project sustainable.\r\n\r\nRequested budget for the tasks presented is coherent, though it is clear that more money will be required to sustain the project after the indicated period.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Even though some general milestones are provided, no SMART metrics on how to measure impact and adherence to the challenge goal were provided.\r\nIf the project gets funded, I strongly suggest to work on those success criteria's ASAP so the project can be audited and provide clear indications on how it is addressing the issues that the challenge aims to solve.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_288", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Assessor states that no sustainability model is present and that this is a major weakness.

Good that there is plan to involve the community to vet/contribute as that will create ongoing engagement and correct any machine translation errors.\r\n3. Knowledge Base and ChatBots while useful may not be a very interactive mode of communication. Could leverage on the existing IOHK KB hosted on Zendesk which from my experience with working on Zendesk in the past contains some integrated solution.\r\n4.
