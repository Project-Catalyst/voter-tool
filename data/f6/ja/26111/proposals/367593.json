If hes a awarded tv series writer and producer there should be something online but just with his first name its impossible to look for it (-1,5 score).\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the plan, there are some deliverables after 6 months but it could have more details before and after that, like a proper project schedule, in order to assess its fully feasibility (-1,5 score).\r\n\r\nthe project is a bit expensive but budget breakdown is adequate to the size of acitivities (like translating and marketing and the # of content it is intended to be generated here.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\r\n\r\nThere are some metrics on the \"defining success section\" but as the schedule is not much detailed, few milestones can be drawn out from it.

The author highlights the relevance of this translation work, since more than 20 countries have Spanish as their official language, and a large number of residents in the United States also speak this language. This proposal differs from the others in the challenge because in addition to translating existing content, it is intended to create an event aimed at exchanging various content, be it videos, books, design pieces, all aimed at the Spanish-speaking community, and whose theme would be content about our ecosystem I found the idea of \u200b\u200bpromoting challenges during the event very interesting, which would have rewards in ada as a prize. So, the event would not only attract new people, but active members of the ecosystem, which would help move the community. Another very positive point I found here is that the event will be organized in axes, which encompass several aspects relevant to the community, such as: why Cardano is the best environment for creating Dapps, the advantages of investing in ada, etc. for a very solid plan, we also noticed flexibility regarding the project's progress, which I consider very important for the success of the idea. For these and other reasons present in the proposal, such as the future objectives of Semana Cardano, I consider the proposal extremely pertinent and very positive.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal author claims to be a writer and producer of award-winning TV series, but which ones? It's always good to have examples attached so that we know exactly what the previous work of those involved is. He could also have attached the link to Spanishpedia so we can better understand what it's about. It's a little confusing to me whether the author has translation experience or not - Spanishpedia is probably about that, but I couldn't log in without creating an account, just to be sure (I don't know if I went to the local right either). On the formation of a team, the author states that \"this type of campaign is better approached in a more 'guerrilla' way than trying to form a small fixed team\"; it would be interesting to argue why, and also how workers would be selected, how long on average each team's work would last, until it was replaced. As the proposal involves the creation of different types of content, there would certainly be a need for different types of professionals on the team in addition to translators, such as designers, blockchain / ada / cardano specialists... For these reasons, I believe there was a little more security needed in relation to the team that would carry out the project, if the author asked us about the points mentioned here, the trust and confidence that everything would happen as proposed would be beneficial.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Regarding the project's applicability, we know of several objectives that the author intends to achieve with Cardano Week, such as the number of people involved he intends to reach, the creation of a \"bible\" with content about Cardano in Spanish and so on. But we don't have a detailed step-by-step on how these goals will be achieved. I realize that Cardano Week is an event of great proportions, involving several small activities, which together form a whole (with which much is promised). But precisely because it is so broad, it would be important for the community to have a more concrete understanding of how it would all happen. For example: would the Cardano Week really last for 1 week or is it an illustrative name? How often would this happen? Where, exactly, would this content be made available (the author cites what part of the funding would be for marketing and social media, but which media)? Furthermore, how would the billions of people that the author mentions in the introduction of the proposal know about the event? In addition to all these questions, it would be interesting to know what these challenges the author intends to promote during the event, in addition to the rewards in ada, what would be the learning related to them... It would also be positive to know the proportion of each type of content that it is intended to generate, since the author intends to produce different types of media. The author details well what his goals are, what he intends to achieve with them, gives us an idea of \u200b\u200bhow the funding money would be used, but he does not detail HOW the goals would be achieved. We also lack a temporal notion, we don't know for how long the author intends to reach the mark of 10,000 participants that he cites, in addition to what I said here before, the duration and frequency of the event. For these reasons, I believe that a proposal of this size deserves more details.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This was a good proposal, it had a plan, a reasonable budget and lots of reasons and ideas.

Spanish, as a widely spoken language is a good place to start in order to have global reach and add the most value to the community and ecosystem. Any voter should be able to understand the premise and purpose of this proposal. That being said, it will take a lot more resources to maintain however, as Cardano and the ecosystem are rapidly changing and evolving. This is not insurmountable but just something that will need to be taken into account to keep the content relevant. I have over 10 years experience in educational content creation for a FTSE100 company and this was one of the biggest challenges (and opportunities). At this point in time, I think, theoretically, this is a good place for funds to be spent. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having 4 pillars/axes on which content is created seems like a great way to engage people. That being said, if the content is to be re-used and be a learning resource, the proposer will definitely need some support and feedback from the community in order to create content that is more learning-focused - and that stays relevant as the ecosystem evolves. \r\n\r\nI am unsure about the split of content the proposer is intending on creating. Whether it is going to be predominantly static content to be used as a learning resource or dynamic, social content in order to primarily engage. It would be good to give a few more explicit examples of the types of content you intend on creating to give voters a way to understand this project better. For example, what might a headline article/video be vs the learning content that might support it?  The background of the proposer is indeed exciting as they will have a natural penchant for promotion, however, I wonder if they have the knowledge and experience to create more weighty content over and above that of an influencer? Not that that would not be useful, it's just veering away from the challenge in some respects. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With this confusion in mind, I am uncertain the budget plan is on point or sufficient. The proposed costings for the content creation (using professionals in audio/visual/copywriting etc) seems low. Also, having been written on a \"weekly budget\" rather than a \"per content\" basis doesn't make this project easily measurable. The KPI/success metric of 10k subscribers by the 6 month point seems a little low for the budget. In 6 months, one would expect to see a multiple of that number at the very least.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a qualified project manager (Agile), I would like to see some project milestones and clearly defined objectives listed out. Similarly, there are no risks or challenges mentioned. A key risk and challenge when talking about mailing lists (especially with a European language) will be that of GDPR and that will need to be addressed if direct communication and mailshots are the primary communication method. Another challenge that jumps to mind is the regional variations within the Spanish language. The content distributed to mainland Spain will have an almost entirely different dialect than that that would be understood in Mexico, for example. \r\n\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_620", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 8, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Great idea for a proposal.

It will be helpful if you added an example of a successful project you worked with this method. \r\n\r\nPlan vs idea seems reasonable but needs to add some details about the work plan. What are the next steps once you get the money?
