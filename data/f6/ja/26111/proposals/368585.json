However, it involves a variety of related initiatives rather than a clear, unified proposal. There is also a mismatch between the stated project scope and specific deliverables. For example, item #1 on scope is a social media account, but the detailed plan does not relate to this. Conversely, much of the budget is for translation of Fund 6 winning proposals, but this is not part of the stated scope. \r\n\r\nI would advise the proposers to focus on building out more clearly one or a few elements of this proposal. With respect to translation, for example, what could be a sustainable approach for ongoing translation of Cardano materials (rather than just Fund 6 winning proposals)? Could there be efficiencies using Google Translate (or Google Translate plus quality control) or similar rather than paying for translations? How will the proposal deal with presenting translations in traditional Chinese (used in Taiwan) vs. simplified Chinese (used in mainland China)?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for the proposed offline and online events, what would they be about? Who would be the speakers? How would they be tied into the broader Cardano / Catalyst community?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Because the proposal presents a variety of related initiatives in a somewhat unclear structure (see comments on impact criterion), it is difficult to understand what would be accomplished. Therefore, it is hard to be confident that the proposal would be implemented successfully. There is also limited information about team skills, including no information about skills to organize the proposed events.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some elements of the budget could probably be managed more efficiently. For example, why is it necessary to pay $2000 for speakers, and who would the speakers be who need such payment? Often it is possible to get speakers to speak for free particularly for community events.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal includes specific KPIs, which are measurable. However, as noted in my other comments, these KPIs do not match to the project scope (which is somewhat unclear). Thus, it would be challenging to audit for the actual scope.

This addresses the challenge well (although it would have helped with assessing impact if the proposal had included details of which social media accounts will be used to share info \u2013 are they already established accounts with plenty of followers, or new ones? \u2013 and a bit more detail on what topics the video tutorials will cover.\r\n\r\nBut then, the project's KPIs introduce an additional piece of work that's not mentioned in the \"project scope\", and which therefore seems to come a little bit out of left field - the idea of providing translations to the funded projects in Fund 6. The impact here is a little less clear, since it's not clear what material would be translated \u2013 I guess progress reports from the projects, so that Chinese speakers can engage with their activities? If so, that would probably have some positive impact, but I feel unsure how much; and it is a little confusing that this is the main part of the work, but it's not mentioned in the initial project description, which sounds as if videos and meetups are the core of the work. The project still sounds like it would have a positive impact overall, but impact would be clearer if the main part of the work was in the headline.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team have translation skills, but they don't mention any video production skills, experience of creating educational materials, community engagement skills or social media and marketing skills. Many of these things are in the budget, so they are probably being bought in from outside; but if so, it would be good to know something about who will be doing the work and what experience they have. It would also be great to know of any management experience the proposal team has, as they will presumably be managing other staff.\r\nThe budget  is clear and well broken down \u2013 but one or two of the items are a little surprising as they weren't mentioned in the earlier description of the project (e.g. the translations, as noted above, and the guest speaker fees, a surprise because the seminars sounded more like a place to chat and discuss Cardano between equals, rather then listen to prominent speakers). The effect of this is that the project comes across as a bit muddled \u2013 it would be better if the project plan/description matched up more closely with what's in the budget. Taken together, all this leaves me a little unsure about the feasibility of the project.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is plenty of auditable information here: engagements on social media, video views and comments, amount of material translated, and attendees at meetups. So yes, the progress and success are auditable. The only thing that's missing is an assessment of whether the participants and video-viewers do feel that the project has made it \"easier for non-English speakers to build and grow the Cardano community in their local areas\", as the challenge setting puts it. This is not easy to assess, but it would be great if the project could add it in somehow \u2013 perhaps by a survey or online poll at the end of the project?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "They explained their budget, they have timeline and a half plan.
