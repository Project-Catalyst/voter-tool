A 'grassroots' approach, starting local and small, that through open-source apps could be shared throughout the African continent to other providers of housing services.  I would love to see this idea come to fruition!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the information in the proposal, I can neither agree nor disagree that the plan presented will likely be implemented successfully. There is no specific information about the collaborators, and even though they are working in the ecosystem proposed, I do not see information in 'Relevant Experience' about how they have the skills needed to see the project through (TAHCo since 2020 is not that long ago either). Also, for me, the budget is sketchy, or lacks detail (10 days/$5000 for a project manager doesn't say much, and seems like a lot per hour). For this much money, 17% of the Challenge Setting budget, I would need to see more detail about the roadmap, the 3, 6 and 12 month goals, and how the team will be spending their time and the community's money.

There is a suggestion about how 'Future Extensions' might look, but there are no specific KPIs or metrics listed as to how we the community can access or audit the progress and success of the proposal. What is the target audience? Who are the potential users of the platform? How will they be onboarded?\r\nGiven that the proposers work in the use case environment, I would expect that they could use metrics based on the number of individuals who are part of this ecosystem, etc., expectations of how many could be onboarded, and a 'roadmap' of their plan to execute and bring onboard an expected number of users of the proposed applications/services provided by them.

This proposal effectively addresses the challenge at hand and also stands in line with the mission of Cardano to bring economic equality to the world. The team have clearly stated the problem that they are proposing to solve with Atala PRISM. They have suggested a solution that would be a gateway to the Cardano Blockchain for millions of people across the continent. The impact of this project being successfully implemented could substantially grow Cardano's user base due to the volume of people effected by the stated problem. The team are based in Africa and demonstrate an understanding of the unique challenges present.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to this team already leading two successful social impact organisations and the high quality of their proposal I think this team has what it takes to bring their vision to life. The team already have established professional networks within several African countries and reference a huge community that would benefit from their solution. I think this would be a good investment of Catalyst funds due to the established team and intention to open source their software. Similar organisations will be able to leverage the progress this team makes to further drive adoption and social good. The budget appears reasonable and an explanation of how the project will become self sustaining has been put forward.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team haven't really specified road map details but the tools they are going to use to get there haven't been released yet so I guess they can't get too detailed at this stage. The team have set a three month target for development of their phone dapp this is a solid target we can audit however It would be good if the team could break that down further so the community can be reassured everything is on track.
