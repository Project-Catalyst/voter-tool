How effective it would be at driving mass-scale is hard to assess without more info.\r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.

Upon implementation, the number of DID users projected would be 0 however the proposal should project out to a timeline in which the community could expect DID users to be recruited assuming future funding. When could the community expect the challenge objectives to be measurably met if this project were funded? \r\nThe proposal should detail specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "NFTs are a hot item and a gateway to the crypto universe at the moment.
