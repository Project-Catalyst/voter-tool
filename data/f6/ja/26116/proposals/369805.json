For example, the proposal stated this \"What are the best routes for voluntary adoption of digital IDs in a small city? Taking Flagstaff, Arizona, as our model...\" without clearly explaining what was done in the said location and how the methods will help their solution.\r\nDespite the lack of details such as above, other aspects of the proposal makes up for that gap.\r\nI agree.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal provided verifiable links of given experience and the implementation plan is well detailed .\r\ngreat work by the team.\r\nI agree.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal did a great job of providing sufficient information that can be used to audit the progress and success of the proposal solution .\r\nI agree.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_331", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The challenge is asking for a way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. \r\nThe problem statement should more closely align with the challenge however the solution is clear and reasonable.\r\nThe goals of the proposal do not align with the challenge objective. The solution of an outreach program of focus groups, workshops, webpage development and the formulation of a roadmap does not solve the challenge in that by the end of the funding period there are no DID users and no prospect of future DID users without further funding. \r\nThe proposal does not scale to drawing in millions of DID users. The process described will take years to attract significant numbers of DID users with multiple rounds of funding and a recruitment cost per DID user which compares poorly to other proposals. Based upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers have not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links. The only link is to the Kepler SCS company which is acting as a Board of Advisors. \r\nThe team of has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal. Specifically who is formulating the roadmap for adoption of secure digital IDs in a small city and what relevant experience do they have. \r\nThe budget to achieve the goals is high compared to other proposals. My personal advice for resubmitting this proposal to later funding rounds is that project management costs should be under 10% (~27% in this proposal) of the total costs. The focus group, workshops and general brainstorming should be volunteer work or funded from other sources as the expectation is that you are submitting an idea that is past that stage. Proposals should request funding in a single funding round up to at least the Minimum Viable Product or Proof of Concept stage. Reasonable marketing costs for a developed MVP can be included if they help meet the challenge objective. \r\n The timetable to complete the work is long compared to other proposals. \r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal however the deliverable for the \"Legal work on guidelines for the roadmap\" should be described in detail and whether it will be made public to the Catalyst community since they would be funding the work. \r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation.

It is not 'mass-scale adoption' per se but it is a path towards wider utilisation. I had often wondered if @IOHK_Charles had penned a similar MoU with the Mayor of Florida in his last trip as it would've been a great testbed for DID utilisation in a US setting & it occurred not too far after signing the Ethiopian deal. But Flagstaff is as good as any and congratulations to Council member Shimoni and team for taking this step and approaching it from a grass roots level. I can't cite the study but there is evidence that organic growth is more long-lasting than imposed by a large central authority. The process described should iron out any concerns people may have of the technology, of their privacy, of the types of metadata  that could be collected and the benefits of a DIDs to the community. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal seems to have the right team members to progress the described approach to this primarily fact-finding project. First and foremost, access to the municipal council with a Council member is paramount. But what has not been explained is whether the idea has already been presented to council and what its general reception is to the idea. Nonetheless there's enough details presented that success in achieving its goal of producing a 'small city roadmap to Atala Prims DID adoption' is very likely. It would have increased the score had the population size of Flagstaff been added and the demographics required to build on a true representation of the community's opinion. Perhaps this could be added to the measures of success especially given this activity relies on participation. It also would have been beneficial to describe how Flagstaff compares to other municipalities in the state/country to demonstrate how representative its community's views are, and whether the small city roadmap output can be taken as a true road map for other small cities across the United States.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The audibility of this proposal is presented as part of the Timeline and Budget heading and an undertaking from its Board to perform audits. Judging by the allocation, audit and oversight is a paid activity by its members. Depending on how this internal audit will be communicated to Catalyst and its members has not been explained. What has been described is the uploading of the zoom workshops to a YouTube channel. How the timing of the video upload to Catalyst's audit reporting schedules is uncertain. There is also a measure of uncertainty in terms of the Atala Prism 'development for municipal' use. Currently,, the final version of Atala Prism has not yet been released so any 'development' has a dependency on IOHK timelines. This part of the described process may not be so auditable if Atala is not yet ready for scrutiny and assessment.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "In creating a roadmap to follow for small cities who wish to implement DID for a given reason (which also should be teased out in the process of developing the roadmap), the potential for this proposal's impact is exactly what Cardano seeks on its way to greater adoption and usage. This project, if executed well, definitely has the potential to \"substantially grow Cardano's user-base, network-utility, network-value & ADA circulation\". That being said, it will be extremely important for the project manager/director to discern the actual needs of the community and whether having a DID will oil the wheels of municipal governance or create more friction. My point being, is not to use technology for technology's sake, but rather to observe impartially during the community outreach and workshop phases whether DID can actually solve a problem or problems they community members are having in trying to use multiple municipal resources (like aforementioned hospitals, employment, etc.). The other thing here to note is whether the problems are scalable and likely common to other municipal systems in the US (and around the world) or if they're unique to, in this case, Flagstaff AZ.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would keep in mind that may help the project succeed is this: what other resources does Cardano offer already that may entice all stakeholders involved to feel more drawn in to this project and make them feel like they need to be a part of this? In other words, what does being a part of the Cardano ecosystem offer potential DID holders that makes this an awesome, value-added deal for them and not just another ID for them to show security at the hospital. For example, and please note that this is a bad suggestion but just one that I thought of off the top of my head: with their DID, they could get a free NFT minted from the Flagstaff City NFT Project that showcases illustrations of memorable cacti in and around Flagstaff...which they could then use to show staff at restaurants for a 10% discount.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'm not sure if, even if perfectly implemented, the proposal will be able to create an effective, scalable roadmap for other cities to follow, but I think that is the point of this proposal. If effectively executed, and without bias, the answers will become clearer as friction points between municipal services in Flagstaff are uncovered through further research and after garnering the opinions of the community through the community outreach and workshop phases.\r\n\r\nFor my own edification, I'm going to list the proposal's strengths as regards this stage:\r\n-There is solid evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal, including the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal.\r\n-The budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. \r\n-The budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals.\r\n-There is a realistic timetable to complete the work.\r\n-There is a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how, as well as describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\n-It explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.\r\n\r\nThat being stated, I'd like more clarity on what deliverables the Board of Advisors will deliver: basically, what oversight will be provided and how will the project be evaluated (if there could be a rubric, that would be excellent)? The point I'm making here is how will you be able to tell if this proposal is succeeding - 200 Flagstaffians with DID's? A solid and effective roadmap for Arizona cities with populations of less that 500,000 people? \r\n\r\nSo, what does success look like even at this early stage and how will the BoA evaluate that you are succeeding?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has strong potential for auditability, but I would like to see some clearly stated goals that would make Phase 1 a success. I think they could be arbitrary, but it may be useful to have some quantifiable numbers to which the proposal aspires.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the following are very present throughout the first phase of this proposal:\r\n\r\n-There is a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\n-There is a clear understandable description of the targeted problem.\r\n-There will hopefully be a clear understandable solution that addresses the problem.\r\n\r\nThe only issue is with the following:\r\n-Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to include a blank audit template that the Board of Advisors will fill in regarding this proposal....because the main point here is that you have an idea of what success will look like pre-implementation (and then it could definitely change as the roadmap develops through community input), but having a more granular representation of success from the beginning may help you keep goals at the forefront of your minds.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_452", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u5c0f\u898f\u6a21\u90fd\u5e02\u3067DID\u3092\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3059\u308b\u3002\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u3092\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u5730\u57df\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u80b2\u3066\u3066\u3044\u304f\u3002", "experience": "\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u3068\u3057\u3066\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u306e\u73fe\u5f79\u5e02\u8b70\u4f1a\u8b70\u54e1\u3001\u8349\u306e\u6839\u30aa\u30fc\u30ac\u30ca\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u3001JD\u3001PhD\u3001\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30fb\u30d5\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30af\u958b\u767a\u8005"}
