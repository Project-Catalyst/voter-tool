Long complex address strings do intimidate many users and dissuade them from using blockchain solutions therefore a solution that simplified those addresses into meaningful terms would encourage more users to use dApps.\r\nMy understanding however is that Human Readable Addresses are already on the Cardano roadmap as seen in this video https://youtu.be/WRYRjmMvkJM?t=999 which would make this proposal redundant unless I am missing some nuance.\r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagee that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.

He also argues several advantages of simplifying addresses, in addition to the readability issue, would help in several aspects, such as token transactions etc; and also because other blockchains have this kind of thing, Cardano also needs it, it wouldn't make sense for tentors of ada, tokens and etc in our community to coin their addresses on the Ethereum Name Service, for example. This technology would add more value to Atala Prism ID, as the challenge seeks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the author's preparation to carry out this proposal, there is no doubt that he is fully capable of successfully making the tool. We have a brief description of who he is, followed by his linkedin profile, where we can see in more detail about his work and past experiences. In addition, a link to a website that explains more extensively and in detail about the proposal is attached to us, which demonstrates that the author has full technical knowledge of it. The only problem I found here was the fact that he didn't show interest in hiring any other professional to develop the proposal. I think it would be interesting for someone to do the marketing and explain to users how to acquire a simplified address, if it wasn't automatic (this part was a little confusing in my opinion). About the roadmap, we have a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat is to come, and about the financial division, we don't know anything, leading us to believe that all the money would go to the author's working hours.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author states that the technology would take 4 to 6 months to be developed, and mentions in topics some actions that would need to take place to do so. However, it would be better if such information were more accurate, for example: what would happen in month 1, 2 and so on. As I mentioned in the previous comment, it would be important to clarify with Atala Prism users that they would know about this possibility, how they would learn to use it. Would it be important to include some kind of instruction in this regard, when Atala Prism is released, would information be provided about address simplification? I think it's also important to establish some kind of monitoring, so that the community could monitor how many users would be using the tool, and that this was constantly mentioned so that no one would stop using the benefit. In addition, there is the issue of the financial breakdown as well, it is essential that we understand exactly how the funding would be used, and we have not said anything about this in the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal utilizes Atala Prism Capacities and will increase adoption without the end-user needing to even know about Atala Prism.\r\nEspecially when you consider that Developers will definitely know about the Atala Connections to the DID Standard Service Features here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I would like to see the WBS and funding/effort for high level sections or pieces of the plan.
