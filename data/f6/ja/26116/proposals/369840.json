It is an app to line up tutors with learners. The proposers have submitted a basically the same idea into 5 other challenges. In the metadata challenge it seemed to fit reasonably well but they have not stated how it fits with this challenge. This specific submission is basically a perfect cut and paste as that submitted to the developer ecosystem challenge and the  Catalyst value onboarding. The only difference is it is 10k rather than 5k or 15k the cost (likely adjusted to the total money available in the challenges).

The proposal's target market info should include the number of online tutors and students in the market. The competitive advantages over similar existing services are clearly stated. The go-to-market plan is a little weak as it simply relies on existing contacts and networking from there.\r\nThe funding request is actually for testing two approaches to preventing sybil attacks, Atala Prism DIDs vs simple social network analysis. Ultimately, if the simple social network analysis is deemed sufficient then the challenge objective would not be met.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.\r\nThe team has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is for testing purposes that may not achieve the campaign goals and is not broken down into identifiable items. \r\nI recommend requesting funds to integrate DID with your product instead of \"This means that our network must be independently sybil-resistant (zoom recordings give us good access to data, but simple social network analysis might be enough), or we must partner with a complete digital identity solution like Atala prism.

Someone's reviews of a person probably should not be considered identity.\r\nHowever, there is value in the services they provide, or will provide. This could be a possible component of existing educational efforts, and possibly the commercial aspect and lack of open source sharing is what I have some issue with. Also, it maybe worth mentioning there is not a tie in with Atala PRISM while there would seem to be a use and need for one. It would seem to me that Atala should provide the decentralized assets for this proposal while it focused on the centralized ones: and those centralized assets and the Tutorchain.io app then expands Atala.

I just question how that value relates to Atala, but could be wrong in that it should be.

I am concerned though that this borders on just being a marketing attempt. The proposers mention how Cardano is their top choice. It would seem if this proposal is good-to-go that their blockchain choice, and perhaps an integration with Atala, would be more solid in this proposal and that leads me to question if this is indeed a proposal or marketing for Tutorchain.io (the app name within the proposal name could also be telling here).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_363", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a use case in which it would bring a large amount of user if it was adopted.
