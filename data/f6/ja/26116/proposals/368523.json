The proposal requires future funding before any significant DID usage however the proposal provides two very large plausible use cases (Xbox gaming & LinkedIn) either of which could scale to millions quickly if implemented.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has evidence of the technical skills however there is no indication in the proposal or his LinkedIn profile that the proposer has any established relationship with Microsoft therefore this proposal would essentially be a cold call sales attempt which traditionally have a low success rate. The proposer also has no apparent special relationship with Cardano/IOHK/Emurgo beyond the Catalyst Community either.  \r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals but is not broken down into identifiable items and is simply time and materials. The hourly labor rate should be specified.\r\nThere is no timetable.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal instead being on a time and materials basis.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation.\r\nIt is not clear to me what value the proposer adds to trying to establish a relationship between Microsoft and Cardano/IOHK/Emurgo other than getting the ball going. If Cardano wants to pursue this idea they should just do make the call on their own. \r\nIf the Catalyst community wants to see this done then a proposer should pick one of the partnership ideas and approach Microsoft in advance of a proposal (ideally they could find someone within the Catalyst community with inside ties at Microsoft).\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal does not provide a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline.\r\nThe proposal should detail specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal (if realized) would answer the challenge.\r\nHowever, there are no metrics provided to allow any assessment of the scope.
