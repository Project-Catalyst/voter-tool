It, on the one hand suggests that proposers 'Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem,' and, on the other hand, 'This Challenge is about small ways we can incorporate DIDs into the Cardano ecosystem to start the ground swell at the grassroots that demands PII be secured and controlled with DID technologies and standards. \r\nThis proposal addresses the latter, not the former, in a way.  So, I say that I agree that it does effectively address the challenge, in that from a grass-roots perspective, it could. If effectively executed!  (see more below). \r\nI want to support this proposal in that it potentially addresses a visionary application of Cardano's ecosystem, to solve a charitable need in many communities around the world, namely, the need for a kind of universal basic income for those in need.  \r\nNow, let's see about feasibility...", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal is visionary, but daunting... Given the money asked for, which is very little, I would definitely support the continuation of work done to realize the vision.  However, the daunting nature of the task keeps me in a more neutral position when responding to this proposal and assessing the feasibility of the project. Where to begin. First, read the paper at: \r\nhttps://ancientkraken.gitbook.io/cardano-universal-basic-income/\r\nThen, take the time to think through how the project would be realized... how to integrate into the existing charitable infrastructure, and merchant culture of a given jurisdiction... I would like to see more details on these elements of the proposed idea.  Give specific case study details: who, what, where in Sacramento, CA? \r\nStart with a call to charitable allocations of ADA to CUBI stake pools from already existing members of the Cardano ecosystem who want to delegate whole or partial amounts of their stake to such a pool, and take that to the community leaders of Sacramento who would then be asked to place taxpayer capital into a locally operated stake pool dedicated to that purpose, with evidence to persuade them to make that leap. \r\nI guess what I am trying to say is, scale down the proposal into phases, with a smaller chunk of the vision set in Phase 1, for example, that then would lead to a Phase 2, where proposers take it to the local community leaders in Sacramento (for example) with evidence based metrics of success that show them how it could work for that community as a whole.  \r\nThen, the more grand vision could be made manifest, hopefully. Namely, that local communities could invest in the Cardano ecosystem (establishing Stake Pools, etc.) dedicated to enhancing their local populations of people in need of smart charitable systems of support.  \r\nIf I have correctly understood the nature of the proposal, its project and scope... Which I find amazing. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is nothing in the proposal about how to access the success of the ideas presented.  I do not want to be too harsh however, again, due to issues presented above, namely, that the idea and its scope, which is amazing, does not correspond to the amount of money being asked for, which is not very much. Meaning, I hope this project can develop into a funded one, and, if there is a revision of the proposal, into 'smaller chunks' that include a more specific roadmap with measurable milestones and ways of accessing the success of the proposed ideas, then, WE WOULD DEFINITELY fund this proposal idea.  I hope.

The title is misleading as the solution is not a \"Universal\" Basic Income strategy rather it is a targeted Basic Income scheme for lower income individuals.\r\nThe goal of providing an Ada basic income to individuals with DIDs aligns with the challenge objective.\r\nThe solution does not scale to drawing in millions of DID users. Using the gitbook Example Case 1 and scaling to 1 million users would require 1000 stake pools with 64 billion ADA staked.
