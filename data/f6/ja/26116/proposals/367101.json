The funding request is for 6 months to develop a proof of concept that does not list DID integration as a feature. DID integration is listed as a long term success factor \"for those who wish to use it.\"\r\nThe proposal will not to scale to drawing in millions of DID users based upon this funding round.

Operational costs should be broken down into more detail.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work but does not show what is being done when. The entire project is simply a one shot deliverable in 6 months.\r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation. The risk factors identified are for education in Latin America.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal does not provide a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline instead it has a short term success factor if the Proof of Concept being funded is completed in 6 months which is not ideal. \r\nIdeally, the proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. Given that the project does not onboard any DID users for the funding period, it should at least project a time beyond this phase when the community could expect to see DID users being recruited. \r\nThe proposal does provide KPIs that define success for the project.\r\nThe proposal should detail specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is very well developed, however I do not think it is the most appropriate challenge, it seems to be an educational platform, I do not see where the digital representation comes in.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I believe they have an excellent team prepared to successfully develop the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the metrics and information provided is very clear to measure the progress and success of the proposal.
