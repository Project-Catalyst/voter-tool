And, as I myself have been asking in Town Hall Breakout rooms, how are we moving forward with developing 'reputation' in our involvement with Catalyst, etc.? As CA's, as community members, and so on.  So, now we have a proposal that is addressing making tools to do just that.  Great. Why not start with 'us'!  And build out from there...

They are very active members of the Catalyst community, and seem to have thought this proposal through in a detailed enough way to see to its successful implementation.  It would be a good use of 8% of the budget allocated to this Challenge.

The proposal includes a workshop and marketing budget to encourage usage of the developed tools which is very beneficial.\r\nThe relatively small budget request compared to the potentially large impact on achieving the challenge objective is a very good ROI (Investment and Intent).\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals and is broken down into identifiable items.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work and shows what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal with a budget of $500 for hosting and software.\r\nAlthough not separately categorized, the proposal does identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation in the form of the unknown go live date of Atala Prism puts their timeline at risk.

We know that the first thing they will do is develop the accreditation tools, and then they will teach the community how to use them. It's good that they already have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhen they would do it, after the Town Halls.
