The challenge is \"to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem\" and this proposal is reversing down the \"onramp\" in that it recruits existing Cardano users (BingoChain players must already have an Ada wallet to play) to get DIDs. \r\nAn argument could be made that BingoChain itself is an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem and by integrating DID it is encouraging adoption of DID but even then the proposal states that Atala Prism will be an \"alternate authentication provider\" therefore the majority of DID users would likely already be using DID instead of new recruits.\r\nThe proposal could potentially scale to millions of DID users although it is not clear if this proposal would facilitate the recruitment or simply benefit from existing DID users. The optional nature of the DID login combined with the fact that DID is not integral in any way other than to login is the issue. Add some additional features that take advantage of DIDs to entice people toward the DID option. \r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links although this is offset somewhat by the operational website.\r\nThe team has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals but is not broken down into identifiable items.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work and does not show what is being done and when however the implementation is very short.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal but there likely are none.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation however the scope is very limited so there are no apparent significant risks.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline.\r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. \r\nThe proposal details specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals (GitHub repository).\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "A can see how requiring people to have Atala Prism DID to enter the game will \"onboard\" more users to Atala Prism DID - will the Atala Prism DID be mandatory to play the game or is it just optional login functionality?
