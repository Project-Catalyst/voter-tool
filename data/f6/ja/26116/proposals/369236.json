Specifically the lack of existing interested partners and a marketing plan to obtain them is a major risk to meeting the challenge objectives.

The budget has a detailed breakdown. Given the size of the project, the estimated costs are +$80k.

The proposer has clearly thought about their problem statement and offers an innovative solution that could be adopted by any group or organization. In addition to being well thought out, the proposer clearly identifies the need for a community solution to a fairly wicked problem, globally. While the proposer notes that everything is certified in the developed countries already, it is likely that this solution would be for new companies, as well as those already well situated. Providing a solution that works in both the developed/developing contexts will have an even greater impact and positive effect for the community at large. If successful, I feel very confident that this would return huge dividends for the Cardano Community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposers lays out a very clear argument for why this is a problem, and breaks down the solution into smaller tangible pieces that articulate to voters the steps necessary to reach the end goal: \"open-source software where everybody can issue and claim certificates\". In addition, the fact that the proposer outlines that this is an open source project, the community will have ample opportunities to test out the product, adapt it, upgrade it, and so on. This intention to return the final product to the community also can give faith to the community that this project will be implemented successfully. The proposer is encouraging this dialogue, which is a necessary step in building voter confidence. \r\nI must also note that at first when I read the budget I thought it was a bit high but completely reasonable, given the potential for disruption such a system could have. The fact that the proposer then cuts that budget in half and will incur half the costs themself is a true testament to their commitment. This also implies that the proposer is willing to take the risk that this project will be a success and is willing to back it up with his own money. A first of all the proposals I've reviewed.

The proposer has clearly thought about the necessary components that would need to align in order to complete this project. The metrics to measure and success criteria are explicit and can easily be evaluated by the community. \r\nAs mentioned in the response above, there is an additional layer of auditability which can be applied to this project through the proposer making it open source. This condition will allow a diverse mix of Cardano developers and users to engage with the developed software and to adapt it to their needs. This, at least to me, will result in the project being evergreen and iterative throughout it's lifetime. The ability to continually adapt and improve is a foundational feature of the Cardano ecosystem and I really appreciate integrating this feature into catalyst projects.
