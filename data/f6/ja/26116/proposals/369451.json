This proposal aims to to do that by creating a DID bridge between the hyperledger Indy and Cardano blockchains.\r\n\r\nThe problem statement doesn't call out a specific problem but makes a general statement about lack of infrastructure. The problem statement should be more specific. I think an improved problem statement would be \"Cardano does not currently have DID bridges to other blockchains\" which is much more specific and sets up the solution statement better. \r\n\r\nThe solution statement is succinct but doesn't relate well the problem statement because the problem statement isn't well crafted.\r\n\r\nThe goals and metrics of this proposal are well aligned with the challenge. A cross blockchain DID/VC platform will certainly improve DID adoption and having an open source wallet which can interop between several blockchains is a great idea. I do wish a link to the existing product was provided.\r\n\r\nThis proposal I believe will be scalable assuming the DID/VC platform is well architected. The wallet should scale just fine and the underlying infrastructure of Cardano and Hyperledger will scale quite well.\r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score of 4 because the problem statement isn't well crafted and some details about the existing product (which will be extended) are missing.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is highly experienced with decades (maybe even a century) of total experience. This is a very positive signal. The links to the LinkedIn profiles of the team is highly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThe implementation plan is quite sparse though. Being an engineer myself (distributed systems, devops, and ML infra), I find it hard to believe that in 3 months an interblockchain DID protocol will be architected, developed and pushed into production with a comprehensive test suite (the test suite isn't mentioned but I believe inter blockchain tech should be well tested). Not only that, the team wants to build a DID/VC issuing platform and an opensource wallet. The team also wants the wallet to be multilingual and I know that internationalization is a difficult and tedious engineering process. The proposal doesn't mention which languages will be supported. The proposal also doesn't mention which tech will be used to make the mobile apps.\r\n\r\nMy opinion would be different if a link to the existing product was provided so that I can evaluate how far along the existing product is. I also took a look at the provided websites and I'm not impressed by the quality of tech there. They're quite simple websites with only a landing page and a contact us form. The websites do not match the entrepreneurial experience of the team.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear if the budget will last for the entire 12 months of listed work or if the team will request more funding in the future. \r\n\r\nThe proposal doesn't outline a marketing plan - how will they gain \"Stable & growing user base of digital wallet across Canada and India, including government orgs\".\r\n\r\nOverall, I strongly disagree that this proposal has a highly likelihood of successful implementation. I expect that a team of this caliber would have a much stronger proposal with more details.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As stated in the impact portion of this assessment, the problem statement does not clearly identify a targeted problem. However, the solution statement does clearly state a solution.\r\n\r\nThis proposal provides a roadmap with 3, 6 and 12 month milestones but it's not clear if the requested funding is for the entire 12 months of work or just a portion. The milestones are clearly articulated but some of them are not precisely measurable. What does \"Stable & growing userbase of digital wallet across Canada and India, including government orgs\" mean? How can it be stable and growing at the same time? Growing at what rate? How many governement orgs? What distribution across Canada and India? What does \"Commercial adoption of VC issuer/verifier platform in the US, Europe, and India\" mean? How will commerical adoption be measured? Why isn't Canada in the list for commerical adoption but in the list for consumer adoption? How will we know if this wallet is \"globally recognized as the most trusted digital identity wallet\"? How do you measure trust levels across the globe?\r\n\r\n\"Digital wallet and issuer/verifier platform enables Cardano to compete as the preferred distributed ledger for the adoption of decentralized digital identity globally\" is nonsensical. Cardano will compete regardless of whether this proposal gets funded. Cardano might not win without this proposal but it will be competing nonetheless.\r\n\r\nOne of the 12 month milestones are is good, it will be easy to verify if 10 mid-to-large size companies adopt the project. \r\n\r\nOverall, I give this proposal a score of 3 for auditability.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_531", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 6, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3001VC\u306e\u767a\u884c\u30fb\u691c\u8a3c\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3068\u3001Hyperledger Indy\u3084Cardano\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3068\u306e\u76f8\u4e92\u904b\u7528\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3059\u308b\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30a6\u30a9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u7121\u6599\u3067\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "IDLynx.com\u3001AyanWorks.com\u3001DigitalIdentityTrust.org\u306e\u6226\u7565\u7684\u5354\u540c\u7d44\u5408\u306f\u3001SSI\u6280\u8853\u3001\u30ac\u30d0\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b9\u30b1\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u4e16\u754c\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u5c02\u9580\u77e5\u8b58\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
