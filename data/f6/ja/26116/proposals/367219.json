So may be you could consider reevaluating your proposition in this lite and give more long term view over the project along with real Use Case examples, as the proposition details are quite abstract.     ", "q0r": 4, "q1": " This idea could bring real value to the Cardano community and specifically to Atala Prism, but the task is complex, the similar solutions seems like much more deep (including some economical calculation and better marketing).  So it seem more like a task to a team of players with expertise in different areas than to a single developer.
