A Basic password is doing the job right now perfectly well.\r\nIf what the proposal seeks is funding to continue their noble efforts I don't think this is the way to get it from Cardano's Treasury. Neither a good use for these resources.\r\nI'd rather go towards generate a certificate of personal emissions stored in our blockchain or a SMARTCONTRACT of some sort that states personal commitments that if you don't comply you can pay to net your emissions (same as companies) or even an NFT of your achievements and efforts to help with climate change, but not a DID.\r\nThe project seems to aim at continuing developing the existing site rather than contributing to the challenge goal of making great use cases for DID and enhance and grow the ATALA PRISM ecosystem and the Cardano's Blockchain.\r\nThe team experience and acumen is impressive and I bet they will find other appropriate ways to fund this or change the proposal and apply for next fund with a better and more related use case.\r\nThe funds requested seem right for the level of effort, but not a good RO\u00cd (Return on Intention) for the Cardano's community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Yes the timeline is totally viable, even though I think is too long (6-9 months).\r\nThe plan is detailed and provide specific milestones to understand what will be delivered in each step.\r\nThe part of the plan that is not clear is why and how the DID will be implemented, so I found it difficult to assess if the intention will succeed, as I foresee several issues with the users as requiring a DID could potentially generate an unnecessary hassle for users.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics provided are detailed and smart, but they are not well aligned with the overall purpose of the site being developed. If a simple and seamless experience is the goal so many more users adopt the platform and take action on climate care and emission reduction activities, then I think the proposed solution fails to give the funded reasons to understand how this will be achieved by adding a DID to the project.\r\n\r\nAgain I am totally supportive of the intention and great cause, but I do think we shall do it right and I cannot foresee this path will lead to success, at least not by adding DID.\r\nTherefore I don't think this proposal will help to achieve the goals of this challenge.\r\nIf you can regroup and review how the blockchain and Cardano's way of doing things and its community can add to the cause I think you will have a winner proposal and worth the use of our Treasury Funds.

One main concern raised by the CA is why we need a DID - the CA even mentioned as a solution to have a carbon certificate or NFT. The CA might not fully understand the model which is explained under the solution section, as the DID footprint is a dynamic measure and being calculated ongoing. It is not a one time process, it is the current climate impact ID each one of us has. I even answered about it in one of the comments. This is a key guiding point in the review and it repeated several times and in each section (Impact, Feasibility, Auditability). The CA might not fully understand the proposal and the importance of the DID for it - i.e. to connect with travel sites and get incentives. \n\n\n2. From the CAMPAIGN Brief \"While we prefer to support Atala PRISM's instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.\" \n\nSo any comment that miss this point when looking at the DID climate proposal should be flagged.
