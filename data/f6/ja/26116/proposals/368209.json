The proposal requires future funding before any significant DID usage.The proposal predicts 5000 users in 12 months for a cost of $45,000 which is $9.00 per DID user which is on the high side compared to other proposals however over time as more users are added that rate would drop. \r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals compared to similar proposals but is not broken down into identifiable items.\r\nAdditional funding is required to develop the product to the point that the challenge objectives would be met, the proposer has not provided a plan on obtaining these funds other than they are professional and outside Catalyst. \r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work and shows what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation. The largest risk is that future funding is not obtained and the MVP closes down due to lack of funds.

Why ?\n1) I brought this team of proposers to Fund 6. I am acting as their senior advisor and co-proposer. The team initially planned to develop this as a 'traditional application'. I successfully convinced the proposing team that without DID & tokenomics-foundation, a lot of future opportunities will be missed. \n2) This means that this proposer team is NEW TO CARDANO AND CATALYST - ISN'T THIS SOMETHING WE WANT ? According to this proposer it seem to be hard to join from 'outside'. Apparently he also assumes that CATALYST proposals need to already be realized, asking for retrospective funding - this is the only way I ever could imagine how the requested information could be seriously provided. In my eyes this is a very critical BIAS. \n3) The ACADEMY team made this proposal within the ATALA PRISM DID challenge setting, because here we can interact with the right experts for INTEGRATING our DID approach with what is already emerging or already available (technically and also with selected universities and institutions). \n4) Therefore putting FOUNDATIONAL WORK as part of this proposal is NOT A WEAKNESS, BUT A NECCESSITY !\n5) What is critizised here are lacking details, which\n a) Either are already there in our MIRO working environment, which are way too detailed for integrating this ino a proposal like this and require a 'guided tour', or \nb) Cannot be there by nature, since we want to use this Challenge Setting for creating something really new and future-oriented. \nc) There is a complete (clickable) POC of the MINDCARDS functionality already available and shown on our WEBSITE. From the functional perspective, we are far beyond 'idea phase'.
