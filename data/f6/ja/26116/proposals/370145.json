However, I do not see in the proposal or supporting content how it specifically intends to leverage the PRISM DID.  The challenge brief does indicate that using PRISM DID is not required by its use of the word \"preferably\" in the following sentence: \"Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released).\" Still, it would be helpful to know if the proposal intends to use PRISM or not, and if yes, how.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs Phil Lewis said in the comments section on the proposal (see below), no details are given on the actual software techniques that will be used to leverage specific features of the Prism DID identifier capabilities. \r\nAs I said earlier, apparently not required by the challenge, but still very useful when evaluating the risk/reward ratio to the Cardano Treasury for this project.\r\n\r\n------------ Comment by Phil Lewis -----------:\r\n\r\n\" Hi cliffordchoi\r\n\r\nCould you please elaborate on how the proposed smart card will utilise Atala PRISM's Decentralised Identifier capabilities? \r\n\r\nAs this would be used in the physical/offline world, could you provide an example of how it could be used for identity purposes?\r\n\r\nWith software, the owner can authorise the use of their identity with an application.  What security mechanism would there be to authorise the use of a physical smart card?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nPhil\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the information provided I can not safely assess with confidence how likely that the proposal can be delivered by the team.  Some issues:\r\n\r\n- In the video they claim that they can guarantee the integrity of the platform, end to end, hardware and software.  But I do not see any proof of this key statement.  How will they prevent tampering with the hardware and software?  What technology, patents, awards, etc. do they have to support that critical claim?\r\n\r\n- Who will do the actual manufacturing?  What steps will they take to prevent the manufacturer from installing a back-door or \"master fingerprint\" that could compromise the entire system?  Some details in the proposal or a successive one about manufacturing contacts and experience would be very helpful.\r\n\r\n- The cost of the card is $20.  the supporting documentation does not indicate if that is their manufacturing cost or the cost to the end user.  Even in the best case and that is the cost to the end user, what research have they done to discover if that price will deter mass adoption in poorer countries where $20 USD is a large amount of money?\r\n\r\n- They state \"The system on chip (SoC) cannot be hacked by web-level software attacks\". It would be helpful to have a link to a document that describes, at least in general how this is true or enforced since it is such an important claim.\r\n\r\nGiven that the proposal funding request is a large share of the challenge pool, a more detailed proposal that expands on these topics would be very helpful.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although I do see project calendar milestones, I do not see any specific performance metrics in the proposal text or the supporting documentation and that makes assessing the auditability of the project hard.  It would help a lot to see possible targets.  For example: a schedule for the number of users that they intend to have onboarded and by what dates, how many Cardano dApps they intend to integrate with (wallets, etc.) and by when, and so forth.  I would really like to see at least some estimates on potential growth targets in a future proposal.  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is impressive and far-reaching.  If completed it could provide a powerful tool in a convenient form factor that would help to secure many dApps on the Cardano network.  However, given that the proposal is asking for nearly half of the challenge funds pool, voters will need to carefully assess the value of this proposal against the other proposals it might displace that have smaller budget requests and shorter time frames, and therefore less uncertainty when it comes to their ability to deliver something the Cardano ecosystem can benefit from.  \r\n\r\nGiven that the requested amount is only for the initial stage of a project that needs 1 million dollars overall to fulfill and a year total to bring to production, voters will need to balance the intriguing nature of this proposal against their belief that the team can deliver.  Despite the impressive credentials of the team members, the team roster descriptions  are quite brief and I don't see developers listed with hard skills in the client and server side tools necessary to deliver the Cardano integration software pieces.  A future proposal with that information would be of great help.  Because of this, I do not find myself in a position to estimate their ability to deliver.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_551", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The example given for Phil was an example how the card is used to authenticate a DID and payment on Atala Prism. \n\n\"If a person (Alice) wanted to get a prescription from the pharmacy, the pharmacist (Bob) could scan her card (QR code or NFC) and then Atala PRISM could help retrieve Alice's medical records and prescriptions. This would help Bob verify the right person, right prescription, and the right dose. Likewise, Bob could use his DID to access the pharmacy's controlled-substances room, check her insurance coverage, verify her doctor's orders and credentials, and process the point of sale transaction with her smart card. She is the only person that the smart card recognizes and the only one that can authorize a payment.\" \n\nThis is on-and-offline authentication connected to Prism. We can guarantee end-to-end integrity because the chip design, firmware, and cryptography is engineered by our team. We use TPM ISO/IEC 11889 specifications to establish a Root of Trust (RoT) to guarantee integrity of the platform. Some technical stuff I left out, because I was trying to keep it simple. We will have third party audits to verify our claim. FYI, the DoD uses that TPM specification also. Our manufacturing partner was listed on the Lean Business Plan (TSMC - is the world's most valuable semiconductor company). The $100K request should have been $50k for fund 6 and $50k for fund 7. That could not be changed last minute. I requested a change. \n\nThe goal seems far-reaching, however the engineers are reloading the card now for the MAS competition (9 week accelerator). We were listed as the top 15 finalist and have one more month to present to the MAS Challenge. The DID is a key piece the banks (our heavyweight competition) are missing. But we can use any blockchain as a backend. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash are on the 2018 version. We are looking at other chains, partners, and wallets now. The photo of the current card shows a Bitcoin QR code. The DID would be a QR code also.\n\nWe did not list our embedded programmers, cryptographers, or other developers. Just the core team. Most of us have worked in the tech over 20 years so some of us do not have public profiles. But calls and meetings can verify credentials. \n\nThe calendar milestones can be planned, however, I just put a bucket list of things to do. I would be the one to update the communnity. But I thought that was a given.
