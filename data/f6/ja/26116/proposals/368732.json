Atala PRISM is a decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain. It addresses many entities that provide digital forms of identity/achievements (digital assets), on one hand, and the users who need their personal data (the same digital assets) and access a myriad of services, on the other hand.\r\nIn this use case, starting from 'Grants Management System' the proposer should think of a solution that solves a problem that is characteristic to the 'traditional' way of grants' management. (The 'traditional 'grants management system could have as output, something that can be used as a digital asset and is useful for the users to access another service (or even to get another grant)).\r\nThe proposal, based on how it was described, doesn't fit the challenge settings.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer doesn't provide evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposer has not presented, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. Also is very vague what the known 2 members have as duties/tasks to perform and what is the output of their work. (assign a role to each one)\r\nThe proposal doesn't offer a realistic timetable to complete the work. (each development stage should have a realistic time frame to deliver a functional component/product)\r\nIt is unclear what (and how many) resources are necessary to implement the proposal. (what resources (human, stationery etc.) are needed to successfully complete the project?)\r\nThe budget is outlined but is not presented in a clear and understandable manner ('$19,000 is the figure we were given to higher a contracted development team to build the first ...(missing noun)'.\r\nThe proposal doesn't clearly explain technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.\r\nThe proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.

Kudos on the narrative which is a \"novel\" addition however the proposer has sacrificed on details on what exactly is being proposed. The solution statement promises identity theft protection implemented in a grants management system but then never explains how identity theft protection is provided in the solution.\r\nThe goal of a Grants Management System integrated with Atala Prism aligns with the challenge objective.\r\nThe proposal does not scale to drawing in millions of DID users. The proposal requires future funding before any significant DID usage.\r\nMy recommendation would be to complete the Pre-funding objectives prior to the next round of funding which will strengthen your business case. Combining Goal 2&3 into a single $50K request is not unreasonable although a $25K request may have a slightly higher odds of success. Look for alternative potential funding sources and put them in your proposal to show that you have alternatives to just Catalyst funding.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.

Solution appears to be hosted where do the hosting fees come from?\r\nAdditional funding is required to develop the product to the point that the challenge objectives would be met, the proposer has not provided a plan on obtaining these funds other than submitting another proposal in Funds 7-9.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work but only vaguely shows what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal.

The scope of 3 months for the funding is short though with a working prototype deliverable.\r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. As a prototype, the number of DID users projected would be 0 however the proposal should project out to a timeline in which the community could expect DID users to be recruited assuming future funding. When could the community expect the challenge objectives to be measurably met if this project were funded? \r\nThe proposal details specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals in the form of website updates, Catalyst Town Hall and Discord Servers.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u30a2\u30bf\u30e9\u306ePRISM\u304c\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u3092ID\u55aa\u5931\u306e\u60aa\u5922\u304b\u3089\u6551\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3001\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304b\u3089\u59cb\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002\u88dc\u52a9\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406", "experience": "**Nyagatare Valens** (++Financial Mgr++) MBA, Grants Mgmt 12\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a **Benjamin Hartin** (++Community Mgr++) \u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc 6\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a, \u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30aa\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc 21\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a"}
