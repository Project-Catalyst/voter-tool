It also serves the purpose of identifying the owner of this \"passive interface\" by biometrically locking that key to a human with a DNA reader. While at first glance it might seem pretty strange, it is a pretty interesting idea when put in the context of communities that do not have access to technology and that are deeply spiritual - it makes interacting with blockchain into a sort of religious experience with the community. I feel that the proposal addresses the challenge as it targets a very specific audience with a novel way to use blockchain with DIDs, although I do recommend to make the proposal more succinct.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has a pretty good idea of what they hope to accomplish and has laid out their relevant experience as well as what kind of additional assistance they would require. I am not sure about the technology that would be required to accomplish what is set out here, but my intuition is that the budget and time frame might be too low. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are some proposed milestones that describe what the proposer will be working on during the timeframe; although it is a bit unclear as to what the final outcome should be. Will there be some MVP for the device described in the whitepaper? Will a user be able to sign a transaction using the process put forth? It might be good to describe the deliverables for each milestone.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_142", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This challenge addresses the challenge effectively by taking the use of ATALA Prism to the edge communities and to use cases that are offline and/or remote. The proposal removes a lot of complexity from traditional blockchain on-boarding and makes the identity validation use case use unique methods that do not rely on screens, which, in my opinion will expand the DID use case beyond what would normally be envisioned. As a software developer, I appreciate this new context as it is novel and thinking outside of the box - quite literally :)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While a lot of this is highly experimental, the idea is well laid out and has clear achievable goals. The thing keeping me from strongly agreeing on the feasibility is the question in my mind around the accuracy, speed, reliability, and cost of doing DNA sequencing in the field. While I admit that this is not a strong area of knowledge for me, I do wonder at how easy this key part of the proposal will be to over come.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has clear 6 and 12 month benchmarks which look to be highly verifiable and auditable, and it has an ultimate deliverable that either works or it doesn't. Also, if successful and able to on-board sovereign individuals in communities that are remote, or traditionally, culturally, or technologically adverse to screens, then it will have been successful in bringing DIDs to communities that would otherwise not have had them.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_285", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "An inventive and thoughtful proposal which does clearly address the challenge (despite the proposer's evident worry that readers might interpret the challenge as insisting on the use of Atala Prism). This proposal humanises identity-checking, addresses the culture of communities without access to screen-based tech, and above all provides a fascinating exploration of the ideas underpinning DID.  Although it might not directly drive mass adoption,  it will provoke discussion and awareness about DID in general; and probably particularly in the arts, where otherwise people might not come into much contact with the concept. The proposal also addresses the aspect of the challenge that refers to our role as thought leaders \u2013 the mass adoption of DID surely needs to be underpinned by this kind of exploration of its meaning and implications. Using an object which is a cognate of the immutability of a blockchain transaction could help people to understand what a blockchain transaction is, and understand the concepts around DID in greater depth, which will drive a more informed and confident response to it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has already done a lot of background work and thought on the ideas underpinning the proposal, which adds to its feasibility. They have some of the needed expertise already on board, and seem likely to have the relevant  contacts to find the rest. The time plan is realistic and well-thought-through. The budget looks realistic (although it would be helpful to include an estimate of the time commitment that would be asked of the developers, as that amount given seems quite low to cover work over 12 months. I am assuming that the proposer is one of the developers, and then an additional developer will be hired in a supporting role.) The only other thing that might be useful to assess feasibility is an explicit assessment of key risks and how the proposer might mitigate them; but in essence it does seem likely that the project would be implemented.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The clear benchmarks make it easy to audit the progress of the project; and there is a clearly defined goal or output, which can also be audited. The depth of the proposer's initial research, included in the proposal, suggests that they will bring the same approach to documenting and recording the process and the qualitative learning and wider outcomes.
