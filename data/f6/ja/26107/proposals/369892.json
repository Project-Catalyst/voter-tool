The resulting CIP if accepted could really drive Cardano to the forefront of blockchain smart contracts. For the small amount they are asking for it seems we can't afford not to explore this. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have detailed their extensive relevant experience and obviously have a passion for this. They have presented a detailed and well articulated plan to produce a CIP which could really provide the type of confidence Smart contracts need to thrive.\r\nThe one question I would have is that given the relatively small amount of funds they are asking for, when converted to hours at the $100/hr rate they discuss, it is not that many hours. Could they not compress delivery of the whole project to a shorter timeframe than 12 months for the CIP? Smart contracts are imminent, why wait 12 months to produce a CIP that may fundamentally change how we deal with them?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A detailed plan is provided against which progress can easily be measured.

The goal of the metadata challenge is to implement anti-counterfeit and traceability solutions. Thus the project is within the challenge settings.  Implementation of the Ricardian contract standard and the development toolkit will have an unlimited impact on the Cardano ecosystem since it'll create a bridge between the legislation managing applications and Cardano platform capabilities by removing the room for fraud. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer team describes the relevant experience.  However, I could not locate the relevant references that support that. The proposer provided the links to the projects he worked on, but it's not easily verifiable that the team worked on those projects. Also, it would be helpful to describe the extended team and link to their credentials. \r\n\r\nThe proposal outlines the complete roadmap for the project. But I think it's important to clearly understand the target audience's needs that might utilize the Ricardian contract in the software that already exists or is being developed. I couldn't locate the mentions of the consultations needed outside the Cardano community or smart contract developers, or if such would be beneficial to identify the real-world needs. It will help if the proposal has a distinctive strategy to gather all-rounded feedback.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plan outlines the formalization of the existing standards and tools on the market, the proposer mentioned that the list of the presented tools and standards is not exhaustive, so it would be important to discuss the potential risks of the research phase taking longer than anticipated. \r\n\r\nIt would be reasonable to specify further technical details that match the budget breakdown, such as the community engagement expenses. And possibly indicate if there is any budget required to host and run the prototype.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project milestone definitely describes the plan and goes beyond the three-month scope. The standard draft and all related tools are planned to be open-sourced, will be published to GitHub. Perhaps having some drafts or UI mockups before the engagement of the community to keep the discussion in the timeline and scope would be beneficial. Also, it would help to follow the project progress. As mentioned before, the research phase timeline is a little concerning.

Some LinkedIn links, or awards/commendations available for inspection on the web, etc. would have been helpful and should be provided at a later date.  I didn't give less than 4 stars because the proposers are up front that the funding request is for a \"pilot project\" (3 months) to determine the shape and direction of the full project.  That combined with the intriguing ideas presented in the proposal, backed with reference document links, left me with a net positive impression of their skill levels.  Voters will have to make up their own minds up as to whether or not I made the right call in this particular assessment note.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Had this been a request for the full project I would have been deterred by the lack of calendar based user acquisition and client integration targets and milestones provided (\"client integration target\" = the number of businesses willing to use their tool on the Cardano blockchain).  But as I said, this is a request to fund a \"pilot project\" so these more concrete metrics are not applicable here.  They have given a few development targets that can be used to assess the progress of the project.  I would suggest in the future they provide a few more metrics for their proposal than they have, just to make it easier to assess their proposals auditability.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I view this project as follows.  Best case assuming the proposers succeed with their follow-up funding requests, it results in the open source SDK code and tools that can be used to make integrating real world business contracts with actionable Cardano smart contracts easier, and that would be a really important tool to assist the adoption of the Cardano ecosystem by the global business community.
