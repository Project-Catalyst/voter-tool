They do not otherwise appear to have any commercial experience, being a group of undergraduate students. Whilst they will probably be able to deliver the technical side, the commercial side is another thing. This only works if they can bring the universities online. This is definitely a network effects product, the more universities that come online, the more useful it is. They have reached out to some university incubation programs, which may give their product access to those universities. It would be good to see a plan for how they intend to market and get universities to join. Are they reaching out to employers/recruitment agencies to see what they need? UIF a large recruiter came on board, universities may be incentivised to join to increase the prospects for their graduates. It would be good to see a clear plan to develop a minimum Viable Product and then iterate with users on both sides. This would increase the likelihood of success. \r\nThe 6-12 month time frame mentions integrating smart contracts. Why are these required? Is this not just a metadata project?
