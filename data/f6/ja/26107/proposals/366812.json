I have a background in stochastic calculus and more is required than just storing the number immutably after they are generated. To create confidence that players are in a fair game, proof needs to be provided and written to the blockchain that the numbers are generated randomly and without reference to players bets or in this case their bingo card. Imutability is great, but proof of fairness of generation also need to be provided. Perhaps you could even use the nonce in the blockchain itself as the source of randomness? It would be good to see more information on how this would be provided. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A front end website has been provided, but there is no information on the team developing this.

The proposers should provide details on who they are and the skills they have and any relevant experience along with a more detailed plan on the steps they are gong to take. In addition to building the project, how are they going to market it and drive users to it? A successful project here requires more than just building it.
