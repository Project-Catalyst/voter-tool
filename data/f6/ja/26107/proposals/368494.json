It is just a broad, IOT devices produce data, and it would be good to store that on the block chain. \r\nThe proposers should provide a specific use case they are solving. Are they just registering the meta data of IOT devices onto the block chain. Ie this device is a thermometer at this location? Or are they planning on publishing all the data an IOT device produces to the block chain? This could be an enormous amount of data. What resolution is the data posted at? One single sensor posting 1 data point every seconds would quickly cost a lot in transaction fees. Many sensors create orders of magnitude more data. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The is no detailed plan on what is actually going to be produced which makes it hard to evaluate the likelihood of success.

Is it just developing a library which someone publish metadata from an Arduino sensor to the Cardano blockchain? What about reading the data? Number of users or sensors?
