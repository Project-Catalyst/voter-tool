Its not clear from the proposal, are you expecting transactions to happen on chain in ADA? It should be noted the proposers have submitted a basically the same idea into 5 other challenges, though it fits reasonably well here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have outlined a relatively simple plan to get a minimal viable product up and running and have both the technical and domain expertise to get this going. It would be nice to see a little more about their plans to scale the project past the initial trial phase. Are they always going to need initial high cost vetting of tutors, or is there a way to decentralise this? Do they have ideas on how to make the ratings system objective rather than subjective? Ie based on outcomes of students? If rolled out at scale how do you stop tutors cheating and self dealing with themselves in round trip transactions then reviewing themselves? As the same proposal has been submitted 6 times with different budgets, I am not sure what they actually need to finance this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is a relatively simple proposal to deveop an MVP and as such clear milestones for progress have been presented.

These services are costly and/or lack functionality. It uses a combination of tradiitional web and the blockchain. The blockchain is used for payments and authenticity (of reviewing). Both usages for the blockchain are the stronghand of the technology. It's sets a good example of how traditional development and blockchain can work together. As such it will promote the usage of blockchains. To that also contributes that the first target audience is academic stem scientist, who will appreciate the most peer reviewed blockchain cardano. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has already been worked on and has a clearl defined timeline with realistic goals. The budget and plan is sensible. The team consists of a developer and a scientist. A frontend developer will be added to the team once the stage for frontend development has arrived.

They have an extensive background of accomplished projects in the non-crypto area. The time schedule given seems like a tight schedule for the proposal but is surely doable. They state that they need extra team members for the job which is a good sign, but it would've been better if they said exact numbers on how many people would be needed. One thing that is missing in the proposal is a clear breakdown of what the budget is needed for.

Reading the proposal and the other proposals requested by the proposers gives a feeling that they clearly understand the challenge and problem they address. One element that is missing for me is risk management. Since the proposal stretches over different challenges, what happens if one proposal doesn't get funded?
