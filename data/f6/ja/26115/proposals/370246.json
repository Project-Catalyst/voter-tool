I'm not convinced that you will achieve the rates of adoption you have stated. Although I do believe that over time you can gain enough momentum to have the impact on the Cardano ecosystem we are hoping for. Your budget seems a little low, even though I see you are re-utilizing existing equipment, if I were a company I would want modern equipment and displays. After reviewing your  website I do like the participate of a lot of young minds that should bring energy and enthusiasm to this project.  You mention local Government Funding but did not describe what this funding would be or local Government regulations that may present a challenge to your project.  I expect you will need additional funding in future funds. However, even with my previous comments I do believe in your project.
