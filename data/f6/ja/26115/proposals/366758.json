I think the proposal is aligned well with the goals of the fund, however I had to guess a lot of what the proposal meant. The proposal contains lots of ideas that seem good, but are not fleshed out in details enough (Is this a business, and NGO or a project that's fully funded by this fund? How does terrain purchase correlate with carbon footprint reduction in details? 10% of what will be donated to africa? What is the point of the treasury? And so on...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the attachments are as confusing as the proposal, and the website provided doesn't provide any additional info about the project.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "In its current form, it is hard to say if the project could be implemented properly. There are no references, beyond what the proposer claims in the \"relevant experience\" section. The plan is not laid out clearly. The budget is high, however sweden is notoriously expensive, so this is understandable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal fails to provide milestones that are auditable. It fails to follow the SMART goals principle - specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. In addition, the proposal fails to address risks and challenges.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_318", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem statement is more advertising phrases that really a problem or a concrete and specific problem to be solved in a Catalyst funded project. It is not easy to understand specifically what is the problem and what is the solution presented in the proposal. Apparently, the proposal consists of transforming natural sources into NFTs in order to preserve the planet. However, there is no explanation or development on how this actually can protect the species and biome.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal has many disconnected catchphrases which make it difficult to understand the concrete plan, and the proposer has shown no experience in biodiversity protection or biome preservation. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There are metrics and milestones presented, but as there's no clear solution to the problem in the proposal, the requested budget and milestones refer only to the creation of a business, but not to the solution of a specific issue.

Let me paraphrase a summary as I think the core of it get's lost in your lengthy description:\r\n\r\n1) You buy physical land in Sweden that represents a diverse biome of various lifeforms.\r\n2) You create NFTs of each of those lifeforms and assign them rarity based on their real life endangerment status\r\n3) A user may purchase one with an initial price set by your team based on the rarity. This money will go towards to protection of that species.\r\n\r\nIn terms of addressing the problem I have the following unknowns:\r\n\r\n1) After initial purchase of the NFT, how is the continued welfare of the represented species sustained after the budget (i.e. initial payment of the NFT) has been used.\r\n\r\n2) How will the secondary market for the NFTs work in terms of supplying the budget for the continued welfare of the represented species? For example, lets say a species became more endangered and the secondary market value for the NFT doubled in price, it is the original owner who would net this profit, but there is no description of how the underlying species would benefit.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think that the idea shows a great deal of promise and original thought. With a plan of this scale, I think that it is necessary to provide the voters with a little more information on how the NFT market will benefit the underlying species. An example might be something as simple as 50% of the realised gains in the secondary market go towards benefiting the species.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the project seems to lose a little focus with the 10% donation to Africa, and VR. These are admirable additions but might serve the project better to be moved to a different proposal or a later stage.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the progress can be tracked based on the goals provided as long as transparency is provided on the end goal, i.e. on the budget provided to each species and what was achieved with that budget.
