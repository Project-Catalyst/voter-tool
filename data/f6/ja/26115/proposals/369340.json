Currently, there are numerous NFT markets but not many have been emphasizing use cases outside of the art aspect. Even fewer have decided to focus on the support and wellbeing of animals and environment, making (in my opinion) the direction of the proposal attractive and a unique contribution to the Cardano ecosystem.  From my understanding, the proposal has the potential and intention to work both on a local and global level, inviting both organizations, community members and retail investors for involvement in the project. The proposers does not exactly describe exactly how the creation of this NFT minting and market platform will counteract the initial problem, but the intention is described further down in the proposal. The scale of the proposal is massive, which may explain the substantial amount of funding. \r\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

Both from the perspective of being active members and contributors to the Cardano ecosystem, and having decades of experience with working in the field of environmental development and animal rights. Sufficient information on each team member is provided through their respective LinkedIn profiles. Having already gone through the process of creating a functioning platform (DignifID) is increasing the trustworthiness and credibility of the team. \r\nAs stated before, the budget is rather substantial being 44% of the total budget for the challenge, but it makes sense considering that the proposer wants to launch an NFT minting tool AND market exchange portals within the time frame of 3 months (More on that later). The allocations of the budget is presented in a clear way, and the fact that their previously created platform (DignifID) is helping to cover the costs of the launch leads me to believe that the team has planned for sudden changes in the budget allocation. \r\n\r\nThe 1 year-project plan is laid out in a clear and structured way, but I would have liked to see more detailed information about the different stages in the plan. The proposal does not say if the minting tool and market exchange has been developed already, or will be created from scratch from the time of potential budget allocation. This makes a huge difference in my opinion, since creating functioning tools and a working platform in 90 days is a very short time frame depending on where you start from. Adding information about where the process of creating the platform and tool currently is would make it easier to assess the feasibility of the proposal. \r\nAnother aspect that would have been beneficial for the proposal is an example of who the 'credible auditors that provide trusted and reliable financial support' is, are they organizations or private actors? How does the outreach look like? The proposal does give a hint of ongoing contracts with associated actors through their previous platform (DignifID), but it is unclear if they aim to use their connections from before or are in need of a completely new base of connections. \r\n\r\nDepending on how far they have come in the development of their platform and minting tool, I agree that this proposal will be implanted successfully.

In order to increase the audibility, the proposer could have added some KPIs and metrics that would help people outside of the organization to better understand if the milestones are achieved or not. For example, how many users does the project expect to host after 6 months? How much of the NFT revenue is allocated into the protection of animals and the environment, and what is the expected traffic after 3, 6 and 12 months of uptime? Is it concentrated on global spread right away or is there a plan for extending or developing from a few local areas/organizations?  I believe that answering these questions would invite the community to audit the growth process more clearly. \r\nIn order to further increase the trustworthiness and credibility of the team and proposal, I would have liked to see a list of potential risks and challenges. From my understanding of the NFT-space, it is full of organizations and artists minting animal-themed NFTs. How do the proposer plan to emphasize their underlying USP (environment and animal wellbeing) as much as possible, in order to separate themselves from 'Bored apes' or 'Stoner animals'? There is a whole lot of potential in the idea and values behind this project, and I would've liked to see examples of how this project would emphasize the strong mission behind the product.

The team further sets out a detailed roadmap with check points at month three, six and twelve which maps out an operational project after 3 months which in turn develops and expands from there.

This proposal aims to create NFTs for the animal and environmental well being space. I think this high level idea of this proposal fits in nicely with the challenge.\r\n\r\nI think the problem statement is poorly constructed. The problem statement is phrased a there being a \"huge opportunity\" in building some new tech but it's not clear who/what suffers from the lack of infrastructure in this space. To give an example, compare the following problem statements \"millions of dollars worth of ADA are lost from giveaway scams\" vs \"antiscam infrastructure is underdeveloped and there's a huge opportunity in that space\". Notice that the first framing is observes the problem more directly.\r\n\r\nI think the solution statement is well crafted and gives readers a great sense of what this proposal aims to create if funded. \r\n\r\nI'm of the opinion that this project will have significant impact on the Cardano ecosystem because it is innovating that NFT tech in other ecosystems isn't. \r\n\r\nI believe that this solution will be scalable because it's very software oriented. The web app for minting NFTs I guess won't be particularly difficult to build since there's lots of prior work to be inspired by (I have a background as en engineer myself) and the decentralized exchange will be able to run even in times of high load because of it's decentralized nature.\r\n\r\nThe metrics and goals of the proposal align well with the requirements of the challenge. The proposal aims to increase NFT usage on the Cardano blockchain by enabling institutions to issue NFTs in support of animal and environmental well being. The proposal also aims to build this software in a multilingual way which will increase global adoption.\r\n\r\nOverall I give this proposal a score of 5 for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have a background in software myself and I think the plan, as it's currently laid out, is quite ambitious and unlikely to succeed on the proposed timeline. Now, it's very possible that I'm underestimating the speed the engineering team can build but I've worked on fairly talented teams (like distributed database teams at Facebook) and I think for even talented teams this is a lot of work to get done in a short amount of time.\r\n\r\nOne very positive signal is the professional experience of the team. They cumulatively have decades of experience and they have successfully provided links to their LinkedIn profiles. I would like to see links to Github profiles of the software-oriented team members to further validate the technical abilities of the team. \r\n\r\nWithin 3 months the team wants to design and build an NFT minting platform with some social capabilities (like following providers) adn multi-lingual (internationlization) features. They also want to design and build a smart-contract supporting DEX for NFT exchange that's also internationalized on a completely new smart contract system (eUTxO). On top of both of these, they need to build a provider verification system which is no easy feat. In my professional opinion, these products will take 6-12 months to design and build with the desired feature set.\r\n\r\nOne of the 6 month milestones is \"cashflow positive\" but it's not clear how this product will generate cash. I have an intuition for how it will work but they haven't defined a business plan (will the NFT minting platform take a cut of all transactions? if so, how much?).\r\n\r\nOverall I think the feasibility of this proposal executing as laid out is quite low and I disagree that it's highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal has done a good job of laying out milestones and deliverables at the 3, 6 and 12 month mark. \r\n\r\nMany of the 3 month milestones are easy to audit. The community can easily determine whether the NFT minting website and decentralized exchange are up and running.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's very hard to audit the 6 month milestones. What does \"stable and growing user base mean\"? How is \"stable\" measured? What rate of growth is acceptable? How many \"Specialized regional and topic pages\" will there be? For which regions? For which topics? In my opinion, the milestones for the 6 month mark need to be more numeric, eg: \"user base growing at 6% MoM\". \r\n\r\nInterestingly, I don't see numeric metrics on how many NFTs are minted and (re)sold on the platform. Will just 1 sale count as a success? 100? 1000? \r\n\r\nOverall, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals because a few of the goals/milestones are verifiable while many are unclear and unverifiable.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_531", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "WILD NFT\u306f\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u74b0\u5883\u3084\u52d5\u7269\u305f\u3061\u306b\u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u3068\u30b5\u30b9\u30c6\u30ca\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306eNFT\u92f3\u9020\u30fb\u5e02\u5834\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002", "experience": "\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306f\u3001\u52d5\u7269\u3068\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30ebID\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u975e\u55b6\u5229\u56e3\u4f53\u3001dignifid.org\u3092\u8a2d\u7acb\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002NFT Maker Pro\u306f\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306e\u6280\u8853\u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002"}
