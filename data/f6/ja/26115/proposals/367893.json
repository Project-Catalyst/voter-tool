Yes this is a new use case and one that can drive wider interest in and use of Cardano. We have approached Niantic and await a response. Half of the budget is for development of the AR MVP. The remainder is to attract and engage blockchain programmers to begin work on the \u201cliving NFT\u201d component of the game. Given the shortage of Haskel and blockchain programmers, we thought it prudent to have a solid budget in hand first. Note: the AR team is already in place (see https://rewildgame.toonstech.com).

Until that event, we were unaware he owned bison."}, {"q0": "Creating an NFT game addresses the challenge brief of creating business models with NFT's at the core.
