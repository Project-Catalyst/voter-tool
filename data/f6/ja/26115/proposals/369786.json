So proposing a video game to utilize NFTs does effectively address the challenge. I only gave 3 starts though, because this proposal does not contain many details other than the fact that want to have a game that uses NFTs. It is extremely vague and lacking in details, and something like this is should have a lot of details to describe exactly what they plan to do. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is practically zero details about what the actual plan is or how they expect to implement it. Because of this, it would be impossible to assess the likeliness of success. They literally just say they will \"deliver a videogame\" and that is it. They also just state to be a member Tokhun and deploy utility to Cardano. Creating a video game is a lot of work and providing additional details about their team and why they believe they can bring this to market would go a long way in creating faith in their ability to actually do it.  Lastly, they have only requested 15K in funding, which seems extremely small for what they are trying to accomplish.

This team has not provided any details on thier goals or timelines that can be audited against to assess them. They have kept it extremely vague, with the only real goal of creating a video game. If they included a timeline with milestones such as 3 months - have first beta version running, 6 months release to general public, - 12 months, 200 daily active users, etc, then this would be much easier to track and audit. They also have not really defined what success will look like for them. In the absence of clearly defined metrics to measure their success, we cannot really audit against that.

I would like the team to expand on the responsibilities and deliverables of each member, this allows the team to judge whether there is a work overload in one area. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the labor must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.
