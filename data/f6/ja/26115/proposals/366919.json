The authors of the proposal promise to deliver a platform in which there would be commodity trading made through smart contracts, generating NFT. In this way, there would be more transparency between the purchase and sale of these instances and the final consumption would benefit from a more accessible price, in addition to being a giant market for the Cardano ecosystem, since the commodity trade in Africa represents a large portion of the entire economy. The idea is also related to two other challenges of the fund, which would be DApps & Integratins and Grow Africa, Grow Cardano. In other words, in theory, everything is perfect, but what really worries me is what it would be like in reality, because I believe that most producers and consumers (especially consumers) have no contact with the universe of smart contracts or know how to do it. them. So, in a more pragmatic way, I believe that I wanted to include in this proposal some kind of instruction manual on how to use the platform. I went to the site that was attached, put in the test username and password, and got a little lost, to be honest. I believe that like me, people who are not used to making smart contracts or handling NFT may find this platform more of a barrier than an ease when it comes to commercializing the commodities, you know? It would be beneficial for this issue to be explored.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the team, we don't have any kind of details, we know that it is a team that has experience in handling cryptocurrencies (on an industrial level) and NFT. But it would be important to know their names, their professional trajectories up to the present moment, some examples of previous work and so on. Certain security is given by the fact that the explanation of the proposal is very technical, which shows that they dominate the technologies of the cardano universe, and also by the fact that there is already a website created for the purposes of the project. However, it would be more beneficial if there were in-depth details about who they are. As to what is to come, we have some established notions, but nothing that we can consider truly detailed, in order to justify the large amount of funding requested.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It would be important for the proposal authors to justify why 1 year of funding would be required. We can understand that after 6 months, the project will already be completed, things are working (smart contracts and NFT), and in the interval from 6 to 12 months it would just be a swelling in the tool, that is, new users joining, generation of more and more smart contracts and NFT. In a way, I think it got a little greedy for the authors to ask for USD 200,000 in funding. We are given a superficial notion of how this money would be used, it was better to be detailed what this office setup would be like, and also what other tools would be needed for the development of the project. Another piece of information that was important for us to know is exactly how many professionals would be working during the construction and popularization of the platform, and also what the marketing plan would be, specifically. We have a time frame and some success metrics to analyze how things are going, but I thought there was a lack of detail about how the funding money would be used.
