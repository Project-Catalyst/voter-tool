NFTs are booming on all major ecosystems, as well as on Cardano.

The solution and USP according to the proposer is a super simple mobile wallet app for newcomers (Wallet for dummies), but there is vague information in the solution statement on what aspects are important for the application. It does adress a problem with a high learning curve when entering the world of cryptocurrencies, along with a popular trend (NFTs).
