The problem statement suggests that the use of NFTs will increase revenue for musicians themselves but does not offer up any rationale for the initial low income base. Where the low base is a result of poor marketing, distribution or a substandard music (given the low barriers to entry as opposed to signing with a label) a website providing music NFTs may not be a solution to increasing revenue for artists. That being said, a quick internet search shows Indie music comprising c.30% of the music industry and capturing this market on a Cardano NFT website certainly scales with a positive impact on the Cardano Ecosystem (even if it doesn't mean an increase in revenue for the artists). Setting aside the assertion of possible increase in revenue for musicians specifically and rather focusing on what I believe the team is trying to communicate being the sheer scalability of reducing music to NFTs,  I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

As positive feedback, the team may wish to consider the use of a marketing professional with some inroads to the music scene to introduce the musicians to the project. At this stage it is unclear how musicians and the technical team will converge. The team provide a 12-month road map which states that an increasing number of musicians will be on-boarded monthly. Given that these are independent musicians to be sourced as opposed to a collective onboarding, and that they will likely require some form of a knowledge bridge to understand the NFT utility case, it remains unclear how these onboarding numbers will be achieved. Team have provided us with a breakdown of the $50k requested which speaks to the technical set up and does include a $7k marketing spend. The team have not set out any key challenges or risks and how they would mitigate these. Given the specific bespoke target market (independent musicians) and with seemingly no connection to the industry by the technical team, I can unfortunately neither agree or respectfully disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has laid out very clear and tangible deliverables by specifying the number of musicians and NFTs to be available at months 1; 2; 3; 6 and 12 which will be evidenced through the website to be developed for this initiative.

This would also need to be broken down so that the community might know what the marketing budget would be spent on.\r\n\r\nYou would also likely need a full time operations manager given the pace of growth that you have stated.
