Using NFTs as a proof of donation made, adresses the challenge brief of creating business models with NFT's at the core. Minting NFTs as donations on the platform will increase the use and number of NFTs on Cardano, thus increasing utility and providing value to the ecosystem. I would like the team to simplify the problem statement and solution, at the moment the problem statement is very broad (Maybe something like: Problem: The \"donation\" supply chain lacks transparency, turning away potential donors. Solution: NFTs as PoD. providing all the information such as who donated, how much, when, to whom and for what, getting the full cycle of the donation on the blockchain.)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "NFTs for use as Proof-of-Donation is a great idea and the team has already done an MVP with the Red Cross. Although links to videos from the MVP campaign for the team was provided, I feel the proposal requires further development to ensure successful implementation.

I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences.\r\nI advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\". \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a minimal roadmap and single line budget.

I would like to see the team create a thorough roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the developers must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.
