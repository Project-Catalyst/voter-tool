There will be huge opportunity in the agriculture sector for this system to be used therefore adding a great value for Cardano. Traceability system for farm produce will greatly increase the quality of the product and make the supply chain information more transparent.  However there is more clarification required for the solution. How much will it cost the farmers to mint the entire farm produce given that they have to pay when everytime they mint the tokens. If they use the system, will they have to raise their produce prices which in turn gives a negative impact to the consumers?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer fails to provide details on budget. Provide a budget breakdown that are clear and simple to understand. Besides that, the proposer did not provide information on the required manpower and resources to successfully implement the project. Also, the proposer did not explain in detail how will the farmers input their produce data to the system. Will the farmers have to hire a clerk just for data entry? Or is there a system already been made for the data input to be less painful. Will the farmers have to pay for the hardware and also software? Provide us with the information on that system. Additionally another question regarding cost, how much will the farmer has to pay in order to use the system? How to make it sustainable for the farmers to use the system again without giving them the burden of costs", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer provided the website of the nft maker.

The research is supported by a series of data, which are presented at the end of the proposal. And in fact, blockchain solutions involving the food industry will only increase the inequality between large and small producers, because certainly small farmers, whether family farming or even more, have never even heard of a blockchain. Therefore, it is very important that there is some initiative to reduce this gap, and we can find an example here, through the Digital Twin (DT) project, which will teach farmers to produce NFT patterns for their products. This is extremely positive for them but also for the Cardano ecosystem, as it will attract a new type of audience that is not tech-driven like most of our community members. I thought it was very important that the author explained exactly what kind of content can be found in Digital Twin (DT), thus generating a more solid understanding of what is intended with this, in addition, it is explained how the contact between the farmer and the NFT (very clearly). Furthermore, the author further describes the advantages of his tool, the impact being indisputable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, we don't have any detailed information about the author, all we know is that he is an engineer (I didn't understand why, it would be positive to clarify this), he studies about blockchain and has a startup that dialogues with his proposal, as is attached in the description. However, it would be important to know more about him, such as his name, where he studied, examples of previous work, maybe a linkedin profile... In addition, he claims that, in order to carry out the project, it would be necessary to hire a Cardano developer and an agro-industrial researcher. Okay, but in this way, how does he intend to hire these professionals? And it was also not very clear if he would work directly on this project, besides being the creator of the idea, and from what I understand he would not receive any payment for his creation, which I consider unfair. Regarding the roadmap and financing division, we have few details, especially in terms of finance, it would be important for these aspects to be further explored here.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "What happens in this proposal is not uncommon, the author uses practically all the space to explain his product, from its characteristics to its utilities and benefits. However, little is said about the step by step, what would be done; we know what happens in 3, 6 and 9 months, however, he spoke in detail. For example, where would the research that would be provided from 6 months onwards be published? And would it be in a more technical or more accessible language, and what would its content be, exactly? Regarding the financial division, all the money asked would go to the hired professionals, I believe that it would be necessary to include a part for hosting in some virtual asset, in addition to which it would be necessary to think of a UI/UX design well-oriented to the public that does not is so used to dealing with these things, that is, very intuitive. Maybe it would be interesting to attach short videos with instructions... but it's just an idea. Finally, it would be necessary to trace success metrics, so that the community could follow the progress of things, and also a good marketing plan, after all, how would workers in a branch so far from the blockchain know about this project? Therefore, I believe that auditability needs to be revised.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The farmer access problem for the supply chain is nested in a transparency/verification problem that blockchain based supply chains attempt to address. Naturally, there is a tradeoff in this space between ease of access and identity verification. Thus, I think there is a reason why other supply chain solutions tend toward a permissioned system. If you enable anyone to mint an NFT, how would you verify that the original NFT was from the original farmer and not someone who had purchased from a variety of sources. If it is the latter, any sort of transparency or food risk traceability is lost. Thus, I think you need some link between the blockchain and the real world. Either decentralized identities linked to accounts, or some authoritative machines that links RFIDs or QR codes to NFTs.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I definitely think this proposal could fulfill its stated goals. Farmers would be able to provide NFTs for their food. They should be able to pass those through the food processor companies. However, it is not clear how processors would add the required metadata to the NFTs or combine NFTs into a new NFT with its own unique metadata. Finally, there are issues of scale. The TPS for supply chain applications, would likely require a layer 2 as well. For the scope of this proposal, they would probably be able to work with the layer 1. It is just unclear, how this proposal will scale up to a real-world use case.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is not mentioned how the NFTs will link to the real world. Will the NFT issuance, be tied to a bar code reader, QR code or a RFID chip so to more easily integrate with existing supply chain infrastructure. Otherwise, the \"first functionality of the NFT maker\" is a fuzzy deliverable. Batch NFT minters already exist, but creating an NFT minter for supply chain would need to be specially tuned for connecting to the real world. For a digital twin you need the digital part as well as the connection to the real world equivalent. It is not specified how that is intended to be achieved. Also, the research paper does not present the hypothesis it intends to test or questions it intends to investigate.
