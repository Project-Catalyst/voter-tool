The proposer problem statement was NFT business model has a user experience problem, and the solution statement was to create an educational token? And on the plan you were talking about creating a wallet? Please identify your problems and solutions and present it in a simple to understand sentence. The goals of this proposal is confusing therefore it does not address the challenge. Creating a wallet with the features mentioned in the proposal is good. It does add utility however it doesn't bring much impact in terms of the challenge hence I have to disagree with this proposal.

The proposer also fails to present in details about the plan breakdown such as what is the required manpower or resources to successfully implement the project. There is no detail explanation on how and what is being done on the project. Moreover, there is no detail budget breakdown on how the money will be used. In addition, this proposal fails to identify the potential risks and challenges that the team members might face when developing the project.

I would like to see the team develop and define Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for the project \u2013 what does success look like in 12 months, how many wallet users do you want on the platform by month 6 \u2013 set a goal and use it as a KPI.  Furthermore, I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, for example set milestones for creating the wallet (technical development milestones). Lastly, the budget needs to be developed beyond a single line entry, the team must create a detailed breakdown. As the project stands at the moment, I feel the project will be difficult to audit.
