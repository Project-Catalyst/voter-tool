The proposal aims to add NFT functionality to an existing application, indirectly through this application value can be delivered to the ecosystem through increased NFT minting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provided links to LinkedIn, the current website and to two additional Fund 6 proposal entered by the team.
