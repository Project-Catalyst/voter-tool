An excellent response to the challenge to provide a massive onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. Starting with the specific use case of athletes via university and beyond increases its chance of success and reduces unknown obstacles. This narrow focus also meets the challenge criteria of framing towards specific use-cases. That the smart contracts used for all the magic making will be open sourced will further enable more more niche implementations by toolmakers in the community to solve a wide range of problems. Falls short of a five start because it's not clear whether the proposal is trying to build a smart contract template (a developer tool) or implement or validate a particular business model. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Creating multi-owner NFT smart contracts that allow for long term royalties to original creators is very achievable and something the ecosystem needs. \r\n\r\nAn important questions that should have been answered: Will the users own the NFT directly or will their ownership be document or proxied by the smart contract? \r\n\r\nSince the proposal is title \"Multi Owner NFT\" and much of the spirit of crypto is self custody, I'm interpreting the intention to mean users will own their NFT directly in their wallets.  Under this assumption, the proposal fails to demonstrate a clear plan for adoption that include wallet vendors neither does it propose to build its own wallet. \r\n\r\nDaedalus, Yoroi, and AdaLite (the lion share of how self-custodying ada holders transact) do not support multi-sig transactions or smart contract interactions. Perhaps they might in the near future and the team behind proposal might have privilege information, but it's not clear how exactly user will interface, own, and transact.The proposal fails to provide onboarding details for users. Perhaps the intention is hidden with the \"Stakeholder behavior research?\" It's not clear.\r\n\r\nIf we take the face value of the proposal's point that \"The focus for this funding is to create Smart Contract Templates for other developers who want to create multi-owner NFT's\" then it should have been in the Developer tools challenge. This focus is not a business model with NFT usage as a core component that can act as an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "\r\nThe proposal provides a solid timeline. Actual KPIs or measurable outputs that can be audited however is a bit lacking. \"Onboarding 2-3 more Plutus Pioneer Devs from the community\" does not speak towards any measurable output.\r\nstakeholder behavior templates, git repos, town hall updates  however all lends themselves well to audits. 2 stars because these KPIs do not support the challenge goal of proposing business models that drive business use cases on Cardano that have NFT usage as a core component that can act as an onramp to the Cardano ecosystem. The KPI defined in the proposal move away from validating a business model and more toward validating a developer tool. A good business model KPI perhaps would be if www.quicc.io can get some its current athletes sign to some Multi Owner NFT's.
