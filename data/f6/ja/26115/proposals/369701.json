As more and more digital art is produced, \"showing\" digital art will quickly become an important part of any gallery's exhibition plan. In terms of addressing the campaign brief, there are no hard numbers in the proposal, however form some quick googling \"In 2017, 24% of the U.S. adult population had visited a museum or art gallery in the previous year\", indicating a sizable potential audience that could be onboarded to Cardano", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The technical aspect of this is highly likely to be successful, given the experience of the proposer. The challenge will come from finding a venue, gathering a suitably diverse and famous array of digital art and then marketing it well. 3 months to do the three key non-technical aspects of this project is aggressive and suggest pushing this out to at least 6 months. A second key would be to find someone experience in the art world to assist with the 3 non-technical tasks above.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are some high level goals that can be audited however more specifics around number of galleries, desired number of pieces of digital art would be helpful to audit progress against.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_275", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal lives up to the NFT challenge and it is an interesting idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the development point of view there is a sufficient experience shown in the proposal.

That the project goes alive, probably some more detailed project plan would be necessary.

Therefore I believe it will attract a lot of new users thus adding great value to Cardano.

You say you successfully launched an NFT-project but give no reference to this. You state that you need a team to be recruited which is a good sign seeing that you know you can't do this alone and lack relevant skills to fully complete the project, but I can't find how many members you wish to attract and with what relevant skills. The budget plan is asking for relatively large funds but they are not explained in detail. It would've been better if you had given an hourly rate on the development cost or the number of developers you wish to recruit.
