The idea has morphed into something else and it might continue morphing after implementation. That is not necessarily a bad thing; pivoting is more important than sticking to ideas that don't work. Having said that, the proposer's biggest strength seems to be listening and incorporating feedback. That gives me confidence that something might come out of this. \r\n\r\nAdditional team members could help provide another angle and make the wheelzup \"the first killer app\" for socialgiving (referring to the conversation in the comment section).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Considering the expected impact and scope of the project, the budget is clearly only for the proof of concept phase. I just don't understand why you don't ask the entire sum? Why only $10,000 USD? No need to be humble here. Ask what is needed to pull this through.\r\n\r\nShould you feel the need to take a step back and reflect the applicability of the approach once more, I could give one advice: make it bloody simple! :)\r\n\r\nCheck the movie \"Pay It Forward\" if you need inspiration for a simple idea. There the boy does something nice to three people and doesn't expect anything from them. He only asks them to do something nice for three others. You could actually take that approach also. Make three tribes and choose three people to get get the ball rolling. Create the original NFTs for them and code it so that it's only possible to make three copies of that NFT. Then the \"next level\" needs to scan a QR code or something and get the next three each. And so it goes. You had mentioned in your PDF that there are 13 different traits of the NFT. This way you could make them all a bit unique. You could make it a competition between the three tribes: who reaches the level 100 first, for instance. This would also help you validate that something nice was done to another person.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Addressing the impact of using a service or product clearly seen and understood.
