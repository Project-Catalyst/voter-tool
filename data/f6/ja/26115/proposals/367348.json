The proposed project does propose a new renewable energy engagement NFT, which might pull in certain players, but the use case is very niche.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the proposer make it clear that they are not knowledgeable in NFTs. This might mean they do not have the intention of growing the NFT further and add new functionalities, once the initial goals are reached. It also could mean limited support in case of issues ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team references on the solar power side are impeccable, but they are transparent about the fact that they are not knowledgeable about the NFT side of things, which makes me worried for the cost and time estimate of developing the NFTs. The budget is very low compared to what I would expect on all fronts, but the proposers mentions they are already invested in the project so I assume part of the costs would be covered out of pocket. There is a business plan, but there is not NFT development plan.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The only metric for success proposed is the amount of NFT sold, but it doesn't say if this is a dollar/ADA value or a number of NFT sold. This is crucial, as I would imagine funding the development of a solar power plan requires tremendous amount of money. Hence, is the goal to get lots of people interested and buying lower priced NFTs or a few individuals to buy very expensive ones. How much does the business success depend on these NFT to pay for the funds?  If we are talking about a significant percentage, what magnitude of $ do you need to raise in order for the project to stay viable?\r\n\r\nThe milestones are auditable, however, and it would easily be possible to identify activity within the NFTs sold by the team.

It proposes the use of NFTs on the Cardano blockchain as a vehicle to raise funds for businesses and entrepreneurs in the solar power industry that need capital to assist in power grid upgrades for those regions/areas that need them.  NOTE: I believe the proposers included a fair amount of dialogue regarding how renewable energy could help with the power consumption that comes from maintaining the blockchain.  Given that Cardano is Proof-Of-Stake and not Proof Of Work, and therefore has a much smaller energy consumption footprint, they might want to revamp those parts of the proposal in future fund raising rounds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The entire blockchain space has had historically an abundance of speculative activity and passion mostly in the financial space, and limited hard-core domain specific knowledge, leading to a dearth of the solid, world-changing dApps that all of us who are hard core blockchain enthusiasts have been waiting for.  This is a rare case of a proposal whose primary team members are members of a domain related business, Southern Current, a company that has years of experience in the solar power industry.  The proposal obviously shows that they know all the key problems of the solar power landscape from politics, to energy credits, and more.   Some light web research led me to web sites like SolarReviews, and I was pleased to see mostly positive ratings with few or any negative ones.  Normally I would take stars off for the lack of references that would allow me to vet the programming experience the team has, but I feel the deep industry specific knowledge of the proposers supersedes that.  I would definitely want to see that information in future funding requests.  Voters will need to decide for themselves.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has given several concrete targets with time windows for acquiring corporate and individual users.  Also their timeline does provide guidance as to what we can expect to see and in what general time frame.  NOTE: In the comments section Rishiraj asked a good question about potential benefits to NFT owners.  One of the proposers gave a detailed answer that indicates that for now, the benefits are to the environment, to the consumers of the electrical power, and proof of sponsorship elements like badges, etc.  This is in alignment with Cardano's larger goals of making a better world.  Having said that, I think it would be a boon to the project and future funding requests, if incentives were in place to reward token holders with direct monetary rewards.  The proposer did not indicate that there were inherent market dynamics in their proposed dApp that would make NFTs appreciate in price, or would pay out any \"royalties\" for successfully implemented solar upgrades.  If there are, and it is not my fault for missing that information in the proposal text or attachments, then a future proposal should explain how it works.  If not, then as I said, I believe direct monetary incentives to token holders would increase the popularity of the system and therefore the amount of money raised for the solar power entrepreneurs the proposal intends to serve.  This statement should not be taken as a negative against the proposal.  Instead, it is a message to the proposers to consider adding this to their proposed solution in future funding requests.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_551", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal addresses a specific use-case to offset high solar infrastructure repair costs.
