As a member of\r\n   the 3D printing community I am personally excited for a dApp which allows creators to monetize and\r\n   distribute 3D models. The proposal offers a unique approach to hosting 3D model repositories and a\r\n   mechanism for creators to easily craft and monetize their work. This proposal builds off the current NFT craze to access a,\r\n   relatively, untapped market for the 3D printing community. The proposed dApp shows promise to attract\r\n   people with 3D printers to the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is very repetitive, it continuously makes claims about what the dApp will be capable of but doesn't offer insights to how the team will achieve them.\r\n - How will the 3D model data be stored? on-chain or Off-chain? Many detailed 3D models are gigabytes in  size and require multiple parts. The proposal does not offer an answer to how or where the data will be stored? centralized or decentralized storage? \r\n- What off-chain or on-chain mechanism will be utilized to prevent multiple NFTs from representing the same 3D model\r\n     - A block explorer can verify that a smart contract \r\n       only minted a single instance of an NFT, but \r\n       doesn't prevent other smart contracts from minting \r\n       a different NFT to represent the same\r\n       metadata (i.e. 3D model).\r\n     - Is there a plan to prevent other NFTs from \r\n        representing the same model? Such as an off chain \r\n        algorithm that combs through the off-chain \r\n        database to identify NFTs that represent the \r\n        same/similar models or only listing NFTs that were \r\n        minted with the project's NFT minting solution. So \r\n       that it the dApp can verify that each listed NFT \r\n        represents a unique 3D model.\r\n- Much of the data that specifies how to print the model (i.e. nozzle temperature and size, print bed temperature and size, different materials, SLA vs FMD printer etc.) differs for each 3D printer. How will the dApp handle print details which differs for different 3D printers?\r\n   - Once a \"user\" of the dApp gets the 3D models from \r\n      the off-chain database, (I am assuming that the \r\n      cad/slicer models will not be stored on-chain -> too \r\n      expensive) what is preventing the \"user\" from\r\n      sending multiple copies of the model to their 3D \r\n      printer. How will the dApps enforce the \"pay-per- \r\n      print\" mechanism. \r\n- How would the dApps limit the quantity of 3D prints of a specific model, without relinquishing control of the 3D model data? Once the user is given the data necessary to 3D print the model, how can the user be prevented from printing unlimited copies?\r\n\r\nBecause the proposal does not seems to acknowledge many of these concerns it is not clear how or if the team has the capability to complete the dApp. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Much of the milestones offered by the proposal are definitive and can be used to measure the progress of the team.

This CA obviously has extensive knowledge of crypto and 3d printing tech... This is probabily one of the best reviews we have recieved. That being said I don't think its entirely fair to expect a full breakdown of feasability when our proposal was already one of the longest in its category. In a situation where the average person voting on these proposals may not have technical knowledge you are forced to make choices on how to paint the picture so people can understand quickly. I apologize if this proposal fell short in the keen eyes of an experienced developer. Just because we did not include everything does not mean we aren't spending long hours thinking about how to solve these problems.
