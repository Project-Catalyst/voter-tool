However, this proposal fails to provide information on how this project is able to scale to address future challenges.

However the proposer did not provide any future risks or challenges that they may face during the development and how will they navigate through the problems. What is your plan when facing an issue that requires additional funding? Also, can you explain how do you implement the 'pay-per-own' or 'pay-per-view' model when the data is easily viewed by the public in the blockchain. Explain in details what sort of mechanism used to implement the privacy mode for NFT. Another question on the 'pay-to-own' or 'pay-to-view' model, if the buyer buys the token of the of a academic or scientific paperwork and produce something out of it, will there any more charges or royalties that should be paid or does the smart contract is customizable for each of the token?
