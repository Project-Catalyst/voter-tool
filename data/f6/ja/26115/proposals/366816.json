As the proposers point out however, there are significant hurdles to cross before we even get to the blockchain side of things. Unlike something created digitally and then stored on the block chain. the proposers wish to use the blockchain to store ownership of thing that may have already been around for centuries. The hard part there is ascertaining this ownership in the first place. This proposal acknowledges this fact, and intends to conduct research and consultation to try and figure it out. As such the majority of this project is not really NFT related but focused at a level prior to that. Hence the 3 star rating.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is hard to state it is highly likely this project will be successfully implemented due to the fact as mentioned above that it is reliant on a prior of actually establishing ownership of the IP, which they intend to use this funding to research. Successfully implementation would thus require \r\nthat research to be successful. The proposers, WADA, have great experience with Catalyst in the Africa space and thus they may be able to solve the problem. It would also be good to see a road map going forward of what happens next if this step is successful. Will all future steps require more funding, or is there a business plan to become self sufficient?", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The key metrics reported focus on the number of people engaged with. This seems like a necessary but not sufficient condition for success. The proposers should be focusing on what appears to be the key impediment for this proposal succeeding, which is, can they reliably (and perhaps legally) ascertain ownership of IP for which they then store immutably on the blockchain? Without this there is nothing to store and there is not project. Further metrics would then be the number of items/patterns etc stored, number of people/groups/regions using it, and then onto number of countries etc. ", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 23, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 10, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Contradictory and Unfair Impact/Alignment Note: Assessor gives contradictory reason for low score that this proposal does not belong to this category contrary to his/her own prior statement.

WADA is already known to me, I've analyzed several of their proposals, and I know they are a serious and qualified group that promotes projects in the Cardano ecosystem that relate to the problems of their continent.

On the roadmap and currency division, we have a lot of detailed information about what needs to be done, how and in what order. They are very detailed indeed, for example, they mention that the first place they will implement the proposal is Ghana and they justify this, because they already have a strong presence there and prefer to start small to reduce risks (which in my view is always the ideal posture).
