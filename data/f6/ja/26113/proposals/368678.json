This puts them at a disadvantage as they are not able to reap the benefits using Github. This proposal suggests a three pronged approach to helping people understand Github and allow them to use it to the fullest. The recording of workshops, published to be viewed in perpetuity is especially important as it allows the knowledge shared in the workshops to be accessed not just by those who are available at the time and also allows people to go back later and rewatch if they require a refresher. This strongly relies on marketing properly and getting the word out; although mentioned there is no indication on how this will be marketed to the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is shown that the experience as an educator is vast, this assures that the teaching component of this proposal will be executed properly.

However in my opinion these criteria assess the ability for people to access these resources and not the effectiveness of the resources produced.

It would be good to know if the project proposer also has these skills or if he will be outsourcing this part of the project. \r\nSecondly, it would be good to understand the value split of the workshops vs the on-demand videos. The workshops seem like a great idea with good value-add. Will the scalability of this project be diminished if the workshops are a big part of the value proposition? \r\nFinally, it's great that there is a plan for where these resources will be stored and that there is a budget for marketing efforts, but it would be good to see some detail around outreach methods and means.
