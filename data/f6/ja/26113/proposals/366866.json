As someone with considerable experience of developing successful training,  I know there are issues that an impactful training plan needs to address, which this proposal is missing (for instance, awareness of the barriers that learners might face; managing inclusiveness to different learning styles, literacy levels, and first languages; etc) Cultural norms of how to write and persuade vary from one culture to another; but as the proposal does not address this at all, it's in danger of not being very adaptable to the different cultures within Catalyst, and of not having a positive impact on the challenge's aim around supporting increased diversity. And the idea of a forum could work, but only if the participants know how to critique each other effectively and are confident to do so  \u2013 as the proposal doesn't plan to support them in developing those skills, the forum could actually have more of a negative impact than a positive one.
