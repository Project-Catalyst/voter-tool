Included lots of resources to familiarize anyone with the project's ins and outs. The budget allocation and plan is also sensible and straight to the point.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has a clear roadmap with  key performance indicators. A clear and effective solution is proposed to a long overdue problem. This proposal focuses on a solution and provides integrations like APIs, smart contracts etc. to extend its use cases to other projects.

Making sure a proposer has all the necessary tools accessible to kick off a proposal without wondering if he forgot something or not will considerably enhance the quality of proposals. However, I do have some doubts about the creation of routines, how will you be able to get this going and make sure that quality prevails quantity in the early stages?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Looking at your GitHub and how active you are on it gives confidence in your expertise to do this. You clearly understand the objective of the challenge and your solution is simple yet effective. Another great indicator is that you were a participant in the Plutus pioneer program. The timeline on the proposal and GitHub match each other. The timeline is not farfetched and certainly doable from my experience. You're the first proposal I've come across with a reasonable hourly rate. The medium article is well written and explains everything in detail on what you plan to do with the website. Seeing that you already put this much work into it and how it's all well based I have confidence that this proposal is highly likely to be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability wise this is a valid proposal. Almost everything needed for further assessment and follow-ups is here. A clear roadmap, a decent budget,... One thing I would've like to see and what you can still do if the proposal is successfully funded is thinking about some metrics for the proposal. What are your thoughts about the success of this proposal? How will you state that the proposal is a success? What numbers can you give for it being successful? Think about active users, amount of routines, amount of feedback on routines, total reviews, engaged users,...
