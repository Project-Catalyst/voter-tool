It is an app to line up tutors with learners.

It is good to start with a 'niche' of targeted audience (profiled users) as along as you know exactly the people/resources in the environment your are living/working.\r\n\r\nThe proposal doesn't cover very well how it will add value to Cardano ecosystem. 'This money will get us started on the best chain out there' it's a statement that doesn't emphasize the truly benefits of using the Cardano ecosystem (Atala Prism API could be used for this project - DID component).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is missing in setting up KPIs/Metrics (i.e. what is the number of users that impact the app? etc.).\r\n\r\nThe ideea has potential, but this time it wasn't presented with a working plan.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence (references) of skills and experience needed to implement the proposal.

The project seems to need additional funding and this should be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nA timetable is provided but with no milestones clearly emphasized (i.e. 1 month - backend design and functionality, 1 month - testing/reworking 1 month -wallet integration and testing with the backend etc.)\r\n\r\nThe proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation. The proposer should define risks that can be associated with the ongoing plan (i.e. what if none of the onboarded users (students) don't initiate a contract in a time frame (1 month, 3 months - your choice)\r\n\r\n'We will be profitable with only a 5% cut' this is arguably a bad financial approach. Relative numbers looks good when they are low but for a healthy financial perspective they should be weighted relative to an accepted (positive outcome) absolute value. It is clear that this project needs a minimum threshold of necessary income to be running.

I think Cost, Match & Trust should be highlighted in the Problem statement. Also I think you are limiting this to academics if you stick to the term \"Tutor\" only. You can use more terms like specialists, consultants, advisors or advisers.... Your problem statement should be more like \"Finding an expert consultant/ tutor or monetizing your consulting/academic expertise requires centralized vetting services that limit your choices limiting your choices based on your budget, expectations and integrity of the Tutor/Student\".\r\nI hope this gives you pointers.
