It may not fit the definition of community intended for this challenge as its not location-based but they are nonetheless a niche of people who share a commonality spread across the globe, hence the positive marks given. As a person who belongs to this community, I am a daily user of Alexa's news functionality and if Cardano news briefings could be added to my feed, it will allow keeping abreast of the latest whilst performing my normal home routines. Thank you for thinking out of the box and expanding this assessor's.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the proposer has already completed and released Alexa Skills, albeit in a different language, there is a high level of confidence that this project's goals can meet success. The amount requested is small and the proposal intends to produce two Alexa Skills (presumably one from the www.cardanofeed.com and another from other sources), which is great value for money. The plan defined, albeit brief and concise, seems straightforward. It would have improved the given score had the plan been presented in an itemised form but given the approach is looking like a one-person undertaking, no additional resources outside of the proposer is required.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Audibility is where this proposal is lacking. Despite the high level of confidence given in the implementation to success, the summary of the development approach does not provide the kinds of details that will make it trackable. It would've been ideal if timelines are added to the analysis and the build so voters have an expectations of how the journey is tracking and when the two final products can be expected.Are they being developed concurrently or or one-after-another?
