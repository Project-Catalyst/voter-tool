Summer and after school free online group coding programs.\" - What challenges? What is the target audience for this initiative? Who will create and guide the online group coding programs?\r\n\"Coding and idea challenges for different age groups. Reach out to school districts and youth centers. Have them beta testing projects\" - Again, what are the coding and idea challenges referred to here? What projects? Will they be created by the proposer? It is not mentioned in the proposal how this will be done.\r\nDue to the above mentioned reasons and the fact that I can see no metrics for success mentioned anywhere, I strongly disagree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\nFor the proposal to receive a higher score, it should be clearer in how the problem will be solved (with concrete steps, not general statements) and by who.

Here is my assessment:\r\n- The proposer has not provided any details about himself whatsoever and I cannot count \"Youth\" as relevant experience here\r\n- The proposer has been a member of Project Catalyst only since the 22nd of August, 2021\r\n- I cannot find any previous contributions of the proposer to the Cardano ecosystem\r\n- There are no details in the proposal about who will do what, when and how\r\n- The budget is very large and there is no justification on how it is intended to be used\r\n- Between 22 and 25 August, the proposer has created 7 separate proposals, all suffering from the same issues as this one. This leads me to suspect that the proposals were created en masse in the hopes of gaming the system and obtaining some funds.
