However, this proposal does not address the challenge effectively: \r\n- they are not intending to start a new community hub\r\n- the website/ interactive map is not targeting local communities\r\nI would also argue that a website that is about Cardano would not be able to solve the problem of FUD for the average person that is the main focus of this challenge. The map would be considered biased by people spreading FUD about Cardano, especiall since it\u00b4s funded by Cardano but also because a map that specifically focusses on one project will not be considered trustworthy as a source of unbiased news, even tho it might offer objective facts and wants to educate. But generally, this proposal would fit great in the Developer Ecosystem or Dapp and Integrations, value onboarding,multilingual resources, it does not fit well in this challenge that is focussing on empowering and onboarding people from the ground level. I understand that the proposers plan to use this map to support local community hubs but I think this would still not point towards this proposal meeting criteria for this challenge, it seems more like a way of making the project fit into this challenge. I want to add that I don\u00b4t think this proposal has no value - just that it does not fit in this specific challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team provided the url and the website is up and running, showing prior committment and lots of hours of work that went in this resource. So while not much information about the team is provided, proof of prior work points towards a high probability that this project would be further developed in the way the proposing team stated. The financial budget is not broken down and included base salary for developers, which in this case is fine, since the team would like to receive funding to further develop an existing webpage. If this proposal would truly aim to provide this map mainly to local community hubs, I would expect funds and milestones to point to how they would want to reach out to these hubs and what sources would be used to promote the map, seeing that there is lots of websites on Cardano and crypto in general out there, so outreach would be an important factor for this page. I would recommend to the proposing team to include this in future proposals - will there be a social media reference? Is the team presenting their work in Townhall or do they have connections to any local hubs to provide the map to? How will this map be search optimized?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Problem and solution do not perfectly align since a map about Cardano will not necessarily avoid FUD on Cardano. The roadmap and milestones are very broad and not auditable. The measures of success should include more concrete, measurable outcome. How many people would the proposers aim to onbaord to Cardano? How many developers would they attract who use this map as a \"go-to-source\"? Would they be able to bring external organizations into the ecosystem?

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As we can see the POC developed by the team, looks great and there is a lot of score for improvement. Also I would suggest adding details about how the project would sustain in the future, since Cardano is growing there will be lot more things added than what we have now, so there will be a need of continuous work hours for a long period, so it would be better to add such details in the proposal next time.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The timeline provided is great and looks promising, can measure how the proposal's progress over time.

Underpinning the efforts of onboarding new members and foster new projects. \r\nThe site that is in beta seems very promising and the additions mentioned to be developed after funding I do consider will help to reach several of the challenge goals, indirectly as I said.\r\nLocal hubs may either publicize their projects, promote projects and information that makes sense to local needs, engage founders from those projects and may help to translate/localize contents in local languages.\r\n\r\nThe requested funds are coherent with the estimated effort and the amount of people involved.\r\n367 hs per month by 4 people = around 92 hs each.\r\nThe issue I found is that as the site is free to use, and no funds are being requested to sustain the operation and maintenance of the solution, those recurring costs could produce a risk of continuity at some point in time.\r\nI do suggest as well to leverage other projects by the community to join forces, accelerate evolution and reduce efforts to add and maintain the information (maybe moderated interface with ideascale?)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is solid, with clear deliverables, enough muscle and skills to be able to produce the deliverables on time within budget.\r\nJust a brief general comment about the specific individuals of the team was provided, so my assessment is based on the site already built, rather than information on the individuals of the team.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics provided can easily serve to audit and track the progress on the promises.\r\nThey are also SMART in conception and I consider a good indicator to measure success and its impact to the stated goals.\r\nI'd suggest that some extra KPIs or OKRs are produced to understand the indirect impact of the project, such as how many local hubs are using the BoC site, how many projects have been added by local hubs to the site, how many concepts or projects information have been localized or translated and are being consumed by local hubs.

Sure, the Community Hub and localization angle is mentioned a couple of times between the lines but, frankly, this would have been a five-star proposal in the dApp challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is obvious that the team means business and they are passionately building this to be The Hub for Cardano related dApps and solutions.

Add for each initiative (automate where possible):\r\n- Social Feeds (e.g. #twitter hashtags)\r\n- Recommended content from YouTube*\r\n- Team profiles from LinkedIn\r\n\r\n2. Integrate to support Project Catalyst\r\n- Mark if this is a Catalyst project or not -> funding received, results achieved etc \r\n- Make this a tracking tool where teams update their progress, news and announcements\r\n- Collect auditability / tracking / other use cases from Community Advisors and Catalyst Circle\r\n\r\n3. Integrate with:\r\n- https://cardanocataly.st/\r\n- https://projectcatalyst.org/\r\n- https://github.com/nahern/essential-cardano/blob/main/essential-cardano-list.md\r\n\r\n*I sense a little bit of YouTube-frustration between the lines but I still I dare to suggest this.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Everything is quite clear. Normally I would require to see a more detailed plan and budget but now results speak for themselves. Hopefully the project's success in Fund6 attracts partnerships and more team members so that the 3-12 month targets can be achieved earlier.\r\n\r\nIdea for ensuring the sustainability of funding: perhaps the included and claimed projects could pay a voluntary donation to be included in a FEATURED list or something. They could choose the sum and if it's a one-time or recurring donation. FEATURED list could update monthly. -> For transparency's sake these voluntary donations could be listed on the site (without mention which project they came from).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This team has already started to map the Cardano ecosystem and with this proposal the seek to finance the rest of the development.

Also they don't explain how this proposal fits into this challenge.

Therefore this proposal would fit much better into the challenge developer ecosystem.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team has already started to develop this project and therefore has proven their commitment.

It gives confidence that the team are capable and know what they are doing and why. Additionally, the existing website should help any voter easily understand this proposal. \r\n\r\nThe \"available in\" function will be even more useful in being scalable on a global level, however, might there be some limitation in that the primary language of the website will be in English? Something for the proposers to consider in future versions. \r\nThe budget appears to be reasonable and very cost effective given the work already put in. As someone who has worked in educating new users in a corporate setting for 10+ years, one of the biggest barriers to adoption is always definitions and access to an easy-to-use glossary of terms written for the lay person.  Something to consider is who will be writing these so that it effectively speaks to that audience. I do have confidence though that the fact that the proposers have mentioned this as being central, they have a plan in place for executing this. To make this proposal even better, it would be great to see how you are going to make that happen (who, what, and how much).

For instance, being the \"go-to resource\" is a good success metric but how are you measuring that? Is that in comparison to another resource? Or is it citations in media?
