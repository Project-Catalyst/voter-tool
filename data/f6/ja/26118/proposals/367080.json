This would certainly drive up the exposure to Cardano of the attending companies. However, it is worth noting that the attendants are mostly already knowledgeable in blockchain technology if these companies/individuals decided to attend a blockchain expo. And if anybody is exposed to crypto already it would be unlikely that this person/company is not aware of the third largest crypto out there. I believe the proposer should focus on the governance aspect of Cardano which is a unique characteristic. It should also speak about Project Catalyst. Nonetheless, this booth has a good chance of attracting new devs, new Cardano users and new external organisations.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has a high likelihood of being successful although process of being accepted to have a booth at the EXPO was not shared. The proposer is advised to write about the ease of getting a space allocation for the booth at the EXPO. Otherwise, the team seems well competent of operating the booth and sharing useful information on Cardano.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The setting up of the booth is quite easy to track confirmed though pictures and more. Tracking the people who are informed from this booth and who end up holding Cardano or developers participating in the community as a result is much harder. Nonetheless, the proposers are asking for a small portion of the total budget. Disclosures should be made whether the proposers would be somehow profiting from setting the booth or whether they would be marketing certain services of products which they offer.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_281", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal presents a problem and has provided a solution which fits in challenge settings. For better visibility and to present the proposal in a more understandable manner it is recommended to have a member in the team with good writing skills in English. The statement 'At present, it is difficult to adopt CARDANO into the real business world' because... (i.e. few people are aware of the benefits of using Cardano ecosystem etc.) will be more clearly presented (problem details section pointed to this direction). Anyway, the proposal as it is, hasn't lost its essence and the outcome that it will be produced. This is a non-English speaking event that has a big potential to attract new users in the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe proposal has metrics defined for measuring the outcome. I will recommend to implement a way to also measure the impact and to collect feedbacks from the participants (it will be good to know the level of desire for Cardano ecosystem adoption among the participants in a defined time frame - 6m, 1y, 2y etc,)\r\n\r\nThe proposal is able to scale and to address future challenges.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is already assembled with each member having a role defined and it seems that they have the relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal as a good part of the team is already involved in different areas of using/promoting Cardano ecosystem or in promoting events.\r\n\r\nThe budget is outlined and broken down into identifiable items. For better visibility the amount requested should have details on how it will be spent and for what. Anyway, based on the proposal details a good chunk of the estimated budget is already covered form other sources.\r\n\r\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work.\r\nThe proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how. (good job!).\r\n\r\nI recommend the proposer to outline some possible risks to be taken into consideration (Mr. Hoskinson participation is for the EXPO or for the booth organized by the proposer (it's somehow unclear)? What is the backup in case of no show up (Video message, another relevant IOG representative etc.) and what is the impact of this undesired event if it occurs?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\nMetrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are set.\r\nThere is a good description of the targeted problem which has a clear understandable solution that addresses it.\r\nIt is highly likely that this event would be very attractive to the audience and has the potential to onboard people on Cardano ecosystem.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_309", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Amazing proposal and vision. This meets all of the requirements to meet the challenge brief with the core underlying mkission of \"introduce Cardano to Japanese Fortune 500 and public organizations.\" Hopefully you get the feedback desired which will end with a successfully funded campaign. I scored this well as I believe that a Japanese target market is key and to present these Cardano facts to these key companies could yeild some significant results. I understood your solution to the problem stated and I feel its relevance. The benefitting community is self explanatory and you have adequately addressed the education and adoptions aspects of this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the detail and depth of the team you have assembled I am confident that with the various skillsets on display that you will find success with this project. Your plan is solid and with a few extra tweaks I feel like this could be a great initiative.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The only area I scored this down for was with regards to the lack of incorporating more of the Key Metrics into your proposal. I feel that you could provide some more metrics like 'The number of businesses engaged' and further to follow-up at various milestones advising of the status of the engagement (i.e. if they have committed to a partnership, are they are planning some partnerships etc) I also like what Rik mentioned in the comments about the flash interviews. These could also form the baseline for what the attendees intentions are and also could be used a key follow-up metrics over time.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_575", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "JP\u6700\u5927\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3067\u3042\u308bB.C.EXPO\u306b\u51fa\u5c55\u3057\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30f3500\u4f01\u696d\u3084\u516c\u7684\u6a5f\u95a2\u306b\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\u30ce\u3092\u7d39\u4ecb\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "Cardano Youtuber\uff082\u5e74\u9593\u6bce\u65e5\u6295\u7a3f\uff09\uff0fSPO\uff0fDC Spark\u30e1\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\uff0f\u516c\u5f0f\u30a2\u30f3\u30d0\u30b5\u30c0\u30fc\uff0f\u5f01\u8b77\u58eb\uff0f\u516c\u8a8d\u4f1a\u8a08\u58eb"}
