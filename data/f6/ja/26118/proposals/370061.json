The value to the Cardano ecosystem is clear - having a central space for members of the community to gather, learn, and collaborate would be extremely impactful.

It is very helpful that these specific details are provided, as this connection makes the implementation seem feasible. A detailed financial plan was provided to support the budget. The plan envisions that the Hub will become self-sustaining in six months, which is appealing. Two factors kept me from rating this aspect with five stars. I would have like to know a bit more detail about the proposers themselves, in order to validate their skills and experience. I really like the inclusion of the financial plan and don't want to be too critical given its inclusion. However, there are a lot of numbers I don't understand on the plan.  For example, the final column lists \"Month 12.\" I assume the numbers in this column do not apply only to the 12th month, but are they for the second half of the year? Or perhaps the year in total? I don't understand what the first column represents (prior to month 1). When I try to add the columns and rows myself, I can't get the math to work out. And I would like more detail around how they arrived at the revenue projections. I commend their efforts to include a budget as it is important to substantiate the funds requested. But more clarity is needed regarding the numbers. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A clear road map is provided that breaks the project into four distinct phases.

They identified groups to target including students in the Cardano/development space, as well as young entrepreneurs. The plan is absent, though, on the details of how to reach those in that community (developers, entrepreneurs, etc), and how to attract them to want to come to the space. The plan is to do \"word of mouth\" exclusively, which presumes that the proposer has access to the particular networks and credibility within them to be able to spread the word to the right people and to attract them. Which there's no documentation to support, such as examples of communities or groups or universities or university groups that would be contacted. Which the proposer may have but doesn't detail at all in the proposal. How many people in these communities are they currently in contact with? Are there already a quorum of people interested who can be spreading the word to their respective communities. The hope appears to be that if you build it, they will come. The lynchpin of the plan, though, involves getting the space and plan to be known to those that would interested, and the steps to do that are not detailed here.  Furthermore, the proposal lists \"the capacity of the space is very limited.\" Which raises other questions -- how limited? 50 people? 20 people? If it's limited, how much can this realistically grow the Cardano community? Can there be plans to grow beyond the initial space if successful?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I appreciate the timeline in the presentation deck which does list some loose KPIs (refurnishing the space), which is a bit nebulous on the metrics of real success (how much adoption is enough for this to be self-sustaining or to grow, what are longer term metrics of success such as dapps developing out of collaborations). The evaluation of \"what works? What doesn't?\"  Does not define what \"works\" or success means, how it's measured, etc. No is the definition of \"full\" or \"too full.\"  Further details or thoughts on optimal amount of attendance, turnover/churn, amount of interaction between members, traction of attendees turning into collaborations, number of projects resulting from the space, etc, have not been thought out at all but would be useful in future revisions of the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_517", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "A coordination space in Addis Ababa fits well within the goal of scaling up as it holds the potential to grow the business and development side of the Cardano community in Ethiopia.
