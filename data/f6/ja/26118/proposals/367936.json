The solution that the proposer is offering is effectively addressing the challenge in that he is able to name the group that the hub is dedicated to and the content that the hub is going to deliver to the participants and members that would join the hub. By choosing a University, the proposal might be able to onboard new users into the ecosystem, bring a University on board, onboard developers into the ecosystem and provide relevant information on Cardano to a new community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Relevant experience is given, Matthias is a very active member of the Catalyst community and would be able to deliver the overall message and value to a hub. Being a graduate of the University can be seen as a great start for the networking event and will give credibility to the program. The financial budget is very humble and if documented, this hub could be used as a template to other Universities. It is an easy way to scale-up and reach new members, drive adoption from the ground level, empower and make people curious. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Audatibility is given and content of the proposed workshop is provided. Education as the key metric to onboard new members is a good way. Outreach ideas are great - start at the University that you graduated at and might still have connections to, give out rewards for people to sign up early to enhance planning and make the workshop more attractive. This can be seen as measurements to prevent the risk that the hub is not being noticed much. Overall, I think this is a simple and great solution to introduce a community to Cardano and onboard new people and guide access to what it\u00b4s all about without being overly patronizing.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal seek to increase the awareness of cardano blockchain to under represented folk which in turn will increase the adoption of cardano.
