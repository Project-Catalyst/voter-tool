Building a decentralize charity system can add much value to the ecosystem. Beside, the charity can go directly to the persons in need, without having to trust a middle men or a central organisation. ThIs idea is very good.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a lot of potential, but it fails to provide enough informations, in order to be implemented successfully. The proposal lacks a detail plan and a roadmap. There  isn't enough informations about the team. All in all, this proposal does not contain enough informations to be implemented.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal doesn't include some KPIs  which are essentials for auditing a the project. The  informations provided in this proposal are just not enough to track its progress. Since I think that this idea is great, my suggestion to the proposer is to add more informations such as a plan, a roadmap, a detailed breakdown of the budget and some good KPIs.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_439", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The idea appears to be to create a centralized community hub for charities and/or non-profits. Traditionally non-profits are more targeted in their individual industries and/or hubs. LGBTQ non-profits, are resources for those in the LGBTQ community and a hub for them individually can serve that community. I'm not aware of a clear \"charity\" hub per se that would organize all people in the non-profit space. Most people who get into it, but donators/contributors, and workers, get into it over interest in their particular domain, so not sure that centralizing a payment/donation system would upscale the cardano community, per se. But the non-profit \"industry\" is ripe for disruption and could benefit from innovation, and may help create a payment channel for them, just not clear that it ultimately solves the scaling up of community hubs per se.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While I appreciate the entrepreneur thinking creatively on the topic of creating NFTs and a new coin, the details are too light as to how this can get adoption and traction compared to current centralized donation systems (gofundme, etc). The steps to creating NFTs are not detailed out, nor the possible functions of the AID coin, or how this will directly attract charities/nonprofits to list on their site (would ideally detail how to grow the audience of consumers, and how to make it more relevant to the charities themselves). The entrepreneur and team's background are not listed and it's unclear they have direct experience in the nonprofit world, engaging with leadership in those orgs, building websites, or understanding of the fundamentals to make such a system work.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately no KPIs are listed, dates expected, or steps outlined for progress of the project. Phases aren't detailed in any way and even the metrics by which to assess \"success\" aren't sketched out at all. Would success be a website alone? Adoption by 1 non-profit? Creating a successful campaign for a non-profit client? Getting adoption/donations of X amount of ADA? All could benefit from being detailed.

In theory it is a very good idea, but it fits more into the \"partnerships for global adoption\" challenge. I say this because it is an initiative that seeks to globalize the act of giving, and thus involve technologies from the Cardano ecosystem, which is very positive, but I would not say that it is an idea that encourages different people, from different groups, to carry out new solutions that involve the ecosystem within their mother tongue/cultural contexts. In other words, it is still a relevant idea and one that is certainly worth the funding (if it were better explained, as I will comment on the next items analyzed), but it would be more appropriate if reallocated.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "When it comes to the group's ability to carry out this project, unfortunately we do not have any information about the Cardano Care servants. It would be necessary to present their names, their areas of professional training, some work already done so far, in addition to explaining the relationship of the authors with the Cardano universe, who would build the website, integrate with the digital portfolio, develop the new currency, create NFT? I searched the site mentioned here, but I couldn't find a \"who we are\" tab, and with that it's very hard to believe with confidence that those involved can successfully execute the project. Regarding the roadmap, we don't have either, it would be positive and extremely necessary for the authors to establish phases to be fulfilled for the development of the project.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As in the previous comment, there is also no details regarding auditability. We know the main objectives of this project: to create a more transparent channel for donations; a new cryptocurrency (it would be interesting to know why you need to create another one and not use ada...); reward donors in NFT. But we don't know what actions would need to be taken for these goals to be achieved. In fact, there is already a site that is possibly the donor channel, but unfortunately I found the navigation to be a little tricky, it would be nice if a UI/UX designer redesigned the site to make it easier to use. My suggestions are: outline phases, in which they are composed of small tasks to be accomplished to develop the whole; determine which professionals would be needed for the progress of the project, such as developers, designers, etc; explain how the financial amount would be used, between the development of the website itself and the salaries of the professionals involved; set dates for project launch; define a marketing plan to make the public get to know the site, and thus make donations; define success metrics so that the Cardano community can follow the progress of things. With such information given, we could have a solid vision of what is to come.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 6, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Cardano Care\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u306b\u5bc4\u4ed8\u3092\u9001\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\u5fc5\u8981\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u304c\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u3092\u6295\u7a3f\u3057\u3001\u79c1\u305f\u3061\u306fADA\u3092\u8ced\u3051\u3066\u5bc4\u4ed8\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "kitabisa.com\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3057\u3066\u5bc4\u4ed8\u3092\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u624b\u6570\u6599\u3068\u3057\u3066\u5bc4\u4ed8\u91d1\u304c40\uff5e60\uff05\u30ab\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\u624b\u4f5c\u696d\u3067\u53d7\u4fe1\u8005\u306b\u78ba\u8a8d\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
