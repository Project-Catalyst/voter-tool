Eligibility is an issue shared for similar proposals and crowdfunding platforms and the proposal does not give much information of their uniqueness about this issue. \r\nAs the proposers clarify that this request is for exploration and improvement of the project, it can be assumed that they will address this issue during their research.

In addition, it is a fact that traditional loans have abusive interest and many loopholes for financial theft. I found it interesting that the authors have the notion that it is necessary to build trust in the technology before deploying it to the public, and the place chosen to carry out the project was a country (Ethiopia) that already has previous contact with the activities of the our ecosystem, through the Prisma Atala project. However, there is a detail that I disagree with the authors' view, when they say the following: \"NGOs exclusively focused on donation will probably not attract the attention and suspicion of regulators\". I think this mistrust will always exist, and it is better to prepare prior material, such as a simple and succinct demonstration of how transactions are carried out, in case of future investigations by regulars. But this small detail does not make me believe in the proposal any less, on the contrary, it is just a facet that also needs to be analyzed.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is very positive that the proposal authors are aware that to successfully implement this project, a lot of research is needed. They claim that they will hire \"Ethiopia student(s) at Oxford who have relevant training\" for the purpose of producing a \"white paper that will explicitly address the possible obstacles to financial cultural norms\". In other words, they demonstrate that they have a realistic view of how the entire process will take place, which is a path to be followed. They also devote part of the proposal to explaining who they are, their backgrounds, in the case of programmers: what languages \u200b\u200bthey operate, etc. etc. In this way, a lot of confidence is transmitted regarding the technical capacity of the team to carry out its project, leaving no doubt that the project will be in good hands, with the perspective of reconciling: the academic background and professional experiences of the team already formed + the intention to hire more members for the team.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The applicability of this proposal is perfectly described. We have an extensive description of what will happen in each phase, that is, small actions that will result in the whole, as well as the dates when they will happen. Also very precisely, it is explained to us how the budget would be shared, in phase 1 parameters. What I found very positive was that in this proposal they did not ask for funding beyond what will be necessary for phase 1. Many proposals ask for one high financial amount and do not give much details of how things will happen in the long term, here we have the opposite, a detailed notion of how everything will happen over the months and only what will be used immediately was requested.
