This is not necessarily a problem, but does bring in the inherent risk of cost mispricing or unforeseen technical issues. It would be great if the proposer could team up with a technical partner to at least design and plan the technical side and manage the technical hires.

Its all in the 'plan' section. In summary adjust UI, integrate wallet, create a simple website and promo video, prepare for the next funding round (if needed) for marketing. And otherwise (time and budget permitted) work on security.

Also there is a strategy about how to enter the market with this idea (many proposals are missing this aspect). The budget is broken down in detail and from my experience and perspective fair priced. The detailed plan and the experienced team convinced me, that there is a high likelihood for a successful implementation. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team provides metrics and has defined how success look like, so we can audit this proposal.

It seems that the team already dedicated a lot of work to the project, have a local company registered, and have an initial app version. This gives some good confidence about the knowledge and efforts already dedicated to the solution and believes it could be a good DeFI app for Cardano. \r\n\r\nAs have some good experience working with tech startups for example as a mentor at Seedstars.com or advisory board at GivingWay.com I can appreciate a well-defined problem and solution. \r\n\r\nMore information about the market size potential would have been helpful to understand scale opportunities. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is good information provided about the leading team and it seems a good team with relevant experience combining business and technology. One key red flag is that the venture was not able to raise money and continue progress. The team leader had to focus on his day job. However, well done for making this point clear and explaining that with the funds provided he will be able to dedicate more time to the project. Some other key team members still need to be recruited when funding is available. \r\n\r\nThe plan matches the idea with reasonable milestones and timeframe. The budget is well presented and reasonable with about 65% for development and 35% for marketing (although I am not an expert on local prices in Zimbabwe). You did mention that the budget is in the high end and I believe it is important to have qualified team members for the success of the project.\r\n\r\nOne recommendation from past experience is to focus either on Google or Apple app and do not do both, at least not at this early stage. It will focus the development efforts and will not change much for the proof of concept. In general, the more focused you are, I believe you will be able to progress more and bring stakeholders on board including investors.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Overall good KPIs but having more details about the deliverables and timeframe and connect them to the budget would have been helpful. For example it is not clear to me if the budget requested cover all the 12 months deliverable or it covers only the first 3 months and the rest depends on fund 7 support as mentioned before. Overall, the proposal gives confidence in the transparency of information but this last point was not fully clear.\r\n\r\nGood Q&As section. I would suggest splitting into two sections QA and risks & challenges (which some are implied in the Q&A), so it is clearer. \r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u65e2\u5b58\u306e\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u30fb\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u30fb\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30a6\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30fb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3001CheCha\u3068\u547c\u3070\u308c\u308b\u30e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u3001\u4ea4\u63db\u30e1\u30ab\u30cb\u30ba\u30e0\u3092\u5099\u3048\u305fADA\u30a6\u30a9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u5c0e\u5165\u3059\u308b\u3002", "experience": "\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a2\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30af\u30c8\uff0810\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u30c6\u30ec\u30b3\u30e0\u304a\u3088\u3073\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u30c6\u30c3\u30af\u696d\u754c\u306e\u9ad8TPS\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3092\u5c02\u9580\u3068\u3059\u308b\u3002"}
