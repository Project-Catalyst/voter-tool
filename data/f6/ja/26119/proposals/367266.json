They have set out a detailed plan and timeline and are likely to be able to deliver. As stated above, this biggest risk to this project is whether proposers actually use it.

The proposer shave nominated some metrics to measure success, however it would be great to have some goals here as well.

This wording should be phrased in a better diction to be easily understandable.\r\n-The solution clearly states that the proposal will provide a platform for updates on the state and the progress of proposals. Thus, this challenge is addressed. Furthermore, it states that the community would benefit from having access to a history of update logs, so the community will be able to follow the progress of completion for the funded proposals.\r\n-It is difficult to understand this proposal by linking Ideascale presentation of the proposals from previous fund. All documentation should be created explicitly for this proposal and edited in a coherent format.\r\nThis proposal needs to be worked on, the referred concerns should be addressed.\r\nI rate the impact of this proposal with a score of 3.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "-The feasibility is moderate-high. Teams combined experience in software development and cloud infrastructure is counted to more than 25 years. It is clearly stated that the data needed for the project will be acquired from IOG. \r\n-The roadmap is described in adequate manner. The connection to the previous funded proposals, supports the level of success. \r\n-\"..In total the proposal will likely take anywhere from 5 weeks to complete.\" This sentence is difficult to understand. I can only assume that the proposer meant to say that the first stage will take up to 5 weeks, with 2 weeks for the functionality implementation and another 3 weeks for IOG data integration. \r\n-The budget is clearly defined and declared acceptable with 11% this challenge's funding.\r\nI agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "-For auditability of this proposal the developing team is referring to open source code on their Github repository and on their own community web site https://projectcatalyst.org. \r\nAt this moment this website presents the following statement:\r\n\"Currently the community do not have easy access to the data needed from Ideascale. We are trying to collaborate with IOG and the community on the terminology, definitions and data access in a document we've shared.\" \r\nTo be able to make further inquiry the proposer added this link https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e\r\nWith this last link it is possible to communicate and audit the progress of this proposal.\r\nIn summary I agree with the auditability of this proposal.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_276", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Very simple and funcional idea, adressing the challenge of the campaign and scalable. It is also well written with a clear problem statement, a solution, a defined plan (though here the plan could be splitted into months) and a roadmap.\r\nTo make it more visual, I would add a progress bar (from 0 to 100% complete), with the deliverables/milestones distribuited in their given percentage, and possibly a Kambam layout, so people can see the size of the backlog, what is being  done and what was already delivered, instead of just a list of deliverables. Also, I would also a place to attach \"proofs\"/evidences of the achievements as documents, presentations, spreadsheets, etc\r\nIf possible, it would be nice also to have alll these logs concentrade in a sigle and searchable place, in addition to only the proposal (a dashboard would be great).

The problem is related to information fragmentation and transparency in the reports and updates of funded proposals.\r\n\r\nOne of the essentials of auditability is to disseminate information about funded proposals to the community. Several funded proposals teams have been publishing their progress reports independently through social media, which causes information fragmentation and makes auditability difficult. Having a hub where teams can submit updates and keep a log of this data/infos is important to improve auditability and allow for the creation of analytics that can provide a comprehensive view of past fund cohorts.\r\n\r\nThe goals and metrics mentioned indicate a positive impact on the items established in the challenge brief.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team described relevant experiences(including sources) for the development of the proposal, such as aptitude in web development (front end/back end) and has been actively participating in Catalyst for several months, having contributed with several projects related to community integration (voters, proposers and CAs). such as Catalist Swarm and https://projectcatalyst.org/ \r\n\r\nThere is description of a reasonable and well-structured plan, with a cohesive timeline. A budget breakdown was included according to the allocation of time in different activities and the hourly rate. The established values are reasonable and compatible with the values corresponding to web development rates and other activities.
