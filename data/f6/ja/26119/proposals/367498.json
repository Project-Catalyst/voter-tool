Without this, the technical side would not be used.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The authors seem to have the experience available to complete the technical side of this proposal.

This is great, however success cannot happen without completion reports being mandated. More of the proposal should focus on how they will get this to happen, and on successful design of the reporting format. TO get a scalable efficient process, it would be good to have the completion reports in a standardized machine readable format so aggregate metrics can be published across projects, challenges etc to inform the design of future challenges and voters on who to fund.
