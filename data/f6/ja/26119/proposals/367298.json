Whilst potentially a good way to get audits done, will this scale well enough for Catalyst as a whole? Perhaps some effort should go into standardizing and automating what proposals submit so that the number of hours of audit time per proposal is reduced. If this cannot be done, what is the minimum size proposal we should fund such the audit costs are an acceptable proportion of funding? I.e. is there a point funding a $1000 proposal and then spending $625 to audit it?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer clearly has the ability to deliver this proposal. it is a relatively simple plan that has been costed out and it likely to deliver the audits proposed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The delivery of the proposed audits under this proposal is easy to audit. But is delivery of 40 audits and the system that managed the process count as success here? How will the proposer work with the experience gathered during the process to help standardize the process and make it more efficient going forward? The proposal does talk about the hope of streamlining the process, but can we set some goals around it?

A contingency plan for how to scale up/down as necessary based on the workload would be nice to see.  As Cardano grows, so will the funding rounds and the amount of proposal.  The solution looks like it may have scalability issues depending on how the system is implemented and rolled out at the end of the day.  There is a mention of requesting future funding, but also looking at other ways to do the same amount of work is important.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal doesn't have a clear framework in terms of a roadmap or deliverables laid out.

Perhaps you could create another proposal for the purpose of training these student-auditors to evaluate the financial aspects of proposals pre-assessment. If a proposal gets funded, this Auditor will then help the project team to meet the auditing requirements.\r\n\r\nProjects that have auditors in their team might get funding more easily.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This plan might not address the challenge requirements but the proposers' experience is definitely an asset that should be utilized.

Wouldn't it be possible to make the submission of financial data and documentation open to all proposers so that the number of proposals with available data could be greater? This would also make the audit fairer.\r\nThe team could focus efforts only on proposals that involve a higher cost to the treasury, so the use of resources would be more rational.\r\n\r\nNo metrics or KPIs were included, which could help with the impact assessment.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer described relevant experience with financial audits and included sources for verification.

I think it is important that the audit process doesn't create excessive bureaucracy for proposers.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a reasonable timeline.\r\n\r\nOne risk that was not considered in the proposal and I see a problem is data fragmentation.\r\n\r\nWe need to keep in mind that the idea of \u200b\u200bauditing is also to give the community access to information. Creating a new website adds complexity. My recommendation is towards integration with other websites and people who are already developing related projects.\r\n\r\nIt hasn't been defined how the 40 proposals to be audited will be chosen. Some proposals on Catalyst request less than 1,000USD and others more than 100,000USD.

This challenge seeks to  \"make the auditing process of funded proposals *efficient, distributed and transparent*\" \u2013 but this proposal only addresses transparency. It does the **opposite** of making auditing more distributed, because  a) it centralises financial auditing in the hands of the proposal team, rather than the community, and b) it doesn't plan to do any consultation with the community when devising its reporting requirements and processes, to ensure they're appropriate or even that the community as a whole understands and approves them. It also decreases efficiency, because it's trying to apply the same auditing requirements to all projects \u2013 but for financial auditing to be efficient, it needs to take account of the scale of a project, and not apply disproportionate auditing demands to small, low-budget projects (which many Catalyst projects are). If the project plan had taken account of this (two \"tiers\", maybe, small projects and more major ones?) and also looked at some level of consultation with the community to develop the audit process, the project would have addressed the challenge much better.\r\n\r\nAlso - although the project does address making auditing more transparent, there is a balance to be struck between transparency and data privacy. This proposal wants to \"build out a website where funded proposers are required to submit [financial] documentation\" \u2013 no bad thing, but I'd like to see some recognition in the proposal about the importance of data protection, and how potentially personally-identifiable financial info will be kept secure, how it will be stored, and what elements of it will be made public.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal takes no account of risk. What happens if proposers find the system difficult to use, cannot use it, don't use it in a timely manner, etc? This could at best delay the project, and at worst, make it unworkable. There's also no built-in process or resources in this pilot for usability testing,  technical support for users, or even for publicising and ensuring that the wider community (not just existing proposers, but everyone) knows about the new system. These omissions could all negatively impact feasibility.\r\n\r\nThere's also an issue with scaleability. Although the proposer calls this project a \"pilot\",  there is a clear intention to  implement it long-term for all projects; and  I don't think that can possibly work. This project will use fully 25% of this challenge's money (a big chunk, and I think a little questionable in itself)  to create a system and pilot it on 40 projects. To do, say, 100 audits in a later round would cost upwards of $47,000; and as proposals continue to increase, it will be more; it could easily become prohibitive.  The project does mention long-term plans to \"create more auditing tools\" to \"streamline the process\" \u2013 but this is naturally quite vague at this stage, so can't really be assessed as part of this proposal.\r\n\r\nSo on balance I don't think we can be confident that the project is feasible; nor can we be confident that it would solve the problem identified in the problem statement, because it is proposing a solution that is not scaleable. It does present itself as a \"pilot\" - but it won't be acting like one, and intends to just go straight ahead and implement the solution more widely immediately; so we have to consider whether that's workable.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are no specific KPIs or metrics given to help us measure what success would look like, beyond simply doing the work. This seems a bit thin for something presented as a \"pilot\" to test the viability of a solution.
