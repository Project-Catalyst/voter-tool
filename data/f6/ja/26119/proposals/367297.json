Unfortunately even a successful implementation would not help the goal of this challenge to improve and grow auditability.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Delivery of 3 video's over 3 months will be easy to audit.

There is little discussion outside of Catalyst townhalls on how projects are progressing and this proposal will help to give a voice to past projects on how they fared once they secured funding.  This is an important aspect of measuring and growing Catalyst, but doesn't really fully fit into the ask of this funding group.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer do seem to be knowledgable and skilled in the media production side of things.  Some questions that aren't fully mentioned in the proposal would be their ability to translate highly technical information effectively through video.  The ability to make content doesn't seem to be a concern given the experience of the team.  More detail into a layout of the content within the videos and how they plan to reach and effectively cover the landscape of all projects is a concern not fully addressed in the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Given the video media production and desire to create a video a month, it will be reasonably easy to track and measure their progress in developing content.  A roadmap of how they will accomplish the videos, a la pre-production, sourcing proposals to interview/make content would make the proposal more easier to understand how they plan to get things accomplished.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_13", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "There\u2019s no better category for this project.

I suggest to look for challenge like F6: Scale-UP; or  F6:Catalyst value onboarding; this challenge asks how do new people learn about Catalyst? This would be perfect niche for this proposal. \r\nI strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer represents highly skilled team, nominated filmmaker with 15 years of experience in film/documentary. The program is well described with 3 months of production. The budget asked for, does not cover marketing expenses, as the marketing is not included. The proposer is unsure how to promote the produced material and is seeking for a marketing solution and assistance. Because of lack in decision on distribution and marketing solution, this proposal is not complete. The budget asked seems to be between high and acceptable rate, given that the quality is of high standard. videos are only 5-8 min long. If the  marketing is meant to be included, then the budget seems reasonable.\r\nI neither agree nor disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The progress of this proposal could be easily audited by defining exact dates for each of the videos produced, the proposer has stated that each month, form November to January, one video will be created.

Not just people within the Catalyst group. \u00a0That\u2019s why it is in the right category. And the question of the duration of the video is simply wrong. Creating a short, fast-paced, well-edited content is much harder than recording several hours of video live on Youtube. \n\n\n\n"}, {"q0": "Unfortunately, this proposal has nothing to do with the challenge in which it was released. I evaluated this same idea in another fund, I believe that maybe the author has not been aware that each challenge has a specific objective and has launched the same proposal in 2 (or more, I don't know) different challenges, or maybe he thinks that way will get more funding. The fact is that this idea talks about creating videos, in documentary format, about the Cardano universe, in order to clarify what this would be and attract new members to the community, but it has nothing to do with improving auditability, how the challenge proposes.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Regarding the author's ability to execute this proposal, there is no doubt that he produces quality audiovisual content, as we can see in the video attached to the proposal itself. He claims to have a lot of experience with audiovisual, but we don't know what his direct connection is with the Cardano universe. We also don't know who the other team members are, which he claims has some other people collaborating on the project. But which ones, what do they do?... Unfortunately, there is a lot of missing information. I don't see how the author and his team could work with the challenge objective, improve the auditability, if they don't mention this task at any time in the proposal description. We have an (abstract) notion of how the project will happen, but it's all very superficial, unfortunately.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "About the auditability of this proposal, we know that the objective here is to produce 3 videos, and the months in which they will be released. We also know that they will be posted on vimeo, and after that the intention is for the public to publicize them, in an organic way. However, how can the public divulge something without first having an expressive contact with it? The author recognizes that he is a documentary filmmaker and does not understand much about marketing, and someone is needed to exercise this role in the project. So it would be important if he, for example, specified how many people would be involved in the project, exactly who they are, and how much they would get paid for their work. On the attached website, you can see the content of each video, and none of them come close to what the challenge proposes. This proposal needs to be allocated to a more appropriate challenge, which I believe is the \"propose outreach\" challenge, and with that, it would certainly be well evaluated.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "There\u2019s no better category for this project.
