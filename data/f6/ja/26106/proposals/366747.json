At one point the proposal refers to access to activity data in Ideascale. So, is the idea to incentivize e.g. commenting on proposals? I don't see how that would lead to any positive outcome. Should the trial be successful, it would spread the idea that you have to get paid for all participation. That's not a desirable outcome. Encouraging meaningful participation is more meaningful if it's based on volunteer-drive. I know, I have been a nonprofit leader and seen the achievements and zeal of people working for the purpose, not for the money.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Team members and the greater WADA membership are respected parts of the Cardano community. They are very capable people who have already achieved a lot. This plan, however, is not the way to go (see above and refer to the comments section as well).\r\n\r\nOccasionally rewarding people for their outstanding contributions is a different question altogether. If you could take the proposal to that direction it could have a positive impact: having some funds earmarked for one-off \"thanks\", voted on and distributed by the community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It feels like the proposal is not entirely thought through.
