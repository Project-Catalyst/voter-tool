It is an app to line up tutors with learners. The proposers have submitted a basically the same idea into 5 other challenges. In the metadata challenge it seemed to fit reasonably well but they have not stated how it fits with this challenge.  This specific submission is basically a perfect cut and paste as that submitted to the developer ecosystem challenge, it even has the same heading. The only difference is it is 1/3 the cost (likely as there is less money in this challenge).", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer likely have the experience to set up the platform generally and it will likely be implemented as described, though the fact they have sent it into different challenges with difference costs makes me wonder about what the budget should really be?

How it will work and how they will build it. The solution they provide to solving the transparency in reviews is a sound one. Also solving the payment and minimal fees of the tutor in the process. The roadmap provided is simple and straight to the point with a possible launch date. Keeping track of this proposals progress and success should be easy to monitor. They have addressed some risks, like the zoom session that automatically records the session should there be a way to prove the quality of the session. As the project grows I think it should be noted that user feedback should become a part of your growing process.
