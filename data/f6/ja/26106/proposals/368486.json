This would need engagement from the proposal with the people who run these channel. I'd also open for suggestions from users/viewers about future videos to see what community needs the most. \r\nFurthermore, There are some similar proposals in F6 (educational videos) and its imporant they can complement each other - if more than one proposed related to video creation get funded, it would be nice to see proposers working together to avoid overlap on the content or on the way things are communicated.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not giving a score 5 here becuuse only 2 videos in a time fram of 3 monthts seem not to be enough in order to solve the stated problem (Many Catalyst concepts are is difficult to understand and hard to explain). Also, no communication strategy is explained. How these videos will be spread and communicated within the community and the new comers?

However, a motion design would still have to be hired and his time availability is not certain.\r\n\r\nregarding plan and budget, it seems 8,000 USD seems a bit overpriced for only 2 videos in 3 months. It would be nice to see how many hours the team intends to work on each of the budget lines. \r\n\r\nA final consideration, it is not clear on the lenght of the videos so I'm assuming something like 2-3 min duration, as it is in the posted draft. If it is much more than that, then maybe the budget and plan make sense.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are proposed milestones (1 video each 2-3 months) and some metrics but they dont have targets.
