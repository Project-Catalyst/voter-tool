In the context of hundreds of proposals in Fund5, the participation of casted votes/unique wallets is still small and further exploration would be needed to understand the behavior of voters. Obtaining more information/data about voters would improve their onboarding process and also help distribute the decision making, so this proposal is addressing two challenges at the same time, which I consider a plus in ROI.\r\n\r\nA goal was set to get 200 surveys filled by voters, a reasonable number, but there is no definition of how the survey participants would be chosen. The ideal would be to choose different voter profiles for a more comprehensive result and the financial incentive can result in a less uniform/skewed voter profile in relation to the community overall real profile. The proposal may be expanded in the future.\r\n\r\nThe questions cited as an example seem to be pertinent and seek relevant information from voters.\r\nIOG has been conducting surveys, with voters included. It would be interesting to obtain data from these surveys already carried out to add to the proposal and enrich the analysis.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I believe that the quality of the survey is very dependent on the team's ability to understand Catalyst, to prepare a survey that asks appropriate questions and that can result in rich and clarifying data/information. The questions cited as an example indicate that the team is aware of the weaknesses of the process and the team in general is very involved in Catalyst and in Catalyst improvement projects, so I believe they are able and qualified to carry out the proposal. There are details about the experience and qualifications of the members, I recommend just adding sources/links for more information about the whole team.\r\n\r\nThe plan described is well structured, there is a realistic timeline for the suggested steps. There is a budget breakdown, but I cannot say whether the $20 incentive is appropriate as there is no estimated time to complete the survey.\r\n\r\nOffering $20 to each participant seems too much to me and can make people try to abuse the model just for the reward. How to prevent a person from creating multiple fake profiles to answer the survey? Will there be any control in this regard? I know that IOG conducts surveys about Catalyst and that hundreds of people respond voluntarily. Regardless, I consider this as a small issue for feasibility, just a point to be considered as there is no mention of this in the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is clarity in the problem, solution and alignment of both with the challenge.\r\n\r\nThere is a goal of 200 participants and a realistic timeline for conducting the survey, data analysis and publishing the results.\r\n\r\nThere are no indicators that allow us to check the quality of responses in the survey. 200 participants is an indicator of quantity, but it doesn't allow us to understand the quality of the sample.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a great proposal and will help to improve the experience in catalyst for multiple groups of people (especially voters and proposers).

I believe that this poll is something really important and that it will make a difference for the next funds, not least because it is not very common (at least I didn't get to evaluate) proposals that focus directly on the voter.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team involved in the project is certainly very capable and prepared to execute it, they include a detailed explanation of who they are, what they do and some examples of previous work, as they already have their marks left in the ecosystem. through the development of some tools, such as the Ca Tool (I've used it myself and it's very useful). As it is an objective idea, I didn't feel the need to include more people, that is, to hire other professionals to attend all the activities involved in the project, here we have: the creation of the proposal, the dissemination, the data collection and the visual/informative elaboration of the results. I believe that the team presented is able to work on all these fronts in a satisfactory manner.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We know what will happen, what small tasks will be needed to accomplish the whole, in what order they will happen, how many voters are expected to develop the survey, how the results will be represented (visually, through of infographics, as I understand). We also know, objectively, how the money requested in the financing will be used, and these are pretty fair amounts, in my opinion. A suggestion I could give is: it would also be interesting to clarify where the research result would be published and on what probable date, approximately.
