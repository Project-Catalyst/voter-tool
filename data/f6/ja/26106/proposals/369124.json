The plan is quite good described. Budgeting is reasonable.

The Eastern Town Hall is a communication channel that can engage the community in the eastern hemisphere, for reasons of time zone and different languages, so it's a good way to onboard new people to Catalyst.\r\n\r\nThe continuity of the Eastern Town Hall and incentives for participation for 6 months are a good indicator of impact, as the community will have a channel to exchange information about Catayst for a reasonable period, which adds to the impact of the proposal on the challenge, however there is a lack of indicators about the engagement of the community in the Eastern Town Hall.\r\n\r\nThe 20% growth target for each Fund doesn't establish an initial number of participants, 20% growth without a base number of participants is not a good indicator. E.g.\r\n\r\n-If the base number is 100 participants and there is a 20% increase for each Fund, there will be more than 140 participants after 2 Funds\r\n\r\n-If the base number is 10 participants there would be an increase of only 4 participants after 2 Funds.\r\n\r\nMy point is, without a base number of participants this indicator is not appropriate for impact indication.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team presented qualifications and experience suitable for the objectives defined in the proposal. The members involved in the proposal have already held sessions for a few weeks and the work is already being developed on a voluntary basis.\r\n\r\nThe proposal intends to use the funds to create a treasury to fund activities for the maintenance of the Eastern Town Hall like, software costs, subsidies, bounties, management costs, translation and creation of content relevant to Catalyst. \r\n\r\nThere is an adequate and reasonable timeline adjusted for the maintenance of the Eastern Town Hall for the next 6 months.\r\n\r\nThere is a budget breakdown, but establishing a discount for the required amount in the budget doesn't make sense. If the proposal requires X amount of money, asking for only part of the amount only indicates less feasibility and reliability of the defined amounts. If the intention is to lower the subsidy for participation in Town Halls it would make more sense to lower the incentive to less than $15 per person.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is clarity in the problem, solution and alignment with the challenge. \r\n\r\nThe established goals are linked to the continuity of the Eastern Town Hall sessions for 6 months, but there is no roadmap with clear milestones. A questionnaire will be used to collect feedback from participants, but it is unclear what information to collect in the questionnaire. The team is committed to report financial data about all expenses of the treasuty.\r\n\r\nThe success of the proposal was linked to a 20% increase in the number of participants for each Fund, but this is not a reliable indicator as an initial number of participants has not been established.\r\n\r\nI would recommend including metrics that allow for a more objective and detailed assessment of the proposal's success.

I greatly appreciate the townhall meetings. They've helped me so much in the early stage of becoming a CA. The proposal accurately represents this challenge.

I can't really see any fault for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because the Townhall meetings are already present and the proposal's purpose is to maintain the meetings and give structure to the community group leading I find it hard to believe this proposal won't succeed.

A well-thought-out proposal that takes an innovative approach to supporting the important onboarding work that this team is already successfully doing. A treasury, managed by them,  enables them to respond quickly to the onboarding needs of their communities, and to take an integrated approach rather than trying to tackle different aspects of the challenge in isolation. And the fact that they see the proposal as a way to \"pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management reporting\" means the proposal could lead to important learning for the wider Catalyst community too.\r\nIt's also positive that the project is led by people from its target communities, who have direct understanding of the kinds of barriers they are seeking to address. It's really important for this challenge that this kind of on-the-ground organising is rewarded, as it's what makes meaningful onboarding possible\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes. The team is diverse, and has a really good set of skills and experience between them. The breakdown of  daily/weekly/monthly activities is clearly already working. Perhaps it would have been good to include a couple of milestones towards the 20% increased onboarding that they are aiming for, and how they might recalibrate if they find at the halfway point that it's not growing as they hoped; but this is not a huge issue, as they clearly *are* working in a very responsive way.  The budget is  clear, appropriate, and broken down to an appropriate level. I also like the approach of calculating full cost-recovery and then giving a \"discount\" \u2013 it is illuminating to see the real value of the work that's being done. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes. I think the approach of having one, simple, overall KPI (20% participation growth), that addresses the project's and the challenge's aims very directly, is a good one for this project.
