Over time i can envision langbassadors becoming the go-to translation service for Cardano and Catalyst content providers and I well worth funding to continue this experiment so we can see how much growth can be achieved over e next 12 months.\r\nI have spent the past few years running multi country ERP rollout programs so appreciate and have first hand experience of how language can very easily become a barrier to success, thankfully it is easily solved if specific efforts are made to address the language issues. \r\nAs a potential addition to the roadmap the proposer might want to reach out to other content providers (eg Catalyst school) or reach out the the catalyst circle to get a rounded community view of how to take this important piece of work to the next level.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a project lead i like to keep thing simple when both developing project briefs and delivering projects. you will often hear me say 'show me , don't tell me' or 'make a list , do the list'. evidence/data is key.\r\nThis project provides all of the above. A simple to understand tracking system (see trello/kanban board in the roadmap) and a set of videos as a POC.\r\nThe budget is broken down sufficiently that it is easy to understand the proposer thought process.

The techniques suggested (simplifying and summarising, using mind-mapping) make the material accessible, which will increase the likelihood of impact. However, although the videos will undoubtedly inform people, it's impossible to know if they will necessarily lead to the practical onboarding that this challenge demands.

We can audit how many videos are produced, and how many unique people view them; and, because they are on Youtube, there might be some qualitative info in the comments so we can assess in an ad-hoc way if people find the videos helpful. However, the ultimate focus of this challenge is  on people going on to participate meaningfully in Catalyst, watch Town Halls, vote, become proposers or CAs, etc; and there is no consistent way to assess either whether this happens at all, or, if it does, whether it is a direct result of the videos.

Regarding the Audibility Note : Education is a long term process, but since we need to start with the basics the content created will remain relevant for years to come. Once enough content is created you can start doing marketing towards language groups that are ready for it. But we are at step one of a long process, just like the development of Cardano itself took and takes years to complete. In 2017 there were no ( short term ) parameters of success to be shown for Cardano itself. With educational programs it is similar. Either you think that the whole world will suddenly speaks english on an expert level, or you acknowledge that education and content needs to be translated in order to reach mass adoption. We have our POC which can limit the cost / animation drastically, since we know no immediate ground breaking results can be expected short term. Education is a long term investment, not a Dapp wth clear MVP and short term success."}], "solution": "SNC\u30e9\u30f3\u30b0\u30d0\u30b5\u30c0\u30fc\u306f\u3001\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u308210\u306e\u8a00\u8a9e\u3067\u30ca\u30ec\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u308c\u305f8\u3064\u306e\u30dd\u30c3\u30c9\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u4f5c\u6210\u3057\u3001\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\u30ce\u3078\u306e\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u306a\u53c2\u52a0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3092\u6559\u3048\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "Rik\u306f1991\u5e74\u306b\u7d4c\u6e08\u5b66\u4fee\u58eb\u53f7\u3092\u53d6\u5f97\u3057\u300125\u5e74\u9593\u306eB to B\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u30b9\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u30686\u5e74\u9593\u306e\u8d77\u696d\u5bb6\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306e\u7d4c\u9a13\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066Fund 5\u306e\u53d7\u8cde\u8005\u3067\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
