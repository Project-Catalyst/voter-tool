However, there are some aspects which made me think: \r\na) I would like to know how the attendance during these four months (since April) looks like, meaning, how are these meetings growing through time. Can we correlate the number of participants in these meetings with the people who are already participating in other sides of the community (voting, proposing, assessing, etc); how is this project likely to bring people from the community which is not engaged.\r\nb) Let's assume that the people attending these meetings are the people who already participate in some way in the Cardano Community. In this case, is there a way to make sure, or at least be aware of, that the subjects of the meetings are permissible for people willing to engage? I imagine that if people who already has some sort of knowledge are attending every week, the level of the meetings tent to become higher through time and, therefore, the meetings itself becoming more frightening for newcomers.\r\nc) If we scale up a little bit, lets say 10K+ participants, how are we going to menage this \u2013 maybe start thinking about transform these meetings, that need a team now to organize everything, to become independent. Furthermore, maybe creating a team (just to introduce the idea) in the east hemisphere to be more time zone friendly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- The proposal is well written and, since it's already running, it's clear that is feasible. My only concern is in the scalability and plurality of the engagement. \r\nIt's seems to need some team members to make it happen today. I imagine that maybe it would make this proposal cooler if there was a plan to make this autonomous. E.g.: I'm thinking about the meetings happen by themselves (some sort of environment that the community could release some themes and vote to create a meeting; some rooms to newcomers with some sort of content and some 'mentor' that is chosen randomly (whoever wants to participate in some content put their names and he/she would be selected to organize and help newcomers e.g.)).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- I think that the proposal would gain if there was a way to confront the number of people who are already engaged with the community with those who are participating in the weekly meetings. This way we would know if we are engaging the inert members from the community. \r\nE.g.: Fund5 = 1k members participating in total; Between F5 and 6 \u2013 1.2K in meetings (not necessarily every week, but in total); F6 = 1.2K+ participants.\r\n- Besides, having these numbers may help the advertising: We will know if we are always achieving the same people or getting into new (old) members.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Part of impact and feasiblity note is about hypothetical things in the far future and in regards to the entry barrier of newcomers or scalability, we always have an onboarding room or topics of different levels."}, {"q0": "The proposal outlines a very decent blueprint for increasing community engagement and involvement with Project Catalyst.
