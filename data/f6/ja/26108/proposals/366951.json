This proposal also lacks a detailed plan for this and potential additional funds. Overall, this proposal is missing some critical information that can allow me to judge its implemention.

Which from my perspective it's missing. As a big project of two hundred thousand dollars, it would be reasonable to start gradually by phase, and with a target of a specific country, after what an evaluation of the pilot project will be conducted and from the outcome and learnings, try to expand by adjusting what didn't work well on that stage.\r\nThe budget is not detailed, and a big portion is allocated to the salary of Senior Developers.
