The solution proposed - Employment Contract Dapp is possible to remedy the problem but some kind of background legal enforcement should be in place before that. \r\nThe lack of formal work contracts bad practice is unlikely to be changed if simply a new type of digital contract is introduced as an option. The unwillingness of employees/employers to sign a paper work contract wont change if there is a new digital contract type to sign because they are unwilling to do it in first place.\r\nHowever - even the largest problems can be started to be tackled step by step. So - the Dapp idea can be a first stage in that process if it is accepted in at least 2 or 3 local employers.\r\nI would suggest the proposal to be changed after initial talks are being made with some employers that are willing to accept such an approach for electronic contracts. This would allow the smart contract to be customized to the specific needs and include for example the \"payment when work-hours are fulfilled\" or \"payment after delivery of goods\", which are very progressive ideas in principle!\r\nI would give 4 stars \"Agree\" to the impact assessment recognizing that if such a Dapp works in small scale (2-3 companies) it can work for the whole world. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately the budget, the timeline and the previous experience of the proposer at this stage doesn't really bring too much confidence. USD 600 for 20 hours of development is quite insufficient for such a task I presume. Not to mention the \"Established contact with some companies willing to use it\" stage which may well take weeks to accomplish on its own.\r\nAgain - It might be advisable to do some more work on the project and present it again to be more feasible and acceptable. Possible additions are:\r\n-establish the contacts with willing companies;\r\n-identify the needs of those companies and what could hook them to the idea;\r\n-involve at least one developer in the team to tackle the above and make a more realistic budget/timeline. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The timeline of the project implementation consists of 3 months, 6 months and 12 months from the start, but these describe the deliverables, not KPIs that can be used to keep track on the progress.

Similarly, it is clear from the Auditability Note that the timeline has been misunderstood. The timeline is does not refer to what is expected to be achieved from the money received in fund6. However, it is understandable that this is their interpretation (given that all other proposals are using the timeline in this way). I should've been much more clear on this point and perhaps not even included a long-term timeline even if doing so was recommended in the proposals guide.
