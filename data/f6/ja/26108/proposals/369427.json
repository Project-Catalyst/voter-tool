This connection can be made by it's effort to provide financial sustaining opportunities for non-profit conservation organizations in Africa. Non-profit conservation organizations tend to rely on grants and donations, though there are some that also generate sustainability through sales of merchandises, leasing of land etc. By utilizing blockchain, and what this proposal is proposing, the leveraging of NFT, done in a thoughtful and detailed manner can perhaps not just sustain but help grow those non-profit conservation organizations. This proposals effort will add various values to the Cardano ecosystem in terms of providing awareness to other non-profit organizations, NGO's and similar organizations the potential empowerment that Cardano can provide to achieving the goal of Cardano being a force for good.

Seeing the potential massive undertaking this team will face, their proposed budget is underwhelming. It is very much still in it's early stages. The budget and timetable needs to be clearly defined to maximize deliverables and minimize unexpected hurdles for again this is a huge undertaking.

Speaking with WADA, although not related with conservation efforts, might yield connections that could act as partners or collaborators in the future iterations of this proposal, which perhaps will act as validators or/and act as a great initial partner to bounce off this proposal's idea.
