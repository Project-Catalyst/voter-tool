The utilization of smart contracts running on Cardano seems like the targeted win-win-win. It will give a reason for new people to adopt Cardano, provide a much needed solution to a problem which will help the people in Africa, and the added use of the blockchain will increase value for ADA holders.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is solid and the team seems to be well experienced and up to the task. However, with the complexity that comes with such an ambitious plan, it leaves room for the possibility of unforeseen problems draining the funding and leaving the community with an unfinished project. This is my primary concern for the proposal. Additionally, I'd like to see something planned in terms of ongoing support to amend the smart contract templates as needed as laws change. I'd like to rate this 3.5 stars. I chose 4 rather than 3 in an attempt to give the team the benefit of the doubt, but 4 stars is slightly overstating my confidence that there won't be a malfunction in one of the many moving parts contained within this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a loosely defined timeline that can be used to monitor progress.
