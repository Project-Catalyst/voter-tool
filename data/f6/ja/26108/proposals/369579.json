It is a very important area for developing countries as the supply chain is highly inefficient and abuses farmers and nature. \r\n \r\nWhen I was at Earthwrom.org, I worked for a couple of years on the agriculture supply chain including coffee and I am well aware of the importance of such a solution but also of its complexity. \r\n\r\nIt is great that the proposal considers how to pilot the model, scale it in one country and then share the knowledge with other countries.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the proposal deal with a very important area, some information is missing about the feasibility of the project. \r\n\r\nIt makes sense to have two teams one traceability team and one developer team.

The team is probably the most important factor for the feasibility of the project and with general information, it is difficult to evaluate. \r\n\r\nThe plan vs. the idea makes sense and especially it is good that you start focusing on one region. I worked with many startups (i.e. mentoring at seedstarts.com or givingway.com) and focus is very important and will help to make team, plan, budget all aligned. \r\n\r\nThe budget has the main elements in it but it is difficult to assess as it does not show how ten budget was calculated.

For example, how many farmers, cooperative, and traceability entities do you plan to work within each timeframe. This will be a straightforward KPI that will help to evaluate and measure the progress.   \r\n\r\nFinally, it will be important to have a section of challenges and risks, which from my experience there are many across such a supply chain. \r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u306e\u751f\u7523\u8005\u304b\u3089\u6700\u7d42\u6d88\u8cbb\u8005\u307e\u3067\u3092\u8ffd\u8de1\u3057\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5730\u7406\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u306e\u54c1\u8cea\u3001\u8a55\u5224\u3001\u4fa1\u5024\u3092\u4fdd\u8a3c\u3059\u308b\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u3002", "experience": "\u539f\u7523\u5730\u547c\u79f0\u4fdd\u8b77\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b9\u3001\u30a8\u30c1\u30aa\u30d4\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc\u683d\u57f9\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u56fd\u969b\u8a8d\u8a3c\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30cd\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3002"}
