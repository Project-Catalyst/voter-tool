The products appears quite polished and well written although I found some of the texts for some courses to be quite expensive which I found counter intuitive.

For example each boot camp costs $15000 USD and yet KPI's to measure 5000 -10000 participants across the continent. The logistics of this do not appear in the proposal so cannot be accurately gauged to risk assess likely success.
