A YouTube/News link would help the voter visualize the problem statement. The proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. 185000 inhabitants is not a clear representation  of the number of landowners / direct users though. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A team of 4 is small. Linkedin profiles would help voters verify whether they are capable of developing and implementing this solution. I'd personally have liked to see a team member who currently is a citizen living in Burkina. Four outsiders may lack perspective. \r\nThe type and number of team members required to implement the proposal is unclear. Are the 3 externally located members going to move to Burkina Faso? If not who is going to implement the plan? \r\nI personally feel that the context part of the proposal feels judgmental. I'd have appreciated  more information in the form of source links  about the situation. Use of words like tension, insurrections, illegal, unauthorized, anarchic, and simmering social bomb certainly create a picture. Evidence is not provided to back the picture.\r\nThe budget breakdown is clear. I think the timeline is unlikely to work out. If the current government of Burkina Faso is as chaotic as stated, getting it to adapt/adjust/accommodate to a new idea in 3 months seems optimistic. As stated, land ownership is very important, closely guarded by the people of Burkina Faso. A plan for education / shifting mindsets and convincing them of the power of new technology is not given. It may come across as Berlin Conference-esq.\r\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Milestones are very clearly set out, but the timelines are unrealistic.

It is perfectly in line with the overall challenge setting and will be a first step for Cardano to be involved in Africa. It is a first test case for a land registration with Cardano and can be used for other municipalities as well. The local population could really benefit from a new land registration system as it gives them more security. Although I am from Europe, I heard that land grabbing and land registration is a wide problem in Africa (as already mentioned in the Bermuda Ted Talk of Charles Hoskinson). Therefore it is vital for Cardano to tackle this problem. And this proposal could be a first step.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team consists of four people that are partially already engaged in Project Catalyst. By looking at their resumes, they seem to provide the right knowledge to implement such a registration system. They are already engaged with governmental authorities in Burkina Faso, work with Blockchain and digital infrastructure and have (partially) management experience in bigger companies. However, it is not entirely clear how far the conversations have come already with the 3 municipalities that the team is planning to work together with. Based upon the resume of the team, I think it is likely for the team to build something with the local authorities successfully. But depending on the work of the local governance structures and the willingness to implement something new, there might be some delays. (As I heard it from other projects in different parts of Africa). A bit more clarity in the proposal regarding the collaboration with the authorities and the status quo would be therefore helpful for future assessments.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team provides clear milestones for 1, 3 and 6 month that seem reasonable. They even included a longer term outlook what they want to achieve in two years. It will be relatively clear to see if they reached their milestones in the first phase. But these are rather soft metrics to measure (like if they registered the COOP in Burkina Faso) or if they have first employees. The hard KPIs (such as the number of land registrations and number of collaborations with municipalities) will be more relevant down the road. What is missing in the proposal is to address potential risks. What could delay collaborations with municipalities? How many contacts does the team already have with the respective governmental structures? Are there opposing political interests that don't want a better land registration? Have there been previous attempts to change the bureaucratic system? All of the culture and political concerns are not sufficiently addresses in this proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_380", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This is pretty good idea. As an African, I know for sure that land conflict is a real issue in of African. I think that this proposal, if executed properly, can represent the start of a global viable solution in all Africa. This proposal  has its place in this challenge. This project can benefit africa and can add value to the cardano ecosystem. African will win by having the solution of the land distrinution issue, and the cardano ecosystem will win by being recognised as the best blockchain.

Great that you start the pilot in one location and clear idea for the next locations. \r\n\r\nThe budget seems reasonable for the first 12 months but more details about each line would have been helpful to see how you got each amount.
