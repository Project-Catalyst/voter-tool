The team have created a beautiful website to populate with stories of Cardano success in Africa. Having people on the ground actively reporting on adoption and use cases will be inspiring and satisfying. One of the 'success metrics' described in the F6 challenge is - Cardano is considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa. Well presented media will definitely contribute to this goal.\r\nKeeping the community engaged and educated is paramount in all of our success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team have shown commitment by already creating a well designed website and one very inspiring video on their/our mission to grow Cardano adoption in Africa.\r\nThis team has had a project funded in previous rounds and delivered a Cardano conference in West Africa. \r\nLooking at the work that has gone into their previous project and the beginnings of this one it seems that the team is committed. It appears feasible that they will be able to deliver but they have not outlined any specific stories they plan to cover/promote.
