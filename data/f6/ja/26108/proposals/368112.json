Goals intended also coincide with the potential entry points of Cardano's use case though Atala PRISM, which would potentially act as a gateway for end-users to perhaps copy and upgrade this business model, or develop something else altogether.

At the very least years of experience of some sort unfortunately has not been provided. Although all their attachments indicates they have a potential business model or the sense of it, after reading through time and time again, no mentioning of the proposer details are fleshed out. One would expect since it seems that the majority of the work would be contracted out and not team-based, their would be an emphasis showing experience in project management, this proposal unfortunately again falls short. The type and in-depth number of contractors are also not identified clearly enough therefore assessing the selected contractors is not possible. Budget wise, sufficient breakdown is not provided, therefore assessing whether it is reasonable unfortunately becomes a guestimate. This also trickles down to various other pressure points, even down to identifying challenges and risk.
