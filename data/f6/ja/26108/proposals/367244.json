This way would be through an application, as I understand it, in which the products would be tracked by token, and the main objective would be to make the purchase and sale of such products more direct, because according to what is said the large number intermediaries between a product and its consumer is one of the factors that make things more expensive on the continent. Therefore, creating a more direct way of marketing would certainly benefit the local population, and engaging token, blockchain and ada would add value to the Cardano ecosystem in Africa.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We know who the 3 team members are in a very detailed way, while they have attached the link to their linkedin profiles in the proposal.

Therefore, it is very solid that the team is aware of the project's needs, in addition to the fact that one of the members of the fixed team (Mearaf Tadewos) is a developer, and details the project in a very technical way. In this way, a lot of confidence and credibility is given to the team, which demonstrates that it has the knowledge and ability to manage the next hired and, therefore, carry out a successful project.

In this respect, it is well on the target of the challenge and well done on the initiative. \r\n\r\nWhen I was at Earthwrom.org, I worked for a couple of years on a related model for Indonesia but also evaluated other locations including in Africa such as Ivory Cost. I am well aware of the importance of such a solution but also of its complexity. Therefore, I think the problem and the solution should have much more details to show that you fully analyzed the challenge. \r\n\r\nHaving adoptions by the farmers, overcoming logistics (certification, packaging, storing, and transfer, product quality, organic vs not organic), and selling to B2B clients, different types of agriculture products, nationally and internationally is quite a complex ecosystem. It is not clear from the solution how you are going to approach those issues in your plan and where is your key focus.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal suggests that stage 1 is to have market research with clients to understand their needs and discuss with them possible solutions. This is a very important step and I believe the proposal should have focused mainly on this part for now. Without this analysis, it is difficult to plan the next stages and define the product which in my view is still not very clear. \r\n\r\nBeing a mentor for startups (i.e. with seedstars.com, GivingWay.com) I do believe more analysis is needed to give confidence that the plan is feasible.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the budget well done for aiming to raise part of the budget from other sources as well as aiming to become profitable. However, the budget plan for me is also not clear, why for example the first 3 months focus on legal consulting and quality assurance? And how it connected to stage 1 in the overall plan? The separation of the budget to 3,6 and 12 months is not clear. For example: \"customer service officer $8,500 for 12 months\" does it mean that the position starts at the first month and for 12 months? If yes, than the 3 months budget should include also this item. This is relevant for all the other expenses. \r\n\r\nFinally, key team members seem great with complimentary experience (good to have the LinkedIn profile). It would have been helpful to have more information in the proposal about each one, position, and relevant experience for the proposal. \r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "You wrote in the proposal that \"Fortunately enough, risks in the space are quite a few and at the minimum level, most likely not to happen.\"  I am not sure how you got to this conclusion as I do believe there are many risks around agriculture supply chains, starting with one of the key challenges you are trying to solve which is reducing the number of middlemen. Those middlemen normally provide logistics, cash flow, sales, or agriculture supporting products (seeds, chemicals) which are not easy to replace in such a complex supply chain.  \r\n\r\nDeliverable could be clearer. For example, what does it mean mass scaling (customers, the volume of products sold, use of technology, range of products)? \r\nIt is not clear what are the deliverable and metrics after 3, 6 or 12 months.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Cardano\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u306eWeb\u30a2\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3068Telegram\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3088\u308bB2B\u30b5\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3002", "experience": "Full-Stack & Mobile App Eng, tested Plutus playground, B.SC in Computer Science, 4.5 years, key connections.Solidity\u306e\u30b9\u30de\u30fc\u30c8\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30c8\u3002"}
