It seems that some groundwork has been laid with the already established projects from the consortium. The system is probably very well thought out already.

Is someone validating those data points and if yes how? \r\n\r\n- questionable: website hummingbird tech makes claims about \"regenerative agriculture  data science\" and then shows images of monoculture and deep ploughing below! This doesn't fit together and makes me wonder how well the proposers understand the term regenerative agriculture.\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRationale given for score:\r\nToo many open questions for me to correctly assess impact, the effect on challenge respectively.

It feels like the whole downstream incentive mechanism could be sliced into at least two proposals: incentives structure for independent/small scale (more easy to enact change) food processors; and; (gamified) incentive structure for consumers; or sth similar.

But, if the proposers really want to have a true impact on Africa (and with Africa, in the hole world) they will have to put a lot of soil in their code.

Because, actual consumers (for conscience reasons) and retailers (for competition reasons) in the cities already are delighted with the idea, the interface, the tecnology, the philosophy, the major and beautiful purpose.
