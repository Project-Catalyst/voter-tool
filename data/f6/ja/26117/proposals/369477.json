The milestones consist of research on, education and documentation of possible threats and providing this information to the community to support general knowledge of all and targeting SPOs specifically. It seems that this could support overall participation of community members. However, there is little information on how the team would want to implement outreach effectively - will they have their own communication and networking channels or bundle existing ones - and if so, through which repository would they communicate their links to SPOs and community members? More actionable steps would benefit this proposal to understand how they want to achieve outreach and SPO participation. Generally, looking up what exists and bundling those information would help SPOs to get access to critical information. However, some other proposals also want to provide information, it would be important that the funded teams connect with each other for the best results. The milestone to engage more community members to initiate proposals for this field is very relevant. The funding has a category that is not mentioned specifically in the proposal: \"Recovery Test Support\" so I\u00b4m not sure what that is referring to, since \"Compile all disaster recovery protocols and proposals\" is mentioned under \"documentation\". It would be good to specify actionable steps more precisely.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditable is the goal to enhance participation through proposals, to document and to offer educational workshops.

The statement is not completely up to date since it mentioned there it Challenge only had 6 proposals, but more were submitted after that. But it really is a problem as mentioned. The proposed solution to create workshops and raise the awareness of the community about the topics aims at having at least 50 proposals in the same challenge in F7, but it does not take into consideration that the submission week is only a few weeks after the results of F6 are disclosed, which could lower the impact of this proposal. It also mentions some of the KPIs that would be tracked and they make sense to the Challenge, and since this would be a focused solution to a specific problem, there seems to be no need to mention something about the proposal's sustainability in the long term.

Although, it does not mention if the solution would be executed by him only or by a team. This would also be important to evaluate the required budget since only lump sums are presented and it does not mention with more details how the money would be spent. Also, there is no roadmap presented, just some bullet points regarding the expected topics to be addresses after funded, and it seems like the proposer would have a very short period of time to deliver what he is proposing, since the submission week for F7 closes only a few weeks after the F6 results are announced, and this would make it very difficult to execute everything in time and to achieve the desired outcome.

The proposer mentions some metrics and KPIs, which could help with measuring the outcomes of this proposal.
