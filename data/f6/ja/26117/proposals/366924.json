In this way, they are prepared and damaged can be controlled.

Not to belittle other proposals that tackle just limited aspects of a challenge, but I think that that a proposal that looks at the entire picture is often a better fit - as it tries to look at comprehensive solutions. That is difficult, but ultimately more rewarding for the Cardano ecosystem. The Cardano-Heartbeat (CEM) proposal is one of those proposals that leaves a very strong impression upon reading it. I think that the team correctly identified basic (but at the same time major) issues that will plague the ragtag band of Cardano SPOs around the world: power failure, network disruptions & hardware failure - and many SPOs are probably not prepared for these events. A global financial operating system must have redundancies inbuilt and must have addressed basic issues such as these. I like the clarity that the proposing team has in its approach and the proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through the Critical Event Management (CEM) Platform that will provide early notification of relevant threats, automation of incident response activities and resiliency protocol, a rapid recovery of SPOs and even providing assurance to delegators. This is in essence a wide-ranging and comprehensive response to the challenge that aims to help SPOs to a put disaster recovery strategies in place to maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disruption. The team proposes to develop their Critical Event Management Platform (based on differing technologies and data) in a way that will automate processes. The idea to base everything on an established framework such as the a Threat & Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment & Stakeholder Preparedness Review (THIRA/SPR assessment) is excellent, as it eliminates improvisation and needs to be completed by a certified TEEX Infrastructure Protection Professional. The Cardano Heartbeat CEM will become a  mass notification system, a perfect addition to the network of SPOs. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I don't know whether to start addressing the team or the plan first, as both left a favourable impression on me. In short that would mean that I think it is fully feasible. Just to give a small flavour of the team - it includes (as the define themselves) - five independent SPOs, DevOps, Full-Stack Devs, IT specialists, FEMA Infrastructure Protection, Data Analysts, Entrepreneurs, and Educators. The right mix for a challenge of this scope. The proposers have included references confirming their status. What is more interesting (although the team is an interesting bunch) is the comprehensive plan that they presented. They have clearly thought out the development of the Cardano Heartbeat Critical Event Management System (CEM) by envisaging that their system will include all three critical components for such a system (Risk Analysis, Mass notification system and  Incident management/recovery). The team also presented an extensive list of specific and clearly delineated short-term (3-month) deliverables and a similar list of long-term 6-months from funding deliverables. Plus they plan to make the Finalized SPO Disaster Recovery Plans available freely to the public. Some other lon-term consideration have been included, such as the possibility of issuing Validation Tokens/NFT for SPOs who meet a defined set of standards for Stake Pool operation - which is a great idea for a utility NFT. The detailed budget seems realistic for the proposed scope of work and the product that they intend to deliver. I think the timetables are realistic and the team will be able to develop APIs to gather ad-hoc data feeds for information about: Cardano nodes and network health, Weather Data, Critical Infrastructure, Natural Disaster warnings, Cybersecurity threats... I'd love to see this project realized for the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal seems clearly auditable and has a well-thought out roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. The metrics are well linked to the proposed success of the proposal. The team does have a very good general understanding of the potential threats and issues that could hamper operations of SPOs in a variety of adverse scenarios. The proposed plan to conduct Cardano Stake Pool Resilience and Security Survey Quizes will help them to get an even better understanding of the sitation on the ground. Essentially, I think they understand the task ahead and are proposing a feasible project that will strengthen the Cardano network and the resilience of every single stakepool operator that takes part in some form. The proposed solution seems to be right on the money. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 10, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The problem description and solution make sense and are within the scope of the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe proposal described a very complete approach to risk assessment, taking into account a survey in the SPO community and the development of a multi-risk monitoring model, which would allow greater community coordination for risk identification and decision-making.\r\n\r\nSeveral deliverables/targets were presented that indicate challenging impact.
