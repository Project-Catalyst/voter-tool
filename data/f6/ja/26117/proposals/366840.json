But regardless of whether this situation is commonplace or an eventual disaster, I believe the main idea is to ensure the resilience of the SPOs, so there is a relationship with the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is within the items established in the challenge brief.\r\n\r\nI believe the number of 5 SPOs is a small sample to identify bottlenecks and problems on the African continent. If the idea is to carry out a comprehensive local assessment, I believe that the number of participating SPOs should be greater.\r\n\r\nI understand that the stage of data collection and monitoring of SPOs specifically in Africa is desirable to understand local risks and particularities, but the results of this will be public and may benefit SPOs in situations analogous to the African continent, so I think it would be more advantageous to expand participation in the post-monitoring phases to enable a collaborative effort by the entire community.\r\nSeveral places around the world have infrastructure problems similar to those seen in Africa and I believe they could also benefit from this proposal. The tools, data and reports in this proposal could be used by SPOs in similar infrastructure conditions to that observed, both in Africa and on other continents with similar conditions. Limiting the proposal's scope in Africa decreases the proposal's potential impact on the community.\r\n\r\nThe goals established in the roadmap are relevant to the challenge and the metrics are good impact indicators. I would recommend including KPIs and considering that reports, tests and tools will be produced, these items could be used to estimate KPIs and improve the impact assessment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposers described experiences relevant to the proposal's implementation.
