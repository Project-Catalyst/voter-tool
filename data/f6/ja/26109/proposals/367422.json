By using rewards as the collateral, stakers are swapping their ADA stake return for unsecured micro lending returns, whilst preserving their capital. I would like to see some information on how stakers are guaranteed that actually get the micro-lending returns. Is this just done off chain on trust or through a smart contract?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are already involved in this space and have linked up with SPO's thus are likely to be able to deliver. The proposal is relatively simple with clear deliverables. It would be good to see more information on how returns/defaults etc on the micro-loans will be communicated to stakers.

Where are the 2 raspberry pi's going to be stored, for such a high value system i'd want better infrastructure than 2 pi's. Perhaps more server redundancy, devops, continuous integration and deployment. 270M Ada staked from a partnership seems to be significant risk if one or both pies went down.
