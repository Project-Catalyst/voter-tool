If Cardano can have one which is better than other competitors it will drive users here. The proposer believes there are a number of issues with current and proposed DEX's. He intends to further research solutions to some of these issues and build a better solution. The proposal itself could be more concise and the flaws of other exchanges and proposed solutions clearly stated at the beginning rather than starting with a glossary of terms. It takes a long time to get to what the proposal will do, and even then it in not 100% clear the proposer has the solutions clear in his mind.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is obviously highly motivated by this problem, already expending effort on the solution. He has great background on the subject matter, though it is less clear he has the technical expertise to code up a robust real-time trading platform. I have a similar background in trading at large investment banks, quantitative finance degrees and a PhD in Robotics and AI and understand what he is trying to achieve, however the proposal lacks some clarity which worries me in terms of his ability to deliver such a complex project on time and within budget. Some of the core problems he wishes to solve are still open research question, thus successful delivery cannot be considered highly likely. Perhaps a smaller research proposal to research the best solutions to the problems outlined would be a better first step and more likely of being funded?\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has clear aims for what it wants to produce, which are thus auditable.

The proposal tackles low capital efficiency, high impermanent loss and concurrency with novel Algorithmic Automated Market Making (AAMM) protocol dynamically adjusting to the market. Such approach looks different than porting of existing ETH solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano ecosystem will benefit with easier and more friendly Liquidity Providing then competition which can in turn attract more DeFi oriented users.\r\n\r\nThe key metrics are indirect (not measurable), such as powerful solutions to the issues ETH based DeFi faces, as well as ports of these to Cardano. Due to the impact the proposal can make, I will not deduct from the score lack of metrics. It would be beneficial to add anticipated savings, or other value that would describe why this solution is superior.\r\n\r\nCardano can only benefit from such novel solutions built from the ground up in a better way.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has demonstrated extreme and detailed knowledge for this development, presented public YouTube interview as well as current state of the DEX development.\r\n\r\nThe proposer is also an highly educated individual with sufficient skills and experience to deliver.\r\n\r\nThe presented plan is reasonable, both in scope and budget.

It would be beneficial to see the potential roadblocks and ways to mitigate them, such as wrong time estimates, unexpected problems or similar.\r\n\r\nExpansion on the Metrics/KPI to measure the success would be beneficial, such as expected number of users or value saved in global sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, the progress can be audited based on milestones to be achieved (1-3-6-12) so no points will be deducted.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_160", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 4, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "DEXes are essential part of DeFi ecosystem on every blockchain.

Observing sites like defipulse.com it is possible to attest to the fact that the TVL (total value locked) of DEXs is already over $10 billion dollars, indicating the great potential of this niche in DeFi and blockchains in general, so the concept has great potential and alignment with the challenge.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that DEXs that use the constant-function market maker model are excellent to provide liquidity to those who want to use a DEX to do swaps, but sacrifice LPs (liquidity providers) due to impermanent loss.\r\n\r\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bbringing in alternative models to mitigate impermanent loss is welcome and can benefit LPs(liquidity providers) and create alternative models.\r\n\r\nIt is also important that solutions have been identified for the concurrency problem, as the development of DEXs on Cardano brings programming paradigms different from those on Ethereum, this is due to the EUTXO model inherent to Cardano.\r\n\r\nOverall, the proposal seeks to resolve different inefficiencies in the DeFi market, such as those present in the AMM-CFMM, order book model and arbitration models. These market niches are extremely relevant and important to DeFi.\r\n\r\nThe goals described in the timeline are within the deadline established in the challenge, but KPIs/metrics that can properly measure the impact through numbers were not included.
