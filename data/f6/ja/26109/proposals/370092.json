The proposer has not explained in their proposal but linked to a medium article. It appears it is a simple smart contract where the freelancer tells the client they have done part of a job and the client approves and releases or transfers funds. What does this add over the freelancer and client simply sending funds directly to a wallet at each stage? Is it that total funds are held in escrow first? What if there is an issue, who mediates to release escrowed funds from the smart contract or are they locked there in perpetuity? It would be good to have a clearer explanation of the benefits to both sides using this contract.
