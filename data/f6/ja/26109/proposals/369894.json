The pressing question however is, is there a demand for home and auto loans on Cardano. As this is not even delivering that, but a stepping stone below. Why not trial in an individual state first and se if the product has demand, before building templates for 50 states? Would these be denominated in USD, or ADA (which could get very risky for borrowers if ADA increases significantly over the duration of the loan)? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has great domain experience, though it is less clear they have the programming experience to deliver that side.

Perhaps more could be done on defining and measuring success. $59,000 seems like a lot of money to deliver a project who's success id defined by the delivery of a workshop, some tutorial and some templates.

It's not clear that the team has the experience to create the templates in Plutus, I recommend more details about that as well.\r\n\r\nA budget breakdown was presented and is associated with different stages of the project, but it is unclear how these resources will be used, there is no association of the budget by workload or by employees, which makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of the requested budget.\r\n\r\nThe budget mentions the allocation of 2,000 USD for website and YouTube channel, but there is no information on how or why a website will be created.\r\n\r\nThe budget also cites the allocation of 14,500USD for \"Project direction\", what does project direction involve?\r\n\r\nConsidering that the proposal is requesting almost 25% of the total budget for the challenge, it is important to be clearer.\r\n\r\nThe project implementation timeline is reasonable, but the deliverables described do not meet the challenge objective.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Problem and solution presented make sense, but they are not aligned with the challenge.
