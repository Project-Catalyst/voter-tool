Given the magnitude of the funding requested, it would be good to have some evidence of this experience, perhaps linked-in profiles? The proposal is very breif. More detail should be provided on exactly what will be delivered. What is the Panther MvP they will be integrating into. Which chains will be linked to Cardano? The first 4 months is set as define scope. Perhaps a much small project should be proposed to do this, and once it is defined come back in another round for the remained of the funding to deliver it. Without a defined scope it is hard to state this is highly likely to be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Significantly more detail is required to audit thee progress of this proposal .
