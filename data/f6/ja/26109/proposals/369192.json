The solution presented is reasonable and is within the context of the challenge.\r\n\r\nCardano is currently starting to use smart contracts on mainnet and oracles will be essential to the viability of several Cardano DeFi dapps. There is few public information about the development of oracles on Cardano and the limited information available (such as the partnership with Wolfram Alpha, the oracle pools model adopted by Ergo and independent projects such as Charli3) indicates a need for advancement/development in this field, therefore this proposal theoretically has a very positive impact potential.\r\n\r\nThere is a technical rationale for the concept of Milkomeda oracle and the use of sidechains to enable the use of oracles that already exist in Ethereum, but there are no deadlines for project implementation, nor goals or metrics that allow the evaluation of the impact/utilization of this project.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the dcSpark team describe the plan in more detail as per the template set out in the Catalyst documentation.

I know the trio of dcSpark founders due to their popularity and importance in the Cardano community (Nico, Sebastien and Robert) and they are extremely qualified to develop this proposal. dcSpark has hired developers/engineers, such as Nicolas di Prima, and has assembled a team with experts able to develop projects in Plutus and in the EUTxO model.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is extremely important that this type of information is properly informed in the proposal itself, so that community advisors and the community in general have easy access and can make their assessments in an informed and transparent manner.\r\n\r\nThere is no detail on budget breakdown and considering the relatively high amount required by the proposal(50% of the budget for this challenge) it is essential that there is a detailed budget.\r\n\r\nThere is no comprehensive plan for implementing the proposal, no roadmap, metrics, KPIs.\r\n\r\nThere is a technical rationale for how the protocol works at a high level, but a risk assessment has not been described. The use of several hops and second layers to transmit critical data such as the data used by oracles in DeFi needs to be accompanied by a rationale of pros and cons. Every oracle has a balance of incentives and a mechanism to ensure data integrity, such as slashing/reputation.\r\n\r\nEvery DeFi dapp is as secure and decentralized as its price feed provider, so I think it's important to address what mechanism will ensure data integrity.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a problem/solution description consistent with the challenge, the concept of the proposal is reasonable, but the absence of a detailed plan greatly affects the auditability of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThere is no roadmap, no metrics, no budget breakdown, no KPIs.
