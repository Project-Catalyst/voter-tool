Dapps like DEXs don't require an oracle. Some smart contracts require off-chain data feeds would be an appropriate definition.\r\n\r\nAre data feeds expensive? That's a subjective statement. Expensive compared to what?\r\n\r\nA data feed can be cheap. it depends on the security, liveness, decentralization and resilience needs of the desired oracle.\r\n\r\nI recommend the correction of the problem statement in order to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nAn oracle is an essential element of a functioning DeFi ecosystem, so the proposal is within the scope of the challenge. \r\nThe goals are in line with the challenge, but the absence of an estimated use of price feeds in the first 6 months makes the impact assessment less objective towards the challenge brief. The target of 1000 dapps using price feeds doesn't establish a period to be reached.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is little information about the team in the proposal. On the website there is information about 3 team members, but there is no information about qualification for smart contract development in Plutus. The CTO seems to have an understanding of the EUTXO model, but that's just my impression watching him speak in the interview. I recommend more clarity about the team's experience in developing smart contracts on Plutus and whether the team participated in the Plutus Pioneer Program or Alonzo's testnets.\r\n\r\nThere is no budget breakdown, which makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of the budget, but from what I could understand, the budget will be used to subsidize the maintenance and updates of price feeds by the team. For transparency purposes I think it's important to say that the team held an IDO with Cardstarter, but I couldn't find information on the website or on Medium about how much money was raised.\r\n\r\nI believe the team needs to provide more information regarding risks, technical aspects and transparency.\r\n\r\nThe team did not address the risks inherent in oracle protocols. Every dapp that requires price feeds is as secure and resilient as its oracle. What would be the estimated cost of an attack on nodes? I couldn't find information about this in the whitepaper or in the attached video. In the video, the intention to implement a slashing/reputation model was mentioned, but there is no estimate for this, so the feasibility of the proposal is in question. Providing price feeds by itself is not a complete metric, you also need metrics to assess uptime and security, as an attack on the oracle could harm several dapps that are using the price feeds.\r\nThe project's CTO stated in the interview that only the team is running the nodes, so the security of any dapp depends on trusting the Charli3 team, which is far from ideal and centralized. There is no resilience in using an oracle if there is only one price feed provider.\r\nOne of the problems that staking-based oracles have is that the cost of an attack will be associated with the market capitalization of the tokens used as collateral. Because of this, oracles that have low market cap cannot guarantee security for dapps with high market cap, as there is an imbalance of incentives that allows an attacker to gain influence in the network by obtaining nodes and making a stake. If the attacker has the majority of nodes and identifies some dapp that has dependence on Charli3 as a source of price feeds and this dapp has a high value allocated in contracts, there will be an incentive for attacks.\r\nIt is important to note that there is a prototype in development and the CTO mentioned that once the prototype is ready they will look to create a community.\r\nIt is not clear from the whitepaper what the incentive for a data provider is and without an incentive there is no way to create a robust and decentralized oracle network.\r\n It is also unclear whether the project will have problems with concurrencym. I couldn't find information about his or any other team member's qualifications in Haskkel/Plutus.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is clarity in the purpose of the proposal and alignment with the challenge, I just recommend modifying the problem and solution statement to reflect the points I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nI believe that the metrics/KPIs are not enough to indicate the success of the proposal.
