The author understands the need to explain the relationship between his proposal and the Distributed Decision Making challenge, and he provides an adequate justification. I believe that the need for this explanation comes from the difficulties found in contemporary society for constituencies (and leaders) to understand and capitalize on the value of information products for decision making and on the necessity for data gathering and processing for information production. One would expect that it would not be necessary to explain this in the realm of blockchain technologies and within the \"science-oriented\" Cardano ecosystem, but it is not only necessary to reiterate it but also, to actually execute, as the author is proposing here. The author clearly understands these issues, is competent, motivated, and shows profound engagements with Cardano and Catalyst. In my opinion, the proposal demonstrates that it understands the issue, that the author can deliver on the desired products, and that these products can contribute to improving distributed decision-making for Project Catalyst and for Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes. In his proposal, the author demonstrates the experience, competence, and interest to execute the project satisfactorily. Besides, the budget is adequately estimated.

This suggestion clearly exceeds the scope of the proposal, hopefully, well taken, the author can make the most of this recommendation without exceeding his commitments to its execution.

It would be of great value for the community to use part of this challenge to allow Victor to take the time to look for the most relevant possible variables to measure and to create visuals that will be easy to understand.

Documentation via GitHub and maybe the landing page as proposed would give access to all community members.

I wonder if its scalable to also include text data analyisis to check if any insight comes from it. how the size from approved proposal differs from the size of not approved? what are the keywords that a good proposal has that wll rated by CA and accepeted by voters? how a technical proposal differs from a more non-technical in terms of rates, number of assessments, voters, etc?
