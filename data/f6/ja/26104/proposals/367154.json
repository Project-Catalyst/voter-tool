The proposal seeks to help build a qualified set of advisors that can apply pre-filtering of the ever-growing number of proposals that will be coming through Catalyst.  This will help with the consumption and simplify the decision making for the general voter.  The only concern is that the process of pruning ideas/proposals to give to others will impart some of the bias of those SMEs/deciders.  This could impart an undesired response in the system and skew the flow of ADA to projects that may or may not have been naturally chosen.  This idea has a lot fo merit, but so much care would be needed to take to ensure that this doesn't become something like described.  If done right though, this could make the whole proposal a great value add to Catalyst", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is very little noted in this proposal that descirbes the how's and what's will needed to be done to build this system.  On the other hand this proposal consists of many of the current curators of proposals (CA's and vCA's) who have expereience with monitoring, tracking, and pruning the ideas. They definitely have been part of the past Fund proposals and can take that experience to build a system.  More details about how they build the application and the choice selection of everything would help to give an understanding of what funding would do for them.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned previously, the big thing is that there is little details about the how's and what's they will do.

While it is definitely important to develop the way that proposals are assessed and ensure that voters have access to \"good\" proposals, channeling proposals through a non-profit team instead of making all proposals equally accessible to all voters is actively limiting decentralisation. The proposing team does not address the risks that come with pre-selecting proposals for voters - how would they avoid bias and/or corruption? The risk of pre-selecting proposals as a group instead of an open community is not considered in the proposal. It is highly likely that this would be in favor of the selected proposals and it is important that the group addresses this issue and gives a clear statement on measurements that will be taken to avoid these risks. The objectives why it would be good to move away from decentralized structures and transferring them to a small team are imperative but are missing. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Relevant experience is limited to being a CA, vCA \"or other\" and the team itself does not provide information about their background with Catalyst or further qualifications. The team itself is numbered as 10-25 - which is again very broad. The plan presented is not broken down in actionable steps or milestones or a financial budget plan. The team gives different information throughout the proposal. The proposers say that they would want to allow everybody to participate as a CA but further down in the proposal they suggest they might limit the number of CAs based on budget decisions. If the number of CAs is limited, decentralization is limited as well and bias is more likely. The proposal itself does not provide all necessary information that is required - if the aim of this team is to present proposals in a better way - this proposal should already be designed very coherently and most importantly with all information that is required. The budget for this proposal is 2/3 of the funding for this challenge without giving any detailed information on how this will be distributed further.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "At the moment with the lack of information provided and the very short time frame of 1-3 months the proposers have set up, auditability is not feasable. The team has not given milestones or actionable steps that they aim to reach in this timeframe. The team is not yet set up, information and experience of the current team is missing, rewards for assessments are not yet broken down. The proposal would be more auditable if the team would provide some relevant numbers: how many CAs will be included in the first trial? How many proposals are going to be presented to the voters? Most important - how does the team itself define success and (!) who will choose the proposals that will be presented to the voters? How will they avoid bias in choosing proposals through an established group in comparison to a whole community and a decentralized assessment phase? How to avoid corruption if a team instead of a community is responsible for picking out proposals to present to the voters? The team does not reflect on the risks of wanting to present some instead of all of the proposals to the voters. What are the key metrics to decide which proposals voters would want to see? For this proposal, it would be important additionally to have access to voters through a questionnaire or any other measurement tool to estimate voters agreement or disagreement with the \"new\" system - otherwise it is speculative that it would be beneficial for voters to have a pre-selected amount of proposals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "- There is no doubt that is mandatory to investigate a way to facilitate the voting process, creating a method that allows everyone to evaluate all the projects and compare them, making the voting decision more efficient.\r\n- One point that causes me trouble is the scalability of the process, since you've said and it's seen that we have a growing community with more wallets, voters and proposals, I'm imagining how long you will need to accomplish everything described in the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "- I do think that it's reasonable to involve people who is already participating in other parts of the process, like CAs and vCAs.
