I am not sure, if the number of voters is low, because people do not speak the language, or it is because they do not care. If we had more data we could assume better. I understand that it is hard to collect, I am just trying to say, that the proposal might not be AS EFFECTIVE as expected. \r\n\r\nto put it simply:\r\n\r\nIt will increase the number of voters and CA, but what if it will be only 1%? (if you consider 1% as a success, please take it as a low outcome:))\r\n\r\n3. is not 200 people low expectation? - for new voters?

It's great that they back up their assessment of the problem with real info from the Cardano Vietnam community survey; and their aim to \"help the community to evaluate proposals by themselves\", rather than telling people what to vote for, shows a good grasp of a key principle of distributed decisionmaking.\r\n\r\nBut \u2013 they're basically trying to insert a second  tier of assessment, with separate criteria, in between the proposer and the voter, without explaining how they will communicate these additional criteria to proposers. In order to be transparent (and transparency is a cornerstone of distributed decision making), it'll be important to make sure proposers are aware of these new criteria that they're going to be assessed on; this will take time and effort that's not accounted for here. For example \u2013 writing guidance notes? Integrating it all with the challenge settings on Ideascale for fund 8? etc. I'd like to see some awareness in the proposal that this needs to be done by *someone* (even if their plan is for someone else to do it), because not recognising that it needs to be done at all is a bit of a red flag for me as it's so anti-transparent.\r\n\r\nI get that the team is using an iterative process to develop the evaluation criteria, and that's great; but I would like to see a little more info, even if it's quite vague, about what kinds of additional criteria they think they might develop in their first iteration, and how these will address the challenge. Or if they really don't have any idea of what the criteria might be until they start working on it, then I'd like some more detail on what their processes will be to develop the first iteration. Will they use any research or consultation to come up with these additional evaluation criteria? How will they ensure that these additional criteria address the challenge and improve distributed decisionmaking, rather than being arbitrary or irrelevant? \r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team seem to be quite connected to the Cardano community, which is great, but the information and links given about each of them are a bit opaque, honestly. For example, it's hard to assess from a github with no public repositories , whether someone has the skills to deliver a project, so maybe a little more info on people's skills and experience would be useful. The budget is clear and well broken down, though; and the plan, dates and milestones seem solid and achievable. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It's good that they are taking an iterative approach, so we can audit progress by looking at e.g. their community survey halfway through and the feedback they get from their testers. Ideally, though, I'd like to see a couple more audit metrics being used. For instance - we can audit whether the target 200 people are using the guide; but can we audit how many of those people actually do go on to vote? And on the qualitative side - as it stands, we can audit \"has an assessment guide been made, and are 200 people using it?\" What's missing is \"...and what do those 200 people think of it? Is it helping?\" I'm sure that info will be in the community survey the team plan to do, so it'd be great if they could make explicit how they will collate that info, anonymise it if necessary, and make it available to the community so we can assess what effect this work has had.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal is very interesting, because as the authors of the proposal say, less than 10% of the holders of ada participate in the voting process of the Catalyst Project proposals, often because they do not understand the process. I say from experience that I can only perform this work actively because I have a family member who instructed me on how to carry out the assessments. He explained to me how to read the proposals, which criteria to evaluate and etc, and from there I started to study about the fundamental concepts of our ecosystem, such as blockchain, NFT and so on. But people who do not have someone already \"in\" this universe would certainly have a much harder time understanding how Catalyst works, let alone the act of evaluating proposals! So I thought this was an amazing idea, I would like to have access to the reviews guide myself. This project will certainly contribute a lot to distributed decision making as more people will understand, evaluate and participate in the launch of proposals on Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the team's ability to execute the proposal, it is very clear how they are technically prepared to do so.

They also measure steps based on months, and establish metrics to measure the proposal's success. About the division of the requested funding, despite providing us with some information, it is not very detailed... for example: human hours. Who would be working, what would people's work routine be like (how many hours a day, for example), which professionals would be involved in each phase? Regarding marketing, we are not specified what kind of advertising campaign they intend to launch, where exactly would the existence of this guide reach the community?
