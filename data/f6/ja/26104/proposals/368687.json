It's aim is to create the 'first distributed news journal on Earth'. Very interesting application, but according to my interpretation not fully fitting into this Challenge Setting. This challenge has defined the following goal: 'How can we help the Catalyst community to get better at distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds?'\r\n\r\nFor future proposals, I suggest to comply more directly with a Challenge Setting's goals. A pitty: This is a very appealing proposal, but due to the 'misplacement' I cannot unconditionally support it. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is definitely very experienced and engaged within the Catalyst activities. They are all highly engaged community members with a collective background in writing, project management, content creation & community outreach. From this perspective, I consider it very feasible that the outlined goals of the proposal can be achieved (even if I see these goals not fully aligned with the Challenge Setting's goals, see my comments under Impact). \r\n\r\nOne other concern I have here is that the suggested news-story-voting has (initially) nothing directly to do with the Core-Catalyst Decision Making. I suggest to keep this quite separate for avoiding confusion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team properly outlines the activity roadmap and the way, progress and success can be audited. \r\n\r\nDue to their strong entanglement and engagement within the Catalyst Community, this coukd become integral part of various meeting formats (e.g. Townhalls).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_101", "no_vca": 28, "ne": 14, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Yes, it is a very interesting approach for people to get active and it will serve several important purposes that can develop the community and it\u00b4s diverse skillsets as well as decisionmaking. Challengewise, it fits to Experiments in social, collaboration, or meeting structures in that it iterates publication processes - which are very similar to our important funding related roles \"writing proposals and assessing proposals and also voting\" - but it brings it on a more personal level (or any other level that I\u00b4m not thinking of right now). In it\u00b4s openness it might add perspectives and facilitate sharing. By voting for stories and learning how the stories go through the steps of the publication process the proposers are utilizing a meta-process similar to the funding cycle in Catalyst which is pretty cool in itself and it might also be be a good way to share different perspectives, have \"themed special issues\" and grow as a community. Great idea. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, I know that Ben has a writing background, Felix has experience with project management and general networking as well as Raz. All members are very active and have already contributed greatly to the community in several areas but also in toolmaking/decisionmaking so the proposed idea is definitely within their range of experience. It is highly likely that this way of contribution from the community will be set up by the team and running smoothly, the idea to introduce it through ATH as well as through the communication channels and swarm is feasable and will help get people curious. The financial budget is very well broken down, but with 25.000 the project requests a third of the funding so it is quite high.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones are feasable and the proposed release date is communicated. Communication as well as documentation is given through bi-weekly ATH breakout rooms and open documentation that can be audited. Rewards are calculated, voting process is described thoroughly, outreach is coverd through discord and other communication channels as well as swarm and ATH. Bounty as well as voting and contributing will lead to a more active participation and as mentioned - the process mirrors the funding round process (kind of) so it will be a great way to experience the \"big\" Catalyst funding circles through \"smaller\" timeframes of publication rounds.

The potential benefit here is in providing new information sharing and creative outlets for the Catalyst community while normalizing and legitimizing decentralized decision making. This potentially looks like a space where new diffusions of leadership roles and journalistic exchanges are forged. It makes sense to give a community of readers the ability to choose their level of participation in what they are reading, up to and including making submissions, voting on content, and direct editorial feedback. The responsibly apportioned initial incentives to contributors, stake pool synchronicity, and nft plans all point to the team having considered the scalability of the project carefully and from multiple angles.
