It is worth noting that at the voting stage CAs, vCAs and proposers become voters too, so it is a tool that is widely used in the community. One of the problems I see currently is the fact that casting votes is only possible in the Catalyst app, so using the voter tool fragments the experience and because of that the user base is limited. Regardless of that aspect, the voter tool seems to be an excellent option to present voters to proposals in a friendlier way than the voting app and IdeaScale itself and also allows the creation of lists for sharing, which is an important item for sharing. lists/ expert ballots.\r\n\r\nKPIs were included, but targets were not set for these KPIs, which makes the impact assessment more subjective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The trio responsible for the project has already demonstrated qualification and achievements in the Cardano community for many months.

Nevertheless, a standard voter just uses catalyst voting app, and if he would like to use this VT (voter tool) he would need to go to another page - where I see a risk, that voters might perceive it as \"another step - a longer time to decide; rather than - it will help me out-. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if this will be as effective as planned, therefore I put 4 stars.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "the team provided relevant information, I have used CAtool myself, so it is running, no doubt they will deliver.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "the proposers provided KPI which is considered as suitable to measure and audit the progress.

It's great that this proposal is giving ongoing attention to this, offering a friendlier alternative, and that the tool has been improved and iterated in response to users. \r\n\r\nI particularly  like that the tool gives voters access to info like the CAs' rationale \u2013 this is great for transparency, which obviously improves distributed decisionmaking.  Also very pleased to see multilingual localisation is coming; that feels important in addressing this challenge.\r\n\r\nBut there are a couple of details that don't help \u2013 and when i think about those, they actually feel like they reveal a more deep-rooted issue. I mean the way that this tool (and all the AIM tools) are so completely separate from each other, so users don't get an overall sense of what they're part of. Sure, some users of this tool are probably not at all interested in the rest of Catalyst \u2013 but some might be, and when you've got 'em there, it feels like a missed opportunity not to point them to other aspects of Catalyst. Even if it was just a links page signposting voters to Town Halls / how to make a proposal / how to become a CA, etc. Doing something as simple as this would address, in a small way, the lack of \"joined-up-ness\" in Catalyst, and the way that the different groups (voters, CAs, proposers, SPOs, etc)  are pretty separate and siloed. That's the main thing that leaps out at me when I look at the tool  and how it's designed (or even, when I try to actually find it from elsewhere in Catalyst.) It's like the tool (and therefore the voters) are in their own separate universe, which I feel runs counter to addressing the challenge \u2013 distributed decisionmaking means participants know about the whole system, not just their corner of it. This does feel symptomatic of a wider issue in Catalyst as a whole, and that's not really this proposal's fault; but it does mean that for me, the proposal doesn't address the challenge quite as effectively as it might\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Clearly yes, as the work has mostly already been done, the tool clearly works, and people are using it successfully.\r\nThe budget and work hours breakdown for the future are completely realistic too, so there's little doubt the project will be implemented successfully.\r\n\r\nBut it's striking how there's no plans for any features development for F6 and F7.

But to be able to audit the actual *success* of the project, we probably need to know not just if people use the tool, but if they find it helpful. It's completely fair enough if there's not capacity to do any full-on qualitative evaluation in the future; but maybe simply looking at what percentage of F5 users come back and use it again in F6 and F7, would give an idea?
