It may not be straightforward to everyone how documentation and more generally, information contribute to decision making, nevertheless, in time it should become clearer to Cardano supporters that documentation and information are fundamental for decision making in technological innovation, software development, and blockchain governance. This project does a very efficient job, founded by actual work done, in demonstrating how documentation for oversight can be achieved. Outside of the scope of the current proposal, I would recommend that the proponent considers how oversight will relate in the future to implementation (i.e.: sanctioning corrupt or inefficient behavior). The reason for this suggestion is that in the long run, oversight without sanctions/control would eventually become useless. Thank you for your proposal and good luck.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes.

In addition, the proponent has demonstrated availability and responsiveness to the Catalyst community. I highly recommend that if the proposal is funded, the proponent pay great attention to the automation and future decentralization of the oversight tools. It will be highly desirable that in the future, the tools developed here for project oversight can be transferred to other community members, to other projects, to future generations, and to decentralized communities. To achieve this, it seems desirable that the processes of documenting activities, publishing and disseminating will be as automated as possible and independent from individual human skills and dispositions (e.g.: going from automatic note-taking i.e.: 'subtitles generation', to social media posting).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_183", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The ongoing work outlined in the proposal is to the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem and addresses the challenge effectively.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has a track record of delivering value.
