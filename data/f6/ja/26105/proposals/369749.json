A big YES! This goes beyond submitting proposals and drives submitting QUALITY PROPOSALS. As I started reading the proposal, I was immediately inspired and started getting ideas...\r\n\r\n\"Hey, this could go hand-in-hand with projectcatalyst.org\"... oh, it's there.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you could do this on-chain\"... oh, they've thought about it. Should this be successful in incentivizing mentor-proposer relationships, the smart contracts can then be extended to automate most of Project Catalyst incentives - taking a load off of IOG's shoulders and enabling further decentralization.\r\n\r\nI initially thought this would be a great way to match experienced CAs with the proposers whose proposals they fall in love with during the assessment period.

However, if the fee based model is fully implemented, it would limit the reach to those who already can afford. A way to overcome this would be a hybrid model where those who can pay for this service do so, but those who cant are able to apply for some financial aid from Cardano community. It would extend the reach of the second fund model (let's say, for instace, to low income country as the ones in Africa) without fully overloadind the Cardano community (as in the first model). Another way to extend even more the reach of it is looking for extra mentors from different countries or who speak different languaged other than english (when the platform grows).\r\nA main concern here regarding the campaign as a whole (proposer outreach) is that this solution alone maybe  wouldnt bring much new proposers, at least at firts (thats why I'm not giving a 5), but it will certainly increase the quality of the new proposals. A proper communication plan and marketing strategy could help overcoming this.\r\nOther thing that could be added here is how the platform will ensure mentors are qualified and how they will be ranked. Will there be a selection process? A Curriculum analysis? Mentors with not enough qualification could lead to a bad experience here.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Two qualified  mentors seems enough for a MVP.
