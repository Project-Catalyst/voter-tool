The proposal talk about these sessions but does not describe how people will be compelled to attend such sessions. A breakdown of the $6,000 allocated to marketing should be broken down and explained.

With that, new entrepreneurs would probably be attracted to our ecosystem. Despite being consistent with what the challenge seeks, unfortunately I found the proposal itself a little poorly prepared. Let me explain: David (the author) does not specify how he would select meeting guests. How is he going to decide who are the right people to call for the event, and furthermore, how is he going to convince them to take the time to listen to a lecture on the subject? It was also not very clear how often these meetings would take place, at one point he states that they would be bimonthly, then every 2 months a new meeting would be created, or the same meeting (with the same contents) would be repeated in this period of time ? Another thing, it is not said how long each meeting would last, if it would be all in one day, nor why the city of Moudon (in Switzerland) would be a good place to hold them. For these reasons, I believe it would be positive if the proposal were revised in more detail, so that we would be able to understand more about its impact.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The author says he has experience organizing events, which is positive. He also claims to have managed to convince about 10 people to use ada... However, he does not prove, through attached contents or a detailed description of his professional performance, that he has solid knowledge about the Cardano universe. I also thought that he needed to demonstrate his intention to form a team of different professionals who would be essential for the proper functioning of the project, such as: speakers specialized in each subject covered on the day(s) of the event (he talks about this at one point in the proposal, but I didn't understand if they already had people for certain subjects or he just indicated where the speaker would be called); production professionals, such as people responsible for taking care of the environment, monitoring sound, providing water, transport, etc; a group aimed at getting in touch with the people invited to the event... I thought that solid trust was not established in relation to the author's preparation and the formation of a team to carry out the project, unfortunately.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "We have some information about the event, such as what would be the main topics covered and how the funding would be distributed. However, many other important information remained pending. For example, it would be essential to understand how (in detail) the events themselves would happen, from their preparation to the day, how long it would last, how the logistics would be; whether guests would be picked up from where they stayed (and where and where); how the Cardano community could receive feedback from these activities, and so on. I also had the impression that the project itself would be quite expensive for what it proposes, for me it would be valid for the event to be recorded, broadcast, posted somewhere, registered and widely publicized so that it reached the maximum number of people. The author even mentions that part of the money would be earmarked for the communication and marketing sector, but it would be positive if he clarified this information further, what kind of marketing would be done, how, where? Therefore, I believe that the notion of how the event would take place was still too abstract, in need of revision", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u3053\u3053\u3001\u30b9\u30a4\u30b9\u306e\u30e0\u30fc\u30c9\u30f3\u3067\u3001CardaSatellite\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u3002\u5c06\u6765\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c7\u30a2\u3084\u4e0d\u5b89\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u3001\u5c0f\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u3067\u5b9f\u969b\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u958b\u50ac\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "\u591a\u304f\u306e\u4eba\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3001\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u3067\u306e\u8b70\u8ad6\u306f\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u4e0a\u3088\u308a\u3082\u81ea\u4fe1\u306b\u3064\u306a\u304c\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u3001\u5468\u56f2\u306e10\u4eba\u306e\u4eba\u3005\u306b\u6697\u53f7\u3001ADA\u3078\u306e\u6295\u8cc7\u3092\u8aac\u5f97\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002"}
