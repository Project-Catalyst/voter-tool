A more user friendly social community or social media could  centralize forums, discussion, useful websites, Q&A, kpis, etc. My main concern is how receptive people in general are nowadays with social medias that dont provide a fast interaction (such as instagram with focus on images and stories rather than text, tiktok with quick videos or twitter with short texts) - and thats one of the main reasons facebook is becoming much less used. I've seen companies try to implement internal communities like these and the people engagement is general not very high. It would need a great effort to centralize all the content and keep everything that is being generated or discussed here, as I dont see other channels disappearing (like telegram)\r\nHowever, it's worth trying, it just needs to have the right appeal. It needs to provide information on all kinds of sorts, in a direct and quick manner, speacially for those who are just joining. short videos, straighfoward texts/messages  and real life applications of Cardano should be incentivized as well as integration with other platforms (cardano's and general social media). the proposal itself is very well written and with a clear plan which makes me think that proposers probably know what they are doing.  The \"plan\" in the proposal seems to adress some of these aforementioned challenges - the e-learning platform is great, for instance.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roles division in the team are satisfactory but it still need to be build up (not yet committed) - as it is a relatively big and diverse project team (at least 8 resources, but probably more) the feasibility rate here cant be higher. Its also not clear how the team will be selected/hired. The proposer seems qualified with enough experience.\r\n\r\nthe plan is sensible though the \"rough\" timeline should be divided in weeks or months (or incoporated to the estimated timeline somehow). The only thing that seems irrealistic is having 1 million users after 1 year if the team doent even exist yet.\r\nThe budget is relatively big but a proposal this bold really needs some investment. Its breakdown seems reasonable.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are some kpis to track but they seem misplaces in relation to the proposal. For instance, it is mentioned # of mentor but no other place in the proposal mentors are mentioned. What is the plan to specifically atract it? Others seem too subjective (\"Storytelling that aligns with individuals 'Why' and attracts them into a welcoming and user-friendly community measured through surveys\" how this is going to be measured?). Also, none of them are spread into time nor have a clear target.\r\n kpis shold be s.m.a.r.t.: specific, measurable, assignable, realisitc and time-related.\r\nAdditional kpis here could be as simple as number of new users by month (with increasing targets), f time people spend there, number of post, number of content in the e-learning platform, number of languages it is available on, number of users by country. The link bewteen the social media and the proposals is a great idea but not clear how the connection will be made.\r\n\r\nThere's a timeline with acitivites but only a few milestones - for a proposal of this size, it should have more. \r\nSome risks are considered but their management are way too simple (for instance, use software X) and subjective (\"This innovative environment is a creative & fun environment\")", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact - All 4 key bullet points are addressed as well as each challenge metric under the KPIs (Plus others to show impact & scalability  \n\nFeasibility - I have a contracted development team I mentioned under the Development Role and can use.

It outlines how to answer the problem of attracting more and higher quality proposals by understanding human behavior and asking engagement based questions.  The proposal touches on meeting the challenge brief for F6: Proposer outreach but based on the content, seems to be a better fit for F6: Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs.  This proposal outlines ways to strategically grow the Cardano Community to become the most valuable asset of the Cardano ecosystem.  Using a highly human-based approach, the proposal takes the reader on a deeper understanding of the problem of why the Community lacks the growth and adoption it deserves. It cites studies that validate Emotions, not facts, as the key drivers to buy in that lead to adoption to a new system technology and to a sense of belonging and therefore widespread adoption.  This proposal addresses the issue of Proposal Outreach by promoting an overall better community experience for non-technical Change Agents and as a result seems to fit also in a different challenge area.  Based on the level of detail of the proposal, the potential impact on the Cardano Community if this proposal is implemented I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge and would be a huge benefit to the Cardano Community. (Rating given: 4).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\r\nThe proposal outlines an estimated timeline with clearly defined deliverables at each interval.  The technology to be used is already a developed technology and would not need to be created from the ground up.  The proposal mentions using a platform called BuddyBoss which is designed to host the type of meaningful platforms that the Cardano ecosystem can incorporate.  BuddyBoss runs on WordPress which allows for easy integration of dApps into the platform.  The proposal describes 1 person as The Team with other Roles to be solicited from the Community that are yet to be part of the project.  Although the proposer knows the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal; it is unclear who will be soliciting for the Roles of Project Manager, Community Manager, Development Team, Server setup and Optimization, 2 BuddyBoss Developers, IT Maintenance, and Content Creation.  Also no mention is made of how the proposer plans to pay the person in each role.  The proposer draws upon 23 year of Leadership Management, Mentoring and Startup Experience, has a LinkedIn presence and appears very capable of implementing this proposal.  However, the risks here is if the proposer cannot find the talent he seeks to fill the other roles.  I would recommend the proposer update the proposal to indicate he is actively searching for each role desired and updates again when all the desired roles are filled.  The budget is reasonable to achieve the defined goals as it boasts a detailed cost structure, number of hours and cost of estimated development, number of hours and cost of Initial Content Creation, Infrastructure costs, reward system costs for contributors and a yearly estimated maintenance cost.  The plan describes the resources need to implement the proposal, challenges and risks the team will face during implementation. \r\nThere is plenty of information laid out in the planning and implementation of this proposal, the timeline, sustainability, cost structure, and the plan to have the portal be managed and sustained by the community seems ground-breaking and very useful to the Cardano Community.  However, without more of a team than 1 person in place when development starts, it would seem likely that the one person would become overwhelmed very quickly without the help outlined above. This project reflects the quality and innovation of the Cardano Community but falls short with just 1 identified person on the team and for this reason I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.  (Rating given: 3).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "AUDITABILITY:\r\nTransparency is built into this proposal with the detailed description of the challenges and risks the team will face during development.  The explanation of the use of Archetypal analysis as being a challenge to how one sees one's unique characteristics is a very interesting idea.  The proposal achieves audibility by presenting a rough timeline which acts as a general road map. Each step of the road map acts as a 30 point checklist for successful implementation.  The proposal gives sound reasoning and Research for the basis of its use of visual content.  It provides research based performance-based indicators that bolster the ideas of collaboration, information sharing and collective action as a basis for Digital Platforms that Support Online Communities.  The proposal goes on to illustrate how Community of Practice can deal with complex issues concerning larger more complex topics and serve to broaden the knowledge and experience of the entire community in the process.  The metrics and KPI's in this proposal are less technically based and more based on sociocracy which lends itself well to consensus. The proposal promotes eLearning and Community of Practice as the well-designed management tools to be built into the platform that will benefit learners, get quicker and more individualized feedback from peers, add to personal experience and avoid learners' reliance on tutors' opinions, develop feelings of control of learning  while practicing. Based on the research-based approach the proposal has adopted, I strongly agree that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.
