Besides this, the project is very limited in defining various aspects of how this will be achieved.  The proposes give a general plan (Story development, project dev, secure financing, pre-production etc) but it feels like it is not enough for a film project. I would expect to at least have a script and a trailer for deciding whether it would be a worthwhile investment.

Nonetheless this person seems to be an actor based on IMDB and also has some minor experience in production.\r\nThis proposal is asking for $56,000 but it will need more financing in future proposals.

There is a broad brush approach to the delivery of the final film with the aim to reach a 'global audience' through tapping into an action/adventure entertainment market. I struggle to believe there will be the interest in this at that scale, and that a more refined audience segmentation would better suit any launch - a defined list of target consumers who may have interest in crypto but lack knowledge may provide the nudge required to investigate Cardano for example. In the proposal, there are a number of studios mentioned, but no verification of the relationships held with those organisations. The proposer should add more information here, perhaps specific examples of previous work with those studios, to support these claims. I also don't see any scalability in such an endeavour, and though their short-term goals are to engage with the community, it is not hitting the brief of \"proposer outreach\" at this time. Additionally, the requested budget only covers the first part of their roadmap, and there is no indication of cost for the other parts - if this is to be taken forward, there needs to be some indication of the cost for the delivery of the entire project. Delivering a screenplay without oversight of the full costs is not a good use of community money in my opinion.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "\r\nThe proposal states they will create a \"feature film & global distribution\" but what they are actually requesting is seed money to create a screenplay, which they hope to supplement with paid-for product placement/advertising. The metrics are too vague to be auditable or measurable. There needs to be a business case developed already, not promised in the next phase. Additionally, marketing for a film is not cheap and the proposer needs to provide much more detail on their audience, geographies, advertising mediums, etc. than just provide a generic line on out of home and social media advertising.
