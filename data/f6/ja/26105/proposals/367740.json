The largest economies in the world currently use the system but I do not understand how the SOIL data will replace it. The proposal assumes that patents are the motivation that funds ideas, but I would assert that patents are rather a necessary by product of protecting an investment which is only made because of a promise of future cash flows. Without the strong legal backing of a patent system, the promise of future cash flows is less sure, and therefore some innovations would never have been funded in the first place (e.g. iphone).\r\n\r\nI agree with the goals of the proposal, but I cannot see it addressing the challenge unless modified to work with an existing global system e.g. SOIL could provide favourable patent licensing terms for developing countries.\r\n\r\nI think the proposer may miss the link between the funders of innovation (it's very expensive with no promise of return) and the security that a patent provides them, so working within the system may be a better outcome for an initiative like SOIL.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I like the proposal very much, but the current societal and corporate apparatus that surrounds investment in innovation and global IP protection would not be replaceable by a database without the legal and corporate backing of millions of IP owners.
