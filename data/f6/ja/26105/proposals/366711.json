I thought this idea is really great because it dialogues directly with the context of a large part of the world population, the internet, more specifically youtube (in addition to other social networks that the author mentioned). With this, it would not be necessary to attract new eyes to the ecosystem, but the content would go directly to people through paths already adopted by them. When reading the proposal, at first I thought it might not work so well because many people skip ads, but the author explains that the amount paid relates to counting who accessed the content, not considering who simply ignored it. O. Once this doubt is resolved, I strongly believe that this is one of the best ways to attract new members to our ecosystem and strengthen it even more.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal author is highly prepared to carry out the project, as he has a university education and 10 years of experience in the marketing world. And besides saying that, he attaches a website where we can get to know him better, which increases his credibility even more. Not enough, he also provides an example of a trailer that has already been made by him and his co-worker, which I really liked and I think has done very well what it promised. The author is also aware that he could not do all the work alone, and delegates the audiovisual construction of the project to a colleague (from what I understand they have already worked together), in addition to mentioning, in the financial division, that a certain amount would be invested in design (probably contradict a designer too). In other words, for me everything is perfect regarding the ability of this team to make this idea come true (and success).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "About how the project will happen in practice, I also have nothing but praise. The author details in detail what would be done, how it would be done, through which strategy... We are provided with information about how the financing money would be distributed, and also what would happen in the months following the financing. We are told exactly how youtube advertising works, what other social networks would be included during the outreach, what metrics they use to determine the campaign's success, and what is expected as a result of it.
