Skills of hosting meetings are evident.\r\n\r\nAre these links sufficient?\r\nThere are no links given. But the people are present here, and as i have seen at a TH meeting are highly engaged in hosting.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you the CA visited these links and contacted the relevant people?\r\nI have interacted with the mentioned people. \r\n\r\nHave you been able to assess their level of competence?\r\nThey are quite competent.\r\n\r\nDoes proposer know, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal?\r\nThe team is established. Why there are that many numbers in the team is not clear, since many roles seem to be duplicated.\r\n\r\nHas he rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown?\r\nTeam structure is laid out. Some roles are duplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas budget been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items?\r\nBudget has not been broken down. One figure is given and its said what its for but not what each activity costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS budget reasonable to achieve the set goals?\r\nBudget is reasonable to achieve goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas the proposer provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required to implement the proposal?\r\nThere is no other plan if additional funding is required.\r\n\r\nHave you verified this plan?\r\nNo\r\n\r\nDoes proposal offer a realistic timetable to complete the work?\r\nThere is no timetable laid out.\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how?\r\nIt shows whats being done and how its being done.\r\n\r\nDoes the plan describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal?\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nDoes the proposal clearly explain  technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nHas the proposer considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation?\r\nThere appear to be no risks for success. Nonetheless none have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nSince the townhalls have been happening successfully, its clear the participants can carry these out.  The budget has no break down so I cannot comment on whether its too high or too low.
