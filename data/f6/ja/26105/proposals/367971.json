We have no idea about their experience or competence in blockchain technology\r\n\r\n\r\nHas he rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown?\r\nYes he has\r\n\r\nHas budget been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items?\r\nIt is somewhat clear but some items seem over priced. On what basis has the cost per slide been calculated?  Salaries for supervision of slides seem very high for one hour of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS budget reasonable to achieve the set goals?\r\nThe budget is very high and could be set more reasonably to achieve set goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas the proposer provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required to implement the proposal?\r\nNo. They state that some of this funding will be deferred to later.\r\n\r\nHave you verified this plan?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes proposal offer a realistic timetable to complete the work?\r\nYes its realistic\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nDoes the plan describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal clearly explain  technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation?\r\nTechnical aspects involve presentation of slides at Townhall meetings and breakout rooms\r\n\r\nHas the proposer considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\r\nIs there clearly laid out a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\nYes.
