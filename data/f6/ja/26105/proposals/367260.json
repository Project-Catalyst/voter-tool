It's also completely scable to other country or educational institutions other than university and college (profissionalizeing or technical courses, schools, etc).\r\n\r\nHowever, the proposal could tell more about the content in the daily zooms and how the assisting in proposal development will be made. Also, not clear how the target audience will be engaged. What is special in these daily streams that is more appealing to university/college students? There could be a plan to bring external guests to these streams like people from business or tech world who uses cardano, proposals who already got funded, etc.\r\nIn addition, if project is already launched, what are its numbers (reach) so far? \r\nAlso, if, for instance, China is a target country, how to engage with non english speakers there?\r\n\r\nLast, It's said a social media campaign will be done but it could have more details on the proposal.

Some milestones for the next months could be available though, specially if they intend to be self-funded - an extra kpi could be how much they are able to get with referal fee per week or month, to follow up with the self funded objective.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice also to breakdown the proposed kpis by the universitiies or country where the studentes who attended the streams are from.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal is indeed tailored to reach awareness among college students. However, it seems to rely more on students that come to the channel \"Cardano Outreach\" than the opposite. That is, the platform has pointed no actions on reaching the fraternities, academic associations, or anything that can be translated into an active campaign to reach more students. Additionally, the uniqueness of this proposal is not clearly determined. What makes it better than any other educational channel for blockchain on social media?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The fact that the proposers have previous experience on Catalyst and have implemented a social media campaign before is an indicator that they know what to do. However, the public engagement on \"Cardano Outreach\"  on Twitter is too low - so far, and not all the content published is related to awareness about Cardano or blockchain. On Twitch the profile has only 5 followers. Therefore, it's arguable that the proposal will be implemented successfully.

Although they have presented KPIs, there's no indication of how they are planning to evolve in a certain timeframe, especially because they have mentioned that the strategy is to keep applying from Fund to Fund on Catalyst.

Based on all these evidences, I can  confirm that this proposal addresses effectively de challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "That proposer has already conducted similar projects.

Adding it now to the safety that Cardano project catalyst can provide in terms of financial independence, will be a huge catalyst to grow Cardano eco system. \r\n\r\nIn general, young minds bring in lots of energy and passion to anything that they work on. This proposal here essentially is targeting this group, and if we are able to promote what opportunities exist with Cardano then we should not be surprised if it brings lot of new ideas that present solutions to  real world problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team here is well experienced and have also received good attention from community in the previous funding rounds.

In addition, the authors claim that there will be translation into Chinese and Korean.

One of them, Jeff, attached the linkedin profile, which is super positive for us to know more deeply who he is, and both made available their personal contacts (e-mail), which shows a lot of devotion and willingness to dialogue with community and improve the proposal. Not enough, they intend to involve students as well, which is great because it's a pretty big project and it would actually need more than 2 people to run it. The only point I have to comment is that they could have shown their intention to hire a designer, because it will be essential to have graphic material to promote the campaigns on social media. But this is just a detail, I was very satisfied with what is provided to us.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We know what the authors intend to do with this idea, where they intend to go (both in terms of which sites and platforms they will use and also what audience they aim to reach).
