The proposal itself seems to revolve about teaching people about blockchain in creative ways through drinking games, music and more. It does not specifically talk about Project Catalyst or attracting people to participate in Catalyst and submit proposals. He is also looking at collabing with other more popular channels and introduce 'crypto concepts' in their channels. Again, no mention of informing people about Catalyst is mentioned. This could be a good proposal but require much more work and proof of actuation. Goals defined are not synchronous with the challenge goals. The idea of granting money to youtubers without anything to show for it does not seem a good allocation of funds. Granting money to already popular youtubers in order to create content on Catalyst seems much more fruitful and would probably cost less.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Given the low popularity of the channel, it is unlikely that more popular channels would be compelled to collab with the proposer. The videos already published by the proposer do not seem compelling to watch and lack flow.
