It only really solves a short term problem and doesn't propose how the Hackathons for startups will continue after this initial 12 months. The budget plan seems good mentioning how the money will be used as a prize incentive. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It mentions use of incubation hubs in the proposal, it would be useful if incubation hubs were identified. What experience does the team have in organizing events. Hackathons are also more about the challenge, problem space and organisation not just experience in Software development. The lack of detail and unclear overall logistical plan for marketing and how they will connect with developers and startups does not give me confidence hence a score of 2 here.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Videos captured from the hackathons seems like a good measure of audibility, however it would be helpful if there was a better way of measuring success once a hackathon is done.

I think that at the of each hackaton, winners should be helped proposing their ideas in catalyst. Since the challenge about introducing new proposer to the catalyst program, helping the hackaton participants should be part of the project. In the other hand, this aspect doesn't break the implementation of the project.

Very few people in Ethiopia know about Cardano or Catalyst.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this proposal fall within the scope of the challenge brief?\r\n Yes\r\n\r\nDoes this proposal show clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System?\r\nYes. hackathons will bring lots of new proposers with new ideas into Catalyst.\r\n \r\n\r\nHave key metrics and goals of the proposal been stated clearly \r\nYes. This includes the cost of running 12 2 day hackathons together with prizes and media expenses including cost of video production.\r\n \r\nDo the key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge\r\nYes\r\n\r\nCan the proposal scale to address future challenges?\r\nYes by carrying out more hackathons.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\r\n\r\nHas the proposer provided evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal?\r\nNo team members are mentioned. Proposer has not included his own Linkedin profile, FB profile, Insta profile, or any other website, YT channel or links.\r\n \r\nAre these links sufficient?\r\nNo links are given \r\n \r\nHave you the CA visited these links and contacted the relevant people?\r\nNo \r\n\r\n\r\nHave you been able to assess their level of competence?\r\nNo \r\n\r\nDoes proposer know, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal?\r\nNone are listed \r\n\r\nHas he rationally and logically laid out his team structure and breakdown?\r\nNo team listed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHas budget been outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items?\r\nBudget is clear, though its unclear who is going to implement it. \r\n\r\nIS budget reasonable to achieve the set goals?\r\nIt is very high. There is no way to ascertain whether these are realistic costs. To me it is 37% of the entire budget for this challenge. Also they believe they will have sufficient capacity ( no of interested participants)  to run a 2 day hackathon once a month. This maybe too high an expectation considering its the first time. It would be more realistic to do 1 hackathon a quarter for one year, learn from the experience and then if it works, scale up.\r\n\r\nHas the proposer provided a verifiable plan if additional funding is required to implement the proposal?\r\nNo verifiable plan for additional funds \r\n\r\nHave you verified this plan?\r\nNo \r\n\r\n\r\nDoes proposal offer a realistic timetable to complete the work?\r\nNot really. Though the hackathons are to happen once a month, are there enough participants to compete? Are there enough experts to be on 12 juries?  \r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how?\r\nThe proposal idea is sensible. Can hackathons be conducted in a location considering present Covid spread?\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the plan describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal?\r\nYes \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the proposal clearly explain  technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation?\r\nNo technical aspects.  \r\n\r\nHas the proposer considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation?\r\nNo\r\n \r\n ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "\r\nIs there clearly laid out a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\nNo roadmap is laid out other than specifying one hackathon per month for 12 months. Any plan for the training and development of the winners, ensuring they know how to prepare proposals for Catalyst would be needed, otherwise the expense spent on Hackathon is wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAre there clearly defined Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal?\r\nThere are no KPIs that define the success of the proposal beyond hopefully getting 120 proposals of quality to enter into Catalyst. If they are not of suitable quality then the expense on hackathons would not have a successful outcome.\r\n \r\n\r\nIs there a clear understandable description of the targeted problem?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a clear understandable solution that addresses the problem?\r\nThe solution is understandable. Whether it will achieve the end result of bringing more proposals to Catalyst cannot be determined with surety.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas the proposer identified possible hurdles, challenges and difficulties?\r\nNone are identified.\r\n \r\n\r\nHow does the proposer plan to deal with these difficulties?\r\nNo plans given\r\n\r\nAre there contingency plans in place for various outcomes?\r\nNone\r\n\r\nThough the problem is real and the solution is a good one, the plan does not reflect how exactly this will take place, and once its done how to ensure that the 120 plans are of sufficient quality to make it to Catalyst and have a chance of being funded.

The proposal has clear objectives - running 12 hackathons - but, looking at the proposal with my many years of strategic marketing experience, I think the proposal could be improved by providing more detail on how they will create interest and engagement, whether they would target different locations each month and understand how they will build on the engagement through the year. It would also be helpful to understand how they will build validity in the event - perhaps through the reputation of their jury panels and communicating the outcomes of some of the chosen projects.\r\n\r\nThe proposal outlines the costs of the various elements for delivery, but it would benefit from a more complete project plan, with resourcing requirements and any risks added to deliver them - for example: will they outsource consistently or look to hire. Is there a risk of COVID impact, etc.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if there was positive ROI and engagement, I can see this as a scaleable event which can generate interest in the locations it takes place.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The milestones and KPI's are well defined, however, there are no identified risks or challenges. This may be because there is a minimal risk to delivery but it would be beneficial for them to give this due consideration.
