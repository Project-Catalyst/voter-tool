The scope of the challenge does not overlap with any of the existing challenge funds although there are competing new environmental challenges in this fund. Cardano has many attributes that make it a more green and sustainable blockchain ecosystem than leading competitors so its a natural partnership. It also has the potential to bring in a lot of new users to the community.\r\nI strongly agree that this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "My understanding is that it will be one or two hard forks before many of the features which will allow SPOs to offer a large number of services. By the time this challenge is run and awarded the hard fork may have occurred however even if it has not then the challenge brief is flexible enough that setting up a solar powered hub in a rural village that could possibly provide electricity and internet access as add on services would also meet the challenge objectives. There is nothing in the challenge that cannot be addressed by the community and the budget is moderate.
