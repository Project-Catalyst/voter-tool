In principle, as a former social entrepreneur myself, I would be against just pouring money on to a problem and waiting for it to get solved. That's the giving a fish approach. This proposal, however, goes beyond teaching how to fish. It aims to fund the creation of 10 sustainable fisheries. :)  \"This challenge will therefore look for local implementors to acquire, equip and resource local community centres/hubs where communities can be mobilized to solve problems on Cardano.\" I think this is exactly the way to go. The only thing I would add is to try and get partnerships created as well, e.g. the abovementioned World Mobile co-sponsoring a location or other relevant players tagging along.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This relies on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Project Catalyst process and, so far, it has proven to be a very good way to disseminate funding to worthy projects.
