There are 32 proposals (7th largest of 18 Challenges) being assessed for $100K.

The challenge is more than tripling its funding request in Fund 7.\r\nFund 6 proposals have not even been voted on yet so there is no way to know the cost effectiveness of this challenge yet. The recruitment cost should be under $5 per new user to be comparable to other challenges so a $10K community hub should bring in 200+ users within 12 months.\r\nI agree that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success criteria are relevant to the challenge question. \r\nThe key metrics are relevant to the success criteria.
