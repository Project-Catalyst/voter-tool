The current funding model is an all or nothing approach which is problematic. Setting expectations as to what is a reasonable fund size helps proposers, CAs and voters in their decision making. \r\nThe fairest way to allocate funds to specific communities should be based upon community size. Africa represents ~15% of the global population therefore using the 6.25% Total Fund guideline if spread out equally on a global basis that would mean that would mean 41% of the Total Fund should be set aside for growing the Catalyst community within specific regions. Personally, I would favor 20% set aside for localization however 40% is not an unreasonable number given the push to rapidly grow the community.\r\nI agree that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success criteria are relevant to the challenge question. \r\nThe key metrics are partially relevant to the success criteria but some are not readily measurable.

This proposal perfectly adresses such an ethos and it is a praiseworthy attempt to bring in more African projects for Fund7.\r\nHowever, that being said, I'm missing a proposal of a more granular prioritization scheme for future African-based projects. More specifically: I believe we should prioritize not only on the scale of what network effect (among African developers or other stakeholders) the project will bring, but also how this future Fund7 challenge is able to incentivize African developers to tackle high-impact projects. By this \"high-impact\" I mean both for their local communities, but also from the global perspective (and give the very specific condition of Africa, many solutions to local problems can have much larger positive global effects in the long run).\r\nI think that e.g. a future Decentralized Crops-Insurance project proposal should be given a higher priority than a new Microlending platform, which itself should be given a higher priority than a yet-another-micro-payment-system-this-time-based-on-cardano-in-africa, which still should be higher than e.g. a NFT platform for African rappers.\r\nI mean this as a very illustrative example, don't take it literally, but I think you get the point ;-)\r\nAnyway, I think what could really improve the current proposal, is to include such an impact-based prioritization mechanism. Perhaps based on something  along the lines of Effective Altruism, or some other more African-facing rationalist movements that have already identified what development streams could make the biggest long-term positive impact on Africa.\r\nIf such a prioritization is present, I gladly give 5 stars. Now I'm on 3, which means \"really good, but I'm not so sure about the ultimate impact\".", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This is quite a specific topis, Fund7 challenge setting, where there is no need for a full-stack development team etc. It's more on the community meta-level. Still, somebody from the team will have to do the challenge presentation, facilitate breakout sessions, lead a challenge retrospective, track key metrics, etc.\r\nUnfortunately, this project proposal has no team introduction or anything like this. I can only judge from a) how the proposal is written (and it's written well, in a structured and coherent way, etc.), and b) what else can be found about Steve Lockhart on Ideascale - he's involved in couple of other proposals, one of them being much more elaborated (Planting Roots in Africa).\r\nSo much gut feeling tells me that Steve will be able to handle all these.
