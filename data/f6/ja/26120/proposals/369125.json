Focusing on building tools for DAO creation and support will increase traffic to the Cardano space. Many proposals on Catalyst will scale better if they become DAOs. Having a challenge setting that promotes and supports tool building for DAOs will help other proposals as well. This challenge could provide a springboard for Cardano adoption and advance Cardano's mission therefore aligning with two of the Fund 7 challenge setting guiding questions.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Catalyst community already has the Cardano vision and Catalyst in itself is an active DAO.
