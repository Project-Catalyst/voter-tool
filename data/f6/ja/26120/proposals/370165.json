You could add to the survey a question like \"how many users do you think this prototype bring onto Cardano\".  While not an ideal metric, at least they are actual measurements.\r\nI neither agree nor disagree that success criteria and suggested metrics are set correctly to measure progress in addressing the challenge.\r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30b6\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u304c\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001Cardano\u306f\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3084\u6587\u66f8\u306e\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u8a3c\u660e\u3092\u4fdd\u5b58\u3059\u308b\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3068\u3057\u3066\u6d3b\u7528\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002", "success": "\u73fe\u5b9f\u306e\u554f\u984c\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u30e1\u30bf\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u3092\u5229\u7528\u3059\u308b\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u304c\u69cb\u7bc9\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3002\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u306f\u3042\u3089\u3086\u308bTH\u3067Catalyst\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306b\u767a\u8868\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
