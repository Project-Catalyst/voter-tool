Clearly, the CA did not understand the basics of the challenge : help start-ups by funding their inital set-up and expenditure at 75% of total cost with the binding that they have to allocate a discount for any sales paid in ADA by customers. CA also asks how long the icnentive will be kept, when in fact this is a one time payment at start to be repaid slowly to catalyst. If one cannot understand the proposal, he/she should not assess it and if he/she does, it should be filtered out.
