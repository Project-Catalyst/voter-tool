I was hoping that one group specifically would be mentioned: ADA investors and traders who are still blissfully unaware of what we are doing here. They keep their ADA in centralized exchanges and while they might follow what is happening in the ecosystem they are missing out on opportunities to participate. I'd say that is a real \"low hanging fruit\" because it's easy to justify to them why they should join: to increase the value of their investment.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Apart from notes like \"a media plan is required from all proposers\", this is a very relatable challenge and fairly easy to put into action. The tone of these remarks sounds like the proposer wants to sell his services to the rest of the community: \"This challenge aims to give professional and experienced marketers the financial framework to use their skills to increase Catalyst's reach and awareness.\" So, these things need to be reworded but the gist of the proposal is solid.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "You shouldn't limit the community's ability to innovate by limiting this only to \"Online marketing campaigns and Event marketing\".
