The potential to solve multiple scaling issues that we are experiencing today could come greatly to this community's benefit and with forces combined, bring both Cardano and SNet on the radar as leading entities in the innovative technologies sector. Tapping into a huge market potential of 5T USD could spark a tremendous boost for both ecosystems.

Judging from the comments section, SNet is being informed and prepared by Dr. Ben Goertzel himself. As AI-integration is set to become one of the largest emerging markets for the coming century, the potential is enormous en therefore highly feasible to have a beneficial outcome if a challenge were dedicated to it. The sooner it happens, the better our position would be in this emerging market.

There is without a question a solid amount of teams and individuals from both sides already working on joint solutions and could expand such work in the future.\r\n\r\nIn addition, independent AI researchers (academia) could use the Catalyst funds to build AI services on SNET on Cardano.

I am also extremely supportive of having \"a world for [challenge proposer's] kids and community where Artificial Intelligence's goals are as beneficial and ethical as Cardano's. \r\nAt the same time, I am not sold that this challenge is critical to achieving Cardano's mission as there already exists a significant amount of collaboration between the two ecosystems with SN ready to launch now that smart contracts are live. \r\nThe challenge proposer could go further and explain why a challenge is the right mechanism by which to promote this partnership. Is there currently a lack of partnership going on? If yes, is the barrier to making the partnerships actually the funding? If it's not funding, how would a challenge help? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I wholeheartedly believe that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address this challenge. The reason why I am only giving it a 4/5 is because the Cardano community is only half of the equation. I would like to see the challenge setting proposer include some more information on the SN community: how many people are there? Has there been expressed interest from the SN community to use catalyst as a mechanism for growth? Is there already overlap between SN developers and Cardano developers (i.e. are there many that are both?). \r\nProviding details on such questions would be valuable. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, I think this proposal still needs work in developing success criteria and suggested metrics to measure progress in addressing the challenge. \r\nThe challenge setting proposer confuses these a bit by dividing \"success criteria\" into two different sections: the first one seems as an overview of key features of both systems; and the second one is a more qualitative than something that can be measured. I think putting down more tangible success criteria would help this challenge setting proposal. \r\nWhile I appreciate the challenge setting proposer including key metrics to measure, there is only one in the list that actually would be measurable to demonstrate success in the challenge: Number of proposals with teams composed of both Cardano and SingularityNet community members. The rest of the metrics are too generic and do not differentiate the need for a dedicated challenge vis-\u00e0-vis all other catalyst funding challenges. \r\nLove the idea but need to see more concrete outcomes and metrics.
