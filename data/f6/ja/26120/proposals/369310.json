One example would be PlayerMint from Funds 4 & 5. One could argue that this challenge is not only feasible but could lead to a more finessed DApp & Integration challenge, given this can now provide a home for the niche gaming proposals. The overlap may well occur with the NFT Business Models but proper education and mentoring of proposals could minimise chances of submitting one under the wrong proposal. Nonetheless, that is a good problem to have for Catalyst.
