Cardano's mission is to be sustainable while growing! The challenge is scaled too large.. We will always have climate change. Temperatures will always increase and decrease over time. We can see that in lots of research. However, this is overwhelming and not thought out clearly on how we can use the blockchain to establish sustainability. It is not clear as to how this challange will be solved. Will there be projects that require a net zero carbon footprint? Or is the idea to get projects to a net zero carbon footprint? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We need to be clear how the community will help to address and solve this challenge. The implementation of apps is a good idea but how does it help?

We do so because we share the same ambitions of the Foundation; to build better systems that will uplift lives, not only of those who have been left behind by legacy systems but also to usher in a new way of sustainably and globally managing our future and our environment. Climate Change is a danger and a challenge that needs to be addressed now and it comes with a little bit of a surprise that we have not yet included this in Catalyst. It is of paramount importance and is at the essence of what Cardano is. It is not just critical to achieve Cardano's mission. Climate Change  is the yardstick that will measure our success for what is the good of building a new system when we continue on our path to destroying the planet. Kudos to those who presented this challenge. I hope it achieves mass acceptance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "No new company or organisation, or new products and services, or new applications and technology are discussed these days without assessing its impacts on the planet.

We are aware of the differences between PoS and PoW energy usage. We are aware of SPOs who run carbon-neutral nodes. We are aware of sustainable Bison farming techniques, etc. Because its a common topic in most of our discussions, I am confident voters and proposers have the capacity to address this challenge in a careful and responsible manner and like myself, most would be surprised this challenge is only being considered now. That said, I believe the community will be eager for a Climate Change Challenge in Catalyst.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers have presented seven key metrics for success which could measure if Cardano is meeting this challenge. And given the on-going activities to beat Climate Change in different jurisdictions and communities already happening around the world, more could be added as corresponding proposals are submitted and new ways to address the issue are presented to the community. From a project oversight standpoint the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, which the proposing team presented in its draft, may also act as a checklist to which we can base the success of this challenge.

Even an energy-efficient blockchain like Cardano still requires energy. Therefore, to succeed, a proposal in this challenge would have to replace an existing way of doing things with a better, less energy-intensive, way, or facilitate other actions for avoiding the climate catastrophe.
