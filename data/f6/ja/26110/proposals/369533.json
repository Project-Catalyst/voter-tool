As a software developer of 30+ years, I don't know how one would go about building a \"system algorithm\" to categorize threat level in an automated process. \r\n\r\nI suspect every threat needs to be carefully considered by a human. \r\n\r\nWhich leads me to my next and primary concern with this proposal as it stands: lack of community engagement. \r\n\r\nA successful threat identification and mitigation system needs strong community engagement, including access to experts, developers and stake pool operators. Yet this proposal appears to focus exclusively on the construction of a web application. \r\n\r\nI suspect this proposal is premature. Perhaps the idea should be discussed with community members first. \r\n\r\nFor example, when a threat is submitted, who will analyze the threat and categorize it? How do we verify this person's credentials? Do we compensate them? What policies do we use regarding disclosure of threats? How do we alert affected parties (developers, stake pool operators) of imminent threats?\r\n\r\nOnce we better understand the requirements for the system, and garner community buy-in, then we will know enough to begin building the web app.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I suspect the proposal submitter has a vision for the application they intend to build in fulfillment of this proposal.

What the app would do, not do, features left as possible future improvements, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor example, how will threats be tracked? How can community members see and interact with threats?

The proposer suggests to create an app/web location to capture threats from Cardano users and then categorize their threat level based on the system algorithm.  This might be a very good step to implement if it was followed by a real plan for developing the application and system logic and a forward view on how it could function. This proposal to me screams \"IDEA\" and not \"real implementation plan with specific milestones and deliverables\". It almost coincides with the name of the challenge, but is careful not to delve into too many (any?) specifics. The proposer should demonstrate more forethought, planning and consideration of possible paths, platforms, alternatives, mechanisms and choices that will be made in implementing the project. What are the hurdles to effective implementation? As it stands now, the proposal is so generic, so bland, so lacking in any detail that it is difficult to criticize it for any failure in planning. Namely, there is no specific plan - apart from a few sentences. So, my advice is to start setting up a team and explore the idea - as a possible MVP and plan to deliver the MVP and explore alternatives to how this could be done and what are the difficult design choices. \r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "OK, so the proposer hasn't included a professional biography and detailed competencies apart from generic statements This could be easily improved by providing a link to his/her Linkedin profile and projects that have been successfully realized - if any. Success is defined in a very limited way as \"Develop an app/web location to capture threats from Cardano users and then categorize their threat level based on the system algorithm. \" I feel this is such a low bar for success, especially without specifying any quality parameters, platforms, functionalities, user interface traits, maintenance challenges, budget breakdown, estimated costs of individual deliverables, technologies that will be used... There is so much that could go wrong in a project like this, but none of this is given any consideration in the proposal. The worry for me is that if the proposal is this bland (I strongly encourage the proposer to improve it in further rounds if it is not approved in this one) - then the outcome/product could be of a similar nature.

Whether the proposed app or website will really deliver on its functionalities is up in the air - as the only promised functionality is to \"develope a capture/intake process for perceived threats.\" No specifics apart from that ... and truthfully an app/site that invites email submissions would clear that extremely low bar. I would suggest to the proposer to revisit his proposal (if it is not approved this round) by thinking long and hard about a vision of the future in which his app/website works. Imagine how success looks like, in your head. Imagine how problems emerge. Imaging how you overcome these problems. This mental map for the future will help guide some design and system decisions today. Don't limit your proposal to an idea. Have a clear vision of the future .. and then write the gory details down in a proposal, the nitty gritty, what works, what will not work, analyze competing solutions in similar platforms for capturing perceived threats, also look at practices in other functioning systems.
