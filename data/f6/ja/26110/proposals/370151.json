The game of the cat and the mouse is one of the most exhausting games in the hood because, no matter how skilled the hunter is, the prey is also skillful, wily, clever and with the amazing ability to multiply (kill one, appears thousands).  A never ending fight, and never ending fights have no sense. \r\n\r\nJust imagine a kid that in the school is victim of bullying.
