", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Part of the project plan is to hold events to help develop the plan, thus there is significant risk in the later stages which depend on this. Its not clear the proposer themselves have the skills to do smart contract auditing, which whilst they are not specifically proposing to do that part, it would seem useful for the project.

The proposers have focused on the expected emergence of malicious (also named as scam) smart contracts that can threaten market trust throughout the network. What I think is missing in the proposal - and would strenghten it - is an overview of how serious this problem of malicious (not poorly written smart contracts - but malicious) smart contracts has proven to be in other blockchain systems with smart contracts. The impact can already be asessed in some form - as smart contracts have been present in th blockchain world for years. The severity of this problem would be a great factor that supports developing this system. It is a potential threat - but its importance would need to be indicated through some existing examples. Who uses unvetted contracts in other smart contract systems? What has been the result? Who vets smart contracts in other blockchain systems - which vetting models have already proven to be the best? Why choose this proposed approach and not another? Having in mind that the scope of the proposal is not as wide ranging as the spirit of the challenge [to detect a wide range of threats as blockchain systems are complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components] it needs to be laser-focused on malicious smart contracts - and what has been learned. Maybe the bigger problem is poorly written smart contracts, then maybe that should be specifically included too - or tackled first. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The milestones seem a bit too difficult to pin down in terms of end size, quality (especially)  and scope. Build a knowledge base for contract transparency... the holding of two summits... Example faucet ... Example wallet integration ... These may be delivered on paper and boxes could be checked - as the milestones are very general ... but there might be no real impact. Hence, I question whether including \"Hopefully, a low number of scam contracts : )\" would be a good milestone - for a system that aims to detect malicious smart contracts. A low number (or zero) of scam contracts that are able to evade the new system might be a better metric. The proposed Beta wallet integration with a Cardano light/web wallet (e.g. Gamechanger wallet) would be better if it was more specific - which wallet, or how will the wallet be selected. Gamechanger wallet was used as an example. Will it be Gamechanger and why? When I tried to checkout the Team & Partners page for Gamechanger - the site has some generic information on the team (\"We are a small team that borned with the building barriers of undeveloped countries and the ones of the Cardano Blockchain's rising ecosystem. We are committed to lower the entry barrier of users, students and builders who want to see their dreams materialized on this young but amazing 3rd Generation Blockchain.\" ) - but no specifics. It might help to focus on a wallet that is in much wider use. As the system aims to blacklist smart contracts it might be good to build into it some kind of auditing of the whitelist/blacklist registry and a mechanism for smart contract authors to seek corrections of possible mistaken inclusions. The plan states that the proposers \"propose that this project will use Gimbalabs Project-Based Learning process and community-based planning\" and references  another proposal \"to understand why and how we will involve the community in every step of delivering on this proposal: (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/NFTs-derisk-Project-Capitalization/368330-48088). However, when I followed through to this other proposal, it states that it has been \"Withdrawn\". Does this mean that Gimbalabs Project-Based Learning process and community-based planning will not be available for implementing this proposal (it seems to be an integral component). Voters are now not able to consult a component of this proposal - as the other proposal explaining Gimbalabs Project-Based Learning process and community-based planning has apparently been withdrawn. The team does seem to have the qualifications for delivering this proposal, but I think that its presentation and deliverables could be improved to maximize its chances if it is not adopted in this round. The budget seems suitable, but I do not see a lot of planning for future maintenance and iterations and updating of the system - apart from a general comment on \"identifying next opportunities for important additions to the protocol and establish a roadmap for further recommendations.\" I think that a vision of how this would work in the future and be maintained is essential - for it to be ultimately successful. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As I mentioned above some weaknesses have crept through in the proposal, such as a milestone of \"Hopefully, a low number of scam contracts : )\" - I think that a very efficient system would be more impactful if it aims for a high detection rate. To make it clear, with the milestone \"a low number of scam contracts\" if the system does end up detecting a low number of scam contracts - this would be defined as success. But it may also be due to the lack of understanding of malicious contracts, lack of a good methodology or lack of expertise. So, scam contracts may be widespread - but the new system tells us there is a low number of scam contracts as it does not detect them. Success? Additional clarity is lost as the project plans to use Gimbalabs Project-Based Learning process and community-based planning - referenced from a different proposal that has been Withdrawn. If the other proposal is not material, maybe it should not be linked. This makes auditability difficult. Good things I would draw attention to is the teams expertise of the team. I just feel that this is a rushed proposal that could benefit from more sharpness, more focus and more answers (less questions). Such as the the proposed topics for the two summits: Smart Contract Developer Ecosystem & Trust Summit (identify how we flag, how we search the blockchain, how do applications digest flagged contract data/interrupt contract transactions) and SPO & Decentralized Service Deployment Summit (Who will host this service?  Do we allow for paid channels/services?  What does that look like?). I think that this proposal needs to come up with some proposed answers to these problems and not leave them to Summits especially as it is not clear who will attend, who will be invited and whether these Summits (what is a Summit anyway, exactly?) can answer these questions that are of critical importance for the success of this proposal. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability rationale suggests that accomplishing summits isn't an  auditable action, when its a primary focus of the proposal.

If nothing is done we risk regulation by incompetent exterior agencies that would hinder innovation and treat us a children who cannot take care of themselves.

Nonetheless, the team seems highly competent (from their LinkedIn profiles) and well organized to deliver such a project.

The main proposer is very active in the community (Swarm sessions, Gimbalab) and therefore accountable.\r\n\r\nThere is a budget but it's not very detailed.
