The reliability of the network is something that is constantly mentioned, especially today when it's possible to run a stake-pool in a cloud service such as AWS. Understanding the reliability of each SP, and consequently of the whole network, is something very valuable. The funding of this proposal, on the other hand, would limit the impact of the challenge as a whole, since it is asking for 80% of all the budget, even though it mentions that part of the proposal is covered by another proposal in Fund6, and there will be a 3rd one in Fund7 as well. Score: 4", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems to have enough experience to deliver what they are promising, since their background covers most of the areas required to develop and deliver it. The plan is well defined, some deliverables and goals are mentioned, the technical aspect is also well explained. Although, the budget is only partially broken down, and sections like 'staff budget' and 'supplies' are provided as a lump sum and it's not possible to really know the effort involved in order to assess if the budget is appropriate. Score: 4", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team presents a roadmap, and the deliverables of each step are mentioned in the proposed objectives and key results. Success metrics along the way are clear. Although, the lack of budget breakdown regarding the 'Staff Budget' mainly, but also 'Supplies', makes it a bit harder to audit the project expenditures, especially the individual participations in the project. In order to improve auditability, a more detailed budget breakout could be included.

The proposal does put forward a convincing path to conducting risk profile cybersecurity audits for stakepool operators (SPOs). The campaign brief specifies that Cardano stakeholders (users, SPOs, DApp developers, partners, Exchanges, governments, companies) need a resilient system that is able to identify and grade developing threats to its own existence. The challenge brief is wide and I would welcome a wider ranging solution that would encompass more types of threats - as a better fit as it would cover more ground and would represent a better fit to the scope of the challenge.  The risk profile audit will help identify and grade  developing threats - but will inherently be limited by its narrow scope. It targets cybersecurity risks specifically and I think it addresses that narrow segment competently. The proposing team proposes a \"Risk Profile for Cardano stakepool operators who manage individual nodes across the network\". BTW, it is not clear to me from this sentence whether the focus will be stakepool operators who manage \"individual nodes\" only or does the scope also include stakepool operators who manage \"multiple nodes\" - meaning multiple pools, but this does not detract from the score (I presume it means all SPOs). \r\n\r\nMaybe there could be space for using the experience gained in developing templates for independent Stakepool node assessment - for other elements of the Cardano ecosystem as well? Or trying to widen the project to cover more threat sources in a similar fashion? \r\n\r\nUltimately, the proposed solution does not address other novel, emerging systemic threats to the Cardano ecosystem. Other important threat sources, include economic and social threats, or regulatory sources, or operational issues related to the structure of Cardano and its components, major stakeholders, market destabilizing activities, attempts to destabilize the chain from other sources, etc... \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think that the proposers of this challenge are an impressive combination. The right mix of theoretical experience, practical experience in running a stakepool and technology risk professional experience. The proposers' solution is to develop a Risk Profile Cybersecurity Audit for SPOs using NIST, ENISA, and ISO cybersecurity standards. These standards are publically referenced and the proposal includes links to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ENISA Cybersecurity Standards and Certification, and the ISO Information Security Management System (ISMS) Standards. I think that the proposal seems feasible, well in the competencies of the proposing team and would provide some great value. There is something I noticed too. According to the scoring criteria for feasibility a feasible proposal has considered the following aspect as well: (The proposal clearly explains technical aspects like architecture, language and technologies if they are crucial for implementation.). So, while the NIST, ENISA and ISO standards are referenced with links, I was trying to explore to learn more about the proposed integration of Cardano stakepools onto the NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool. The tool is not presented in any detail in the proposal and its significance is not explained, so I tried searching for it on my own. From where I am based (on Sep 11) a Google Search reveals only one result (https://noxmon.com/), when I open the webpage I see a page for what is presented as a technology & cyber risk management company. However, the company's page is full of placeholder (dummy) text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without meaningful content. The Case Studies page on this website (http://noxmon.com/project/consumer-products/ ) is non-existent, while the Testimonials page (https://noxmon.com/testimonials/) is full of John Doe (\"Lorem Ipsum\") quotes. Effectively, I am not able to get a picture of what is NOXMON C2RM -  the proposers have not explained to voters the importance of the NOXMON C2RM integration for stakepools and no relevant links have been provided. This NOXMON C2RM integration roughly accounts for one-third of the budget - so this part of the budget is now hanging on a lack of relevant and reliable information. It requires a leap of faith (not a good sign  -when trust needs to be implied, instead of being documented). As for the rest of the budget, the budget is well presented for a proposal of this size and relatable to the activities that are proposed. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, as regards clarity and auditability, or effectively the ability to audit the progress and success there are is some good and some not so good. A roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement has been provided and Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal are there too. But not all key metrics are clear (See NOXMON C2RM below). As regards the solution's clarity, I think that it clearly falls short of addressing a wider scope of problems/threats for the Cardano ecosystem as I feel the spirit of the challenge requires. The proposed solution also lacks links to explain or reference the importance of using the proposed NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool, but that would not be a problem if a simple Google Search were to reveal the answer. Unfortunately, a Google Search opens up more questions about NOXMON C2RM than it answers and - voters would probably want more explanation for this segment that accounts for a third of the budget. So, effectively, I think this proposal would benefit from the team explaining what does NOXMON C2RM provide and why has it been chosen over other solutions. The NOXMON company's page is full of placeholder (dummy) text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without meaningful content, no commercial products are visible and the testimonial and other page are effectively placeholders.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_35", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal takes a standards approach to targeting threats to stakepool operators. This is on-theme with the challenge brief, however the approach isn't validated with any rationale in the project description. For instance, why is a \"psychometric evaluation of the key areas of risk \" a better approach than any other? There are also some elements of the proposal that are a little hard to follow. For example, references to the NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool are made but it isn't clear why this tool is best suited for the job. Additionally, while the SPOCRA website is referenced, the reference to \"Photrek\" team is't elaborated on.  It is true that the companion proposal in the Disaster: When all is a Stake challenge  has some more details, but considered in isolation the proposal was unclear to me.
