I am a bit unclear about what the core building block will solve. The main challenge of bringing an analog product like traditional trust into digital trustless world should solve the issue of verification of conditions to be satisfied, e.g. someone passing away. Though I am not suggesting that the proposal to outline to solution, I expect a bit more detail on the challenges to overcome in mvp use cases. \r\n\r\nAlso, the proposal currently seems to be only discusing the first half of the scenario where ownership is assumed by a trust. It seems to be missing to discuss the second half where the ownership passes on to the heir(s) without which a reasonable mvp cannot be drawn on the napkin. If this is a conscious decision to exclude from the current building block, let's make it explicit for easier assessment.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Though I am a big fan of the idea, and RBM.dev's experience and drive, crisp use case(s) that the mvp would solve is the key to knowing when we arrive at a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in the earlier section, let's crisp up the mvp and understand what use case(s) the first building block will achieve.
