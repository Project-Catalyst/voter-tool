It would have been a better fit for 'partnerships for global adoption' because creating a control system built on Cardano to manage pipeline control security could be implemented literally everywhere around the world. Not limiting the creation of such a system to just one nation would increase community influx, benefit and scalability. The idea of integrating infrastructural services on the blockchain as a whole is interesting, though. If successful, the ecosystem could tap into a whole new market. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer claims relevant experience in the oil and gas industry. However, it is still unknown how there would be an incentive for a nation to implement this. As is, the proposal proposes just an exploratory study of what the possibilities could be. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are a lot of details in the plan, somewhat indicating that the relevant experience is true. \r\nThere is nothing provided to determine the rest. No roadmap, links to organisations, ... \r\nFuthermore, there is no breakdown of the requested budget. What would happen with the 20k USD exactly and why this amount? \r\nA proposal like this needs a risk assessment. We are dealing with security here, what if the system wouldn't work as planned? What if the nation that hosts the pipeline isn't interested in cooperating?

Since you're, as I understood, not part of the crypto environment itself nether is a dev from cardano community, I'm wondering if this quantity of money is enough to engage a Plutus/Haskell developer helping you to disentangle this control's mechanis.\r\n- That being said, I wonder why are you going to need this $20K.
