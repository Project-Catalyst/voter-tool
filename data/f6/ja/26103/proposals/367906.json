Being participants in the Plutus pioneer program is also a good indicator. \r\nHowever, today most states have implemented their own payment and tracking systems for taxation.

The proposal articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for the stakeholders (in deep detail for users, professional and so on.. ).\r\nAt the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is only specified with implementation and not throught business case that support economic model (eg. revenues of the tax service provider, cost related to the service,\u2026).\r\nHowever the objective of the proposal is interesting, but I think it's important to improve details about the solution for the challenge (eg. with business case support).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team is completed skilled and have a very good technical knowledge, so in my opinion will able to make surely a good pilot or MVP (SPOs, Community members, Plutus pioneer)\r\nFurthermore then plan proposed is only research plan as a startup phase, so it's good as approach, but not completed with enough details.\r\nThe metrics for the assessment isn't given, so it's impossible to assess what the proposer wants to do, but the success of his actions is poor defined.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones (incl. time horizon) are weakly described.

This dApp would allow businesses to automate their tax payments. One thing that is a concern for me is what would you do if taxing authorities won't accept ADA as a payment? It seems like for this dApp to work that this is a big gamble to make. Since you want to make this for businesses I feel like the proposal is missing a critical part of the challenge settings and that is to attract as many users as possible to the platform. Wouldn't it have been better to start with the normal working class?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have confidence that the proposers can work out this idea with the experience they have. However, there are some red flags. First off is the budget breakdown, it would've been more helpful to split up the budget into different sections. Now you just ask for a total of $25.000 which isn't really transparent. Next and final would be the gamble previously mentioned, what is the alternative if this doesn't work out. Risk analysis on this would greatly benefit the proposal.
