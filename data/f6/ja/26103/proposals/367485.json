Who is going to verify or sign those records affirming that they're legit?

But this proposal isn't developed enough to really address the challenge. It does make a case for why it might theoretically lead to a \"novel and viable app\" as the challenge says; but it gives little practical detail about what it's actually going to build and how. The challenge setting also focuses a lot on profitability \u2013 so rather than just talking about the size of the potential market, some detail on projected profit would really help address the challenge. Also, the proposal seems very targeted towards the US or other countries where the patient owns their own medical data (which is not the approach taken in every country), and where healthcare is privatised and therefore the patient's financial info is relevant.

A time-plan, with dates., or even just a rough roadmap of  the stages involved in delivering the project and what order they come in, so we can see what depends on what, is also pretty necessary to enable us to assess feasibility; ideally this would include some key points along the way where we could assess whether things are on target,.

But above all, the proposer should look at the challenge setting, and decide which of the metrics suggested there are best applicable to the proposal and how they would measure them.
