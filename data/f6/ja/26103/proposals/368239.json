Also you need to get a team behind you that can help realize this dream.\r\nThere are a few similar proposals on here. Joining one of them could benefit you both. I suggest joining Cardano music streaming Dapp. He is solving a few extra solutions, but he lacks the DAO idea. Your team would still need developers as well and I suggest you find them ASAP. At least before the next funding round. That will increase your chances for funding exponentially.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Having the full team needed for this project on board will make building a roadmap with KPIs and a solid plan in general so much easier.

A streaming service that supports the musicians of the world is quite clever. Really goes down to the fundamentals of blockchain by removing the middle men and increasing the end users experience. That being said in its current form this proposal is an idea, not a full blown project. There is a ton of great ideas from better royalty distribution to governance features to token holders but there isn't quite enough depth to say that this proposal effectively addresses the Dapps & Integration challenge. The \"Detailed Plan\" portion is rather sparse, it offers more of a summary of the project as opposed to diving into the nitty gritty details. As mentioned I really like the core idea! I would recommend providing further information as to how everything will function and specifically how it will work to increase adoption of the Cardano blockchain. If your proposal doesn't get funded this round definitely try again in fund7, just be sure to put a great deal of time and effort into it so this idea becomes a project! For the reasons mentioned I have rated this with 3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The idea is great but in its current form there isn't a plan in place to make everything possible. At the moment there is a lack of context around how this idea will become a product that can hit the market and start onboarding the musicians of the world to a better and more sustainable streaming service. I would recommend adding in the following to the \"Detailed Plan\" section:\r\n- In-depth description of all features within the product along with the standard user flow through them\r\n- Description of token system including information on how royalties will work,  total supply, distribution model, staking feature, etc. This can be included in a google doc that has a viewable link pasted into the proposal.\r\n- Budget and roadmap that explains the step by step process in which the product will be built so there is an understanding of the projects timeline. This should include a description of how much this roadmap will cost.\r\n- Further explanation of the team needed to make this possible including descriptions of anyone currently involved.\r\n- Tech stack that will be used.\r\n- A go-to-market strategy that explains how this product will onboard users.\r\n- Key metrics to measure over a 3, 6, and 12 month span.\r\nI think your proposal would be very strong if you added the above ideas along with some more to fully flesh out the proposal. Additionally the \"Relevant Experience\" section provided notifies the reader that you are in the industry but not a signal as to how experienced you are in it. Something as simple as stating the number of years worked in the industry along with the people/projects you have worked with and on can go a long way to establishing credibility. Highly encourage taking another swing at this proposal in fund7, but due to the lack of a plan and understanding of your experience in the industry I have rated this with 1 star.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Despite being a great idea there isn't enough information provided to have the capacity to audit the proposals progress and potential success of it. That being said this is easily fixed! Including detailed descriptions of all interactions associated with your project and then key metrics that match those interactions could make this proposal highly auditable. For example if you included the feature of publishing a song to the streaming platform and detailing how that is done from the users perspective. Combine this with a key metric of \"Number of songs published\" or \"Total royalty payouts made to artists\" and then include a projection of what that will be like over a 3, 6, and 12 month timeline. This gives the reader a nice sense of the goals you set and how much adoption you think it will bring. Because there is currently a lack of information and therefore an inability to audit the proposal I am rating this as a 1 star. Don't get discouraged though! You have an amazing idea that could easily see success once a good bit of effort is put in.

Will there be blockchain based governance strategies decided upon by Ada token holders?  Etc.\r\n\r\nThe proposer is trying to show the link between their proposal and the Cardano ecosystem:\r\n\r\n\"This will all happen almost seamlessly on the blockchain. While holding and staking the native token, listeners will help keep the network secure and given rights to vote on certain issues such as changes to royalty rates.\"\r\n\r\nBut these are general statements that indicate ambition and not a serviceable design or the experience and skills voters need to see to be able to make an informed decision on a project that is asking for a significant amount of funds from the Cardano treasury.\r\n\r\nAgain, this is a powerful idea that could help many artists.  If the proposer is passionate about this project, than I hope that they do the footwork necessary to provide a winning proposal in F7 and get the funds that they need.  I look forward to that new proposal.  I strongly suggest the proposer looks at some of the proposals that got funded in past rounds to see what they should do in F7.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_551", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Not enough details on how the system would work and integrate with Cardano.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Missing significant implementation details.
