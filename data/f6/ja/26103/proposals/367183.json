It's great to see blockchain, moreover, Cardano being used and thought in projects which aims to help people around the world.\r\n- One point that I've not understand is that in this proposal is mandatory the presence of an auditor, which is going to verify if that certain charity is converting the ADA (e.g.) to fiat and using to buy or building the thing it was supposed to. Therefore, isn't it a problem for scalability?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- It is noticeable, and was proved by you, that the project is feasible, however I have some points:\r\na) it seems to me that if you don't get funded the project will stop \u2013 or there is another method to capitalize and make it continue?\r\nb) how the auditors are going to be selected?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- The transparency given until now is amazing.\r\n- How will be chosen a trustful auditor?
