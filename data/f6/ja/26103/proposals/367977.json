On the music industry side of this project, the proposer has relevant experience and claims of contact with developers to create this platform.

The company from the proposer has a red flag for me, the company was established in 2011 yet the link provided to the company is an adobe spark website. The website provided on the social media platform to the company gets a 404. The proposal is also missing a budget breakdown which doesn't clarify why they need the 60 000. I can get behind the 30.000 needed to develop a music platform however that still leaves 30.000 unexplained. The proposer stated that he has a plan to make sure every major label will use the platform but doesn't really give a hint as to how he plans it. Two major record labels are already interested and the proposer has a commitment from a record label but doesn't give facts on which record labels these are.
