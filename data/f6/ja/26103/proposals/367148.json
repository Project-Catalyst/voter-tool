Therefore, the proposal that took me the longest to review. Let's get into it. \r\nThe overall impact of this project can be very big for Cardano and Catalyst. When it comes to Catalyst the proposer explains that it could actually be used to fund non-commercial ventures and find a way to stimulate projects that don't necessarily bring a monetary return, but a social good.\r\nThis doesn't get a five, however, due to the complexity of the ecosystem that it plans to build with 3 different coins. This is not to say that complexity is a problem, but it is more an issue here when the proposer doesn't explain when how these coins will be issued on top of Cardano. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposer put in a lot of work in making sure the plan was specific and feasible, however, there are some missing elements. \r\nLet's start with the positives. \r\nThe project plan and milestones are very detailed and seem to be achievable. This is especially true because a large bulk of the research and work seems to have been done. I would have to say, however, that the white paper is not very easy to read when it comes to the technical parts. I had a harder time reading this than many peer-reviewed academic articles published by Cardano, so I would recommend some refinement to be done.\r\nFinally, I am missing a link to see the background of Nikita (the proposer). Given for now he is a solo founder it would have been good to understand his background and experience to understand if he has the capabilities of building this. This is especially important for a project like this that is very complex and requires a strong CTO or mathematician from the start to create models.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer provides a clear step-by-step plan with different milestones as previously mentioned as well as potential challenges or risks he might encounter. However, for this to become truly auditable I am missing some key elements especially for a project of this caliber. There are no clear KPIs in the proposal showing what the platform could or should generate in regards to user adoption or a number of projects being listed on Samurai. \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_473", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal is fitting for the challenge. I really like the proposal, there are some really interesting ideas forming on top of the Tera network like rewarding investors for staking.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, there are no mentions of any concrete people that would do the actual technical work. There are no mentions of companies or people to be hired and a project of such magnitude needs more people to work on it, and the fact that there isn't a mention of that but rather of C-level executives who are also missing at this point is really bothering me. This brings the credibility of the whole proposal down a bit.\r\nFrom reading the white paper I see that the idea for incentivizing the investors alongside the power multiplier is based on top of the Tera network, which is good, but unlike the Tera network, there are a few unanswered questions: \r\n* there already is a problem with stablecoins that are not fully backed by cash but rather there's an algorithm that tries to peg them. Here's a detailed explanation on what the problems with algorithmic stablecoins are: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUokre-szPg and why it's very hard to find the balance between Blue Coint and Centia Coin in this proposal using the AMM.\r\n* on page 5 from the provided whitepaper there is the sentence: \"As organisations successfully complete more milestones, the organisational Trust levels,\r\nincrease on a scale from 0 to 3.\" which is bothersome because if the network is dynamic the scale should be dynamic as well instead of the range 0 - 3. The platform would have a really hard time coping if the Dapps reach all their respective KPIs and their power is essentially set to a permanent 3 which would greatly disrupt the system which is exactly what happened with Iron token in the linked video above.\r\n* the word \"seigniorage\" mentioned in the whitepaper meaning \"profit made by a government by issuing currency...\" which is worrisome because that issuing would be a volatility problem if your original assumption from the whitepaper that:\r\n\"The Supply of Centia Coin has a maximum target of 30 million. The supply of Centia\r\nalternates depending on econonmic expansions and contractions oscillating around the 30\r\nmillion mark. Therefore the supply of Centia is naturally scarce.\" \r\nis not met. There is no mathematical proof that the Centia coin would be able to keep its 30 million target.\r\n* Another thing I was wandering about is the freedom the Dapps have to set their own KPIs, which is not regulated enough by the investors IMHO.\r\n\r\nI'd love it if the proposer put a more detailed breakdown of the budget as in the current form it's not very auditable. There's no mention of any breakdown for any specific expenses. The legal fees for example may vary from 5k to 500k but there's no argumentation on the more than average price choice for legal fees. This applies to the other budget points as well.\r\n\r\nI very much like that you have plans to self-fund in the future but that does not negate the fact that the funds you ask for are the whole available funds for the whole challenge, which IMO wouldn't be more valuable than the iterative benefits multiple other proposals can make on the ecosystem for the combined challenge price.\r\n\r\nOverall it's a very nice idea but I think there's more to think about implementation and budget-wise.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As I mentioned there's no mention of any concrete person or plan for execution on the technical part of the project.\r\nThe only metric I found is the broad Q1-2 amidst a 4-year roadmap, which is not enough if the community members want to track the development of the project.\r\nAs a suggestion I'd recommend having a more concrete short term plan alongside what you already have as an idea. Find the right people to get the job done or a company to hire that will have the right credentials and link them in the next proposal you make, as I believe that will bring greater credibility to the whole proposal. \r\nAnother suggestion is to have the whitepaper looked at by expects in a true Cardano scientific manner.\r\nGood luck.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u306fROI\u3092\u975e\u8ca8\u5e63\u7684\u4fa1\u5024\u3068\u7d50\u3073\u3064\u3051\u3001\u6295\u8cc7\u5bb6\u304c\u5229\u76ca\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u793e\u4f1a\u306b\u4fa1\u5024\u3092\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3059\u516c\u5171\u8ca1\u306b\u8cc7\u91d1\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "CEO\uff1a\u30cb\u30ad\u30fc\u30bf\u30fb\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30eb - \u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u601d\u8003\u3001\u7d4c\u6e08\u5b66\u8005\u3001\u8d77\u696d\u5bb6\n\n\u30a8\u30b3\u30ce\u30df\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30a2\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fcTBA\n\nCTOTBA\n\nCMO: TBA"}
