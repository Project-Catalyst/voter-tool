", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal puts forward a timeline with a budget of development and integration costs. The timeline indicates that the launch is in Q4 of 2022, and fairly logical steps at each high level stage, however it would have been useful to know what was happening within each stage of the roadmap in greater detail. Such as what is the development approach, what steps it involves and who is going to be doing that work. The team that would be integrating the project has not been made public. This would have given me a clearer understanding of whether or not success could be achieved.  ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It may be difficult to track the progress of the project from a community prospective since Monate dosen't have a large web footprint from what I can see.

Besides the conglomerates who dominate this industry, often running systems in many countries, there are also the more shady scalping industry who take advantage of ticket scarcity. This DApp certainly falls into this challenge and can forward Cardano's mission in this very ubiquitous service. This proposal presents an opportunity for Cardano to penetrate sporting events, cinema and theatre, concerts and festivals and even your local fete if marketed correctly and the right partnerships are formed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, pertinent information which could have informed on this project's chances for success are missing. The proposer has failed to state their bona fides and experiences in either the ticketing industry or in technical development, be it in blockchain or otherwise. A large part of the proposal was devoted to an explanation of the problem and the rationale for the proposed solution. There were no examples given of past projects, no Linkedin profiles or the like, which could have given this assessment a sense of the abilities of the proposer on delivering the end product. A quarterly roadmap for 2022 was presented with relatively understandable details but there were no measures for success presented, which could have added confidence to this assessment. I recommend that should this proposal miss out on funding this round, that it be revisited with more details on the activities from each quarterly milestone as well as a list of what success could look like. Adding the proposer/s previous experiences and skillset would also be beneficial, as well as any other members of the team, particularly from the technical side who would have validated some of the technical developments presented here.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal certainly presented milestones or builds at each quarter with matching dollar values and this could form the basis of a possible audit. However, and as state by the proposer him/herself, the team is yet to be recruited. This places a question mark on the validity of the requested budget itself as it does not leave any room for a difference in fees for say, the API developer who may expect a higher payment than what is allocated for the job. This lack of granular detail endangers the funding amount requested. I suggest this proposal is revisited at a later funding round with a full team recruited even on an MoU, to solidify the amount of funding needed. It could also lead to a more detailed development/deployment path with more accurate timelines and more measurable points for success.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_42", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 6, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal is for developing a Cardano-based API service to sell tickets for events and other activities.

First, there are no details about the team and experience, I would have liked to see details about who is behind this and their background with APIs and the event industry. Second, the timeline seems arbitrary and does not go into detail in, for example, the number of people needed to develop the software. Third, step 1 aims to use Q4 of 2021 to do \"Deployment & Development research\" and would only cost 200$, this seems not proportional to what usual research for this type of project. Having been involved in prototyping a marketplace built on a blockchain network I would estimate this to be at least 10x higher regardless of where you are based geographically.\r\nLastly, the roadmap and plan do not explain what technologies will be used, front-end and back-end and, challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation were not considered.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "While the roadmap does provide milestones with \"dates' and approximate budget requirements for each, factors that ensure auditing are lacking.
