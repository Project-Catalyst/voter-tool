That's a good start of a proposal but the solution statement does not speak to how that problem will be solved. Further more, no information is provided in the \"Detailed Plan\" section. This makes it difficult to understand how the proposal could be impactful in the Dapps & Integrations challenge and therefore effects its capacity to drive users. I would highly recommend trying to submit a proposal in the next fund after doing a deep dive into what your TCG will be. I am a huge gamer myself and would love to encourage proposals in the gaming space! It is just a necessity to have a detailed and exciting plan in place first, especially for a larger budgetary ask.

This includes all features and the user experience of them \r\n- Roadmap and budget that shows how funds will be spent and at what time. Roadmap should display timeline of project with specifics on what the development steps are and how long it will take to complete each one\r\n- Further explanation of the team involved with details on exactly what they bring to the table\r\n- Go to Market Strategy that shows how you will bring in users and retain them\r\n- Metrics you can measure to determine success of the project along with predictions for 3 month, 6 month, and 12 months for each metric\r\nAgain I really wanna encourage you to submit a proposal in Fund7 that is well thought out and contains the recommendations I provided!
