This project has the potential to scale and benefit a huge community. Driving more people to use Cardano. To be resilient to future challenges and to incorporate all the features you mentioned it would be beneficial to turn this project into a DAO. That would make it a true decentralized marketplace and even more attractive to potential active community members.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposal needs more team members to contribute to the plan on building this marketplace. Seeing an already established committed team with links to showcase their experience will boost confidence in CAs and voters. Also showing of prototypes of UI design and budget allocation will increase feasibility.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal is a prototype and I believe if it gains more active team members the roadmap and milestones will become clear. Potential risks and challenges needs to be considered as well. How would you address fake profiles? and people posting someone else's work as their own.

But the solution lacks a clear, measurable and feasible plan to make it happen, so I cannot agree neither disagree that it can address the challenge. I suggest you work on the HOW you will make it happen, providing a timeline (3, 6, 12 months) with intended deliverables. A budget breakdown with realistic estimates, to develop the platform, but also to take the platform to the market (How are you going to get authors? How are you going to get buyers? Solving the chicken and the egg problem is key for any platform, so that go to market strategy should be part of your proposal to understand its feasibility). I believe the amount requested is rather low for such a project which makes me doubt on the potential success of it as it is presented.\r\nIf the proposal does not get funded, I suggest you work on the details and present it at next funding round, as I think with the proper plan you could have a great platform with great impact for the cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is no detailed plan presented, neither clear deliverables.

Nonetheless, it is difficult and ambitious to fight this on your own. Let alone with funding of $10000. A question that pops up in my head is how plausible is the dApp going to provide high numbers/growth to the platform. Creating a marketplace for E-books is a good idea but why do you include all the extra features? I would focus on the core of the proposal and not included all the extra features. This way you can make a better proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer says that he has experience in publishing en writing books but does not provide the necessary links to back up this statement.

I would've like to see a full debriefing about how you plan to implement this idea and how you want to bring it to life. What do you need to make this proposal work(developers, market research,...). Since there is no funding breakdown of timetable we are left with empty words on how this is going to work. For what do you need funding, when do you see yourself starting on the project and how do you plan to move forward. The biggest issue I have with the proposal is that you have already participated in Fund3 and that nothing has changed since then.
