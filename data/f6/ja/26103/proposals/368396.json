However unique algorithms and experiments in DEX can bring about the advantages of the third generation features of Cardano.

To improve auditability for the community I recommend to add success metrics like number of user after a certain amount of time. In addition to that, I recommend providing a documentation source (like Github, etc.) to enable the community to observe the progress of this project. Also, I would like to see more reflection about potential challenges that might (or probably will) occur, as this is a mathematical complex solution, and how to avoid/overcome those challenges.
