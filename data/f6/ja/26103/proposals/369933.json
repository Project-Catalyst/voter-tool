It would also be essential for the author to demonstrate the intention of forming a team, because it would be necessary, in addition to programming people, a UI/UX designer, someone from advertising to make this idea known to the people, someone who understood blockchain and everything about the Cardano universe and also someone to keep in touch with the charities.
