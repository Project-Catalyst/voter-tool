The authors already have experience with the creation and transaction of NFT, as we can see from their previous works, which involve the creation of NFT for drawings and paintings (they can be verified through the attached website, madinart). Therefore, it is positive that they intend to expand the use of NFT to other fields, as mentioned, for example, in sports and literature, attracting new users to the Cardano ecosystem. The authors are also aware that NFT transactions are complex for most people, as can be seen from the passage quoted here). It is also extremely relevant, because facilitating and getting this information to more people is certainly a powerful way to attract new users. In addition, we can be sure how the work done so far, NFT in fine arts, was useful and successful, through the artists' testimonials, which were attached.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team involved in the proposal is very confident in terms of technical preparation to execute the project. In addition to having access to the work they have done so far, through the attached website and the included videos as well, there is a particular description of who they are, what each member does. It is a very complete team, which has people for the most diverse functions. Although we know who they are, it would be even better if we could have access to the linkedin of each involved, or even social networks, some place where we could get to know each one's particular work. However, due to the fact that they already have successful activities using NFT and a ready and functional platform, the credibility of the team is solid.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the proposal's applicability, we have several positive points and some details to improve. The authors clearly specify what their main goals are, which are to create videos and short documents on topics relevant to the Cardano community, such as the importance of cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, NFT, and so on. They also explain where the financing money would go, rather superficially. We are told what the spending needs would be, but not how much each would require. ? They also claim to have the intention to monitor activities over time, but do not say how often this monitoring would take place or where the data would be provided to the community. In fact, it is not at all clear where the content created would be published, it is always good to make it clear how this contact would be established between the public and the project. Another detail I missed was setting dates, a temporal sense of how things would happen. The authors explain how much money would be needed per month, but they do not say how long the content would be created, when they would be released, how much time each would receive to promote the next content. For these reasons, I believe we have a good, but not complete, notion of how this project would happen in practice.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "It is a magneficent idea and the team appears to have the passion for it.
