In this way, the Cardano community would benefit, because its blockchain would be used in a new way, and especially the submarine branch, which, as they say in the proposal, has difficulty in gathering and accessing its contents.

And not enough, the pair is interested in hiring other professionals, including self-employed developers, to work on the project's progress. It's a super complex idea, so as much as the duo is totally capable and prepared, it's positive that they intend to hire other people as well.
