Obviously climate change is a relevant topic that this proposal addresses in their problem statement and the suggested solution is feasable. The proposer give an example how other blockchains integrated projects on this topic and provided information how and why they would approach this differently. It would have been interesting if they would have provided some data on the existing project to be able to see how much traction it received.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "While the two proposers have both developer skills (plutus pioneer) as well as connections to forrestry projects, the team is at the moment not complete since a front end and back end developer and a data scientist is missing and implementation is not guaranteed. The roadmap does not provide information about how these position will be filled - especially with the first milestone being one month after funding.

If this proposal would work together mostly through the company that Jeremy works at, maybe this would provide an outreach on this topic. Clarification on possible outreach/marketing/social media would have been relevant, not only for auditability. Auditability could be improved by adding a number of either initiatives that the team will be reaching out to or a number of sellers that they plan to onboard to their marketplace. The team should also add documentation via github or set up a discord/telegram or any other channel that could be used to provide information to the community and maybe connect with people in the community that would be able to support with outreach. If outreach will be done through Terraformation, the proposers should be transparent how the cooperation would look like.

I would like to see the budget developed beyond single line entries and broken down into monthly spending and connected to the monthly deliverables.

To think that we can finally reach a point where technology and mankind can go hand in hand and work towards such an important goal is amazing. To be honest, at first, I was skeptical because most proposals (outside of the Cardano ecosystem as well) are kind of idealistic. We all want a better world, but this proposal has not only the way to do it but the economic incentive as well.

Unlike many other proposals, there is no lack of credentials that can be checked online and companies whose work can be proven and related to the people mentioned in the proposal.

I think it can be given as an example that, a proposal doesn't need to be 3 pages long to be meaningful and yet not lack any important details like timetable breakdown alongside finance tables and breakdowns.\r\nThere are clear KPIs to be followed unlike many other proposals, and the only thing I might suggest to the proposers is to put a GitHub repo or a link to a place where the progress could be followed by anyone because that might bring in useful people and expertise to the project in the future.\r\nI really like the solution section because it's just as complicated as it needs to be. It explains why just planting a tree is not enough without having the economic balance in mind. It paints a picture of both producer and consumer or CO2 emissions.\r\nSimple yet understandable timeframes and goals. As a developer myself, I think their timetable concerning the application development is doable.\r\nThis project utilizes all strengths of the Cardano ecosystem (tokens, decentralization as well as the use of smart contracts).\r\nThe proposal gives a lot of useful information that can be used to educate oneself about the current state of the environment as well as what organizations are doing about it. It's a beautiful idea to build on top of someone's work to further the end result. Recognizing that this is not a zero-sum game makes this project extremely valuable.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is one of the sections where I rarely can give the maximum points based on lack of explanation and education on where the money is going and why.

This is overlooked by a lot of other proposals and it's an integral part in my opinion of any excellent proposal.
