Phase I online bidding and business discovery have a strong case for online use. Phase II is for ERP which is not directly exploiting blockchain and the proposer plans to open source the code. And Phase II is for the Enterprise service bus, which will enable sharing of selected internal details over the blockchain which will establish trust with characteristics of nonrepudation. There's is a substantial use case for such a comprehensive Enterprise solution that can establish cross-organisation data exchange to establish capability.

They seem to have isolatable tasks and are better if the deliverables are incremental and independent of future phases.

With the context I have, others don't mean much and should be explained.\r\nI dislike that the company hasn't got a plan for self-funding before the last phase of the proposal, which is way too late when everything will be up and running which might take 2 to 3 years for phase 2 and 3.
