It would be important if the idea would attract users to the Autonomy network or to the Cardano Network and what kind of cooperation this proposal intends to form. To be honest \"We have a few interesting strategic partners that cannot be mentioned just yet!\" this quote I find somewhat worrysome, why would this proposal not disclose possible strategic partners? Is funding going to unknown wallets? If so, why and how much? And - to be honest - if the proposer wants to develop a L2 solution, why is it not mentioned in the roadmap? And why would this idea of a reality show need an extra protocol and what would this protocol solve for the Cardano Community?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal uses a lot of buzzwords (unique, never been tried before, can not yet be disclosed, vision....)to attract attention but it does not provide relevant information that would be needed to assess if implementation is likely and if implementation would even add value to the Community. The proposal does  not provide relevant information about the qualification and experience of the crazy startup, prior work is not included. The roadmap does not include the development of the L2 solution that is mentioned by the proposer. Why does the roadmap only include the actionable steps of picking out startups? Again: how would the idea involve the Cardano network? Will the money go to the winner of the reality show to build an integration on Cardano? If so, it would probably still have to be voted on before implementation. Would startups that already received funding be part of the reality show and would they get additional funding? Would a token or an NFT be involved? If so, how? The budget is not broken down and at this point with the information from the roadmap, it is not clear why the proposal asks for 200.000 dollars in ADA. I think the proposers should be more transparent about \"strategic partners\" and about types of cooperations. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No. To be auditable, the proposer needs to add:\r\nNumber/growth of application output\r\nNumber/growth of application transactions\r\nTotal volume of Ada involved in application transactions\r\nTotal/growth of resource usage by applications\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the financial budget needs to be allocated to specific actionable steps that connect to the roadmap. The roadmap itself should provide information on what the team is planning to do, including information on the proposed L2 solution and why it would be needed and add value. Measures of success should be included - it does not help that 12 out of 60 startups will be announced, it would be more relevant, why these startups are announced, what the criteria for picking out the startups is, who decides which startup is good and how - is voting involved? Is a token used? Why would these startups add value to the Cardano network, how are they rewarded. Partners should be disclosed.
