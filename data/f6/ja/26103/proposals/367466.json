This proposal is written exactly the same as the website and no effort was made to rewrite it for a different audience. It is a pity as the proposer had been a CA in a previous funding round and should have been well aware of the strict requirements to enable assessors to properly vet a project. In addition, Clanity seems to be a project which aims to build on Cardano in tokenised form hence asking for funding to build its infrastructure as well as conducting a token sale seems to be double-dipping. Conventionally, projects secure funding from the token sale, so if Catalyst provides the funds instead, any amount raised and allocated to the team from the token sale purely becomes reward rather than payment for the services of building its infrastructure. This does not bode well and could be a pre-cursor to questionable tokenomics. I would suggest that this proposal is revisited for a later funding round, explain clearly the reasons why the funds are requested and clarify its impact on tokenomics due to a separate token sale. There is an upside to the presented project, however, it needs to be more Catalyst-centric so it can be properly assessed on its own merits.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has listed qualifications and past experiences but have failed to produce a link to a public profile where these credentials can be checked. I recommend a link to Linkedin.com or some other profiling site. Even the Clarity website does not provide information on individual team members with their bona fides and commonly for token-presentation sites where there is an intention to perform a token sale, who the team is, is of paramount importance as potential buyers often use this to validate whether the project and the token sale is legitimate or a scam.  The proposal describes the common trajectory of building a token-economy with timelines and roadmaps clearly presented, but it is missing the detailed information to provide confidence regarding how each of the identified amounts will be spent. I recommend that should this be re-submitted at a future funding round, that the proposer engages some of the partners identified which includes dev organisations, and secure a realistic dev costing and plan for inclusion.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "A number of missing elements contribute to the low score for its auditability; verifiable profile of the proposer and the team, detailed costing for each build element (and there are quite a few developments in its inventory), timelines of when the token sale will occur and what its impact on any funding secured from Catalyst. There are a few notable partners mentioned on the proposal who also appear on the website and with Cardano Foundation and ATALA Prism specifically named, casts doubts as to its authenticity. If this proposal is resubmitted, it may well benefit to support those claims if a mention from Cardano or Atala to attest to this partnership in either an article, or from one of the partners' social channels. Given the scale of such a project and despite its suitability to this Challenge and to Cardano's mission, there's not enough of the foundational information to give an assessor confidence that success is achievable. Do the basics well and the rest will follow. I highly recommend rewriting this proposal for a Catalyst audience, present public credentials and secure reciprocating acknowledgements from Cardano Foundation & others of any existing partnerships.

I went to the website and found that they list Cardano under \"partners and network\". It would be important to specify if this proposer is partnered with Cardano and if so, how. Also, network and partner is misleading if it is just about a general network that the proposer sympathizes with or is part of as an individual but not with the company. I would expect this to be more transparent.\r\nThis here sounds unreasonable: \"We will be reinventing the process of how businesses acquire new loyal customers. Clanity will offer efficient ways of targeting customers and effectively convert them into purchasing customers.\" Basically, what I am saying is - while the proposal raises interesting questions, sentences like the above do not provide actionable steps to solve the stated problem - they moreso seem like marketing phrases that could attract customers to acquire the services of the agency. While this might be good, further information would be needed to assess if this proposal would be likely to implement what it claims. Since this proposal requests the complete fund for this challenge, it would be important to give relevant problem statements and actionable steps including a roadmap with a timeline that would help understand why this project would be so valuable that it should be the only one to be funded in this round.
