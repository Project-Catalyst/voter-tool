I was genuinely waiting for something awesome. Then I reached the \"Why Cardano?\" section. The answer was underwhelming:\r\n\r\n\"Collude's mission statement is 'We listen'. Listening is the major part of our strategy and market approach. It's crucial to create a safe domain in which the community can easily & safely communicate their hardships and pains. Through listening, it's possible to create an environment in which knowledge is shared with the possibility to collaborate toward a common purpose or even creating \u200b\u200b a sense of urgency to help others to get involved and attain meaningful goals. Listening is the first stage in building a collective identity that is distinctive throughout the market. The Cardano Ecosystem has a lot of parallels with the goals we want to achieve and the technology stack fits perfectly to the platform.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an example of what shines through the entire proposal: the two full-time team members are very deep in the idea. They believe in what they do and they have put countless hours in planning this. That's all commendable, but the Cardano part feels pasted on. This proposal is not about a dApp per se but the idea behind it.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This plan is huge. Any amount of money requested would not be enough. In the comments section it's mentioned that main funding comes from big production companies... but that funding is not yet secured. Therefore this proposal runs the risk of pouring money into well (or into a machine like on that fantastic introduction video). The first commentator suggested scaling the proposal down but I don't see the feedback incorporated here. It's still massive. Desmond Tutu said: \"There's only one way to eat an elephant, one bite at a time.\" You need to define the first few bites and then come back with a very Cardano-specific proposal. Or perhaps you could collaborate with these guys: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369424-48088", "q1r": 3, "q2": "If I understood correctly the proposal is asking $30K to hire one or more Community Ambassadors (this is not outlined before in the proposal, so it remains unclear). The remaining $60K is earmarked for to-be-hired developers and technology partners (based on the green checkmarks I'm assuming nft-maker, mirqur.io, mukn.io and clearcontracts). It would be much easier to say \"yes\" if those developers were already part of the team. I encourage you to go back to the drawing board, focus on the blockchain / decentralized app aspect of this and make a kick-ass proposal for Fund7.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_289", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The Elephant in  4 Parts\nThere are 4 different stages to bring a movie to market:  Aquisition, Production, Licensing & Distribution.\n\nour Project is focusted on Aquisition - our future goal is to go down the rest of the value chain once aquisition is perfect in a decentralized way.\n\n\nREGARDING 30K\nYes,e the 30K is for building the community.

They are not part of the team but collaborators. As example Nft-maker.io  is will to let us use its api witch will enable us to create a Market plase for screenplays as NFT's \n\nRequested Amount:\nYes the requested amount of money will not be enough for the scope of the project. However, it will be enough for the milestones we set up. "}, {"q0": "I really love this idea and is something desperately needed in the film industry to protect all key players and roles. Although there are many risks, losses and financial liabilities involved in such a process. Although the prospect of a project like this significally enhances that industry the risks are greated than the solutions. There needs to be more work to build this up but the business plan is there and the passion is present.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The experience is shown by the wide composition of the team. More information regarding how funding for a conceptual model like this would ensue. What are the contracts and the difference is distribution of wages per role and who decides these.
