This is an important proposal to integrate new ADA holders and connect them with the SPOs.\r\nThe proposal clearly articulates the contest, the problem (new tools for cardano delegators and SPOs) and how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for all of the stakeholders. Well done that the proposers team worked for prototype that help to understand the solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer team is very well skilled about the whole context and, knows the Cardano community very well because they work as SPO, developers, Plutus pioneers and Emurgo Academy participants.\r\nThe scope of the solution is well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones, coherent KPI metrics and a defined time horizon.

You will have to scale and evolve to keep delegators from going back to CEXs with higher ROAs. Having an education portal alongside all the other info and tools in one place is good. I think you need to have some reward system in place for delegators that are on the platform. Something to keep them from going back to the CEXs. Maybe NFT drops for delegators that have staked for a very long period of time. OR rewards for staking on the empty pools, to help SPOs get more delegators. You don't have to reward SPOs as more delegators is reward enough. The main focus on rewards should go to delegators to keep them staking locally and not on a CEX. \r\nI believe this project can help alot and I would like to see what you come up with.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget allocation seems fair and straight to the point. Already committed team onboard who knows what the Ecosystem needs. Adding more info or evidence regarding team experience would strengthen voter and CA trust. The beta website is great though.

Running a stakepool alongside this project will help with incentive distribution.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Launch date and clear roadmap with milestones.\r\nDefined success with Key performance indicators.\r\nClear plan of what the platform wants to be and could become.
