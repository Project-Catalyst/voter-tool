Besides that, there are more tradional ways to check fruits and vegetables quality.\r\nA small business case could ellaborated considering the audience the proposer wants to target and what would be the price increase on the products if solution is implemented in larger scale, to convince otherwise - and, of course, considering also how much it would be saved with product conservation (maybe a rough estimation net present value).\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea is good, I see it working better for more value added product (wines, whiskey, beers, special meats, seasonings) - of couse, one can start on vegetables and fruits and easily expand to other products, but why not starting in one with more commercial appeal?

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Reading this proposal as it stands it is difficult to gauge the level of experience in relation to loT devices being utilised in the fruit and vegetable industry.

The budget figures do not add up to the requested amount and it is difficult to gauge success of the proposal without specific details about outcomes and what will be produced.

That would have to take into account the supply chain management process of all the worlds producers and align them to have the same standard of markers and IoT devices to keep track of the quality of goods transported, which seems almost impossible to me. A suggestion in that regard would be to talk to a single supplier and start off small as a proof of concept and maybe later move on to more suppliers and later on different countries.\r\nI like the idea about the application thata would be able to digitize the data seen on the marked products once everything is in place (the packages already have a QR code or other marker, and the user will be able to see the history of the product since it was marked) although the author has his job cut out for him.\r\nI don't understand the general plan to install IoT products. Where would those products be installed? Let's take an example of a single thermometer put in a truck to track the temperature is kept bellow a certain degree to ensure product  quality. In this scenario what happens if a different truck is used to supply the product? How about if there are 10 different trucks, are you going to get 10 devices for the 10 trucks. If one of them breaks who is going to repear them? A lot of unanswered questions pop into mi mind, and these are just a few of them, which meet no explanation in the proposal.\r\nI think it's a nice idea, but it needs a lot more planning and thinking through, before there's a working solution.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is not information provided on any KPIs or any traceability so I'd say there's no sufficient way to audit the progress of the proposal development.

In the future it would help if data such as, the potential targeted market to be identified in some form therefore making it capable of assessing the numbers of potential users.

This also follows through on the timeline, which might seem too general and may cause confusion. Having a clearly defined process may assist the assessors from refraining doing guesswork.
