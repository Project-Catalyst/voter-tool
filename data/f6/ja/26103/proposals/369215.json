It is proposing to create a Catalyst like Dap for matching Entrepreneurs with investors.  Where as Catalyst uses a community fund, this proposal seeks to build investment pools from private individuals/venture capitalists.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea presented is good, if this team does not build it I am sure it will be built eventually.  The plan is not overly detailed which detracts in the sense of assessing it's viability.  I would like to see some bullet points showing a breakdown of costs and some milestones along the roadmap.  There is no prototype so we are at the very early stages of development.  $40,000 USD requested seems a reasonable to get the project off the ground.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Key Performance Indicators are not defined in the proposal.  The budget breakdown is brief but ok.  However it is going to difficult for a 3rd party to gauge progress without milestones being given at the 3, 6 and 12 month intervals mentioned in the proposal.

Just to put things in perspective, as long as there isn't any proof of combined 45 years of experience, these are just words that have no weight behind them. I'd suggest to the proposer, to put some links that will justify those words as other proposers are already doing and linking their linked in profiles or the companies they plan on hiring or any other kind of proof.\r\nOne thing I like is the whole process will be audited and community-driven, but I don't see any cons for the entrepreneurs, unlike the lenders (might lose money or the auditors who can be slashed) which seems a bit unfair. I think some more thought can be put in about the balance of the roles and the power that each role will have so real governance is present.\r\nThe roadmap is a bit broad, but this can be overlooked for the lack of experience in making proposals. \r\nThe budget breakdown can be done a lot better by giving a breakdown of hiring costs and renting costs.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since there aren't any links of repositories or real people that can be checked or audited I find it difficult to say there is sufficient information to audit the progress of the solution. As a suggestion for the proposer, I'd say to put themselves in the shoes of a community member that wants to follow the progress of the implementation. A blog post with hard data or another progress update by the project managers or devs would really help in that regard. \r\nAnother thing missing is KPIs, which can be really helpful if you're serious and result-driven.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal identifies a gap in the traditional funding modal I think it's smart to use stablecoins as the preferred payment method given that the price fluctuations in volatility of ADA may prove to be a hinderence to the businesses getting the funding.\r\n\r\nThe proposal also mentions an ICO - does it intend to launch as a registered security as most ICOs likely will be categorised at some point as securities. Perhaps this would be better suited as an IDO?
