Moreover, bingo is famous all around the world and it's quite popular in several countries \u2013 and I liked the explanation given of the birthing of the idea (created a methodology for a casino caller). Thus, I think that this game could increase the utility and adoption of Cardano.\r\n- The key metrics are well defined and are simple to track.\r\n- One point that was not clear to me is that it seems that the platform will distribute the bingo token. Therefore, it seems to me that will come to a time that you'll runoff of these tokens, which may compromise the scalability. Or the caller is going to put his Tokens into the prize alongside with ADA or SCs?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "- Although there isn't any information about the proposer, the proposal seems to have some stuff already developed, which is a good thing. However, it would be good to have something or, even, some link which directs to the real game developed to the Casino Manager.\r\n- The budget is only allocated in prize, as incentive. However, wouldn't it be good to separate some part of this money to marketing in order to achieve more people at the starting point? One good thing to do is create some big events (with marketing and prizes) monthly in the platform that could engage a huge number of players.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "- The metrics shown are very reasonable and easy to track.\r\n- One problem that might appear is, you're asking for USD 10K to provide as prize and incentive to start the project running in a great scale. However, it could be very poorly distributed among the games. For example: If I create a group (being the caller) and start to create several games just to win and distribute the prizes as I want. How can the platform prevent such act? How will be the prize distributed? How much will be defined as a good prize to start with (10K is going to last how many games?)", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The idea is very interesting and meets the objectives of the challenge, because it presents us with an alternative to the traditional bingo game, which will use blockchain technology and ada rewards as differentials, making the activity attract new ones users for the Cardano ecosystem. What is very positive here is the fact that the game and the platform are practically ready, as we can see through the attached link. Although it doesn't use ada and blockchain for a very high number of transactions, if the game gains popularity it could attract a different audience to the ecosystem: people interested in gambling, and not necessarily in cryptocurrency technology and investment. By bringing this alternative to the public and being practically ready, I believe that this proposal is very relevant and if it is managed in a correct and constant manner, it can grow and benefit the community a lot.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the team's ability to execute the proposal, we are not provided with much information about the team that set up the site. We are told that the team has people experienced in blockchain, games, software development and so on. However, we do not know who the members are, how many, who does what, examples of previous work... It would be positive if we knew how many people are on the team, their names, the individual formation of each one, etc. Despite this, we can be sure that they understand well about the creation of the game itself and the website, through the contents that are attached, both the website itself and the video on youtube, which explains how the game works. Regarding the roadmap, we have everything very well detailed, including where the use of Ada and NFT in the game would come in, which is very positive for understanding exactly how this project would impact the Cardano community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The game and platform are ready, and many things are very well explained in the proposal, such as how the user experience would be, how tokens would be handled. We also have a very detailed construction of how the project's development phases would be, what would be expected for each and what steps would be necessary. Another positive point is how the authors define very well what the success metrics would be, which would make monitoring the community simpler. One criticism I can make is regarding the popularization of the game. I thought there was a lack of a sense of how they would present this new facet to the public, because from what I understood, not all players would already be adept at cryptocurrencies and would know how they work. It would also be positive for the authors to explain to us how they intend to promote the game, and thus reach the expected number of players for each phase. So, I believe that the proposal has a great auditability, I recommend just exploring the marketing part more.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I think is a fantastic idea. and crypto needs more diversity.

The various medium used to host a game seams quite troublesome tho, I think technology is still quite cryptic to many of the demographic that play this game and their ability to join or maintain a cohesive connection through a game can prove innefective.For example if someone losses connectivity how can the game proceed or would the person progress be forfeited?
