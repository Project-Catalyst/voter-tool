Additionally, idea to have automated/easier access to information such as stake pools grouped by certain filter criterion, e.g. charity types (certain section of earnings go to charity), will help Cardano network grow stronger and continue to be driven by the willingness to thrive for a more equal world. However, i notice that the solution statement language could be simplified for making it more appealing and understandable for new investor. Hence, not going with 5 stars :)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "After having a brief look at the proposer github page,  developer has the necessary credentials to fulfill the task of API implementation. As a developer myself, API development of such kind does not seems to a very complicated task, and given the credentials of the proposer, (github commit history and projects contribution) this should be doable in the given time frame.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer knows what he wants to achieve and how he wants to achieve it. The proposal essentially outlines the implementation plan, and the budget asked for this proposal has quite high reward to investment ratio. \r\n\r\nThe website already exist where we can see basic set of groups of stake pools listed based on certain filter groups. This is an important attribute for this proposal as it gives a good overview on that proposer has done his homework and has clear implementation path for the API\r\n\r\nAs a developer myself i am confident that the information provided is enough to audit the progress and proposal would be successfully implemented in given time frame.

Such dynamic staking feature is a strength of Cardano protocol design with no lock-in period and affords such freedom of choice.

As a suggestion on this point, I'd recommend a blogpost or simple release notes so that everyone tech-savvy or not can follow your progress.\r\nOverall I love the idea, but the description of the components of the proposal could have been better.
