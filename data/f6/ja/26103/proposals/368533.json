Challengewise this proposalwould integrate or migrate the existing Gotiger tool to the Cardano network. Since the team has prior experience and clients and gives success criteria of migrating the three clients to the network, it would be important to add some numbers of expected value to the roadmap and information as well as how transactions would be facilitated before smart contracts will be integrated to estimate the value of this proposal for the Network, especially seeing that it requires 20 percent of the budget for this challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The company is already operating and will be migrating or integrating an existing tool so implementation is highly likely. However, the team does not provide information about how they plan to utilize ADA and transactions in general. The budget is about 1/5th of the challenge fund so careful consideration of the future value of the proposal is recommended. I looked at the first provided article and it seems that \"ravepub\" is a marketing and strategy agency so I do not see much value in an article that was written for marketing purposes. It would be good if the team would provide more insights on the experiences of the team. Additionally, since the 3 clients that are mentioned as success criteria are already clients of this company, it would be useful to give an estimated output value. Afterall, without smartcontracts (they are not part of the roadmap and are mentioned as \"could be used\"), tokens or other profit-related measurements, this project should specify how they would enhance value for the network.

The approach should be that what problems i have and how can i solve this problem ? Does blockchain (cardano in thiscase) helps me solve N problems with low cost and maintenance in longer run ?
