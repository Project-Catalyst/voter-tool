I ask him why, and he said few cases come to court and just about 0.1% of them gets referred by Judges to go in for Mediation processes. While there are many of these mediators in the house, the job is usually is handed over to the old (senior) mediators due to assumed experience and thus leaving behind the new(junior) mediators.  They (junior mediators) are left to fend for Mediation jobs for themselves which is a very tough task especially with Covid19 restrictions (lock downs) being imposed and it'sjust not fair. He made mention that some time ago, a dispute party was furiously dissatisfied with a mediation process that was handled by one of these senior mediators in the court because he (dissatisfied party) didn't pay his mediation fee early, and the Mediator was somehow related to the other dispute party, he (dissatisfied party) was partially treated.\r\nI'm giving this team a high score because I've realised this decentralized application they're seeking to implement has potential solutions to many problems that the Dispute Resolution is facing in not just local courts but national ones as a well.\r\nThis marketplace, I strongly believe will be very useful as a lot more mediators around the world going through similar problems just like that of my friend Mediator, would love to jump on it and receive peaceful mediation jobs.\r\nAlso, they wouldn't have to go roaming in search of jobs as the jobs would come to them via the marketplace. They will also be able to render a very accurate mediation job as information (time of payment, regional background and others) about dispute parties would remain anonymous to Mediators, I think it's a good solution which clearly aligns with the challenge.
