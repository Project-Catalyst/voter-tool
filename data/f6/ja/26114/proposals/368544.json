The group is led by Carl Henry, who attached to his linkedin profile, which I consider the best way to know who the professional really is, through the report of past experiences, the description of the biography and comments from third parties. In other words, we can know very well who the project leader is, but the same cannot be said in relation to the other members of the NGO, we are not told who they are, what they do, etc. As it is an extremely broad proposal, it would be interesting to have a deeper knowledge about how the NGO works, because even though there are several project fronts, I believe that there would always be a main backing that would guide the NGO's actions. For example: in housing, people who work with architecture, construction, recycling of materials would certainly be involved; in ecology, maybe professionals turned more to biology, agronomy, these areas... But who would manage professionals in relation to the objectives of these NGOs? We have a broad vision of what would happen, and also when it would happen, but as it is a very large project, it would be interesting in my view to provide more details not only about the team in terms of auditability, but also how a community can follow the activities.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As this project is of huge proportion, a lot of information is released about what would be done and in what order, within each project front (recycling, ecology, etc.). What worries me is, as I mentioned in the previous comment: how can the community track the progress of these activities? It would be beneficial if there were meetings with community members, which took place on a standard frequency, where each surveyed member followed up on the project that was most interesting, for example. Or even that reports are prepared to clarify how the projects are progressing. Another question that confused me is whether these project areas would all happen at the same time, or whether it would be more like \"one ends and another begins\". It would also be nice if we knew who is predetermined at each stage. The impression I had is that the project is very ambitious, I don't know if it would be possible for a single institution and a small team to organize everything satisfactorily, it would be beneficial to focus on one aspect at a time, and while success was ended later as activities expand, but it's just my vision. In relation to expenses, it is mentioned how the financing money would be used, but in a very superficial way - there was a lack of detail here, in my opinion. In general, I found it to be a very interesting proposal, but as I said, because it is very broad and extensive, it might be more interesting to go little by little and be more sure who the people involved in each part would be, as well as how the Cardano community could monitor the NGO's activities.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "\u30a4\u30ce\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3084\u30a4\u30ce\u30d9\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3092\u767a\u6398\u3057\u3001\u8cc7\u91d1\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3067\u3001\u5730\u7403\u74b0\u5883\u306e\u6539\u5584\u3068\u6301\u7d9a\u53ef\u80fd\u306a\u751f\u6d3b\u306b\u7126\u70b9\u3092\u5f53\u3066\u305f**\u4e16\u754c\u898f\u6a21\u306e\u6697\u53f7\u57fa\u91d1\u4ed8\u304dNPO/NGO**\u3092\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "experience": "\u79c1\u306f\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u4e0d\u52d5\u7523\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u3001\u4f01\u696d\u3001\u975e\u55b6\u5229\u56e3\u4f53\u3084\u5ec3\u68c4\u7269\u51e6\u7406\u3092\u542b\u3080\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306e\u5206\u91ce\u306743\u5e74\u306e\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u7d4c\u9a13\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002"}
