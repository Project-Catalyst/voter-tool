Given the goal of developing partnerships with global organisations achieved through creating hubs around the world, this proposal seems to be suggesting a framework or method for teams to sign up and coordinate around the establishment of those hubs. The proposal references diversity and inclusion and multidisciplinary teams. However, it is not clear how an open call for teams to sign up will lead to the establishment of diverse teams. It is also not clear what these teams are meant to be doing, beyond the very general goal of beginning partnerships. The World Bank and UN are giant organisations and more practical details about exactly how partnerships would be built, with which department and areas, and how Cardano would be involved would be helpful. Perhaps the idea is to empower a variety of teams to come up with those specifics, but if so, that should be clarified, with additional detail provided regarding how the teams will be directed or motivated to accomplish the objective. I also envision issues with scalability, as there is no explanation of how coordination will occur among 130 different teams using the same google docs spreadsheet. I also find the inclusion of the CF roadmap material from a year ago confusing. I don't understand how those activities connect to this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have not provided any information about their skills and experience. The Community Road map video is referenced under Relevant Experience. The video seems to have been chaired by Rick McCracken and his name is listed as the Section Lead for the Roadmap section. Does this mean Rick a proposer? The video and docs also don't seem to have been updated in the past year, while a lot has changed at the Foundation, particularly regarding the composition of the Council. Therefore, I find this documentation not particularly helpful in assessing the challenge. The proposal requests $10,000 which would be divided amongst the teams, but there is no breakdown of how those funds would be used by each team, or how they would be assessed for success. I don't see information about a timeline, beyond referencing 130 countries in 6 months, which does not seem feasible, particularly given a budget of $10,000. The proposers seem to acknowledge this gap. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is no roadmap with milestones. There are no metrics or KPIs, nor is a description of the success of the project clearly articulated.  As no clear plan is provided regarding what the funds would be spent on, it is rather difficult to imaging auditing the progress and success.
