He states that he needs team members to develop this dApp but does not say how many he needs and what skills are required for the development. This makes the proposal feels more like an idea in the early stage rather than a well-developed proposal. The plan stretches out over more than a year but the budget breakdown only talks about 8weeks. The proposer is still a student and in the budget breakdown, you can see he plans on spending 2hours a week which means he does not have a lot of spare time. This does not really support the hourly rate requested for this proposal.
