From one writer to another, in this setting, writing a proposal is much like writing an essay: it requires structure.

Although the budget of $600 seems insignificant, the proposer has indicated the \"requested funds are to recover the costs of the scanning software.\" It is not prudent for the Catalyst treasury to be spent on a small loan for equipment. There is no ROI (return on intention) by investing in this proposal. The problem with overlooking this, is that there could be viable proposals that miss being funded because the funds they need are allocated elsewhere. \r\nTo the proposer: My suggestion would be to find the information and collaboration you seek at the weekly townhalls, in the after townhall breakout room, and through the many avenues for communication via Telegram and Discord. It would also be helpful to study and reference Catalyst documentation on writing an effective proposal. The new and community formed Catalyst school creates helpful tutorials. The Catalyst community is available to help. You must reach out to them.

You are not the first, nor the last person to become lost in the potential of Catalyst. Over time, and with each iteration in the Catalyst \"experiment in decentralized governance,\" the community and those leading Catalyst and Cardano rise to the challenge and make the way clearer and easier for future proposers. They give us the tools to use for each of us to use on our own or in collaboration with others.

Certainly, disseminating literature through NFT is consistent with the sustainable development of a project, and helps to establish the goals of a unique portion of the population: writers. What seems to me to be a problem is that this proposal sounds a bit individual, because the author says that he would write all the books/pages, and that they would be about a specific theme (self-liberation and the healing of the soul). In this sense, it seems to me that it would be a kind of financing for a project that is more personal than local. I didn't find a direct relationship to how this proposal would contribute to the adoption of blockshain on a local scale, how it would attract different types of people and ideas to our ecosystem. I believe it would be more interesting if, for example, the author suggested that a support network for writers be founded, in which they were taught the advantages and differentials of transforming their works into NFT, than focusing the whole issue on a single author and who writes mostly on a single theme. Therefore, I didn't think the proposal fits satisfactorily to what the challenge seeks, to a dissemination of ecosystem practices for the development of different projects in different locations. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Certainly the author is capable of doing what he sets out to do: writing books. About his talent and writing ability we can be sure, since he claimed to have written 27 novels in 1 year. However, he never talks about the professionals who would be needed for the other part of the realization of the idea, that is, the programmers and developers who would convert the literature into NFT. I think it would also be necessary to establish where these books would be accessed (probably on the website that the author attached, which talks more about him), but at the same time, this issue is not clarified. It would be positive if the author also showed his intention to hire designers, in order to build an easy-to-use platform for future. Also, I think it would be necessary to think of a way in which this project would reach the public. By reading an author's comment on the proposal, we know he lives in Mexico City. But the goal of this challenge is also to expand Cardano to other locations, so in addition to the event located in the city he is in, how would this activity be known to people from other locations? Unfortunately, I felt that there was a lack of planning in relation to the various parts of what the team says about this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a lack of detail regarding how this proposal would happen in practice. What we have here is a brief notion of how the borrowed money would be used: recovering the costs of scanning software + digital scanner. The author did not consider the expenses of the rest of the team, which I mentioned in the item previously evaluated. We are not provided with any temporal notions, we do not know how long the author would write his literature or how the return would happen, what the average number of transactions he intends to carry out in a certain period of time, or even how the community would monitor the development of this project...
