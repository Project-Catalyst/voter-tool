The question asked: \"How can Cardano enter in global partnerships with United Nations Development Programme and World Bank Group, to leverage mass adoption?\" Is answered by this proposal. They want to link funding for NGOs who are working at implementing the SDGs with NFT art markets and in the process obtain 5% of the NFT sale price which is then donated via a smart contract to an NGO that the buyer nominates. If they can get artists to mint their NFTs on their platform (Is this what the stake pool is supposed to facilitate?), and they are able to sell them, ie they create enough of a presence in the NFT market to enable sales to happen, then it seems a small leap to bring in the NGOs who are nominated (why wouldn't they, they can only benefit?) And thereby ensure through the smart contract functionality that they are then given the money to achieve their aims. One of my questions is will the smart contract have any conditions to release the money? I am assuming not. Or any way to evaluate whether the money released is spent appropriately (which a normal conventional funder would be assessing ) My other questions are will they be able to onboard the NFT makes artists to use WottleNFT? This seems like a big job that many platforms already up and running have a presence in which might be difficult to break into . Why would an artist choose the WottleNFT platform to mint and sell their NFTs on? And would they be able to generate sufficient buyer interest?

They seem very capable, but a little more detail would be appreciated. \r\nHow will they choose the NGOs? What criteria will they use? \r\nDo they have enough experience of the NGO world to know who to choose the people they want to support and to assess whether they do what they say they will do with the funds allocated to them?\r\nAs I said this is a great project it needs some further thinking through and evidencing to make it more real and give me the confidence that it is achievable. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has a clear time line that i think can be used to audit their progress. They have already done Phase 1  (although they have set up a stake pool it has not activity, but maybe that's part of the plan?) The rest is plausible. I would just like to add that i think that if this works i think it will result in a excellent collaboration in the UN's SDG space, and open up many possibilities for Cardano and cryptocurrencies to help realise the UN's SDG ambitions. My only questions are the ability of the team to achieve this ambitious proposal. But if they manage to get this mechanism to work then this will be a real step to using Cardano to make positive impacts in important ways.
