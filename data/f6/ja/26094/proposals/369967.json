This is an important proposal to integrate new conceptual smart-contracts devloping and connect them with the real world business industries.\r\nThe proposal clearly articulates the contest, the problem (new developer ecosystem to write and test smart contracts) and how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for all of the stakeholders.

Ethereum).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer team (Ferdon company ) is very well skilled about the whole context of the proposal, but it's seems that doesn't know the Cardano community very well because they work on other blockchains.\r\nThe scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it's convincing.\r\nThe proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones and a defined time horizon, also in technical realization.

Tim O' Brien's reply was: \"Since we target the Citizen Developer with zero technical training I don't see us as part of a Developer Ecosystem\". Apparently things have changed rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe challenge asks: \"How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?\" This proposal essentially allows more people to become \"developers\", even those who thought they are not tech savvy enough to be developers.\r\n\r\nThe proposer states: \"This project allows developers to develop smart contracts without having to master functional programming, Haskell or have a deep understanding of blockchain or Cardano tools.\" If that is the case, this is highly valuable addition to Cardano tooling.\r\n\r\nIn their other proposal (No-Code for Citizen Developers) it is mentioned that QModeler would cost $30 per month per user.

Yet proper goal setting is missing and vague statements like \"thousands of new developers\" cannot be considered actual goals.

Also, it took hours to go through all proposals, related videos and websites.\r\n\r\nMy ability to evaluate the proposals:\r\nIn my day job I use no-code development approach every day but I haven't used Q-Modeler before. It sounds fantastic but unfortunately I cannot judge the proposal with 100% technical accuracy due to my lack of experience with the technology.\r\n\r\nNote to voters:\r\nThis team was funded with $20,000 in Fund5 and has now proposed five interesting challenges in Fund6 totaling $200,000+ USD:\r\nhttps://www.cardanonocode.com/projects.html\r\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/No-Code-For-Creative-Africa/351502-48088\r\n\r\nEquipping the proposals with videos is a really good way to deliver the message (although one of the videos could use some editing).\r\n\r\nThe proposals would have been better if they had been proofread. It's not \"crowed source\" but crowd-source. Perhaps it's just me and my OCD with editing but this kind of small things unnecessarily devalue the proposals.\r\n\r\nGetting funding for this should be dependent on proof of ability to deliver results, including completion of the Fund5 proposal.
