Here's why:\r\nTBH I don't see the point in creating a site and applications if the creator can just use another platform like youtube, as he mentioned he is doing. The only point I see in creating a custom site/apps for education is for them to be interactive, and there was nothing of the sort mentioned anywhere in the proposal. Another thing I find strange is that you can not log in or register the site pointed in the proposal (https://www.knuggies.com), which is kind of strange to be perfectly honest. The proposer says: \"The beta app is currently live at \u2026\", but it's actually not or at least appears to be only a login/register form. Another thing I find curious is the fact the only Jason Barhorst who is an Electrical Engineer https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-barhorst/ doesn't appear to have any Haskel or Plutus experience to teach it, but I can agree that he can hire people to do that for him, although he claims to be an educator in the proposal. I've tried PM-ing the proposer to clear some questions I have but unfortunately, I've gotten no response.\r\nIf the proposer is serious, I would recommend taking a step back and think about what a good business plan looks like and then come and try again in fund 7. To point him in the right direction: https://venngage.com/blog/business-proposal/, I believe these are good guidelines that can be applied for the next crypto proposal round.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I don't believe the information provided in the proposal is sufficient so the community can track the costs.
