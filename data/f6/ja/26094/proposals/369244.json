Its obviously a big project with an estimated 550 hrs compared to many of the smaller proposal this team has delivered, thus there is a risk timelines could slip especially given there is not a detailed project plan.

The PAB which can work without a dedicated node will be much easy to handle for the average developer.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Blockfrost is one of the most utilised and stable API providers in the cardano echo system.

However, PAB is a major component of the Cardano system and will define the interface for the dApps. IOHK is still developing it. Therefore it can be assumed that that it required very highly qualified software professionals to build it. The software will be open-source, but the user will have to pay Blackfrost for the API access charges, likely improving the business.
