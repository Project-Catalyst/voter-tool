The question must be asked now that we have moved into the time of smart contracts, whether this type of functionality that requires trust and runs offchain is the best way for developers to go forward with this type of functionality.\r\nIt should be noted this $20k proposal is one of 4 proposals totaling $85k each adding 1 to three functions", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer created the initial software and is asking for funding to increase functionality. There is no reason to thing they won't be able to deliver. However the plan is 3 months to plan who to implement then another 3 months to deliver. That implies the proposer has not yet planned how to deliver this project which implies some risk on successful delivery. It would be nice to see a breakdown justification of the budget. How many hours of work does the proposer believe implantation of these 2 functions will take?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is a simple deliverable of 2 additional functions, in that sense it is easy to audit delivery. The metrics for success should have some clear goals as to how many implementations using the functions would be considered a success.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem statement refers to a deficit within the current state of the product but is not linked to a defined problem within the challenge setting. Furthermore the proposer team did not explain or describe how the solution will be a benefit to the Cardano ecosystem. \r\nThe presented API is well described but how it adds new value to our ecosystem is not explained. Therefore I can rate the impact of this proposal only with 3 stars.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is well known in the wider Catalyst community, is participating in many community events and has already delivered some useful tools. To further understand the scope of this project I would love to see more technical details and also a more specific plan for implementation. The budget is not broken down in detail (no hourly rate, etc.) so it is hard to say if the requested amount is reasonable. However, because of the proven record of these two guys I expect them to deliver the project as they have promised.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has presented some metrics to measure its progress and success. I would further add a specific number of new applications (instead of saying numerous) that are expected to use Heidrun methods. In addition, I would like see a reflection on potential risks (mainly about the go-to-market strategy) and how to overcome those. Because development is one part, but running it successfully (which means that many projects will use Heidrun) is something different. The team linked a GitHub repository where you can see a lot of activities of the past. So overall, the community will be able to observe the ongoing activities as well.\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Heidrum platform is already available to Cardano developers that makes integration of applications simpler.
