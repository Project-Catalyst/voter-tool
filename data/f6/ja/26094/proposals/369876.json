As a marketing expert, I miss aspects like a media plan, a marketing strategy, different audience profiles. What other channels besides Youtube do they want to use? The budget breakdown only shows ad spend. But what about campaign management?  Adjusting settings and monitoring conversion rates is the most important part for a campaign's success!
