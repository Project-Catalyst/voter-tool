It aligns with the challenge of growing developer ecosystem. The metrics of success defined in the proposal, however, lacks real numbers. For example, \"No. of Educational materials created\" is mentioned as one of the key metrics, but we don't how many education materials are planned to be created in a period of 3 months. Therefore, it is hard to estimate the real impact of this project at the assessment stage. For this reason, I can rate the impact of this proposal as 3.
