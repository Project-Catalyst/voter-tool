This proposal aims to improve the cardano developer experience in 2 ways: 1) develop an SDK/API for off-chain state management and 2) hackathons for this software.\r\n\r\nBeing a developer myself, I can immediately recognize the value of building high level storage APIs and SDKs since they allow developers to focus on providing actual value to the ecosystem instead of (re)building low level primitive tooling. \r\n\r\nThe problem statement is clearly articulated but in my opinion the solution statement is vague. It's not clear to me what \"Schema generated business domain model\" means. However, I understand the rest of the solution statement. I think the communication of the solution statement can be improved.\r\n\r\nI think it's likely that this proposal will have a high impact because the team is focusing on hackathons as well as the core software. I think the hackathons will greatly help with adoption and user feedback.\r\n\r\nOne thing that isn't clear is whether the requested funds will support the team for all 12 months of the roadmap or if more funds will be needed in the future. If the 100k will support all 12 months I think the ROI here will be incredible. \r\n\r\nThe KPIs seem well aligned with the goals of the challenge.\r\n\r\nI rate this as 4 because some of the technical details of the proposal aren't very clear to me. I would give this a 5 if the team provided some samples of what their SDK would generate. ie: given JSON blob x we would generate typescripts/haskell/marlow types/classes/etc y.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is very experienced from a technical and business perspective. They have decades of combined experience from the technology industry which means they likely know some best practices for building businesses and writing software. \r\n\r\nThey provide a link to a professionally built website which is a very strong positive signal.\r\n\r\nI would like to see links to the LinkedIn of each of the members and even their github profiles to get a better sense of their skills.\r\n\r\nThe budget breakdown is a little unclear. As mentioned in the Impact rating it's not clear if this requested budget will last 12 months or for part of the proposed roadmap.\r\n\r\nThe proposed timetable is quite reasonable given my experience writing software and I think is very achievable. \r\n\r\nOverall I give this proposal a 4 for feasibility because the professional profiles of the proposers is missing a bit of information and because the budget breakdown is a little unclear. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal has done a good job outlining the high level deliverables, the lower level deliverables and the KPIs. That being said, I don't see any numeric goals in the proposal. For example, it would be great if the team set a goal of 10k library downloads or 15 dApps launched by Jan 2023. \r\n\r\nI think the high level deliverables are reasonably well thought out and easy to verify - does the SDK work or not? Can we generate Haskell types from JSON? etc. However, it's hard to measure projected vs actual adoption of the software since there isn't a projection of how much adoption is expected.\r\n\r\nBecause of these reasons I give this proposal a 4 for auditability.

This is a metric that most proposals still neglect for some reason, but I'm a firm believer that you can't optimize a process that is not measured, and KPIs serve to do exactly that.\r\nI like the diversity and the ambition of this project and I believe the money is worth it, considering the work that will be put in to drive the community forward.\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are lots of great proposals that have some great ideas about ways to push things forward in the right direction, but a lot of them are missing the people with the right credentials and a clear well-thought-out plan.\r\nOverall I love everything about this proposal!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I already mentioned, this is one of the few proposals with actually meaningful KPIs.\r\nA clear timetable and a list of credible people to get things moving. \r\nThe proposer has put into the budget costs for marketing, which would inform all interested parties about the progress of the proposal, so I'd say it's auditable.\r\nGood luck!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Logosphere L2\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u306f\u3001FlureeDB\u306b\u3088\u308b\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30de\u751f\u6210\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30c9\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3068\u30cd\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30d6\u306a\u6642\u9593\u7684\u72b6\u614b\u7ba1\u7406\u304c\u884c\u308f\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff0b\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\uff0a\u3002", "experience": "\u516b\u6728\u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\uff1a\u5143\u30bf\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\n\n\u30c9\u30df\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30b5\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\uff1a\u5143\u30a2\u30de\u30be\u30f3\n\n\u30de\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30f3\uff1a\u5143\u30bf\u30bf\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30b5\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\n\n\\+ 2\u540d\u306eSr.\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30cb\u30a2\uff08\u5143Fortune 500\u4f01\u696d"}
