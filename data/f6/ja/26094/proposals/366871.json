After reading it several time I am still wondering what exactly could be the outcome of this proposal? \r\nIn regard to the challenge setting, it is not clearly defined how this proposal addresses the defined needs of this challenge, and no KPIs are pointing to this challenge. Part of the 5-year plan is to streamline government spending?! How is this part of Developer ecosystem?

Following questions are only some of which I had reading this proposal:\r\nWhat is your approach in eliminating friction in p2p commerce? Why will this smart contract solution create enormous project confidence? What is your approach in creating a skill sharing culture? Doesn't it already exist (at some areas)? Explain further how you want to construct a highly incentivized tokenomics use case? This sound like an idea, but there is no plan visible.
