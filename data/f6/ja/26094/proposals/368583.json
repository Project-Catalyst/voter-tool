Interoperability between chains for NFT projects obviously will expand the market for NFT's. The proposers have submitted basically an identical proposal to use Ethereum and IOTA. Which is more important?\r\n\r\nWhilst the authors claim their current product is the most popular system for minted NFT's on Cardano, it would be good to have some numbers here so voters can see the impact any proposal to improve they system will have.\r\nGiven they are asking the community for 50,000 to implement this, why are they only adding it to their paid app and not the free version? How many NFT's has their paid app minted compared to the free version?

This is a significant amount of community money to produce functionality that will then be behind a paywall. For the community to see value in this we need to be able to gauge the impact.
