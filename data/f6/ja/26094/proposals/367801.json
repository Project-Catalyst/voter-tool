However, It is easy the host a zoom meeting or start a Discord Server, but where do the people/participants come from? To go-to-market strategy remains very vague. I would like to see more about specific topics and methods they want to present, also some references (did they host a meeting before? Is there a recording or some samples?). It is possible that the team is very skilled in meditation, but we need more information about it to assess feasibility and expect a successful implementation. The budget is broken down in details, but it is not clear what project and community management do mean. What specific tasks are included? Are they necessary? To further improve this proposal, I recommend to add all these information.\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Again, the team present a number of how many people they want to engage.
