As English is not my native tongue, I have encountered people that are initially put off because of the language barrier and find it sometimes to difficult to enter this sphere for that reason. So as this blockchain grows and becomes more accessible to the general public, translations are a driving force for greater adoption. Vietnam currently undergoes rapid development and holds a lot of economic potential. Stimulating the Vietnamese community by providing translations could therefore open up a market of over 100 million people.
