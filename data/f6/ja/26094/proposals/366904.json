Here's why:\r\nTo paraphrase what Marvin Bertin said in the comments: If this solution aims to build on top of the Cardano Hydra layer, it would be a good idea for the proposal to wait until it's release otherwise it would be a pointless effort. Keep in mind that that's a complex piece of machinery and I suggest you put your clear plan on how will this GPU card be maintained and developed on.\r\nMeaningful questions in the comments weren't answered with the same level of respect or details given.\r\nThere is no clear connection or explanation between the given solution and the statements about \"ADA to spend like money\" and \"leverage your crypto as an asset for a FIAT loan\" which should be explained in a proposal.\r\nAlthough I read through the content of the linked documents and watched your linked video several times, I do not see how the Gordian Knot document is supporting or relating in any way to your proposal, so I'd suggest making a clearer point in any new proposals you make to help the community grasp your idea.\r\nAfter reading through \"Secure decentralized peer\u2011to\u2011peer training of deep neural networks based on distributed ledger technology\" I fail to see how will incentivizing peers to provide data to train a neural network, be beneficial for cardano? I don't understand what exact data is to be provided and to what end? I suggest reading through your proposal through the eyes of a stranger to your proposal and try and describe the proposal in more detail.\r\nMost of the \"summary of the notes given to the proposal by community advisors\" given in fund5 is ignored here.\r\nQuestions about the team for this project asked in fund5 also lacking here.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I don't believe there are any key points mentioning any kind of possible audit checkpoints or variations of enabling progress tracking.\r\nEven though I'm not convinced you need the aforementioned GPU for the sake of argument: you buy one which is priced at 149 000$ per unit (which by the time Hydra gets released might be more due to lack of chips and inflation rates) and you're left with 51000$ which should be enough for: (1) \"hiring\" the IOHK to do the \"software mods\". I haven't seen any proof that an offer was extended to you by the IOHK for the sum of 51000$ or less for the job you describe. (2) having a team to work with you for the aforementioned goals of the proposal.\r\nNo mention of any kind of funds distribution.\r\nI have a hard time believing in this proposal.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "The same proposal was in the same category last round."}, {"q0": "The proposal somewhat addresses the challenge in respect of technical developments than need to occur in the backend on IOHK to scale.
