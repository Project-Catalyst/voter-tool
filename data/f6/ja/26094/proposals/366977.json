I think it an important question to ask, as someone in the comments hinted at, that Blockfrost also provides similar functionality. So, would $60K be worth it to provide another set of like tools already developed? I think so for the reason it provides another option, competition for an important element of the ecosystem, and another company that can market that they provide tools for Cardano that make it more developer friendly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has quite the impressive team, and this should be an important factor in considering advancing this proposal. The experience of this team will lower the risks of failure--although success is risky due to possible feature creep due to its need to compete with Blockfrost (and no doubt upcoming others), and just the perils of developing a first version of a form of software. It would seem this team could mitigate those possible obstacles.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan, the team members, and other details are given that should give over modest aversion to the risk of the funds requested. However, if another project seems to vie for this project's funds, and that other project address a more unique concern, then it may be prudent to consider that Blockfrost.io provides similar functionality.\r\nAgain, the importance of these tools are great enough that there is room for more than one in this space, and it is important to have redundancy of crucial systems. \r\nIf this proposal's roadmap is correct: it would offer differing functionality than Blockfrost.io and so that should be a factor as well.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_363", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal aims to build REST API, webhooks, monitor, and query composer. There are components required for app/dapp developers to build build. If there are not using these then each dapp has to have its own infrastructure of graphql, db-synch, and a host of other services to make it functional. There are providers for such services already however with an increase in the usage and arrival of SC, Cardano is expected to get a exponential rise in API consumption, and the availability of more than one provider is always good for decentralization. \r\nOne more API provider will always add reliability to apps and more importantly ability to cross-check and even build a federated system.
