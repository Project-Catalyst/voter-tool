I agree that this proposal improves the market adoption but not directly the number of programmers involved in Cardano.\r\nOn the other hand, I would agree that the proposal is in line with another metric: - What are enterprise dev managers looking for to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\r\nSo, in all, I neither agree nor disagree", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While reading the proposal, I have noticed that the word 'we' is used several times.

The latter could turn out to a challenge on iOS due to the restricted nature of the platform, but, on the other hand, having to rewrite the offchain component of a dApp in another language could easily introduce serious errors (including lost funds due to \"type unsafety\"\u00a0when the CBOR in a transaction doesn't match what the validator expects).", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Milestones to judge success are provided, however, they are somewhat abstract.
