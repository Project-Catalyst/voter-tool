What exactly means that no Cardano Experience is included? Are only proposers allowed that built everything on Haskell/Plutus, etc? Then, almost no proposer would meet this criteria which is not at all an official Criteria. CA\u2019s do not have to set their own criterias for proposals and challenges but should follow the official CA and Assessment guidelines, that's why this assessment is not valid.\n\n3) I as a proposer added on three points (TBA) by being aware that it is not possible, nor fair to make false promises for goals which will be approached by the evolution of the proposals execution and therefore cant be explained in detail in such an early stage. This statement gived by the CA shows the ambition to give the whole proposal a lowest possible rating which is not in relation to the auditability as other points show very clearly how the project aims to evolve. Not agreeing with 3 out of 15 listed points does not show any relation to a good and well made assessment. This assessment definitely should be filtered out as it gives the lowest possible ranking for all categories without acting in the CA and assessments guidelines.\n"}, {"q0": "The proposal is to create a crowdsourcing website for funding innovation not only for Cardano-related projects but the system will use Cardano blockchain for implementation.

The assessment demonstrates that he have not read the proposal and gives no objective reason for the rating.1) \n\n2) As a proponent I would value a score of 5 as it would help the overall rating, but I reaffirm that the assessor has not read the proposal, as he keeps insisting on crowdsourcing, it is true about the experience of the team and its capabilities, but I think it does not go with the spirit of Project Catalyst if the assessor is unable to read the proposal to understand that it is a crowdfunding platform and not crowdsourcing.\n\n3) The assessor does not follow the stated CA Guideline, as it focuses on rating whether the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The assessor makes no reference to this itself, talks about the breakdown of funds and then subjectively begins to indicate how the project should be measured or developed in the future.
