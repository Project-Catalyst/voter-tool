Thus we need some newly created tools to visualize smart contracts. This team has identified this need and therefore wants to build a desktop app for this purpose.

The only thing what is missing, is detailed information about the proposer/team. With the provided video we have some proof of live and with a website prototype which shows what has already been built. It is very clear structured proposal (with a reasonable budgeting) and with more personal information/references I would give 5 stars.
