Such application could accelerate the adoption of Cardano, thus I see a high impact on our Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This team has already integrated successfully 3 different blockchain, thus I am convinced they are capable of doing it again.

The requested budget is high, but very understandable listed and reasonable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The presented roadmap is detailed and from my experience realistic.\r\nSome KPIs are missing, however it is POC. But to have a bit more information about the next steps (is there more funding required, etc.) would help to understand the project in its full scope. Also how will the community have access to the developed tools? A GitHub repository is linked, so the community is able to track the process of this project.
