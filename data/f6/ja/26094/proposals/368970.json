There is a clearly defined plan and budget. The proposer has been open about underestimating time for the previous project which they completed anyway, and have asked the community to cover a higher time budget, but lowered their $/hr rate as well. Seem like an honest proposer who can be trusted to deliver as promised and the community should support them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well defined deliverables and timeline making progress easy to audit.

Unlike many other Cardano software development kits (SDKs), the Flutter Wallet SDK is written in pure Dart which guarantees this complex cryptographic code will work seamlessly on all of Flutter's supported platforms: iOS, Android, web and desktop. The Fund 5 work targeted a few critical use-cases, but was, by design a proof-of-concept prototype, leaving out such key features as native tokens, NFTs, staking and smart contracts.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Information provided is sufficient enough to audit the progress.
