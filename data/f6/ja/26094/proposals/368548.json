Expanding options for users here is a great idea. The proposers have submitted basically an identical proposal to use Storj. Which is more important?\r\n\r\nWhilst the authors claim their current product is the most popular system for minted NFT's on Cardano, it would be good to have some numbers here so voters can see the impact any proposal to improve they system will have. Given they are asking the community for 30,000 to implement this, why are they only adding it to their paid app and not the free version? How many NFT's has their paid app minted compared to the free version?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have a current product which has been running since 2017 thus there is not reason to doubt they would be able to add this functionality. It would be good to have more of a budget breakdown as to why is 30,000 the right amount of funding to achieve this? How much work is actually involved?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Whilst delivery off the functionality within the proposed 3 months is relatively easy to audit, there are not milestones within that period to audit progress.\r\nMore importantly success of the proposal really relies on the impact this will have. They are only proposing to add this functionality to their paid app rather than the free version. This is a significant amount of community money to produce functionality that will then be behind a paywall. For the community to see value in this we need to be able to gauge the impact. The proposers should provide some information on how many NFT's are currently minted under the Pro-version and how they expect this functionality increase to impact hat going forward.

This opens a path for new developers to be integrated to the project, or even if this project doesn't expand their team, it allows for other NFT projects both from an API level and web app level to use this work in future NFT releases. This provides a short term opportunity and long term community benefit for the developer ecosystem. In the future I think a deeper clarity on if this will be integrated within an existing team or in a deeper collaboration with newly graduated Pioneers / devs would be beneficial. While this also might seem on the fringe of the developer ecosystem challenge vs the NFT challenge, as a developer myself I see that there would be a great benefit by showing the continual integration of API's into proven products.  Despite these slight communication improvement opportunities I would rate this 5 overall.

I would like to see more detail of what the team is prioritizing on their backlog / bandwidth of members to show progress on this API while accounting for roadblocks that may come up in the mentioned 3 month window. Since the progression would require someone (or many) requesting updates, which can also cause more work on the team's part, I would rate this a 4.
