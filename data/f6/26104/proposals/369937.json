It is a very interesting proposal, and it's a book I'd probably read \u2013 but does it address this challenge as such? Arguably, it's  only theoretical, and possibly neither the book itself, nor the \"minimal set of rules\" developed from the book research, will *directly* affect Catalyst's ability to deliver better distributed decisionmaking. (The proposal doesn't mention how the ideas might be disseminated, and how a wide range of people in Catalyst might be enabled to engage with them so that they actually do have an effect. Possibly the proposer considers that out of scope - but in academia, for example, post-doc researchers need to show some kind of plan for public engagement in order to secure funding; this proposal would better address the challenge if it recognised the importance of public engagement to spread ideas through the ecosystem and make them accessible.)\r\n\r\nStill -  contributing to scholarship around distributed systems is a worthwhile thing to do, and even if it never directly influences the day-to-day workings of Catalyst on the ground, it may well  contribute to Catalyst's thinking on the issues of this challenge; and without that, where are we? So on balance, 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer clearly has the knowledge and  commitment needed to implement the project. They do have other proposals in this round, but even if they all get funded, the workload and timetable look manageable, and the proposer has recognised the risk of timelines altering. They seem to have worked this way in previous rounds (2 concurrent projects) and been able to manage their time OK. But unfortunately, it's impossible to be sure, as no actual plan, or detail of \"how\", is given, beyond \"I'll do it.\" The proposer is clearly planning to write on issues he's thought about and researched quite a lot already - so perhaps if he gave some links to his previous writing, to show the development of his thinking, it would be easier to feel sure that he knows where he's going with it, and that he won't find that during the writing process, the whole premise actually changes and so that the project becomes something else entirely ( a very common experience when writing a book).\r\n\r\nAlso, the budget... It's fine that the budget is not  broken down, as it is simply \"money to live on while writing a book\". However, much as I hate to criticise how people value themselves, I can't help noting that the proposer lives in Malawi, where an average wage is apparently about **one-fifth** of what he is asking for. What he is asking for is actually more than many people in my country (a first-world one) live on. This seems unwarranted. Possibly it's at this level as \"insurance\" in case his other proposals are not successful; but that's not a valid way to work out a project budget.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As there is so little complexity to the plan \u2013 the proposer will write a book, and write some code, and write a \"minimal set of rules\" \u2013 this project is very auditable as far as it goes; but that's partly because the \"success\" of the proposal is so minimally defined. (\"Did you write a book? Why, yes, I did.\"). It's positive that progress will be visible and trackable on Gitbook. But given the questions about how far this proposal will in *practice* influence Catalyst's distributed decisionmaking, I would like to see some auditable metrics of community engagement with the project. Even if the proposer simply set a number of people they'd hope to see engaging with their work on Github, or similar. Without that, it is hard to meaningfully audit the \"success\" of the proposal in terms of addressing the challenge.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This proposal is intriguing, and at the same time a little confusing. In theory, the author corresponds directly to the main objective of the challenge, which is to work on the distributed/collective form of decisions. And he will do this through a study, which, as I understand it, will generate a book that relates how organizational structures from the most diverse areas (such as biology, languages \u200b\u200band computer science) can come to be useful for the organization of the cardan ecosystem. As it is a rather abstract idea, it would be interesting if the author could cite some more direct example, that is, choose some organization system present in one of the areas he mentioned and demonstrate in an argumentative way how this could fit with reality of our community. It is true that, with the growth of the community, there would have to be new ways of thinking, discussing and deciding various issues involving the ecosystem, but the author's idea was still too abstract for my understanding. For this reason, I believe it would be beneficial to reformulate the proposal, citing examples, perhaps some video explaining better how this task could be done, and also some advantages in establishing such a study.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "All we know about the author is that he has many years of experience in studying complex systems and how to simplify them. It would be interesting to know in more detail who he is, what his area of training is, what studies/projects he has developed so far within this area of study. Unfortunately, as it is presented to us, we know practically nothing about him, thus making it low assurance that he would be qualified to make the book intended here. In addition, we do not know if all the work would be done by him (probably yes, from what is understood by reading the proposal), which references he would use to study each area of knowledge mentioned, how this book would be made available (virtually or physically)... We have a very abstract roadmap too, which makes us only have a notion of how the project will happen, but not a detailed vision of what is to come.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "About auditability, we also have very little detail. We only know that the author intends to spend 6 months working on the project, that is, studying and writing about. However, nothing more is informed to us. It would be important to know a few things, such as: 1) he intends to present the book all at once or in parts, as written (so the community could follow the progress of the project?). 2) where would this book be written? 3) as I mentioned in the previous comment, what references would he use to study each area of \u200b\u200bknowledge? 4) with what metrics would the proposal's success be measured? 5) which target audience does he want to reach, and how? Nowhere in the proposal is said how the publicity would take place, which creates the impression that this proposal has a personal project nature, which is not bad, but it is necessary to establish a more tangible bridge between the idea and the public .

The offered solution of this proposal to do research and provide a framework based on theory fits the overall idea of Cardano to look at things from a scientific perspective. It would help the iteration and might bring relevant ideas to Catalyst to improve the process. Key metrics referring to this proposal and the challenge are: software that supports decision making or iteration and Did we get better at distributed decision making? I have to deduct one star in this rating becasue the overall idea of Catalyst is to iterate and develop with the support of a community and a \"rigid approach on collaboration\" might be contrary to the guiding questions of how to include newcomers, support participation and so on. However, research on how to optimize that will be open for discussion in the community is a good idea. The proposer should add that the framework and research that he does is going to be recommendations. It would also be important to not have \"one solution\" that has to be implemented as this should not be decided by one person. These concerns would not have been raised by me if the proposer would have provided more insights on the general idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While I would not agree that one person would be able to optimize the process of the Cardano treasury, decision-making and participation/ collaboration, I think this book/paper can contribute if the proposer provides relevant ideas that might help develop the overall system and I think the insights might make for a great future challenge in the field of decision making. The relevant experience the proposer describes would fit the specific community and processes that we\u00b4re aiming to develop and I think the timeline and financial budget seem feasable. It is relevant that the proposer adds that he would document the work and provide open access/ creative commons. Timeline and milestones are broad but the idea is dependent on this proposer and not a team so this is fine in this case. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Audatibilty is high based on a github repository and documentation on the proposal in this way. Key metrics of the challenge are in the field of software that supports decision making or iteration. I am deducting one star because the proposer did not include his views on this proposal being seen as authoritative and destructive to the idea of \"cooperative\" and inclusive - especially in the context of the problem statement that a \"rigid approach to collaboration\" is needed - I think the proposer would have to add how he would deal with controversy around the idea of \"rigid approaches\" especially in the context of DAOs and other autonunous collaborations that would not want to be restricted. But if seen as reseach on decisionmaking, than this is valuable and auditable.
