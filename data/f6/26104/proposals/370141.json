(Literate English-speakers can certainly easily read a proposal sufficiently to get an overview of it, in about 90 seconds; so having to watch a 3 minute video would be actually *slower*, and would make the problem of \"not enough time\" worse.) Making videos can address all sorts of exclusions, actually \u2013 language barriers, low literacy, visual impairment, dyslexia \u2013 but not really lack of time, so it's a pity the proposer has focused on that. Maybe if they recast the proposal a bit, and talked about using videos to address *different* barriers?  Cos the *actual* barrier here seems to be that many people in Catalyst are having to read proposals in a language (English) that they're not skilled in. OK, this proposal does address this language barrier in a way, by suggesting translating these videos into several languages \u2013 but  if the problem really is lack of time, then surely a more effective approach would be to spend the effort on translating the *written* proposals, so that speakers of Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean can assess written proposals with the same ease and speed that English-speakers can. \r\n\r\nThe other problem with videos in addressing this challenge is that videos bring in all sorts of unwanted variables when trying to assess a proposal. Does the interviewer understand all the issues in the proposal, and are they asking appropriate questions? Is the proposer confident, skilled at being interviewed, and do they have a media-friendly personality? If not, their proposal might still be great \u2013 but people might be put off from even looking at it, purely because they lack media skills. In short, it feels like this proposal doesn't actually increase distributed decision making \u2013 it just replaces one set of exclusions and barriers  with another. Perhaps this could be addressed if the proposal included a little bit of training for proposers, to help them present well \u2013 but that would be a whole different proposal.\r\n\r\nAlso, the proposal suggests creating 50 of these interviews. In this current funding round, there are 800-ish proposals \u2013 how will the team select who gets an interview? I'd like to see some info about how they will choose, to assess if this really addresses the challenge. If this proposal is arguing  (and it does seem to be doing so) that these interviews will make a massive difference in helping a project to reach people, and in eventually determining what gets funded, then it *really* matters who gets that opportunity, and what the selection mechanism is, and that should be detailed in the proposal if it is going to address the challenge effectively. If on the other hand it doesn't really matter who gets an interview and who doesn't, because it doesn't really help proposers  or voters much, then why do interviews at all?\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I'd like to see more information about the teams who will produce the interviews. The proposal mentions that there will be a separate team for each challenge \u2013 first, that's a *lot* of people, so is there sufficient capacity? And second, I'd like to know more about them, particularly the interviewers \u2013 I'd like to get a sense of whether they will be knowledgeable about the particular field that each challenge covers., and also able to communicate that knowledge to the audience. Interviewing is a *huge* skill ! and I'd like to know if the team has that skill, because if they don't, the proposal won't be implemented successfully and won't achieve its aims. \r\n\r\nAlso I'd like it to be clearer whether these interviews will be recorded live in a 'no-edit' way, or whether there will be any editing and production involved. These things are time-consuming, so it makes a big difference to how implement-able the proposal is.\r\n\r\nOverall, I don't think there's quite enough information to assess whether the proposal could be successfully implemented \u2013 but I've decided to score it 4 rather than 3, because I think it would be OK for the proposer to try it out, have a go, and learn from the experience. I think it's an important barrier that this proposal is trying to address \u2013 and really, we only learn whether these ideas work by trying them in practice. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think auditability here is pretty good. Clearly the community will be able to audit whether the videos have been made, and how far people are engaging with them, sharing them, etc. which all gives a good sense of whether the videos are a success.\r\n\r\nThe \"success \" of qualittaive proposals like this, which \"make XYZ easier\", are never easy to audit precisely, but I think their use of qualitiative data on social media will give a pretty solid idea of whether the project has succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The idea of supporting decision making with the help of the audiovisual channel is very good and addresses the described challenge.
