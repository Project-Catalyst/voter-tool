There is no proof of proposer's ability to execute - LinkedIn, GitHub, and GitLab are not linked at all in the proposal and when searching the Git repositories nothing comes up for MyVoice. Following the link to MyVoice (itsmyvoice.org) there is no information on the developer team or project details either. \r\n\r\nThere is a reference to Gimbalabs as a tandem development path but no sign of collaboration could be found on the Gimbalabs GitLabs, GitHub or even Discord server. \r\n\r\nThere are many statements about the issues faced by the Catalyst community for decentralized decision making, but no clear indication for how the proposal will actually solve them. \r\n\r\nWhen looking at the KPIs there is no clarity around what timeframe will be implemented.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the budget there is a reference to PPBL with no explanation of what that is (Personalized Project-Based Learning is the only thing I can imagine fitting there).
