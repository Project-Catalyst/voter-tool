", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Behind this proposal are major members of the AIM team, which is the team driving the voter-tool, CA-tool, vCA-Tool and the Community Landing Page. \r\n\r\nDue to the fact that most of this developments are already available and the funding is mainly about improvements and maintenance, there is a very high feasibility that the goals can be reached", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal comes from a well-integrated core-contributor-team closely linked with the CATALYST process.\r\n\r\nThe activities, roadmap, costs and milestones are proerly listed. Auditability is therefore easily possible.\r\n\r\nThe asked amount is rather small and very reasonable.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As expected from people that aim to make tools for a community in order to improve proposal quality, this proposal is a good example. \r\nThere is a roadmap, a plan, enough information to verify and the fund request is more than reasonable. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_113", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Yes.

Nevertheless, the past success of this team within Catalyst regarding proposal funding and execution, and the engagement of the team members with Catalyst and Cardano provide more than enough confidence that the project progress and success can be adequately audited. I would suggest that for the implementation and for future proposals the team can improve the detail of the information provided for auditing as an example for other teams and under the assumptions that in the future all teams (even anonymous or anonymized teams), should be treated equally, and that future advisors and voters should not rely on their previous knowledge of the Cardano ecosystem to be able to adequately assess proposals and teams.

To be able to organize the work the tools are critical - for instance to point out which proposals did not receive enough assessments and should be considered by a CA for review.

The roadmap is very exact and feasable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes. Both the roadmap and success criteria (CA-tool, vCAtool, Proposer Tool) are auditable as well as feasable. Additionally, the team can be reached through various channels across the Catalyst community, they offer support and answer questions constantly and they are actively asking for feedback from the community to develop/iterate the tools, hence creating and developing the tools with the community in mind, another important aspect of distributed decision making.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The problem and solution presented are clear and within the scope of the challenge.\r\n\r\nThe AIM tools have been very important in the decision making of all those actively involved in Catalyst, CAs, vCAs, proposers and voters.\r\n\r\nThe established goals indicate a great impact on Fund6 and Fund7. I would only recommend the inclusion of metrics/KPIs that can help the indication of impact. e.g. Number of CAs, vCAs and proposers that used the tool, % of those who used it vs % of those who did not used it...\r\n\r\nDespite this point, my score remains 5, as the set of items and information is too weighty for just a 4.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The trio of AIM members have been developing these tools since Fund4 and have already demonstrated their skills and aptitude for further development.\r\nThere is a detailed and objective timeline, indicating that the tools will be available on time.\r\nThere is a very detailed and reasonable budget breakdown.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is clarity on the problem, solution and alignment with the challenge.\r\nThere is an objective roadmap with defined dates for tool updates.\r\nMetrics and KPIs were not included, which makes the audit more subjective.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "As this is my first fund as a community advisor using these tools had a positive impact on me.
