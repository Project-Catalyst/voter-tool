Why do you think you can achieve this?

This proposal won't help developers. The proposal would've been much more suited in another challenge. The idea itself has meaning, together with the whitepaper it provides a vision of why and what the proposers plan to do.

The budget breakdown needs more information to assess why the amount is needed.

Being that there already is a demo version of the proposal is a good sign that the proposers are engaged in the idea. The success timeline provided is a bit bland and doesn't provide the info needed to evaluate the success of the proposal. You state that the launch date is in February 2023 but in the success timeline you speak of a product launch after six months. This leaves a gap in the timeline of about a nin months. Due to the lack of information, I don't see this proposal being implemented successfully.
