This could lead to someone being tricked into  sending funds to the wrong address. See the huge amount of research in adversarial machine learning in computer vision where for example tiny changes can make the computer see a 60mph  sign rather than a stop sign with obviously terrible consequences for autonomous vehicles.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a well set out plan with milestones from a strong team.
