The question must be asked now that we have moved into the time of smart contracts, whether this type of functionality that requires trust and runs offchain is the best way for developers to go forward with this type of functionality.\r\nIt should be noted this $25k proposal is one of 4 proposals totaling $85k each adding 1 to three functions", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer created the initial software and is asking for funding to increase functionality. There is no reason to thing they won't be able to deliver. However the plan is 3 months to plan who to implement then another 3 months to deliver. That implies the proposer has not yet planned how to deliver this project which implies some risk on successful delivery. It would be nice to see a breakdown justification of the budget. How many hours of work does the proposer believe implantation of this function will take?", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is a simple deliverable of 1 additional function\\, in that sense it is easy to audit delivery. The metrics for success should have some clear goals as to how many implementations using the function would be considered a success.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_11", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "There are 3 similar proposals by this team in this challenge. They are all based on Heidrun, a funded proposal that is already in progress. This part is focusing on multi-asset support for this payment API. Again, this proposer describes in the problem statement a deficit of his product instead of referring to a problem within the challenge that he wants to solve. In general, the improvement of payment APIs can help to accelerate the adoption of Cardano. Providing more context in that sense would lead to a better score.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This open source API is designed for integrating Cardano payments into applications. The presented plan to add multi-assets support is reasonable from my point of view. To get a better understanding of the scope of the project, I would like to see more technical details.\r\nThe team is well known in Catalyst and has already proven its ability to create complex solutions. Therefore, I expect this team to successfully deliver this proposal. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and the deliverables are clearly defined. Also, Heidrun is trackable on GitHub which gives the community the opportunity to follow the progress of this proposal. \r\nThe metrics show, how a successful implementation will look like. This could be improved by adding a specific number of how many users this API/functionality will have after certain amount of time. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Not sure if this belongs in the developer eco system or in the Dapps, but because it has an integration with blockfrost I guess it really is closer to the developer ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It would have been really nice to have links to the Github of the mentioned developers or a LinkedIn account. That would bring more credibility to the project, but since they are reachable once you know the names, this might be overlooked.\r\nA thing that lacks is a better elaboration on the timetable of the project and possible feedback to the community about the progress of the project. One way would be to watch the development of GitHub, but that's a solution only if you're a dev.\r\nI really like that you're building on top of something that you've already got up and running. The fact that you have dealings with a pool operator brings an extra level of credibility to the proposal.\r\nLinks to GitHub projects are always a good idea, to show your intentions and capabilities.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To be honest, It could have been done better, but to be fair, there is a way to audit the progress of the proposal through Github. Code is law and if you're a dev you'll have no problem checking the progress of the project. \r\nIt would have been nice to have some more KPIs besides \"numerous new applications utilizing multi-asset drop applications\", because numerous is not an exact measure.\r\nAs a suggestion, I'd do some kind of community progress report.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_536", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Heidrum platform is already available to Cardano developers that makes integration of applications simpler.
