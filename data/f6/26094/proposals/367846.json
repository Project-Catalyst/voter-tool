When does the first cohort start with the training? When is it finished? In terms of auditability a source for documentation about the progress of the proposal would be helpful. Overall, a clear goal is defined (number of first cohort), therefore the main part of this proposal is auditable. \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "https://www.abcdevs.com/ is a great venture and the proposal is an important one. The problem and solution are well defined. It is a long-term play to train local/African crypto developers, starting with 25 in this proposal. \r\n\r\nAs someone who managed several tech companies, having high-quality developers is highly important especially in a growing sector like blockchain where demand will keep rising. \r\n\r\nWhat is missing for me in this proposal is more the association for the Cardano ecosystem. You use mainly blockchain in a general term across the proposal and less specifically Cardano and how the training will be linked to multiple Cardano-related initiatives. Also on the website, Cardano is one out of 5 sections and not the center of the course, while Etherium has 2 sections).  Obviously, blockchain fundamentals are important, but my suggestion is to focus more on the Cardano ecosystem at least to be aligned with this challenge. This is the main reason why I gave 3 stars. \r\n\r\nAnother important area is to provide more information about the recruitment process and how you make sure you get the best of the best (or the Elite as you put it). \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The program is already started and running for a year with the first cohort of 14 developers.  It would have been helpful to provide more information about the first program such as the recruitment process, progress, and if they are already being employed and with which companies. \r\n\r\nThe team looks great, with relevant experience, impact-oriented, community involvement, and a strong relevant network. Good details about the team members - LinkedIn profile would have to be helpful to have. \r\n\r\nThe training provider will be Emurgo as you mentioned. It would have been good to have more information about the service they will provide and how it will focus on Cardano content.  \r\n\r\nPlan vs. ideas seems reasonable and in line with the proposal. \r\n\r\nThe budget of $1,500 per developer for a 4-5 months course seems reasonable for me. When working with www.earthworm.org we had courses training the future environmental leaders in developing countries and the cost per person was much higher (different model but just as a reference). However, it would have been more clear if you detailed and explained the budget for the various budget lines and not having a total number, i.e. the cost of emurgo service. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap and time frame are good but quite generalized and on a yearly basis, while the courses are only 4 months. It would have been good to have a roadmap for the proposal with 3,6,12 months timeframe and deliverables. Also, as mentioned above show the deliverable more in relation to the proposal and the Cardano ecosystem such as involvement in Cardano/catalyst projects. The key deliverable that could be measured is that 25 local people went through the course. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a good list of success measurements but to be able to audit them needs to add forecast estimations based on milestones timeframe. \r\n\r\nGood that you included some barriers but they are mainly of the ecosystem (i.e. legal structure). Some risks are also implied in the text such as \"Acknowledgment/credibility of African developers from those looking to hire\". \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "*   Train elite Blockchain devs in Africa\n*   Establish the best Blockchain solution provider in Africa\n*   Build technical elite of the future Africa", "experience": "Joshua, Gwen and the ABCD teams run the initiative for a year and already assembled a first cohort of 14 promising blockchain developers."}
