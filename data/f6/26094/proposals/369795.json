With Plutus being a brand new programming language and having an overall lack of courses on Cardano there is 100% a need for the solution this proposal presents. Having been on the search for Cardano based devs myself and knowing the level of questioning non-Cardano devs have on the tech a course model makes a lot of sense. This proposal fits exactly what the Developer Ecosystem challenge is looking for. For this reason I am giving a 5 star rating.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The overall plan is apparent, well written, and took the approach of \"less is more\". This overall worked for them and the plan to achieve success is apparent. That being said portions of the proposal are lacking. For example describing the process you go through to create courses and the specifics of what each item in the curriculum will cover. I would recommend including a section that speaks to the flow you all go through to create these courses and then another flow to explain how a user will go through it. Additionally an explanation as to how these courses will be marketed would be helpful. I understand you all will have a $3k budget to do this but what will this be spent on? The learn-to-earn aspect will definitely attract users and grab interest! But there isn't more explanation as to how this ADA will be distributed. At the moment $10k worth of ADA is expected to be paid out, however in month 6 of your \"Success Criteria\" you mention you will need an additional $100k in funding or to start charging for the course. These ideas are in conflict with one another as on one end you are incentivizing the usage of your platform with ADA and on the other you need more funds in order to scale up to the point where you create 600 new Cardano developers. This highlights an element of unsustainability within the proposal if repeated funding is needed to continuously support Cardano dev creation. To solve this issue I would recommend doubling down on the \"Learn-to-Earn\" feature by minting your own fungible token that gets paid out to users based off of their learning proficiency and capacity to educate others. Your revenue and funds can then come from taking a small percentage of the token that is earned via learning. Then apply some utility to the token such as governance features that enable people to propose new courses for you all to create so there is some backing to the tokens value (you could even call it $BEN). On the experience side of things you all have a quality precedent of course creation along with a beautiful website. Because of your history of course creation combined with an executable plan to make this proposal successful I have rated this at 4 stars. If you all can figure out the sustained revenue portion than it easily would have been a 5!\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Overall the \"Curriculum\", \"Budget Breakdown\", and \"Success Criteria\" provide enough information to audit if this proposal is successful once it launches. I understand what will be built, however I don't have as much capacity to audit the project as it is being built beyond tracking \"Curriculum\" creation process. Additionally it would have been great to get more key metrics to measure beyond total Cardano Developers created. It would have been great to add metrics like \"amount of user generated content created to promote course\" or \"Number of certified developers that became employed in their field\". Due to the clear understanding of what success will look like for this proposal I am rating it at 4 stars. This would have been a 5 if there were more metrics to measure proposal progress and post launch success.

If successfully and well implemented, developing the course they describe could be a very helpful addition and address several elements of the challenge, in particular \"Filling in gaps defined in the exploration stage\" and \"Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano\".  The focus on full courses which make use of Github, the free education model (initially) and certification adds further evidence that this proposal could be beneficial to helping build the developer community.  One improvement could be to include more evidence for the problem statement : what is the landscape currently? What alternatives exist now or may exist in the near future? Based on what is presented here, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The fact that they already offer similar courses is evidence that they can create courses and can create at least some kind a product, although I was not able to evaluate the quality of the courses in the time we have to assess.

A linked document with sources and details would have been welcome here.  Also lacking is any information on the team behind this project.  This is of more concern, because it is unclear how we are to assess the likelihood of successful implementation beyond a website and a course i.e. how we are to estimate the likelihood of actual impact on the Cardano eco-system and beyond.

However, the numbers feel somewhat arbitrary (no justification is given to allay that impression), and the \"either secure more funding or start charging to scale\" comment gives the impression that the commitment to the \"free\" education is not very serious and certainly not a priority.  This would also of course be a 180-degree turn from the claim that they plan to reward (pay) students for participation.  Clarification on the real priorities could be beneficial here.  Aside from this, I would have liked to see some other and more imaginative measures by which the community could assess the project as it proceeds: for example, these could be related to engagement, connections, projects, etc.  Based on this, I feel that the information given is likely to be moderately sufficient for audit by the community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_403", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The availability of recognized training courses will definitely improve the developer ecosystem.

Are there live sessions or is it just recorded? From my own experience I know that live-sessions are much more helpful to fully understand the content (especially as a developer). What is the plan for getting jobs for 100+ students? What is the go-to-market strategy (where do you get your students from?).
