Currently we have various SPO's offering kickbacks of their 340 ADA payment to incentives delegators, however this is all done on trust.

There are a number of ways that the current Cardano infrastructure can be leveraged to build layered economic incentives to benefit network participants. By focusing on mutually beneficial incentives, we can produce versions of traditional business functions in more elegant and decentralized ways. This issue will become larger as the Cardano ecosystem continues to grow.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a large budget for design, architecture, project management, testing, deployment & operator onboarding.
