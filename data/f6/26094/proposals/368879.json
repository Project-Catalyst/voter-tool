Thus we need some newly created tools to visualize smart contracts. This team has identified this need and therefore wants to build a desktop app for this purpose. As this improves the UX for developers in the Cardano ecosystem, this proposal not only fits perfectly into this challenge, also the impact on the ecosystem in general could be very positive. Thus I rate the impact of this proposal with 5 stars. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a very detailed proposal with a lot of insights of the work that will be done. Technical details as well as a clear roadmap makes it clear what to expect from this proposal. From my standpoint it is very well thought through. The only thing what is missing, is detailed information about the proposer/team. With the provided video we have some proof of live and with a website prototype which shows what has already been built. It is very clear structured proposal (with a reasonable budgeting) and with more personal information/references I would give 5 stars. With the given information I have to subtract one star.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has presented a clear roadmap and also shows clearly how success will look like for this proposal. This is a good foundation but there are some aspects the need more information to perfectly being able to audit this proposal. Something like a Github repository could help a lot here. To further improve this proposal, I would suggest to add more details on how to get users for this application.
