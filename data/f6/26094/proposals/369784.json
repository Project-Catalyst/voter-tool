How this can simplify and encourage their work?\r\nIt would useful to indicate the part of the world considered by the proposal: legislation and political systems in relation to the blockchain are really various in the world.\r\nIn general the challenge is strictly about tooling / documentation / way to onboard new developers into the Cardano ecosystem and I can't see a real practical impact of the proposal about this.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There are no indications about the team that will execute the proposal, and also in the website there is no details about the team experience.
