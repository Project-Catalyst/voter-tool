The problem solution is clear, In engine integration for Tokens and NFTs management for UnrealEngine, if it is well executed (wich I think the team is capable of) the positive impact on Cardano becomes self-evident. As a logical consequence, this improves the productivity of current developers and attracts new ones (myself included).

The developers are very attentive to their Discord community, answering technical questions promptly and carefully. Their team work can be monitored.

The developers are very attentive to their Discord community, answering technical questions promptly and carefully. Their team work can be monitored via Github / Discord (where they currently publish progress). It would have been good if they were clearer with the composition of the team (after the time invested, it can only be deduced that the team will be the same as Fund3).
