There are no world laws, you need to pick a jurisdiction who's courts will enforce the contract. Hence why many international agreements have been done referencing UK courts with well established case law especially for trade, services and finance\r\n2) How does the smart contract release funds. If it is just at the clients discretion, how is that any better than just having a promise to pay. If both parties need to come to an agreement, the funds could get locked in the contract for ever. How do you arbitrate?\r\n\r\nThe proposers noted leangle constancy across borders as a potential risk, but really its an existential risk. No technical work should be conducted before this is solved.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Whilst the plan as detailed could be delivered, the I think this issues I have raise in the section above relating to legal jurisdictions and release of funds are key impediments to a successful implementation. \r\nIn addition to technical experience, I believe the proposers really need some legal experience before progressing further.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Delivery of a technical solution can be audited and the proposer have clearly defined metrics for success.
