This has the potential to become the standard for writing queries in Cardano once it is available.

With further growth of Cardano these efforts will increase and therefore will be not manageable without having a certain amount of devs and financial capacity.

Therefore, this proposal fits perfectly into this challenge and with its implementation we can expect a positive impact on our ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind that proposal is very active in the Cardano community and has already delivered some valuable solutions/tools. The Github profile from the project as well of each team member shows many activity and from my perspective they are definitely capable of delivering this proposal. The presented plan includes a broad variety of features of the API. To further improve this proposal I would like to see more technical details. But overall it is clear, what we can expect from the solution. The budget is broken down in details and absolutely fair priced I am convinced, that they will successfully implement this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They team offers different opportunities to track their ongoing activities. There is a Github repository linked and also a website already with some documentations. I like the fact, that they have reflected their doings and also compared it to existing approaches and were able to position themselves among those initiatives.\r\nThe roadmap and timeline are presented in detail. To improve this proposal, they could add some numbers like how many users they expect to use their API after a certain amount of time. That would help to assess the success of this proposal even more. In conclusion, I state, that this team provides us with sufficient information for auditing this proposal. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This projects aims to provide an open source solution to easily setup the infrastructure needed for most dapps.
