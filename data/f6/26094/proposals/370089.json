This will make it easy to audit activity. Whilst the deliverables a re a little vague, the funding request is also quite small. No metrics or goals have been provided.

As this proposal correlates with others of the proposer, a positive interaction is to be expected. The budget covers the monthly costs for up to 6 months and is therefore considered extremely fair. To improve the proposal, more details (technical details) could be added. From my point of view this would make the proposed solution even clearer to understand. The proposer himself has participated in many community events (Swarm, After Town Hall) and has thus established the proof-of-life. More personal information and references would be helpful to evaluate the proposer's capabilities. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The outcome will depend on the research, i.e. it is not well defined yet.
