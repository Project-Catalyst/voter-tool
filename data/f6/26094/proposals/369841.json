It is an app to line up tutors with learners. The proposers have submitted a basically the same idea into 5 other challenges. In the metadata challenge it seemed to fit reasonably well. They have not stated how it fits this challenge. This specific submission is basically a perfect cut and paste as that submitted to the Catalyst value onboarding challenge , it even has the same heading. The only difference is it is triple the cost (likely as there is more money in this challenge).", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer have the experience to set up the platform generally and it will likely be implemented as described.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Delivery of the platform is easy to audit, however what's really important for this use case is how it will impact the developer ecosystem.

This seems to be more of a duplicate proposal, and have marked the tutorchain.io proposal I do think applies.

The proposer team seems to be experience in blockchain development, but they don't provide some references (github, LinkedIn, etc). As this is a complex solution, we need more details to see if this project is more than an idea and ready to be implemented. The budget is referring to marketing to reach a critical mass of experts.

Specifically, considering the proposal within this challenge brief, this is a great starting point to test the tutorchain.io platform. Whilst volunteer-based peer-support is a fantastic tool, the platform proposed allows for monetisation of knowledge, which *should* encourage more accurate knowledge transfer.

Mentioned was that the smart contract portion will be relatively simplistic and similar to examples within Marlowe \u2013 good to hear. A challenging part that I foresee will be the implementation of a trust-based system using a zoom-interfaced oracle. I can foresee how this could lead to a need for human arbitrators to get involved in the case that zoom APIs are unavailable. Some more description on the considerations for implementing this trustless system would be good to see \u2013 perhaps a method external to zoom where tutors/learners trigger something saying the lesson has started and the lesson has ended, which feeds into the oracle without the need for a third party zoom client.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Some milestones/stages of the proposal have been identified, with specifics for each challenge brief in each.
