There will be a tokenized system to allow resolution of disputes by experts who have to stake tokens when deciding. But who then decides which expert to agree with? It seem like it just moves the finial decision making one step back up. If its just majority rules, large token holders could just bet on whether they ant and then determine the outcome?\r\nIts not clear this is really a developer ecosystem proposal given the main point is for the proposers betting app. More should be done to define how it would help developers in general.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There seems to be a significant amount of uncertainty in how this system could work. Funding is being asked for to first design it, then build it. Its not clear the proposers have a solution yet, so there is significant uncertainty in whether this will work, thus whether it can be successfully delivered. I would suggest a smaller request to first research the problem, then put that whitepaper forward with a request for funding to develop it. A more detailed plan and budget breakdown should be provided.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is not really a detailed plan to build this with milestones that can audited.
