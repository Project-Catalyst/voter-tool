What are these things you are asking for funding to build?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers have already developed a wallet so it is likely the funds requested will be used to extend that functionality is some way. However exactly what is going to be delivered has been left quite vague thus it is hard to say the plan will be successfully implemented. \r\nWhat are the feedback loops you are working on? What are the requested features you wish to build. What does smart contract support mean in the form of a gamified wallet?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As the deliverables under this plan are vague, it is hard to audit the progress.
