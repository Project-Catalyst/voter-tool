Furthermore, taking a look into the UK business registry the company or versions of it was dissolved and re-found several times.

There is no debt because the company has never traded, all assessments are copied and pasted on each of my proposals showing a general bias against all of my proposals.\nUnconstructive assessment: The UK Companies are all in good order, this assessor does not understand UK company law, the companies have not been dissolved even once, Notices were served to dissolve the company one time, when I thought about discontinuing the project but I decided to continue and filed the necessary document to continue the company. This does not indicate a lack of ability to complete the proposal.\nRegards,\nCarl Henry\n"}, {"q0": "This proposal meets the goal of attracting more developers to the Cardano ecosystem in several ways. The barriers to entry into the ecosystem are reduced through best practices and templates.
