Interoperability between chains for NFT projects obviously will expand the market for NFT's.  The proposers have submitted basically an identical proposal to use Neo and IOTA. Which is more important?\r\n\r\nWhilst the authors claim their current product is the most popular system for minted NFT's on Cardano, it would be good to have some numbers here so voters can see the impact any proposal to improve they system will have.\r\nGiven they are asking the community for 50,000 to implement this, why are they only adding it to their paid app and not the free version? How many NFT's has their paid app minted compared to the free version? ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have a current product which has been running since 2017 thus there is not reason to doubt they would be able to add this functionality.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Whilst delivery off the functionality within the proposed 4 months is relatively easy to audit, there are not milestones within that period to audit progress.\r\nMore importantly success of the proposal really relies on the impact this will have. They are only proposing to add this functionality to their paid app rather than the free version. This is a significant amount of community money to produce functionality that will then be behind a paywall. For the community to see value in this we need to be able to gauge the impact.
