That of integrating databases with blockchain dApps.  However, on the blockchain it is significantly harder to integrate database services because of the complex logistics of providing data to smart contracts, especially in a way that is cryptographically sound.  This proposal outlines a solution to be added to the Cardano developer toolset that should make integrating outside databases with the Cardano blockchain a well-defined, straight-forward process.  I was impressed with the intent to use Merkle trees to enhance data sharing in a way that retains user data privacy by selective sharing of user data slices in a cryptograpically protected manner.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I would like to have seen some discussion as to why the proposal is not using existing oracle services like Emurgo.

During my research into Plutus development, the name Gimbalabs has come up numerous times and always in a positive light as a leading organization for learning Plutus development.  Given that this proposal is critically dependent on having Plutus smart contract development skills to succeed, the fact that they are cosponsoring this solution encourages me greatly.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal does give a detailed timeline of their project milestones and that can be used to evaluate the project's progress over time.  I am taking off one star because I would like to have seen some numeric targets with dates concerning how many dApps and how many companies they intend to have onboarded within a given timeline.  I recognize that certain key parts of the infrastructure have to be put in place before any of that can happen.  But some guidance on what if any integrations they intend to do with outside companies within the project period would have been helpful.  This criticism should only be taken as a note for future proposals from this organization.  I feel the proposal as it is right now is a good fit for F6 and voters should give this proposal serious consideration.  The lack of proper database integration facilities in many blockchains are slowing down greatly their adoption.  Worse, improperly implemented databases or integrations with poor cryptographic integrity, lead to data privacy hacks or monetary disasters and we all want the Cardano experience to be better than that.
