After reading it several time I am still wondering what exactly could be the outcome of this proposal? \r\nIn regard to the challenge setting, it is not clearly defined how this proposal addresses the defined needs of this challenge, and no KPIs are pointing to this challenge. Part of the 5-year plan is to streamline government spending?! How is this part of Developer ecosystem? And furthermore, how does this approach add value to our system compared to initiatives that are already existing and executing? This proposal contains a lot of general information instead of presenting a clear step-by-step plan to show the community what they will get from this proposal.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer is presenting/promising numerous outcomes without explaining and describing how this is to be achieved. Following questions are only some of which I had reading this proposal:\r\nWhat is your approach in eliminating friction in p2p commerce? Why will this smart contract solution create enormous project confidence? What is your approach in creating a skill sharing culture? Doesn't it already exist (at some areas)? Explain further how you want to construct a highly incentivized tokenomics use case? This sound like an idea, but there is no plan visible. Furthermore, the budget spending is neither broken down nor is it explained. How can we say it is a good use of the treasury? \r\n\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No metrics are related to the challenge setting. No documentation source is provided to enable the community to track the ongoing activities. The roadmap is not clear, as it includes several activities, that somehow rely on each other.

However, it might make more sense to start in a smaller scale (there are many related proposals which ask for a lot money) and show the community what they can expect from your contribution. \r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_484", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "***++YOUR VOTE:++***\n\n**CATALYZES ADA WHALE, GRAVITATIONAL VALUE MULTIPLIER, DELEGATION MAGNET** via\n\n**\"GUARANTEED DELEGATION FOR YEARS\" SMART CONTRACT!**", "experience": "MOA, DLRGroup and City of Bloomington via CCC partner with 23 years of complex commercial construction oversight and invite IOG engagement."}
