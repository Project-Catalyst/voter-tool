Also, even at $18/hr in management time we are still looking at 100% overheads on the amount of funds released. Can we scale this to more funds/proposals without a linear increase in management time? Given those overheads is this more efficient that Catalyst Funds themselves?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has the experience to try ands deliver this project. However its not clear that the proposed $18/hr will be enough to bring in the management resources required. There is little detail on how small the funding will be per proposal. There is a 30k treasury and a goal of 10 funded proposals, so does that mean 3k each?

It does though provide some additions to this challenge's objectives, but they will depend on how it is implemented.\r\nHaving a different cycle for funding mini-proposals is an interesting idea and I think it does worth the experiment, but I am concerned on the level of centralization this proposal could produce as a separated entity from the whole Cardano's community, It seems it could end creating a mini Catalyst project.\r\nI strongly encourage the proposer to rewrite this idea with a mindset to add diversity and new ways of doing things to our community, with this specific goal of reaching faster and continued value out of mini-proposals. \r\n\r\nOf course when you think about including the community then several issues could potentially arise, as it could be very costly and not efficient to implement a full election every 8 weeks, also that short period will make a very though to audit and track process, and you need that to show the community your results and outcomes. But there are several ideas out there that can help with this, such as proxy representatives or hubs. \r\nI consider that the % of funds destined to fund mini-proposals is quite low (a little over of 50%) so the structure to make this proposal a success is a little costly, specially when using Cardano's Treasury funds that already has a method to distribute its funds with a better ratio.\r\nThere is also a duplication effort as it is mentioned that mini-proposals will be also presented to general funding rounds, creating extra efforts and possible conflicts out of assessments and funds return, which I think it can create a very conflicting scenario and potential divisions instead of collaboration.\r\nI therefore consider that the idea and focus could be a great addition, but not in the way it is presented.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There is a ballpark number of hours presented and the team that will work on this proposal, but there is no detailed plan with when the desired outcomes will happen and how, to really understand what success will look like.\r\nIt can be assumed from the estimated hours that the project aims for a 6 months timeframe, so it can potentially run 3 cycles of funding, with 30K to be distributed, based on some of the provided numbers the desire is to reach 30 proposal, around 1K each.  Seems to be doable, but it doesn't seem to be much of an impact by the aims of the challenges Cardano's community is aiming to reach.\r\nThere's no indication about preparation, communication and  organization efforts and time for the program and how it will reach the intended audiences to generate interest and participation, so I cannot provide a funded opinion on wether this initiative could be implemented as is.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are several goals with KPIs clearly defined, such as the number of proposals, amount of voters and several others that could be audited and tracked.\r\nSome of them are a little unrealistic, such as having 100% of the proposals implemented.\r\nThe budget breakdown is presented, distributed among the team, some contingency buffer and the treasury funds. No budget is allocated for communications, infrastructure or material creation to be able to pursue and execute on the goal, could be a mouth to mouth effort that given the small number of proposals goal it can potentially be achieved that way.\r\n\r\nMost of the focus and metrics seem to be on proposals, rather than developers so if the number of proposals is low and having into consideration they are mini-proposals it is not clear how many developers this whole proposal can drive and add to the Cardano's ecosystem.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_288", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "At first glance this proposal can seem a little bit outside of the dev ecosystem challenge whose main focus is to directly improve the ease of developing on Cardano through tools, documentation and education. However it does answer to this challenge's guiding question:\r\n- \"How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\"\r\n\r\nDevelopers are engineers who know how to turn an idea into a reality but they are not entrepreneurs who have to deal with administrations who tend to make nonsense a reality. Although not yet an administration, project Catalyst can look daunting and as intimidating to new comers who may not make the effort to go through the whole process just to ask for a few thousands dollars to try out an idea risk free...\r\nHelping developers get faster funding for \"small\" ideas can thus help them to take the leap of faith needed at the start of any project. Making the first step possible and the next one easier.\r\nHas the saying goes \"All great journeys always begin by a first step\". This proposal can help new ideas come to life and grow.\r\n\r\nI have been involved myself in project Catalyst since fund 2 as a CA and vCA so I've seen the project grows in complexity and requirements, this proposal is adding back some simplicity and effectiveness with the added benefit of improving the main funding mechanism through a positive feedback loop (as explained in the core of the proposal).\r\nAnother positive thing about this proposal is that it gives the opportunity for people to learn the Catalyst process hands on while they work on a small but real project of their own.\r\n\r\nI'm thus giving a 5 out of 5 to this impact criteria as the developer community will directly benefit from its success.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer's experience is in line with the project (from his LinkedIn profile where his full CV is available - interesting to read - and his current and past accomplishments within the Catalyst community).\r\nHe has been helping to shape this community from the beginning. Catalyst would probably be very different from what it is today without his positive influence throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear and detailed budget for the time to be spent and the total fund allocated for mini proposals. We do regret the absence of information about the necessary team member roles to be fulfilled and which of these roles the proposer will be playing himself but I know for a fact that it will not be difficult to find motivated people who will be more than capable to fill these positions inside the existing Catalyst community.\r\n\r\nGiven the above and the proposer who puts his reputation in line as a long term member, there is little doubt concerning the delivery of the promised work and time. The only problem would be the absence of \"mini proposers\" but this is unlikely, given the current growth of Catalyst even before the release of smart contract on the Cardano blockchain... And even if that were to happen we can trust Tevo to do the right thing.\r\n\r\nI'm giving a five star rating to this feasibility criteria.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The problem being solved is well articulated and the solution very direct.\r\nKey Progress Indicators are very detailed, realistic and easy to audit.\r\nI do regret the absence of risk evaluation though as well as the absence of a few examples of mini proposals that would benefit from this system to better illustrate the concept (it could have been past or current proposals or imaginary ones).\r\n\r\nAn inquiry from the community with a few testimonies on the actual need would have been nice. Do we know for a fact that some people were actually discouraged by the current Catalyst project for small ideas? It's kind of logical to think so but having this kind of data would help give weight to the proposal.\r\nSince I'm part of this process myself as a CA and vCA since fund 2, a SPO and developer I can also feel the need for this and know that this is something I might use myself in the future if it exists so this is why I give a rating of 5 despite the above concerns on missing data.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_40", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposals idea is asking for a funds to create a treasury for an alternative funding mechanism in Catalyst. With this approach, small projects could be funded that don't have to go through the 3-month process in ideascale but get their funding in a 5-week cycle. With this project we are able to experiment if other methods than the current one in Ideascale are useful for the use of the treasury. Therefore the implementation can have a big impact on our ecosystem. It also benefits developers who can quickly get the funding to implement small ideas.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Tevo has hosted numerous mini-proposal workshops in the last month during the After Town hall and Swarm session. Many people of the community where able to help to iterate on this process. From my own standpoint and experience I can say, that it is already an advanced method and really helps small projects to not only get funded but also to create high quality proposal. Tevo has earned his trust and respect in the community through is engagement. The budget is very detailed explained and in relation to its impact definitely fair priced. As Catalyst is an experiment, I want to see this proposal in execution to see and learn if there are alternative models to use for Catalyst. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Metrics and KPIs of this proposal are clearly defined. Tevo also is documenting his process transparently. In addition, he has invited to community to join the decision making process.

The problem and solution are well explained. However, I would suggest creating a definition of mini proposals, what will be the limit amount financed per proposal, and provide some examples of mini proposals. This will make it easy to understand. \r\n\r\nAs someone who worked in many technology companies (although not as a developer), there are always steps/ideas to perform that could make a lot of difference. Creating the right mechanism that supports and incentivize such improvements/POC could bring a lot of value to the community. \r\n\r\nI really like the idea but believe some more thoughts are needed as detailed in the next sections. Maybe you can start with a mini proposal for a POC of one cycle and then offer improvements.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Tevo is well active in the community and passionate about this proposal (and mini proposals in general) while collaborating on it also with the community in townhalls breakout rooms. I would recommend however to have some additional team members leading the process and filing up the various positions. \r\n\r\nThe plan vs. the idea makes sense. But what are the specific next steps? Although it could be extracted from the text it will be good to specify them. \r\n\r\nThe budget is well detailed for the various tasks and hours/week required. The overall timeframe of the proposal is not clear - is it about 5 months? I.e. 192/8 hours/week. If yes, why 5 months should be explained. The treasury of $30k also should be explained and for how many proposals it covers and in what timeframe, considering also the ones that will be funded at the catalyst process. You can make a simple excel presenting the treasury part and see how it fits the goals to reach the 4th founding cycle.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap and timeline are implied in the text but could be specified more clearly. I.e. what will be the starting date, when you will recruit the team when the submission process is ready, and so on. \r\n\r\nTevo is the chef in using tools like MIRO to register information and present processes which gives a good base for transparency. \r\n\r\nKPIs and metrics are well detailed and can be measured.  Are 40 voters will be sufficient to create a fair process? It might be a small number to be fully objective. I think the governance process is very important and need to elaborate a bit more to be able to well audit the process (i.e. have someone from catalyst on the governance board).\r\n\r\nI suggest adding some risks and challenges. One that I can see for example is how to create clear information for the community about a parallel process and not benefit only the most knowledgeable community members.  \r\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Create faster alternative funding process for proposals with smaller financial request", "experience": "Project manager,\u00a0Product Manager,\u00a0Project Developer, and Analyst  \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tevosaks/"}
