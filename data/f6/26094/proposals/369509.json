This proposal aims to make a Typescript SDK for one of the leading DEXes in the Cardano ecosystem. Being an engineer myself I understand the value of have high quality libraries and SDKs. \r\n\r\nThe problem statement clearly articulates how other players in the cardano ecosystem will want an easy way to add swapping to their app and the proposed solution clearly articulates that a Minswap Typescript SDK can fill the need. \r\n\r\nThe roadmap is clearly defined with 3, 6 and 12 month milestones going from a beta to (hopefully) wide scale adoption. \r\n\r\nThe solution will be very scalable since it will simply be a library/SDK that can be distributed through traditional means. The underlying infrastructure is also all decentralized which is a positive signal for the scalability of this proposal. \r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score of 5 for impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The single most salient point regarding the feasibility of this proposal is the fact that this team has already developed a working DEX. Being an engineer myself I know that building core infra like a DEX is much harder than building a Typescript library/SDK. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it would be nice to get links to the LinkedIn profiles of the propersers. It's possible to find the github profiles by going to the \"Team\" section of minswap.org but it would be great if that info was presented in this proposal directly.\r\n\r\nAnother not clearly articulated aspect of this proposal (though it's possible to infer) is whether the proposal will need future funding. There are 3, 6 and 12 month milestones but the funding is a request for 3 months of work for 2 engineers. It would be great if the proposal could be more clear about this. \r\n\r\nBeing an engineer myself, I have a hard time understanding why building this Typescript library/SDK needs the full time attention of a blockchain engineer. I do wish the proposal elaborated more on the technical details of what will be built.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of clarity on some of the aspects of the execution of the proposal I give this a score of 4 for feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The ultimate metric by which this proposal can be measured is \"has a typescript SDK for minswap been released?\". This question should be fairly easy to answer. I think the milestones for the proposal are also well laid out and lend themselves to auditing. We, as a community, can figure out if a beta was released as open-source software within 3 months We can also figure out if v1 with high quality documentation is released by month 6 and we can similarly figure out if the SDK is used by most applications. However, the last point is a bit tricker because it's hard to figure out how many applications there are in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOverall, I do wish there were more numeric metrics like \"by month 6 we expect to have 500 swaps happen through the SDK\". Have a numeric metric clearly defines success/failure. \r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score of 4 for auditability because it has good metrics for success but is missing numeric metrics.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_531", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "183 / 5000\r\nK\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 d\u1ecbch\r\nYou guys have built Minswap decentralized exchange and are proposing to build Minswap TypeScript SDK this helps the project develop better, what are the additional challenges in this challenge?

The accessibility and interconnectedness offered by the SDK will improve the ability of all developers to use Cardano by facilitating the integration of miniswap service across a variety of dApps and websites. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers provide ample evidence to show that the proposal will be implemented successfully if funded. Their DEX demo on their YouTube channel makes it clear that the team is equipped to deliver and has provided a substantial amount of work, and is ready to go live as soon as mainnet launches. Since services like Miniswap will be invaluable to the ecosystem as it develops, the SDK takes it further and makes Miniswap integration available to all developers. The proposers also provide a good budget for the work outlined. I appreciate them showing the going rate per hour which is easier for voters to understand than a lump sum for the amount of work. One question I think the proposers could answer is why they only have the hiring of engineers for 3 months but the project is predicted to take ~1 year to complete. All in all though, great proposal and a seemingly great addition to the ecosystem. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is sufficient information to audit the progress and success of the proposal. Given that this proposal is a sequel to the Miniswap DEX which was successful in fund 5, the team has showcased it ability to deliver. In addition, the milestones and final product are measured in a way that is easy for voters to follow. For example, the team lays out clear markers for what is to be accomplished at what stage and that the final product should be used by most applications and wallets as a way to swap native Cardano tokens. At each stage, the proposers could provide a brief update on where they are at and identify any challenges that have arose. Moreover, since the launch date is Dec 20th, there is a clear deadline for the work to be completed that also can be measured against. Great work and look forward to the next phase.
