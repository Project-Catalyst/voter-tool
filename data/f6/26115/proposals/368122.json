The proposal aims to add NFT functionality to an existing application, indirectly through this application value can be delivered to the ecosystem through increased NFT minting.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team provided links to LinkedIn, the current website and to two additional Fund 6 proposal entered by the team.

I would like to see the items mentioned in defining success connected to the timeline in more detail \u2013 example provide NFT button by month 2. The budget is mainly allocated for payment of labor (salaries) in the format of $ charged per hour multiplied by time period. \u2013 I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the labor spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the labor must provide and when must they deliver \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the labor spending.
