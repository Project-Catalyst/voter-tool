The catalyst community is spread around the globe and I can only judge this based on what I think is the situation in Ethiopia / Addis Abeba, and I'm reasonably sure it's quite different from where I live. As a suggestion, some resources that explain the current situation in the local market could help in understanding the proposal better.\r\n\r\nAnyway, taking into account the innovative idea and similar initiatives that could stem from the project if implemented correctly, I will give this proposal a 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is described reasonably in detail and the experience listed is relevant. As a developer myself, the technical plan seems a bit tight on timelines but otherwise decently laid out.\r\n\r\nThere are a bit of inconsistencies though, which are not deal breakers per se, but I would like resolved before giving a final decision (or for next time):\r\n* The budget mentions EC2 graviton p2.xlarge instances. However the listed instance type, p2.xlarge, is not based on Graviton and is actually an instance with an attached gpu, which I don't understand why is used in this setting (nor the plan explains it) and is considerably more expensive than a standard compute instance.\r\n* The partitioned budget does not add up to the total value. I redid my counts a few times and they add up to ~85500$, which is around 6k$ more than the total of 79510$ listed in the proposal\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think the proposal, and the budget, are a bit too focused on the technical implementation of the project. While I trust them to deliver the technical platform, I think this has little to no value if there are no connections and adoptions by local government.\r\nLooking at how the budget is split, and counting in the \"marketing/relations\" budget the following items:\r\n*  marketing 3k$\r\n* legal consultant 1.5k$\r\n* miscellaneous 2k$\r\n* business consultant 1.5k$\r\nwe get that the budget allocated to \"marketing/relations\" is less than 10% of the general budget (using 85500$ as the total value).\r\nAccording to Deloitte, companies in the Tech Software / Consumer Services usually spend around 15% percent of their budget in marketing alone, and this percentage is even bigger for typical startups (around 20% according to lola.com)\r\n\r\nTL;DR The technical plan seems decent to me (a developer), but the business / marketing / relations plan is lacking and could impair the whole project if not executed properly and I would have like more attention on this. Maybe you can iterate from here and re-submit the proposal on the next fund.

I also believe that this project will be the 'proof-of-concept' for fighting corruption which will give a huge impact on Cardano.

That said, it seems this proposal is very much in a nascent stage. There may be greater chances for success had the local government office been approached already and perhaps secure an MOU.

The fact a total project amount is defined and that funding from Catalyst is not 100% of what's required suggests other sources of funding is at hand.
