The NFT market has been growing immensely during the past few months, and the Cardano blockchain will be a strong competitor to the high gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain (which currently houses the biggest market for NFTs). Creating a bridge that allows you to migrate NFTs between different blockchains (similar to what Polygon is for Ethereum) would create a wide opportunity for people to use Cardano, even if they are already involved and committed to another blockchain. I would have liked to see a bit more clarification in the solution statement. I understand that the original NFT will be copied on the Cardano blockchain and that it will expand the working area of the artists without minting each blockchain individually. But is the NFT just copy-pasted, or is it a completely new NFT that is minted on Cardano? Just an extra sentence explaining how it would work could make a huge difference in clarifying the solution to the problem. \r\nAlso, what function would this project have when compared to other blockchains that has cheaper fees than Ethereum, like for example Solana? Does the function of the 'bridge' work both ways, or is it only migrating NFTs on to Cardano from the outside? These are questions that wouldn't necessarily be there if the proposals purpose/solution to the problem would be more described in detail. Since the budget is asking for 63% of the total funds for the challenge, it is my opinion that the proposal should be crystal clear in what it wants to do and how it intends to do it, no matter who is reading it. \r\nBecause of these question marks, I'm giving the impact a score of 3. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It would be beneficial to the proposal if there was some evidence to verify the experience of the team, for example LinkedIn or website. The proposer seems to acknowledge their need of hiring 4 external developers, since they don't have enough experience in developing on Cardano, which is one of the reasons for the budget being so substantial. I'm by no means an expert in business administration, but the budget seems a little bit excessive/inefficient in its allocation of funds. For example, the budget plan includes hiring 2 dedicated testers for 18 000 USD, and I'm assuming the time frame of this spans over the course of 6 weeks (which is the time horizon the proposal provides). My question is why the project aims to finish their product in such a short timeframe, if it means spending so much funds? The proposer gives some further explanation in the comment section of the proposal where he describes the complexity of launching the product piece by piece instead of the whole cake. I would have liked to see some more specifics included in the budget, for example how many working hours are intended for each position in the project. \r\nThe project plan is more than highly ambitious considering the short timeframe and the massive amount of funds required to reach the intended goals. The detailed plan does feature enough specifics to communicate the experience and understanding of creating such a product that the proposer aims to create, albeit with the bar set pretty high. If the proposal had a bit more detail describing and backing up their ambition, I would be comfortable in assessing the feasibility of the proposal, but at the current state I'm unsure of the level of feasibility, which is why I'm rating it a 3. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a rough estimate of time required until the products intended release, with milestones and a time horizon. The team intends to share the development progress with stakeholders and community weekly by reports, having their code on GitHub, and updating the status online for the community to follow. These check-ins with the community and stakeholders are really good for the transparency of the project. I would have liked to see what channels they intend to communicate with the community (apart from GitHub), will it be via Telegram, Discord, Twitter, their own website? \r\nThere are some metrics of success provided, but these could be improved by adding something more quantifiable than having 'we finished this product/function', this would make it more easy for the community to follow and assess. As stated earlier in the assessment, the proposer does seem to have some level of understanding of the potential risks and challenges provided within working with the project (for example hiring a lot of external developers). The level of detail provided is still not enough for me to be entirely comfortable with the auditability of the proposal, there are currently more descriptions WHAT the proposer wants to do, than HOW they want to do it.

A well-known Cardano twitter handle recently joked that with all the attention being showered our ETH-Converter that we should also release an NFT-converter to siphon off some of the NFT successes on other blockchains. Well, this is one such project that could lead to a similar outcome. It minimises disruption from the original tokenisation registration and extends rights and post-minting activities in a much cheaper and robust ecosystem. A DApp such as this could also promote Cardano to other users & artists who may well decide to perform the original minting on Cardano rather than the expensive competition. This aligns quite nicely with Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's claims that the project is well underway with the bridge from the other blockchains are nearly complete so there is a sense that the team has a good grasp of the requirements. The background of the proposer and the team adds to the confidence that this project will be implemented successfully. The timelines and developments targeted within looks relatively acceptable including the budget, which seemingly looks to be a significant percentage of the total for this challenge but arguably could be worth it. The business model besides adding utility to Cardano can be leveraged in marketing our blockchain's capabilities. It also would not damage the reputation and expectation of the coming ETH converter and may coerce other projects who haven't considered porting over to Cardano to do so with the existence of this project. If it meets and/or surpasses the identified success metrics, the requested funding looks cheap. Also, the aggressive timelines indicate their plans are well underway and gives the impression that should it not receive any success from Fund6, that somehow the project will still continue. I believe it may add more value to Project Catalyst itself if this gets funded in this round.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal presents the details and the aggressive timelines that should make this auditable. Mentions of testing efforts and open GitHub repository means anyone in the community can track its progress. In addition the proposer suggested regular reporting to Catalyst and the members so even if one may not be actively tracking its progress, they have the intention of sharing it with the community.\r\nThe overall read of the proposal indicates this is a team who are used to developing fast and reporting immediately and with transparency. That is commendable. It even hints a desired earlier-than-Fund6-timeline release of its production  version, well ahead of time. Should this project receive the support from the voting members, I for one would agree to either speed up the rewards allocation process for this project or its distribution even post release. This project is significant enough to Catalyst, the booming NFT economy and the recent Alonzo release that not acting swiftly could result on lost opportunities that's good for Cardano because this is a show-piece.
