I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

In the detailed plan it's specified that people would purchase NFT representations of a condo and then suggests they could either move in or rent it out.

This leads me to suspect that the proposals were created en masse in the hopes of gaming the system and obtaining some funds.
