Budget allocation and plan seems very reasonable. The timetable for project completion seems reasonable. Having the developers on your team and proof of their skills would help boost voter and CA confidence.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "They have provided in great detail what needs to be done and how they will do it. A clear roadmap with milestones. They are solving a much needed problem and the solution they provide seems perfect.

This proposal directly meets the challenge by suggesting a problem that effects the entire scientific community (millions of people) and would be used in high volume.\r\nReferencing my scientific background I can confidently say that the problem that this team are tackling is massive. If they are able to solve it, it will substantially grow Cardano's user-base, network-utility, network-value & ADA circulation... Not to mention, change the world for the better. This proposal gave me goosebumps.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that this proposal would be implemented successfully and bring huge value not only to Cardano but to the world. The team make me feel this confident because they have prepared such a thorough and well presented proposal which fits the brief exactly. The proposers are high level academics who have presented to us a long term vision and the steps they plan to take to get there. The project is broken down into achievable parts with a defined roadmap to work to. Once the proposed project is available to other scientists it will have a high chance of adoption because the problem it solves is one of the biggest in the field.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The authors of this proposal have presented the Catalyst Community a detailed budget of how they plan to utilise the funds in initial phases of this project.

I believe with using NFT as the medium for academics and scientist to publish their work, it will make the resources accessible to everyone while protecting the author's copyright thus bringing in alot of new users and also provides value to the community. However, this proposal fails to provide information on how this project is able to scale to address future challenges. How do you propose on how and what will be done to tackle traffic load and database issues when millions of people starting to use the platform. Will this platform be open source or only exclusive to the team members?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal provided information on the team members with relevant skills and experience to successfully implement the project. Budget breakdown are made clear to understand. The proposer offers realistic roadmap. Furthermore, this proposal describes the necessary resources needed to implement the project. However the proposer did not provide any future risks or challenges that they may face during the development and how will they navigate through the problems. What is your plan when facing an issue that requires additional funding? Also, can you explain how do you implement the 'pay-per-own' or 'pay-per-view' model when the data is easily viewed by the public in the blockchain. Explain in details what sort of mechanism used to implement the privacy mode for NFT. Another question on the 'pay-to-own' or 'pay-to-view' model, if the buyer buys the token of the of a academic or scientific paperwork and produce something out of it, will there any more charges or royalties that should be paid or does the smart contract is customizable for each of the token?

The budget sounds very reasonable compared to the potential outcomes. Unfortunately, there is not much information about the technical implementation and also the two proposers do not provide us with references needed to implement this project (both technical and business). To better evaluate the feasibility and to see if the team will be able to implement the project, the implementation plan (technical and business) should be more detailed.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\r\nThis team has a well-defined roadmap and the definition of success is made. But it would be even better to add some specific number related to the criteria (e.g. 1000 NFTs minted by scientists after 12 month). To improve this proposal, I recommend to link a documentation source to help to the community to assess the progress of this project.
