However the proposal budget is large and doesn't really outline what value it is going to bring to Cardano. At this early stage in our evolution I think it is wise to focus on proposals that are building utility and driving mass adoption. This problem statement is not terribly specific. The proposal reads more like a list of hopes and dreams and lacks direction and clarity. I hope that the proposer is not discouraged by this assessment and finds some collaboration within the community to refine his proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has stated in the comments that his proposal was done last minute and it really feels that way reading through it. It does not inspire confidence in me that allocating funds to this project is a good idea this round. There is no roadmap, only ideas. The budget requested is too much for such an undeveloped concept. My experience working in academic Institutions (CSIRO & University of Canberra) gives me perspective on this proposal.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "This proposal gives the community no clear way to audit.

I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

Furthermore, I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product.
