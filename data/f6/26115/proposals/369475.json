I think it is original, as I have not seen this anywhere prior. I think that empowering groups of people to be able to bid for NFTs together will be appealing to a lot of smaller investors that might not be able to afford something on their own. I also like that you created a website to show off your project. \r\n\r\nAn issue that I see with the proposal that I think you should work on, is there is a lack of details. The idea is great, and I think that it addresses the challenge extremely well, but you do not have any details other than the general concept. You did provide a link to your website that explains a bit more, but requiring people to go to other websites to get the info might not be the best idea for potential voters. Also, while there is a little more information on the website, it still does not have sufficient details to properly assess it. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I like that you made a funny statement with your relevant experience, but it seems like the all purpose dev is the only direct relevant experience. The NFT collector and economist might have some skills that they can add, but its a bit unclear to the readers exactly what that might be. You have a little more information on the website, but its the same issue of not having enough info in the actual proposal for the voters. \r\n\r\nGoing back to my comments above, I think this is a great idea, but there is not enough information in the proposal to be able to determine if it could be successfully implemented or not. Having a great idea is not the same thing as having a plan to execute it. Voters will want to see all the details of exactly what you plan to do to bring this to market, what your timeline and milestones would be, how me measure success of this project, etc. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "This is the same issue as above. There is not enough information provided to audit against. There are no milestones given, KPIs, or even a definition of what success would look like for us to audit against. I would strongly consider thinking all of these areas through and listing them out, as they are things that people will want to know about your project. \r\n\r\nSo again, love the idea and would like to see this come to Cardano.

I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the developers must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.
