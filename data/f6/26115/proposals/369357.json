However, very little information is given in the proposal. It is unclear when comparing the problem solution and the detailed plan if the proposer wants to create NFTs for rights in publishing and translation, or if the proposal is for funding research on the possibilities of such. In order for being able to measure the impact of the proposal, it would need to include some detail in the problem statement, how this is connects to the challenge brief, how it would impact Cardano and a more clear description on how the solution connects to the problem. It would also be beneficial to have a plan for scalability, and a structured plan for networking, outreach etc. Therefore, I disagree that the proposal effectively adressess the challenge.

In order for the feasibility to be assessed, it would be good if the proposal included some links to previous projects, or a LinkedIn profile page, etc. There is a basic idea described and the story behind it, but the proposal would need a more detailed plan on what the proposers aims to achieve. Also, how are the funds intended to be allocated between the three team members? Is there an estimation of labour hours? How long will the research and development go on?

In order to increase the quality of the proposal, I would recommend also including some KPIs or metrics. Partly for the community to observe the progress, but also to have some check-in-points in the development phase for the team. For example, how many writers and publishers do you expect to reach out to/onboard after 3 months? 6 months? Will you reach out to different platforms via 3rd party, or to publishers and translators working freelance? How many NFTs do you expect to mint and connect after x amount of time, etc. There isn't a lot of information to lean on here, thus making it very difficult to measure the auditability of the proposal.
