Minting and selling Intellectual Property NFTs will increase the use and number of NFTs on Cardano, thus increasing utility and providing value to the ecosystem. I would like the team to refine and expand on the solution, how does the team plan to scale and overcome the different legal jurisdictions found around the world?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Using NFTs to show prove of IP is a good idea. However the proposal requires further development to ensure successful implementation. The team can expand on the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal, what are the responsibilities and deliverables of each member. I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\". Lastly, I would like the team to expand on the plan for scaling and future funding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal has a minimal roadmap and budget. I would like to see the team develop Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for the project (register 50 IP NFTs by month x, sign up 50 artists by month y), and connect the KPIs to milestones on the project roadmap (timeline). I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the labor must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.

As far as my ignorant mind could gather, it proposes tokenising the IP onto the blockchain which then presumably can be a metadata for a piece of work as a minted NFT. If correct, it aims to introduce a first step prior to minting any works with a proof-of-origin stamp. Whether my assumption is correct or not, it is easy to see the aims of this proposal. The only question which can be asked for such a process is, how does one establish uniqueness and originality of the work itself when the registration process is self-service? As an example, an artist could repurpose or re-envision Mickey Mouse dressed in Halo battle gear. Is there a violation of someone else's IP in this case and what checks and balances will this proposed system have to ensure this question is addressed prior to the registration? That aside, should this proposal gain traction and acceptance, it will certainly pave the way for a further boon in the NFT industry.

It would have improve the score had the rest of the team and their qualifications been introduced. The scope of the project seems large and the timelines for the quoted build and deployment reflects the size of this undertaking. What also would have added value is an itemisation of the kinds of skills & expertise required for each of the three phases. This would have demonstrated a good grasp of what's involved. It would have helped to explain what will be spent for each milestone specially given the amount being requested is almost 90% of the budget allocated for this entire challenge.\r\nThe measures of success at the described intervals matches the development and release timelines and that adds credibility to the claims, however the missing details on the Human Resources required held back a perfect mark.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned previously, the scope, the development outputs and measures of success had been carefully laid out. However, from a project management standpoint the key elements that will make this auditable are lacking; i.e. what kinds of roles are required and have they been on-boarded? How much of the funding is allocated to each of the roadmap goals? What levels of participation can be expected from the community when it's in testnet? The ability to audit a project is where some of the more micro details are need and the score given reflects the lack of the finer details in this regard.
