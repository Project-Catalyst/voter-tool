Gaming has huge potential to attract new users to Cardano, however a thorough market research hasn't been done. This research will provide important data for future developers to build their model on. Moreover, with this data, there will be less speculation in the NFT space. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer clearly provided information of the team member with evidence of skills and experience. They also provided clear breakdown of manpower and resources allocation.

This proposal also presented the KPI for definition of success. However, the proposer did not mention on how will the community keep track of the progress.
