However, the project requires further elaboration. I would like to see links to LinkedIn, Github or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences. The team can expand on the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Experience appears valid but nil bio or links to previous work, github or website so impossible to authenticate. Reading the proposal and the comments section gives us some insight that the proposer has excellent experience and knowledge pertinent to this sector but cannot validate. The plan is detailed and does not seem too outlandish but again cannot be reviewed sufficiently to back the proposers claims. Work may well have started and illustrations drawn but I cannot find anything to know this is the case. This is a real shame because I sense a good idea from a clever IT professional.  I would highly recommend that the proposer establish further collaborations with the Catalyst community, find a way to share small samples of the work already completed and resubmit in future fund.

Seems to be an enthusiastic proposer whom has already completed much of the required research and planning at least but very little can be verified and that poses a risk for the Catalyst community in terms of outcomes and deliverables. The metrics/KPI's appear reasonable although the timeline is optimistic unless much of the work is already done. Making a game that will onboard users is a highly competitive market to enter albeit this one is designed for a target audience whom may be thrilled with the idea of utilising their cryptocurrency in a safe legal manner which CCP authorities will allow. I feel the Catalyst community will need strong evidence to clarify that this project will not have a negative outcome for all parties involved.
