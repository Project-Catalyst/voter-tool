I would want to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences.

Lastly, the project will require additional funding, the team must clarify how the project will fund itself in future", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal lacks a roadmap and provided a single line budget. I would like to see the team develop and define Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for the project \u2013 what does success look like in 12 months, what value of investing do you want on the platform by month 6 \u2013 set a goal and use it as a KPI.  Furthermore, I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. Lastly, the budget needs to be developed beyond a single line entry, the team must create a detailed breakdown. As the project stands at the moment, I feel the project will be difficult to audit.
