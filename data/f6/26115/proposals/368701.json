I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences.

I would like to see the team create a thorough roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond single line entries and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the developers must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.

The reason for the neutral rating is that I don't think the proposal effectively addresses the challenge in that it does not really touch on business models, nor on how it can help to distinguish Cardano, though to be fair it does help \"undistinguish\" Cardano as a platform that now supports smart contracts.\r\n\r\nI would have loved to have seen the idea developed in more detail with respect to business models.  While I think it's interesting and useful to develop a user interface, I feel this would be more effective if informed by more detailed thinking about the business model.\r\n\r\nFor example, I think the design of the user interface might be quite different depending on details of the ownership and transfer model.  Would a contributor gain ownership at the expense of current owner(s) stake in the content?  Would those owners feel motivated to give up that ownership?  Might it be better to grant ownership based on signals from other users?  What would the \"cost\" be to those users?
