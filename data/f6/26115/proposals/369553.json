Emes is proposing a unique and creative business model that will drive user adoption and funnel profits back to Project Catalyst treasury.\r\nThis project intends to use art NFTs to bring mainstream awareness to how Cardano can improve our societies.\r\nThis project has potential to scale to high numbers of users. I have no technical expertise or ability to create impressive art but I am a concerned citizen with regards to 'the state of the market'.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "If this proposal received funds I think it could be a growth catalyst not only for this project but for the eco system as a whole. The proposer's work experience leads me to believe that he has the required technical skills and ability to manage a team. The proposal is quite in depth and gives voters a vision of what it could become if funded. The timeline and funds requested seem reasonable however this is not my area of expertise. Emes appears to be an active contributor to the ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is a dream for auditability! The roadmap and milestones are detailed and the budget is clearly presented. It is obvious that this proposer has given much thought to how he will keep the community informed and prove his team's progress.

Not only does the idea fall within the challenge, it will help in the discourse of what NFTs can truly represent and how the economies they spur can lead to new conventions and new ideas. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer and project lead seems to possess the background needed to drive such a project. The idea is also not new as an existing project has proven its merit in production; cardanospace.com already trades pixel spaces where owners can display their NFTs onto a grid and this was achieved pre-Alonzo. However, and as also claimed by the proposer, there are some unknowns in terms of what Plutus contracts can achieve and this places risk on Feature List #7 and onwards. Arguably, features 1-6 has already been achieved by CardanoSpace, or its not far-off, but what then of features 7-12? Will any remaining funds be returned to Catalyst? Can achieving 50% of the features be considered a success? I recommend this project discuss its requirements with a Plutus Pioneer graduate and perhaps re-submit this proposal in a future round with a more realistic view of what is and isn't possible. It would also be helpful if the proposer can name the successfully funded proposal from the previous Catalyst round. It could impact any assessment of the chances for success of this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There's enough information here to make this project auditable. The proposal described the skills needed for each team role and their budget allocations. It also coupled this information with a quarterly timeline and expected measures of success at every end of the roadmap. However, the score given reflects the uncertainty of achieving the complete features list, as disclaimed by the proposal itself. By default, the uncertainty casts a doubt on the plans presented, albeit small but significant for a project that is requesting half of the amount allocated to this entire Challenge Setting.\r\nAs mentioned, CardanoSpace.com already exists, and built within the timeframes bookended by the  Mary and Alonzo hardforks. I highly recommend engagement between this proposer and @cardanospaceNFT or a Plutus Pioneer.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has developer/IT experience and appears to be a knowledgeable in the concept of NFT design and utility. The plan is to onboard a team of six(6) but does not say if this process has already started. Perhaps a query over the amount of funding requested for basically an idea that is yet to begin? I would have liked to see some inroads being made on team formation/collaboration and perhaps some graphical examples of what the final outcome is envisaged to become. The gaming element will need some consideration although I suspect that design does not have to be complex to draw in users. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information is quite good the idea itself is excellent but the budget is perhaps the only query. Consider breaking this into smaller portions that allow for progress to be made, auditing by the community and gradual acquisition of the team and I feel you may well have a stronger proposal. At this stage I do feel that there are potentially many risks that may not allow for the metrics/KPI's stated to be achieved without some level of the plan already in place.
