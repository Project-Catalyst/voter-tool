At no time do the authors mention the use of NFT in their DApp. It's a good idea, really relevant, because in fact youtube censors a lot of content, creating a new video platform that is more open in this sense can be beneficial for many users. What worries me here is how this content freedom would be done, because certain things do need to be censored, such as: adult content (if the DApp is open to any user, it is inappropriate for minors to have access to this type of content); content that is morally offensive to any group, and so on. I think the lack of censorship needs to be thought about, an idea I had is: the user would need to prove their age to access the DApp (it could even an Atala Prism ID when it was launched!). Anyway, it's an interesting idea, but it doesn't involve the use of NFT, as the challenge calls for. Another issue is that I didn't quite understand how the profit involved here would be, how the content creators would monetize the videos (perhaps the views are paid?), how the advertising content would be managed and so on.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There are no details regarding the authors' team. All we know is that they have 15 years of experience in app design and management/development. But it would be important for us to know who they are, their names, what each one does (who are the designers? and the developers?), how many people make up the team and also some examples of apps they have developed so far. Without such information, there is no assurance regarding your ability to successfully develop the project. As far as a roadmap is concerned, we basically don't know anything about how the DApp would be developed, just how long this development would take, thus making the visualization of the project's future very uncertain. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Unfortunately, what we see in this proposal is something even common to find in the description of proposals for the funds. The authors use a lot of space to detail what the DApp would look like, but they don't explain anything about its build process. We would need to know which phases would make up this trajectory, and within each phase what would happen, with dates, the professionals involved in each step, who would do what and for how long, metrics to measure the project's success (so that the Cardano community could follow the course of things). All we know is how long this DApp would take to develop. It would also be necessary to establish a dissemination plan for the DApp, after all, youtube is one of the most famous and used apps around the world, creating a competitor for it would need a strong promotion.
