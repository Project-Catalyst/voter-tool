Minting and selling social NFTs will increase the use and number of NFTs on Cardano, thus increasing utility and providing value to the ecosystem.

I feel the proposal requires further development to ensure successful implementation. I would like the team to expand on the responsibilities and deliverables of each member of the team, this way we can better judge whether there is a work overload in one area. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

I would like to see the team develop Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) (create 100 NFTs by month x, sell 50 NFTs by month y, etc) for the project, and connect the KPIs to the milestones on the project roadmap (timeline). I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond single line entries and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the labor must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.

I have their website (https://www.wottlenft.com/),which is already in development, bookmarked so I can scoop up some early NFTs. I am pumped for this team!
