I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the labor must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.

The plan is too simple at this stage to gain any insight into how the budget funds will be used and this may be presented at a later time in a future fund.
