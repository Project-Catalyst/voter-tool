Yes this is a new use case and one that can drive wider interest in and use of Cardano. We have approached Niantic and await a response. Half of the budget is for development of the AR MVP. The remainder is to attract and engage blockchain programmers to begin work on the \u201cliving NFT\u201d component of the game. Given the shortage of Haskel and blockchain programmers, we thought it prudent to have a solid budget in hand first. Note: the AR team is already in place (see https://rewildgame.toonstech.com). A quick search of LinkedIn will reveal their credentials. Regarding Mr. Hoskinson, it is our understanding that it was our bison game idea that spurred him to begin talking about crypto bison during the March 360.  Until that event, we were unaware he owned bison."}, {"q0": "Creating an NFT game addresses the challenge brief of creating business models with NFT's at the core.

I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the developers must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.
