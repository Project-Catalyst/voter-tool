However the proposal requires further development to ensure successful implementation: The team can expand on the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal, what are the responsibilities and deliverables of each member. I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team work history, education and past experiences. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\".

I would like to see the team develop Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for the project based on a monthly timetable and connect the KPIs to milestones on the project roadmap (timeline). I would like to see the team create a solid roadmap -  develop and add milestones to provide deeper detail, set technical development milestones for creating the product. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending, and I would like the team to connect the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the spending, what are the specific tasks and deliverables that the developers must provide and when must they deliver the tasks \u2013 this breakdown will give a clearer indication about the implementation workload feasibility and match the deliverables to the spending - thus the team can track performance and spending over a timeline.

There does seem to be some aspects missing from the proposal that hold it back somewhat. It is not entirely clear what are the goals of this proposal beyond extending partnerships with luxury goods manufacturers? As such the proposal needs to clearly define exactly how it will proceed and why that is important to Catalyst community. Presently, the proposal reads more like a research orientated project which is fine but needs further clarification on quite a few points.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has a good idea but does not tell me too much about themselves and what relevant experience they can bring to the Catalyst community. I sense that they have knowledge around luxury goods and issues that counterfeits raise but cannot check any bio to establish veracity.

", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Currently the proposal stands as a good idea without any real supporting documentation. The lack of a detailed budget to explain the use of the significant funds requested makes it hard to recommend this proposal. There are no metrics/KPI's  attached and this needs to be present for the community to know what it is getting for those funds. I would highly recommend the proposer seek out further collaborations from the catalyst community to breakdown the intended outcomes and show the value that the community may achieve by voting for this proposal.
