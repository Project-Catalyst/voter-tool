The proposed hardware platform, presumably a cloud service, should be defined to indicate scalability from a technical perspective.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team of one developer has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals and is broken down into identifiable items.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work but should better explain what is being done and how.\r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposal should identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation. Specifically the lack of existing interested partners and a marketing plan to obtain them is a major risk to meeting the challenge objectives. A development team of one also poses a risk from unforeseen circumstances.\r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with a defined timeline but it does not have auditable milestones.\r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals up to the 2 year hosting period defined and the recruitment cost per DID user. \r\nThe proposal should detail specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "I believe this is a really effective proposal that will have a great impact on driving participation.

The budget has a detailed breakdown. Given the size of the project, the estimated costs are +$80k. This puts it in the uncomfortable spot of being not attractive enough for a software developer, but too complex for a community. As a result the proposer will take on the full job and pay c.$30k out of pocket.\r\n\r\nGiven the potential impact, and quality of the proposer I would even have suggested to grant the full $80k.

The proposer has clearly thought about their problem statement and offers an innovative solution that could be adopted by any group or organization. In addition to being well thought out, the proposer clearly identifies the need for a community solution to a fairly wicked problem, globally. While the proposer notes that everything is certified in the developed countries already, it is likely that this solution would be for new companies, as well as those already well situated. Providing a solution that works in both the developed/developing contexts will have an even greater impact and positive effect for the community at large. If successful, I feel very confident that this would return huge dividends for the Cardano Community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposers lays out a very clear argument for why this is a problem, and breaks down the solution into smaller tangible pieces that articulate to voters the steps necessary to reach the end goal: \"open-source software where everybody can issue and claim certificates\". In addition, the fact that the proposer outlines that this is an open source project, the community will have ample opportunities to test out the product, adapt it, upgrade it, and so on. This intention to return the final product to the community also can give faith to the community that this project will be implemented successfully. The proposer is encouraging this dialogue, which is a necessary step in building voter confidence. \r\nI must also note that at first when I read the budget I thought it was a bit high but completely reasonable, given the potential for disruption such a system could have. The fact that the proposer then cuts that budget in half and will incur half the costs themself is a true testament to their commitment. This also implies that the proposer is willing to take the risk that this project will be a success and is willing to back it up with his own money. A first of all the proposals I've reviewed. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is certainly sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. The proposer has clearly thought about the necessary components that would need to align in order to complete this project. The metrics to measure and success criteria are explicit and can easily be evaluated by the community. \r\nAs mentioned in the response above, there is an additional layer of auditability which can be applied to this project through the proposer making it open source. This condition will allow a diverse mix of Cardano developers and users to engage with the developed software and to adapt it to their needs. This, at least to me, will result in the project being evergreen and iterative throughout it's lifetime. The ability to continually adapt and improve is a foundational feature of the Cardano ecosystem and I really appreciate integrating this feature into catalyst projects.
