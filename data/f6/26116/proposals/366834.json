Much more detail is required to assess this proposal however the ride in the video looks amazing! My recommendation is to check out winning proposals at the end of this funding round to see what is required.\r\nThe goal is not clear from the proposal however from a reply in the comment section the goal appears to be \"to gamify downloading, installing and using Atala PRISM on a mass scale\" which would align with the challenge objective.\r\nThe proposal as written is not able to scale to drawing in millions of DID users however the description in the comments section could, especially based upon the annual visit count. Even if it was just a gimmick it would achieve the challenge objectives however the add on Educate and Incubate phases along with other ideas in the comment sections could make a viable proposal.\r\nMy advise is to take the comment response as a starting point and team up with a good proposal writer for the next funding round.\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team of has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is not reasonable to achieve the goals and is not broken down into identifiable items.

How would their identity included in the game link to their broader identity? What happens if someone doesn't want to sign up on the blockchain? What is the benefit of doing it?

While it appears that there is already a pilot project \"midnight ride\" it is not clear where Prism fits in. The proposal is way too sparse on milestones, deliverables, and measures of success. There is also a logic leap between the ride and the use of Prism, while this may be clear to the proposer, it should be broken down more granularly for voters. \r\nThe proposer also should provide additional information on their skillset and background which makes them a good candidate for funding. How does being a ride developer help get mass adoption of prism? For these reasons I cannot score the proposal higher. Addressing them in future funding rounds may strengthen the likelihood of success.
