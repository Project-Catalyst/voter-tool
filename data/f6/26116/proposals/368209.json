The proposal requires future funding before any significant DID usage.The proposal predicts 5000 users in 12 months for a cost of $45,000 which is $9.00 per DID user which is on the high side compared to other proposals however over time as more users are added that rate would drop. \r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals compared to similar proposals but is not broken down into identifiable items.\r\nAdditional funding is required to develop the product to the point that the challenge objectives would be met, the proposer has not provided a plan on obtaining these funds other than they are professional and outside Catalyst. \r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work and shows what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation. The largest risk is that future funding is not obtained and the MVP closes down due to lack of funds. There is no mention of open source code which could be used by other community members to continue if desired.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline.\r\nThe proposal has projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user although they should be projected out farther.\r\nThe proposal details several ways progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal is for a learning suite and the technology associated with the proposer's website appears to be very well thought out and organized.

This proposal aims to do that by building a learning tool which issues verified credentials to the users of the tool. \r\n\r\nThis proposal effectively outlines a problem with the current education system and proposes a product based solution which alters the mechanics of education - from a factory based model to a highly personalized model. \r\n\r\nThe proposal lays out easy to understand 3, 6 and 12 month milestones. \r\n\r\nIt's not clear how this project aims to get adoption. There are high level ideas of partnering with universities but there aren't lower level details. Which universities? Which jurisdictions? What guerilla marketing techniques will be used? \r\n\r\nI think the general idea here will scale quite well since it's a software based approach and software generally scales quite well.\r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score of 4 for impact because it's lacking a detailed marketing plan which means it's hard to estimate how many people the product will affect.

It's great that they want to start with foundational building blocks before building a product but more details would be nice. \r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score of 3 because it lacks many details about why this particular team will succeed and given the fact that the project still seems to be in the research phase.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does a good job breaking up the milestones into 3, 6 and 12 month goals.

More\u00a0clarity on document hosting would be great. \r\n\r\nEven though the milestones are broken down into tasks, some of the tasks are quite vague. How can the community verify if \"Required operational infrastructure for working as globally distributed teams established\" or \r\n\"Foundational-developments completed\" are done? What exactly do those things mean? How big will the team be that it needs significant investment in global operational infrastructure? what are the foundational developments? \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if more the milestones/metrics were numeric in nature like the milestone of \"Achieved 5000+ downloads for Mindcards MVP\".\r\n\r\nI give this proposal a score 3 for auditability because it lacks some details and some of the milestones are not auditable by the community.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_531", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I am flagging this CA, because I see a very problematic BIAS here. Why ?\n1) I brought this team of proposers to Fund 6. I am acting as their senior advisor and co-proposer. The team initially planned to develop this as a 'traditional application'. I successfully convinced the proposing team that without DID & tokenomics-foundation, a lot of future opportunities will be missed. \n2) This means that this proposer team is NEW TO CARDANO AND CATALYST - ISN'T THIS SOMETHING WE WANT ? According to this proposer it seem to be hard to join from 'outside'. Apparently he also assumes that CATALYST proposals need to already be realized, asking for retrospective funding - this is the only way I ever could imagine how the requested information could be seriously provided. In my eyes this is a very critical BIAS. \n3) The ACADEMY team made this proposal within the ATALA PRISM DID challenge setting, because here we can interact with the right experts for INTEGRATING our DID approach with what is already emerging or already available (technically and also with selected universities and institutions). \n4) Therefore putting FOUNDATIONAL WORK as part of this proposal is NOT A WEAKNESS, BUT A NECCESSITY !\n5) What is critizised here are lacking details, which\n a) Either are already there in our MIRO working environment, which are way too detailed for integrating this ino a proposal like this and require a 'guided tour', or \nb) Cannot be there by nature, since we want to use this Challenge Setting for creating something really new and future-oriented. \nc) There is a complete (clickable) POC of the MINDCARDS functionality already available and shown on our WEBSITE. From the functional perspective, we are far beyond 'idea phase'.
