How effective it would be at driving mass-scale is hard to assess without more info.\r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has not provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links. The proposer's role with NFT-Maker is not obvious despite the website link.\r\nThe team has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget may be reasonable to achieve the goals however it is a large lump sum that is not broken down into identifiable items so there is no way to assess.\r\nThe timetable may be realistic to complete the work however it is long compared to other proposals of similar scope and does not show what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal however given the scope there may be none.\r\nThe proposal does not identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation.\r\nBased upon my experience, I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not provide a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline.\r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. Upon implementation, the number of DID users projected would be 0 however the proposal should project out to a timeline in which the community could expect DID users to be recruited assuming future funding. When could the community expect the challenge objectives to be measurably met if this project were funded? \r\nThe proposal should detail specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "NFTs are a hot item and a gateway to the crypto universe at the moment.
