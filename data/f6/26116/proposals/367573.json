If the primary students and alumni were onboarded then that would be a recruitment cost of $2.78 per user which is not unreasonable when compared to other proposals. There are several outreaches within the proposal to expand DID adoption among the community. \r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has not been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals and is broken down into identifiable items.\r\nAdditional funding is required to develop the product to the point that the challenge objectives would be met, the proposer has not provided a plan on obtaining these funds.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work but does not show what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan does not describe the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\r\nThe proposal identifies risks and challenges to a successful implementation.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with some auditable milestones and a defined timeline.\r\nThe proposal includes projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. \r\nThe proposal details vaguely how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals.\r\nBased upon my experience, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "This is a very strong proposal which rightly fits under this challenge. Being initiated by a private university gives it a much better chance for success compared to a public university, which could be hampered by tighter government regulations and requirements. In a way, a private institution has more leeway in terms of experimentation and innovation and they might well succeed in progressing Cardano's mission in this part of Africa. The proposal is very-well considered being transparent of the risks and challenges. Its description of innovations it had already deployed since institution in 2002 suggests ability to navigate hurdles and push on through to success. The example cited for its analog ID, from laminated versions to plastic to RFID tags, is one which western universities have also followed, and arguably in a quicker timeline. The proposal as presented is complete and this provides great confidence for the team behind it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a good team behind this proposal and that's always an essential part of any chance for successful implementation. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's skillset and background is  perfectly matched and it doesn't hurt that he is also the owner of ISDRL. WADA is also involved in this project and most in Catalyst know of their background and reputation. The plan laid out is very realistic as all aspects of such a project are covered; the background, its risks, its approach, any mitigating factors and dependencies (especially with ATALA Prism's DPKI) and the benefits of deploying the DIDs to its present, future and past students. What's described in this well-written proposal is not just an experiment in utilising DIDs. The team is aiming for a very Cardano-centric ecosystem, even including ADA in its tuition fee collection (with discounts for students) utilising Yoroi for on-campus purchases and alumni charging for access to proof of authenticity of their degrees, etc. Where this project could be further congratulated is in its merging of the three common IDs already being used. This can potentially open up a lot of opportunities beyond higher education utility of ATALA Prism. The curriculum-component of field trips to regional farming areas could not only lead to potential adoption of Cardano throughout the country but could also assist in identifying needs not yet considered. Furthermore, that other universities have expressed a desired to join the initiative is a good sign that there is local belief and confidence in this proposer group, and more participating universities could well speed up Atala Prism deployment in Congo. These rationales for the score does not even mention the fact there are Plutus Pioneers in this proposal. That's the real cherry on top. Good luck. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's enough information provided to make this project auditable particularly with the production of videos and digital files, as described on the specific Audit section which most proposals do not have. It would've been helpful if they identified the channel/platform where these trackable resources will be published. Being in the higher education industry, they would be well aware of the importance of audit processes as its a common requirement for maintain teaching licences by  the government hence I have the utmost confidence that this would be paramount in the conception of the project. Where it would have received top marks is in the detailing of the developments of each of the components they are building. However, the presented roadmap which highlights both goals and costing suffices, even though it is bare minimum for this section of the assessment.

Those are good tools to be able to understand to implement such project. It also appear that the expansion of thi project will go beyond only the university (ISDR/GL), up to other universities in two different towns (Goma & Bukavu) in various provinces, and beyond that to get to reach to the rural area, focusing on the use of Cardano by farmers.\r\nIn the metrics section, the proposer doesn't mention about the students trip to reach out to farmers, which is a great action for this project as it is an opportunity to promote Cardano. Also, the outreach activity is not specified. \r\nThe proposal is well divided into phases (3), with focus on a specific set of activities to be implemented. The time allocated to the third phase may be short as it may be the phase during which, the success of activities conducted to phases 1& 2 are promoted to to other potential partners to may be willing to join.\r\nI would propose this project to be 1 year long, and have universities partners who have already expressed their ntention of being part of it, to join at phase 2, during the conference of universities officials. Also, at that conference, may be think on inviting local businesses representatives, who may benefit from the information around the use of blockchain.\r\nTheh total budget seems for me to be low as the work to be accomplished may require more. The total amount requested would cover phase 1 7 2, and eventually target the fund-7 for funding the third phase.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Riska are well elaborated in this proposal, that mention what would prevent the activities on taking place. On that, the Proposer could have also mentioned less safety & security that prevails in that region of the DR Congo that may prevent students to fulfill their outreach work.\r\nThe auditability process is presented with various stakeholders involved : proposer team, university management team\" Would may also be necessary to have a road map and sequences about the contact between the proposer team and the Catalyst (community) for check-in on project advancement  ", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_478", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "A very welcome proposal.
