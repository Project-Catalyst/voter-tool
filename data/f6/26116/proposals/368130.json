You have demonstrated the technical ability to implement your proposal. \r\n\r\nHaving been a PMP (Project Management Professional) for over 10 years I feel your timeline is in order. I would encourage you not to break up funding but keep the budget as is. To know you have the budget to complete your entire proposal gives me confidence you can sustain the staff and momentum to complete this successfully.\r\n\r\nI do see the need for DID in the hiring process.

There are 756 million Linkedin users if even a fraction of one percent were to use the backend connectivity it would be millions.

In this way, this proposal very well meets the main objectives of the challenge and also relates to the \"DApps & Integrations\" challenge. The problem I found here was about how this tool works, I thought the explanation about it was very short and not enough to understand how this technology works, especially for people outside the industry, like me. It would be beneficial if the author further detailed how this integration works, and explained in an accessible way to the public. In this way, the reliability of the proposal would only increase.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We have very little information about the author, all we know is that he has already built HR Tech/Data Driven products and companies, but we don't know his exact training area, nor some examples of these products/companies (it would be essential to include them, to increase the author's credibility), and we do not know its direct connection with the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem either. You can see that he has good technical knowledge and understand exactly what he wants to do and where he wants to go, through the very technical explanation of the proposal and the attached website. Despite this, it would be important to provide this information, in addition, it is not mentioned at any time if the author intends to hire other professionals to work on this project, it would be necessary, in my opinion, to at least hire a UI/UX designer to build the DApp interface. Regarding the roadmap, we have some information about how the project will take place, but there is a lack of detail in several parts, both in the action steps and in the explanation of the financial division.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The author himself acknowledges that the information he gives us about the project's execution is only an overview, when the most correct would be to present a minutely detailed plan of the development phases of the idea, especially when it comes to a proposal with such funding. high and of such complex content. It would be necessary for him to detail each of the parts he mentions in the overview, he would provide information on what would be done every 6 months, but 6 months is a long time, it would be necessary to understand what would happen in each month, for example, what order of the actions, who would be involved in each one of them (if there were other people working on the project)... About the financial division, in the same way, there is a lack of detail, the requested values \u200b\u200bare extremely high, it would be necessary to explain them further, for example: \"DAPP Development 20-40k USD\". Like this? Could the value range between 20k and 40k? And if it was 20k, what would happen to the rest? Who would that money go to, all for the author? What would he do on a daily basis to make these developments? Two other issues that concern me are the fact that the author does not establish success metrics, this way it is very difficult for the community to monitor the progress of the project, and it also does not explain how the dissemination of this new tool created here would be, the marketing plan that would popularize its use. For these reasons, I believe auditability needs to be revised and improved.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Using your DID linked to your job references, skills as an online, standardised & verified CV makes it accessible to humans and machines.", "experience": "Built various HR Tech & Data Driven products & companies.  \nCan reuse these components to make Cardano / ADA relevant to the career jouirney."}
