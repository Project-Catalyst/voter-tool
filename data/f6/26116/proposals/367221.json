And, as I myself have been asking in Town Hall Breakout rooms, how are we moving forward with developing 'reputation' in our involvement with Catalyst, etc.? As CA's, as community members, and so on.  So, now we have a proposal that is addressing making tools to do just that.  Great. Why not start with 'us'!  And build out from there... We are, in fact MANY! ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is my judgement that the two proposers are qualified to see to it that this proposal, well-articulated as it is, will be implemented successfully. They are very active members of the Catalyst community, and seem to have thought this proposal through in a detailed enough way to see to its successful implementation.  It would be a good use of 8% of the budget allocated to this Challenge. It is simple enough, 'doable', and productive from the perspective that we are in the VERY EARLY STAGES of this SSI/DID/VC development.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Roadmap, 'Impact,'  'Auditability,' 'Success metrics,' and 'What success looks like' sections of the proposal plot out a sufficient way to measure or audit the progress and success of the proposal.

The proposal includes a workshop and marketing budget to encourage usage of the developed tools which is very beneficial.\r\nThe relatively small budget request compared to the potentially large impact on achieving the challenge objective is a very good ROI (Investment and Intent).\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient evidence of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal in the form of references or links.\r\nThe team has been sufficiently identified in terms of skills and number required to implement the proposal.\r\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the goals and is broken down into identifiable items.\r\nThe timetable is realistic to complete the work and shows what is being done and when.\r\nThe plan describes the resources necessary to implement the proposal with a budget of $500 for hosting and software.\r\nAlthough not separately categorized, the proposal does identify risks and challenges to a successful implementation in the form of the unknown go live date of Atala Prism puts their timeline at risk.

The roadmap and milestones could be more clearly defined though.\r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. The proposal does provide similar alternative metrics including a reporting website.\r\nThe proposal details specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals with websites, github, weekly development updates and youtube videos.

This would happen through examples of DIDs and VCs; through this observation, people probably felt more secure and the initiative could drive the adoption of Atala Prism. It is positive that the authors use examples so that we can better understand what kind of credentialed information we are dealing with, and from what I understand, there are many types.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "About preparing the team to execute this proposal, there are two people, we have a small description of each here, but they attach a page in the notion where we can see a little more and also access the linkedin profiles.

We know that the first thing they will do is develop the accreditation tools, and then they will teach the community how to use them. It's good that they already have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhen they would do it, after the Town Halls.

In terms of success metrics, this was one of the best auditability I evaluated. The team has several ways in which the community can follow the progress of the project, such as: open source, documentation available, weekly updates via notion (a very good organizing application!) and so on. In this way, the community has more than enough to monitor the project's progress. The financial division is done in detail, but at the same time some parts could be better explained.
