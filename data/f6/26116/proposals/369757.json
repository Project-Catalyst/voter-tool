From what the proposal presents seems that the platform will act like an intermediary between the government and the citizens for clearly communicating and archiving the bills with the will of the people. In other democratic countries, even the bill is sustained by a necessary part of the population and accepted by authorities, further steps are required to pass the bill and make it a law. Perhaps it will be better to find a viable target audience and to start in an area where the legislation is permissible and the government has the will to accept a significant change on how the interaction between citizens and the authorities is done. If the pilot project has the necessary impact among all participants and the outcome meets the goals of the project, can be further developed at a national level.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It is not clear what is the relevant experience/skill of the proposer and the team members, necessary to complete the goals of the proposal.

And the relationship with DID would be that people would use an Atala Prism identity to identify themselves there, just as accounts would be signed in blockshain. Theoretically, it is a very relevant project, the problem is that I, as a Brazilian citizen, am not sure if it is possible for us \"ordinary\" citizens to suggest such a feat. It would be very positive if, during the proposal, the member Lilian Correia, who is a social scientist, explained to us readers how this works here in Brazil, is it really possible to make interventions such as bills? If we had this information more secure, I believe the proposal's credibility would increase! Apart from this detail, I thought it was a very good idea, because it would help the country and would also spread Atala Prism around here, if the publicity was done consistently and intensely.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team that proposes to develop the idea (Lilian, Atico and Bosco) does not detail very well who they are. We know she is a social scientist, a developer and a content creator, but unfortunately the information stops there, making our knowledge of those involved very shallow. It would be beneficial if they detailed more individually, who they are, what their professional backgrounds so far, linkedin profiles (if any) and so on. That way we would be more confident about their abilities to successfully execute the project. This proposal is quite complex, which makes me think that it would take several developers working, and not just the fixed member of the team. In terms of sharing expenses, they say that 60k of the funding would be for developers, in the plural, which shows that they intend to hire other professionals in the area. But they don't specify how many, and whether they would all work during the entire project execution or just in some phases, for example. Another question that is not very clear is: what is the relationship of the team members with the Cardano universe, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, etc? It would be necessary for them to demonstrate a solid mastery of this universe or to have the intention of hiring someone who did, so that we would be more certain that there would be someone there who was prepared to perform such tasks. Regarding the roadmap, we have some information, but everything is very shallow, unfortunately, there was a lack of detail in relation to the parts, as I will comment more in the next note.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "When it comes to auditability, this proposal has very little detail, unfortunately. We have a very superficial roadmap, where we know what activities will be developed over the months. However, it would be necessary for the author team to provide more details on how each of these activities would take place. For example: present the website in beta phase. Okay, but who would this be presented to, and how? Disseminate the idea/marketing: it is necessary to understand how the dissemination content would be constructed, which would be the target audience for the dissemination. Reading the proposal, it is understood that Brazilians would be holders of the Cardano Blockchain and Ada (and in the future the ID of Atala Prism), but it was important that it be confirmed. Through which channel would the disclosure take place, if the site would only go into operation after the official launch of Atala Prism... I also had the following question: why Brazil? I would like to understand why the authors decided that such a proposal would be relevant for our country. Although everything involving politics is highly bureaucratic here, as they mentioned that to access government public data here it would be through a PDF on a website (it would be nice if they posted the PDF or the website link), we also need to consider the fact that the share of Brazilians who know and use the blockchain is still very low. Perhaps this proposal would be more suitable for a future financing, some time when the technologies of our community were more popular among Brazilians. There is a brief explanation on how the financial amount would be divided, but as I mentioned, it was necessary for them to detail how many developers would be working on the project and how, how the marketing campaign would be, etc., and so we would also understand how each installment of the funding (very high portions!) would be used. And finally, I say that there are no metrics here to measure success, and that would make it very difficult for the community to follow the progress of the project. For these reasons, I believe that auditability needs to be revised.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 7, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Develop a platform using Atala Prisma that citizens can use to present bills and vote on other popular initiative bills.", "experience": "Lilian Correia -\u00a0Graduated in Social Sciences\n\nAtico Mismana - Developer\u00a0\n\nBosco Cardosco - Content Creator"}
