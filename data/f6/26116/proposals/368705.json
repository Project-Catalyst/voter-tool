The proposal also includes biweekly reports that contain risk assessments.\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with auditable milestones and a defined timeline. The deliverables are very clearly defined with the  \"commitment to the transparency of the allocated funds, we expect payments based on above deliverables without the need of advance payments.\"  \r\nThe proposal should include projected metrics that correspond to the challenge objective such as the number of DID users projected to be onboarded at specific time intervals and the recruitment cost per DID user. As a \"plugin\", the number of DID users projected would be 0 however the proposal should project out to a timeline in which the community could expect DID users to be recruited assuming future funding. When could the community expect the challenge objectives to be measurably met if this project were funded? \r\nThe proposal details specifically how progress will be reported back to the Catalyst community at regular intervals. \"The project implementation will follow Agile management based on Jira Cloud tools. Jira users can be created for follow up and auditability. Additionally, a bi-weekly report will be publish with project progress, mayor milestones and risk assessment.\"\r\nBased upon my experience, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Although Decentralized Identity (DID) is a novel technology, it has been around for years and there exist several challenges that must be addressed with regards to standardization and interoperability.

He also shows interest in hiring another developer, already establishing what the characteristics of this one would be and how he intends to hire him, that is, everything is already very well organized and secure. So, as far as the team is concerned, I believe the proposal is perfect.

It does establish a timeline, but they focus on the first two parts, which seem to be most important to understanding how the project works. During the explanations, he includes a series of information about what would be composed of each of them. I found it positive that in the first part they thought not only about the blockchain adept audience but also people outside our community or another blockchain, and we know that this portion is still the majority. They are very realistic, as they consider both options - whether the Atala Prism DID is already released or not. They also set a 2-week time frame for this first step. And then they explain the second one, focusing on the concept of plug-ins, with an estimated duration of also 2 weeks. Regarding the currency division, we have basic information about; however, I have found enough to understand this part of the proposal. As this is a very technical project, I can't see the community as a whole following the success metrics, it might be interesting if a select set of developers from the Cardano community were chosen to monitor the progress of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 6, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Facilitate documentation and integration code to the broad DID community so Cardano can be considered as a suitable player in the ecosystem.", "experience": "Strong academics and 25+ years of proven experience in architecting and developing software solutions for the telecom industry."}
