In terms of overall impact, a Cardano native token based 3D world along the lines of a SecondLife metaverse would, if it were to achieve the same popularity as the aforementioned, be an astounding success that really showcases Cardano's versatility to the world. Incorporating Atala Prism DID into the 3D world would be a real benefit, especially since there is an economic incentive in this metaverse. That being said, I did read Phil's comment and do share his concern that people do prefer a certain anonymity when engaging in virtual games.\r\n\r\nMore specifically regarding the impact portion of the assessment, this proposal articulates well that the Cardano ecosystem does not have a killer app and if constructed as the proposer imagines, this would definitely bring a lot on users into the Cardano ecosystem. I really like that the proposer is thinking about connecting to existing NFT Cardano-based technology to further integrate the Cardano blockchain into the project. Also, as a metaverse with no real restrictions, I can see that this project would be able to scale given enough resources.\r\n\r\nGiven the scope and ambition of the project, I have a few concerns related to its feasibility (which I'll articulate in the next section) but in terms of impact, I'd like to see a few more concrete metrics and goals (maybe a roadmap) that measure the project's impact.
