No Methodology is mentioned, nor criteria for Startup selection, Startup success after passing thru the Incubation process.\r\nA more detailed plan on how and what contents, method and process will be produced and/or used, even if it is in the form of an experiment could make this proposal feasible and aligned with the impact our community aims to reach.\r\nSo I strongly suggest the proposer team review these details and aim for next fund and the appropriate challenge to align with. \r\nIt seems that the team has the proper experience to be able to produce such a plan and further detailed description, so the proposal can be considered and evaluated as a good addition for the community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As the plan presented just have general activities with no detail and fundamentals on how the goal will be reached, it is not possible to either agree or disagree wether the plan can be implemented and if it will derive the expected value for the community and be a good use of the treasury resources, which by the way the amount requested is not low for a proposal with almost no detail. Doubts can be cleared by providing those detailed and focusing on explaining HOW you will reach specific outcomes, measured in terms of impact (Amount of proposers out of the program, Funded proposal from the program, Quality of the assessments of proposals from the program, etc)\r\nThe team experience seem to be adequate, but the proposal content should demonstrate that knowledge and capabilities to drive it to success.

Looks like use of a buzz word to help with marketing. I'm happy to be corrected on this by the proposers (suggest you add more info in the comments  (i have posted a comment so voters can get clarity).\r\nHaving said that the sentiment of finding ways to help people bring their ideas to life is completely in line with the challenge.\r\nAs it stand i don't see how this would be good use of treasury funds as it stands. Step 1 of the project 'development of a model' sound like a theoretical exercise which i presume must have already been through about as they have 4 other proposals in Fund 6. \r\nMaybe a better way forward is to share this research with community and develop the model collaboratively. There are many channels through which this can be done (town hall, telegram, discord). This will help to get momentum and then a proposal of this kind would be sensible.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "a very high level plan is provided with an allocation of budget. what is required here however is alignment of resources to this plan. for example we have webpage development and youtube channel - keeper SCS already have both of these, what is it the  $3k is needed for?\r\nAs another example we have $6k for workshops for projects running in parallel with the development of the model  - would these run in parallel? what is the scope and purpose of these workshops?\r\n \r\nHaving spent many years developing and reviewing business cases running project review boards and assessing project briefs i draw on feedback i have give/have been given.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The success criteria doesn't provide the criteria for success, instead gives some of the deliverables of the project (a guidance doc and a website)\r\nThe proposal says is it going to 'test' the model. A set target to support this is key. eg. x number of projects supported (the scope of the incubator is not clear but if it is supporting projects through proposal and year 1, then it will take this long to 'test' the proposal and provide feedback to the community. \r\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal partially relates to the main objective of the challenge, because on the one hand creating an incubator for startups working with blockchain can be attractive to proponents, but also to people outside the ecosystem, so the idea it would also fit the \"proposer outreach\" challenge, perhaps even more so than this one. It is very positive to have a place to guide teams to carry out their projects, and as the proposal author cites, they already have experience guiding 5 previous Catalyst Project proposals (it would be important if they cite which ones, and how they were able to benefit from the help ). However, this idea would especially benefit the proponents, as the Cas and Vcas would likely not have any kind of engagement to participate in the next funds.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team involved in creating the incubator is really strong, we can see who each member is through the proposal description and on the attached website, where we are told what their areas of expertise, experiences and current positions are in relation to the team. In this way, we are given a lot of assurance regarding their ability to successfully execute their project. One observation I make, however, is that it would be important (as I said in the comment above) to know some examples of teams that were mentored by them, what kind of guidelines were given to them in this orientation and where they managed to go after the \"consulting\", because that way we would have a practical demonstration of the work promised here, which would increase credibility and confidence in the team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As to how this idea would be put into practice, we unfortunately have few details. We know that meetings would take place at Zoom and that some newsletters would be made available on YouTube, but we are not told 1) how long these meetings would take 2) how often they would take place 3) who would be present at them, given the large team that is presented to us on attached website. Another issue is that, despite there being an explanation about what would happen each month and how much money would be allocated for it, this explanation was shallow, lacking in detail. For example, in month 1 the development of the incubator would take place, but who would work on it, exactly? Would it be a developer along with a designer? In months 1-4 a good amount of funding would go towards supporting the incubated projects, but how would the breakdown between them? In equal parts, or proportional to the complexity of each project? In the direction of the project, we don't know how this would happen, if it would only be 1 person directing (and who), etc. In other words, although there is a detail, it is insufficient, since it is an expensive and complex proposal, requiring a review in its auditability.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Create a business incubator for blockchain startups.
