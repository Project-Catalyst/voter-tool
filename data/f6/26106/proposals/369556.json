The maintenance and curation of live sessions and information about Catalyst allows for a channel of aggregation and redirection of the community, important aspects to educate and inform the community, which consequently helps to maintain cohesion and mitigate information fragmentation, providing a channel where people can learn about Catalyst and know where to look for more information. Gitbook maintenance also allows for asynchronous communication, enabling the community to access content from previous sessions in the future.\r\n\r\nNo metrics/KPIs related to the material to be cataloged were presented, which I consider important for impact assessment.

As a Catalysts participant for several months i have seen Swarm starting to establish into a dependable hub. As such this proposal will help add value to the community and is worth funding.\r\n\r\nThe piece i would have liked to have seen in this proposal is how the GitHub and Swarm aligns with the catalyst circle, IOG you tube channel and the catalyst community site (dev.projectcatalyst.org) along with others. There is some duplication of content (eg TH slides). As part of the marketing it would be good to how Swarm differentiates itself and the boundaries within which it works.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have validated the time estimates for maintenance and marketing with someone who does this for a living and they both make sense.\r\nAs Stephen has been doing the maintenance it is reasonable to expect he will continue.\r\nThe budget also seems sensible for this type of work.

Stephen has been a key player in the catalyst swarm sessions and has been providing much of his time for free to date. His participation in the swarm meetings and the follow up work behind the scenes is a testament to his willingness to continue this work on his own. The plan presented is clear, well laid out, and shows that a lot of thought has already gone into this. The links provided by the proposer also strengthen it overall by providing additional information, however the proposal itself is strong as a stand alone for voters who may not have the time/will to look at all the links. \r\nIn addition, the budget being requested seems more than fair for this work and doesn't capture free work he has already put in.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The reason I am not giving this criteria a 5 is because I would like to see more information at each of the milestones. For example, the proposer highlights that sustainability is a key component of this work and that sponsorships are being sought, but I think more information could be provided here. What type of sponsorships? Would the idea to have others eventually do the Gitbook? There is also no real contingency should something happen to the one proposer. If say he gets sick, or something happens that pulls him away, what will happen? While I do think the proposal does allow for auditing the progress and success, some additional thinking on the points raised here will strengthen the possibility of overall success.
