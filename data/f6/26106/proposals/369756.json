Since I think content is king, attracting users with good video contents will benefit the community. I think that this proposal has a lot of potential. My only suggestion is to stick to one language at the time. Creating resources for 10 languages at once can be really difficult and non efficient. I give it a 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the informations provided by the proposer are correct, this proposal can be implemented without major issues. The team has experience with creating and translating youtube content. They also have  provided a detailed budgetization. For that I give it a 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think that the timeframe given is reasonable and the community will be able to verify the work and progress of this project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_439", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a very well presented proposal that has global reach and a very specific, clear to understand mission.\r\nIt build up on a POC following a previous fund proving greater confidence that the proposer will deliver. Over time i can envision langbassadors becoming the go-to translation service for Cardano and Catalyst content providers and I well worth funding to continue this experiment so we can see how much growth can be achieved over e next 12 months.\r\nI have spent the past few years running multi country ERP rollout programs so appreciate and have first hand experience of how language can very easily become a barrier to success, thankfully it is easily solved if specific efforts are made to address the language issues. \r\nAs a potential addition to the roadmap the proposer might want to reach out to other content providers (eg Catalyst school) or reach out the the catalyst circle to get a rounded community view of how to take this important piece of work to the next level.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a project lead i like to keep thing simple when both developing project briefs and delivering projects. you will often hear me say 'show me , don't tell me' or 'make a list , do the list'. evidence/data is key.\r\nThis project provides all of the above. A simple to understand tracking system (see trello/kanban board in the roadmap) and a set of videos as a POC.\r\nThe budget is broken down sufficiently that it is easy to understand the proposer thought process. On this basis the amount request is also sensible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The deliverables and timescales for this proposal are clear and measurable, as a voter i am very clear on what i am getting for my money.\r\nThe only guidance i have for the proposer is to demonstrate the risks and potential challenges have been thought about and mitigated. The proposal already demonstrates the proposer ability to adapt the project (in mitigation resource constraints).  Scaling up will add additional complexity not only from a coordination perspective but also from a  quality one.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "The proposal specifies exactly what issues will be covered by their proposed training, so it's easy to see how it will give people the information that *could* lead to their meaningful participation in Catalyst. The techniques suggested (simplifying and summarising, using mind-mapping) make the material accessible, which will increase the likelihood of impact. However, although the videos will undoubtedly inform people, it's impossible to know if they will necessarily lead to the practical onboarding that this challenge demands. (It's actually surprising to me that this proposal is in this challenge, rather that \"Multilingual resources\", which it could have had a much clearer impact on.)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is already successfully implementing this work; they clearly have a really thorough understanding of the issues, costs, and risks, and are able to manage this kind of project. The budget is well explained and appropriate, and  even though 80 videos sounds like a lot to produce in 3 months, their time plan is very clear and obviously feasible as it's based on work they have already done.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Not many metrics or KPIs are given. We can audit how many videos are produced, and how many unique people view them; and, because they are on Youtube, there might be some qualitative info in the comments so we can assess in an ad-hoc way if people find the videos helpful. However, the ultimate focus of this challenge is  on people going on to participate meaningfully in Catalyst, watch Town Halls, vote, become proposers or CAs, etc; and there is no consistent way to assess either whether this happens at all, or, if it does, whether it is a direct result of the videos.

Regarding the Audibility Note : Education is a long term process, but since we need to start with the basics the content created will remain relevant for years to come. Once enough content is created you can start doing marketing towards language groups that are ready for it. But we are at step one of a long process, just like the development of Cardano itself took and takes years to complete. In 2017 there were no ( short term ) parameters of success to be shown for Cardano itself. With educational programs it is similar. Either you think that the whole world will suddenly speaks english on an expert level, or you acknowledge that education and content needs to be translated in order to reach mass adoption. We have our POC which can limit the cost / animation drastically, since we know no immediate ground breaking results can be expected short term. Education is a long term investment, not a Dapp wth clear MVP and short term success."}], "solution": "SNC Langbassadors create a series of 8 podcasts narrated in at least 10 languages, teaching How to participate actively in Cardano", "experience": "Rik completed his Master of Economics in 1991, has 25 years of Business-to-business sales experience-6 years as entrepreneur + Fund 5 winner"}
