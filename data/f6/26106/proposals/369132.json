Will it get people voting, proposing, or becoming CAs, like the challenge metrics suggest? Unlikely \u2013 but then, 'meaningful participation' does look different for different types of community, so maybe this is OK.\r\nThe proposal does mention ideas for after the workshop (some lasting resources on social media, and ongoing collaboration with an NFT maker platform on the Cardano blockchain) \u2013 if that happened, it could represent genuinely \"meaningful engagement\", and new participants \"providing a contribution that improves Catalyst's ROI.\"  But that is all after the workshop; so the question of whether the proposal will actually address the challenge (i.e. produce meaningful onboarding of some kind) rests almost entirely on what happens beyond the end of the project itself. As a creative instigator and participatory artist myself, I know that even if numbers attending a one-off workshop are quite high, it doesn't necessarily translate into impact or engagement beyond that. So it's really hard to assess, and the project as it stands could end up just being a cool one-off event. I don't doubt that some productive connections will be formed between the *proposal team* and individuals in Catalyst, and that's brilliant but  it's not the same thing. \r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal team are well connected with their communities and have a strong network that they are already working with; the budget is fair; there is a clear timeline (with nice integration with the Frei(t)r\u00e4ume conference), and the timeline feels long enough to actually deliver the workshop itself. But it feels like it might be too short to do the background work needed to create much meaningful impact from the workshop, as mentioned above. Also there is no assessment of risk, and no contingency planning for what would happen if anything didn't go to plan, which is a worry. Overall, I can't be confident the project would be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not actually suggest any specific audit metrics. But we can audit how many artists attend the workshop;  the bi-weekly community calls will be recorded and analysed by the team, so they will be auditable; social media engagement is auditable; and it would also be possible to audit numbers of any new people contributing to Catalyst or engaging meaningfully with it as a result of the workshop.
