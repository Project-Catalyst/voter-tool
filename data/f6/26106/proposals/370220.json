The problem statement is valid (how to increase presence of students in Africa?), in line with challenge, with clear return for African community (and Cardano community as a whole) and scalable to other regions of the world.\r\nHaving said that, it still lacks a bit of the \"how\" it is going to be done - thats why it didn't get 5 here. It could be clearer what content will be discussed, how to better engage with local entitities and students (parnetships), what kind of events and activities will be held and so on. Communication strategy should have more details. It could have also be included a mentoring program by Cardano SMEs to help those more interested and prepare them on technical and management aspects in blockchain and Cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The 2 people committed seem competent with experience and technical skill.
