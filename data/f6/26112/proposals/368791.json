The proposal is also a clear value add and positive impact to the Cardano ecosystem and further aligns with the vision that IOHK and the community is working towards in Africa.  Leveraging my experience in the strategy consulting sector, I suggest the following changes to turn this from a strong proposal to an excellent proposal. \r\nFirstly, the problem statement can be improved by rewording it to address a much larger issue - the issue of financial stability and access for women in Africa. This provides a much stronger narrative and story behind your proposal. The ability to scale up a Tontine seems to be a by-product of the much larger issue at hand.  Finally, you would benefit from providing tangible goals/targets/metrics in order to align further with the challenge criteria. This would make it easier for assessors and voters to ensure that proposal is in scope of what the challenge is trying to achieve.

The requested funds for $30,000 makes up a third of the total funds allocated for this challenge. Given that amount, I would expect an appropriate level of depth when addressing how this budget is going to be spent. Regardless of how good your idea is, having a detailed breakdown of how you intend to spend the funds will provide a far more compelling proposal for those voting.  \r\n\r\nFinally, I am struggling to understand the implementation path that lies ahead. Both from a commercial, regulatory and technical point of view there seems to be a disconnect between the idea and the activities that need to happen to truly reach your aspired goals. Once again, providing some detail and structure around the next steps / roadmap for this project would give more color and evidence that the project will be successful long term. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A key strength of this proposal is the tangible nature of the problem they are trying to solve. In order to improve the proposal even further, I suggest outlining important information such as a roadmap, estimate of key activities to be delivered and details on budget allocation. Further, having alignment with the challenge metrics would increase the change of a successful proposal. For example, the challenge identifies success as launching a micro-lending and Defi dApp within the next 3 funding rounds. Forming a view of a roadmap against this metric would have been a great opportunity of showcasing the linkage to the challenge in an auditable way.

If the proposers resubmit in the next fund, I would recommend outlining the skills and abilities of the team, including related work history, and where there are remaining gaps to be filled.
