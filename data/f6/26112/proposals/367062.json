Although KPIs are not presented, there are also no required KPIs in the Challenge setting.

It also perfectly aligns with Cardano's goals in Africa. What is commendable in the proposal is the intention to modernise the age-old financial practice of Esusu, which is well embedded in the Nigerian culture and to other cultures where African diaspora has reached. This will not only make adoption widespread but most importantly, it will be familiar to people who may not even have heard of Defi/Real-fi. It is also commendable that the proposer intends to deploy the DApp in the local language which would make on-boarding easier. Where I would ask the proposer to proceed with caution or reconsider is the intention to partner with single-pool operators, which in itself is not a disadvantage. However, in the end it is the total amount of staked ADA that will ensure regular block production and for members of a Crowd Stake Group, you would want to maximise rewards and ensure regularity of block production. I only mention this as there is a likelihood that pools maintain a single pool because they are not yet saturated. It makes business sense for a near-saturated single pool to spin off another and I am sure that any pool to which this project is aligned will attract quite a lot of ADA delegators who would want to assist in their own way in Cardano's mission in Africa.

The proposal is also a clear value add and positive impact to the Cardano ecosystem and further aligns with the vision that IOHK and the community is working towards in Africa.  Leveraging my experience in strategy consulting for the financial sector, I suggest the following changes to turn this from a strong proposal to an excellent proposal. \r\nFirstly, the problem statement can be improved by rewording it to address a much larger topic such as the inability for Africans to access credit. I understand that credit unions would have certain eligibility criteria in order to become a member - which I imagine is the reason that large cohorts resort to the Esusu/Ajo options. This isn't made very clear in your proposal and I suggest anchoring your problem around this. What would help unpack this further is providing some high-level metrics around who the target market is, how many millions of people this would affect, etc\u2026\r\n\r\nFurther, you mention that credit access is 'limited by factors such as trust, familiarity and capital risk.'  One again, it is not entirely obvious just by reading this what the true problem is and why - consider using terms such as 'financial literacy, eligibility criteria, etc..' to really bring this to life. \r\n\r\nFinally, the proposal's 6 month aspired timelines also appears to aligns with the challenge metric of launching within the next 3 funding rounds.  \r\n\r\nOverall the proposal is quite lengthy. Not only does is it distracts the reader from what appears to be a solid idea but does not sufficiently outline the key information such as (not exhaustive):\r\n\t- who are your target users (e.g 30-50 yr old women?)\r\n\t- why is it necessary to build this (are you just digitizing an already decentralised process?)\r\n\t- what are the benefits of your customers (if they customers don't get the share of capital each rotation then why would they opt into your system, does it protect them from fraud or cash being stolen in the normal setting?)\r\nFor future proposals I suggest trying to be more concise and grouping key pieces of information rather than scattering it throughout the proposal and forcing the reader to join the dots. Despite this, I think it is a great idea and worthwhile exploring further! ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team appears to have a diverse background and existing work experience in the African markets.  Both of these are great starting blocks and supported by links to their profiles (i.e. LinkedIn, podcasts, videos).  The requested funding of $9200 represents just over 10% of the challenge funds and it is clearly detailed that majority of it will be spent on Plutus developers.  Going forward I suggest having a clearer breakdown of this and linking it to your roadmap. You have mentioned in the roadmap section that after  3 months in you will start testing the smart contracts. How does this fit in with funding? Are the developers only being used for 3 months and not the full 6 months? Once again, providing a breakdown of how the funds will be used provides transparency for the community of voters and gives confidence in your proposals going forward. \r\n\r\nThe team has also provided a relatively concise roadmap. In the comments section you have reassured some community members of the 6 month timeline being realistic. Having more evidence around this would be extremely helpful - e.g what is your starting state (are you starting from zero or is this a build on top of a partial build). Once again, providing some detail and structure around the next steps / roadmap for this project would give more color and evidence that the project will be successful long term. \r\n\r\nLeveraging my consulting and project management experience, my recommendation for a future proposal is to more clearly outline what you foresee as future challenges. I can see a local adoption section which mentions elements such as local languages, blocking problems or library implementation which seem to fall under the category of 'future problems' - I suggest changing the wording to reflect this more clearly to demonstrate to the reader that you have considered all of these avenues. Further fleshing this section out to consider elements such as building trust/reputability or incentivization of users to use the service would show a deeper maturity in your proposal. \r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A key strength of this proposal is the tangible nature of the problem they are trying to solve. These tangible problems are translated well into actionable items, milestones and future plans that are mentioned throughout the proposal - providing sufficient information to audit the progress over time\r\nIn order to improve the proposal even further, I suggest further detail and clarity around information such as a roadmap and details on budget allocation.  Finally, to turn this into an excellent proposal from an auditability point of view, I suggest providing more clarity around the challenges (and the proposed solutions) that you are likely to face in the future.
