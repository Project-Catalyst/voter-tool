The proposal also mentions a problem to the local community of Africa, but the proposed solution seems to be general and not completely related to Africa.

Also, without a plan and roadmap, it's not possible to match the proposer background with the relevant experience required to implement the solution. It's also not mentioned if the proposer would work alone or with a team, and this is also important to the proposal's budget, since it should be broken down and better explained. Besides the information already mentioned, it would be good to discuss the technical side of the implementation of such a solution based on the blockchain, and it would be good to include information about who would develop it.
