Will there be different templates for different types of challenges? Some challenges are to create self sustaining businesses, others are to assist current community efforts or build a one off tool.

It would certainly help this assessment if the concrete experience of the person or team were shown in more detail. The link provided leads to the Stake Pool, but there is little information about the operator. The detailed description of the deliverables and the procedure is very well thought out and, from my experience, indicates corresponding knowledge in the relevant area. In my opinion, these details and the realistic cost estimate offer a high probability of successful implementation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap described seems very realistic and can be used to track progress.
