The trainer will then mentor 3-5 proposals into the Catalyst process. The details in the proposal are a little vague. The incubator/accelerator-like program is unknown however given that WADA is a co-proposer on this and the Catalyst Virtual Start-up Bootcamp, the Bootcamp seems the logical choice assuming it is funded. It is not clear how many initial trainers are intended and how many people they will train. There is no mention of seeking future funding for subsequent training sessions.

This is a pilot in one local LCC/hub \u2013 if it works well, but then there is no capacity to roll it out further, has it still succeeded? I think yes, and maybe the project's own definition of what success looks like (\"WADA begins to spread/decentralize and scale up our work...\") is too big for the size of the project? Yes, the challenge suggests measuring *sustainability* as a success metric \u2013 but framing success in terms of the expansion of WADA actually raises  questions about *scalability* which are probably unwarranted. Because if this project succeeds in supporting some new entrepreneurs and creating a training for trainers program that can be used again, that would address the challenge very well even if there is no capacity immediately to roll it out further.  So I'd say the project might be better to define success as the challenge brief suggests, by looking the success of the proposers who are mentored, rather than at WADA itself and its wider growth. Just a suggestion, though. Overall the proposal addresses the challenge really well.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The WADA team clearly have the skills and experience to deliver a project; and it's good that they additionally have the support of Catalyst School and others.\r\nI've developed several Training for Trainers type programs myself, and I'd say the timescale is ambitious but possible; and it's a good idea to use/adapt an existing \"Incubator\" type program for the trainers to deliver. But I'd like to know how many trainers they plan to train, as that could make a difference to feasibility; and I'd like to see some reference in the roadmap to some time and resources being dedicated to supporting the newly-trained trainers once they are actually doing the work. \r\nThe budget total seems realistic, but it is not very well broken down so it's hard to see if there are any gaps.\r\nAnd the assessment of risk is a little thin - only one risk is identified.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The key metrics are fine; and it's nice that they have included both the *number* of funded proposals, and the *percentage*, as those tell us quite different things. But it would be good to also include the number of new trainers trained, because a) it's an achievement of the project and b) it would be useful to be able to audit things like whether many people dropped out of the training-for-trainers. I'd also like to see some qualitative metrics assessing what the participants (both the new trainers and the people they mentored) thought about the process, what skills they feel they developed, etc.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Train WADA teams as mentors to support aspiring entrepreneurs submit quality Catalyst proposals", "experience": "\u00a0WADA: Skilled team of Cardano Community practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across Africa and the diaspora."}
