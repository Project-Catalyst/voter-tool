Simple to execute, leverage already published material and build a community to discuss. Having an upcoming meeting gives the encouragement to read the material by the deadline.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a simple, yet well laid out plan which the proposer has the skills to deliver upon. The only question I would have is should we be raising more funds to perhaps provide a book fund to provide the materials to less affluent budding entrepreneurs as some books in the genre can be expensive. Or is it possible to obtain these on loan in e-book form from some libraries?\r\nBook discussion clubs are generally relatively small. How many people could this format handle? Are there any plans to scale to a larger number of groups if demand rises?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Well laid out timeline and deliverables will make this easy to audit. KPI's have been set to measure success. A good addition would be to set some goals on these KPI's.

So having a books club with regular sessions could, indeed generate the habit to read and become better and more skilled at communicating and articulating business and projects ideas, which is the challenge goal.\r\nI would add to the solution a funded reason on how the initial (and further) books selection could help the participants upskilling at business articulation/communication, as it is not that clear, and I think the results at this goal will much depend on that selection of books.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan presented is very realistic and clearly articulated with SMART goals\r\nThe proposer experience seems to be aligned to the project, though no link or detailed resume were provided.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Metrics provided are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely) - Maybe the time part of the metrics is the weakest one, but I assume it will be monthly based with trends month over month.\r\nThe metrics are aligned with the purpose of the challenge as measuring the quality score of the proposals presented and their funding rate are key metrics within the challenge.

So if you are successor of it, you could mention it,  or if not - I have doubts your club will be  better. The list of books you chose is not impressive and I don't see how they will help entrepreneurs develop their skills to execute & communicate great ideas.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the budget is not big, it's still kind of expensive to charge $50/hour for just speaking about a book. \r\nAlso, it's not clear if the proposer has relevant experience.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Even though the Success Metrics is presented, it will be hard to calculate it.

For example:\r\n\r\n- \"help inexperienced entrepreneurs to learn and apply vital entrepreneurship skills so they can collaborate with teams and stakeholders on meaningful Catalyst projects.\"  The quote provides the idea for a targeted Cardano ecosystem example, nothing to add.\r\n- \"Entrepreneurs strengths are ambition and vision but often lack structure to communicate ideas clearly enough to win voter hearts & minds\" So, provide examples of how your solution directly helps entrepreneurs convert their ambition and vision to structured ideas that Cardano voters will easily digest and want to support.\r\n- In general, upgrade the proposal to specifically dovetail the proposed end product with the Catalyst idea funding ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHowever, weighted against the relatively small portion of the challenge pool that is being requested by the proposers, coupled with the fact that this proposal does not require deep technical skills like others (e.g. - Plutus dev experience, parallel distributed server development, AI, etc.), these shortcomings trouble me less than usual as long as the proposers understand these constructive criticisms and are willing to adopt them.  The voters will have to decide for themselves if they feel the same and if they believe the proposers will change their efforts to meet these criticisms.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of this proposal is an active and dedicated member of the Cardano Community.  He is an effective communicator and education projects like these are inherently about good communication.  I feel the project will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal does provide metrics but I feel they could be enhanced with some specifics.  For examlple:\r\n\r\n- \"Number of people participating in the book club\"  How many people?  By what dates? Etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, given the amount of the funds requested along with the fact that this project does not require deep programming skills, it is one of the safer bets in this challenge to deliver value to the Cardano ecosystem.  This project could have a broad impact on improving the quality of the proposals that are flowing into the Cardano funding pipeline.  I took off one star because of issues raised previously and because the metrics given lack specific numeric targets, but I repeat, if the proposer is willing to adopt those \"upgrades\", I think this is a fine project for F6 as it is now.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_551", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Host a book club to discuss a book per month with peers to help understand and digest the book and accelerate learning and improve skills.", "experience": "Serial Entrepreneur, voracious reader, leadership positions across many organizations from multinationals to non-profits."}
