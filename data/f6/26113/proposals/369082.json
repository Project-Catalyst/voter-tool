It brings a solution to strengthening the quality of proposals via the creation and use of an idea collaboration tool in Catalyst, one that is open to participants at all times and not only during the Insight sharing face (which is open for 1 week). This gives the proposers ample time to prepare for upcoming funds, and collaborate and communicate freely within their own timeframe, but within the Catalyst platform. From my understanding it is not meant to replace the Insight sharing phase, but rather complement it with a more free, less time constricting option. The solution correlates strongly with both the problem statement and the challenge brief in this regard. The possibility of increasing the quality of proposals is a decent investment in the catalyst ecosystem, that will (In time) benefit proposers, voters and community advisors. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team standing behind the proposal have more than sufficient experience working with the tasks required to launch this tool. They are deeply involved in and seems to have deep understanding of Ideascale and the Project Catalyst, and also have experience of having previous proposals funded in Fund5. Information and links to their LinkedIn pages and partnerships are provided in order for community members to verify their credibility. \r\nA detailed budget including labour hours and time allocation is provided in a reasonable and clear way, with few opportunities for misunderstanding. The proposal also includes understanding of what aspects of the process will be most imperative (marketing) or present potential challenges. \r\nSince the idea collaborator tool is promised to be ready for launch immediately (with a 5 week monitoring, marketing and development period presented as part of the roadmap), I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal features a short but clear roadmap spanning over 12 months, with milestones included. Having a slightly more detailed description of the success metrics would increase the quality of the report. It could for example be 'What quantity of ideas in circulation are we expecting to achieve by x point in time?', or 'How many users do we expect/want to register by x months?' \r\nThe community is available to easily audit the process and development of the project with the inclusion of weekly development updates, a GitHub link connected to their previously funded proposals, and using open source code in their development. I would have liked to see a section of the proposal that describes potential challenges and risks in a reasonable and clear way, and how the project means to adress these. It could be in regards to the marketing challenge, as mentioned before. \r\nAll in all, I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining the stated goals.

It addresses entrepreneurs \"building their skills\" via peer support and team building (rather than focusing on individuals building their skills in isolation), which is really appropriate for a  distributed, open community like Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Agree, with one reservation.\r\nThe team clearly have a good track record in building community tools on time and within budget; and their budget and timescale look workable. \r\nBut they (correctly, I think) say \"Marketing will be the most important factor for this proposal\" \u2013 and yet their team doesn't include anyone with skills in marketing or community engagement. These are **real skills**, not just something anyone can do; and especially when it's identified as the main factor in a project's success, some skilled and experienced input would be beneficial. For a project like this,  community engagement skills would be appropriate, rather than straight-up marketing. As it stands, the proposers say the tool will mainly be marketed by them interacting directly with community members they think might be interested; so there's a danger that the promotion might be too focused on their existing personal networks. With the challenge's aim to \"help an increasingly diverse group of Project Catalyst entrepreneurs\" it's important that a proposal like this has a plan for how to reach out widely, perhaps especially to those who are new, or in some way marginalised, or not very well connected. In fact, these kinds of people are probably the tool's main targets, since people who are already well connected across the whole of Catalyst are already doing this type of ideas-development in their existing personal networks.\r\n\r\nIn short, the creation of the tool is very feasible, but it needs more thought and expertise to ensure that those who need it most feel \"invited\". Still \u2013 it looks like the team might have access to some of that expertise via their links with LidoNation?\r\n\r\nAnd a small point - total time allocation only adds up to 90%...   :-) If 10% is \"contingency\", best to say so clearly...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics suggested are good, measurable, and it's great that they don't stop at simply showing that the tool is being used, but extend to showing that its use is having positive effects. Also, it's great that not all the metrics suggested are about creating  proposals \u2013 there are also ways to measure wider community benefits such as  increased interaction, discussion, teambuilding etc.. And very good that the tool itself is open source and readily auditable via Github. So yes, there's clearly enough info to audit both progress and success.\r\nOne suggestion \u2013 it would be good to try to also measure whether the tool increases the quality of proposals. Hard to prove, admittedly \u2013 but maybe something like the average CA score of proposals developed out of this tool, vs the average across the board?\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_540", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Provide a tool for the community to get feedback on ideas at anytime outside the funding process and allow teams to form more easily", "experience": "5 years of web/mobile development experience, 1 year of strategic consulting experience, funded for Catalyst focussed proposals in fund 5"}
