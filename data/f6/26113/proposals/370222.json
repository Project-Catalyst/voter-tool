On a per proposer basis it is quite expensive relative to the size of many funding requests and there are no economies of scale. Perhaps the proposers could create an online course covering the basics for a lower rate that early stage entrepreneurs could access. Once their business models are up and running and they have revenue streams and capital they could then afford a more bespoke and expensive service.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposers are in the business of providing exactly this service thus there is not reason to believe they would not deliver on the the offering.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditing delivery of this proposal is relatively simple. It would be good so see more ambitious targets for success however. What would it mean for the participants who received the training? How would in impact their businesses?
