This proposal offers a meet-up model that generates new Cardano holders in part by offering to Airdrop free Ada to non-Ada holders who attend one of their meetings. They have set a goal to grow Cardano holders by just under 600 over the course of a year, at current pricing this would allow each new Cardano holder to be Air Dropped one Ada. Metrics regarding meeting frequency seem reasonable however it remains to be seen if $2.37 is enough to draw 50 new members per meeting. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While the proposer entity specializes in hosting affinity groups and has experience doing so in Buenos Aires the budget would benefit from the addition of details (e.g. regarding ADA airdrops). The timetable appears to be reasonable given their past history with blockchain-interested meetups in the BA area. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap of milestones is plausible and the metrics for completion appear measurable via the Meetup event logging interface. The use of free food, blockchain-based content, and free Crypto may indeed entice 600 or so members in the span of a year. This may place Cardano and ADA on the lips of Argentinian attendees. The proposing group may want to reconsider the AirDrop approach in general (scammers often claim to offer ADA giveaways and places like the Cardano subreddit underscore the fact that there will not be ADA giveaways) or the amount (should the price of 1 ADA rise above the $3.40 mark).

As there is no local hub in the city, it makes sense to have one. The solution is well defined and makese good sense.\r\nIt would have good to mention how this format could be duplicated to other cities in Argentina or South America countries. Or if the online sessions could be across countries as well (although I see the value to have it city per city as suggested in the proposal). \r\n\r\nAs someone who participated in many tech meetups and worked and lived in many countries including Argentina, I appreciate the importance of local meetups in local language to increase reach and engagamnet. Therefore, making efforts to improve the tools available for the community around localization seems very important and will support the challenge objectives. \r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "https://bitcoinbay.ca/ has great and relevant experience for the proposal. They focus on blockchains meetups since 2013 and have managed 100s of events. They also had multiple crypto meetups in Argentina and have a meet-up page set for Buenos Aires Bitcoin with 243 members. This is all great. It could be helpful to have the stats from this meeting such as how many meetings, participants in each meeting, and other helpful information. \r\n\r\nAny past experience of https://bitcoinbay.ca/ with Cardano-related meetup or engagement with Catalyst would be important to include.\r\n\r\nThe proposal however mentions that \"this will be its own independent organization\". It would be good to have more information about what does it mean. What team will lead this organization? Is this a model you worked on for other locations? What will be the relationship and support between Bitcoinbay and the new org? \r\nThe proposal also mentions \"our contact in Buenos Aires will be able to host\u2026\"  - having more information about the contact will have been helpful. \r\n\r\nThe plan versus the idea makes good sense. The budget, however, is missing more details for example $3,000 for meetups, and logistics cost could be detailed per cost per meetup * number of meetups. Salary could be a breakout for a number of people/hour/months/$ and so on. Overall the cost of $9,500 for 26 meetups = $365 per meetup sounds reasonable.   \r\n\r\nI had a question regarding the budget which was clarified by the team: the budget is for 12 months and 26 meetups but in addition, the team will try to raise more funds through sponsorship.   \r\n\r\nBased on the Bitcoinbay track record I am confident the plan is feasible but some clarifications as suggested above are important. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap and timeframes are clear as well as the deliverable. KPIs are also clear and measured by the number of new Cardano holders as well as participants in each meeting.\r\n\r\nFinally, it will be important to have a section of challenges and risks to show you considered various scenarios. For example, how do we make sure the meetups include quality Carano content? How meetups with different audiences are managed i.e. developers with knowledge of Cardano vs. newcomers.  Based on the experience of bitcoinbay, I am confident they could provide more information about it and how they will mitigate the risk. \r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Fund A Cardano Hub in Buenos Aires.
