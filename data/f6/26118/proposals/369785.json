The proposal would add one community hub and create realistic options to onboard new members, including developers to the Cardano Network. The fact that people from the community would actively take on responsibilities is an important part of empowering new people to find their way into the Cardano eco system and is good in the way that it does not \"talk down\" on peole but actively enables them to contribute. This is very much how Catalyst works, as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The described relevant experience would match the proposed initiative. The budget that is broken down would work with what the proposer describes. I find it difficult that a main part of the funding is allocated to giveaway systems, especially with the proposer mentioning \"airdrops\" - pretty much every video that Charles does and every anti-scam video about ADA includes \"there are no giveaways - there are no airdrops\". So if this proposer aims to onboard new members, a reward system is definitely useful but if he introduces new users to airdrops, they might fall for scams in the future. Information about outreach and programs on promoting the hub is missing.\r\nThe proposer is too vague in what this hub is wanting to achieve. The proposal would have benefittet from some relevant information on the intended content of the hub, \"how to trade ADA\", \"how to avoid scams\", \"how to propose in Catalyst\" and so on. Without this information the prior commitment on this topic seems less valid. Information on the expansion of the project with several hubs points to scalability, but it not likely to be implemented within this challenge and would need further explanation as to what that means and how these new initiatives would receive funding. Generally, the idea is good and implementation of sorts is highly likely, however given the information in this proposal, some of the numbers seem very positive and I would need further information as to why the proposer thinks a hub would attract that many people.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer does not give relevant information that would enhance auditability, like documentation. Additionally, the proposer should specify what \"donations\" means. Generally, those parts of the proposal should be documented. The numbers that the proposer provided show a clear goal and they would be auditable - however, the proposal would have to (again) add documentation on how he would support auditability. The milestones do not include topics, just how many members the proposer would want to onboard. He should differentiate between in-person hubs and the online presence. An in-person hub with 5000+ members would not be financially manageable with the proposed funding, so the roadmap is missing relevant information on that. Additionally, information on outreach and social media presence to reach the targeted audience is missing. No information about content of the hubs is given, this makes it less auditable - the proposer should add relevant information on what they are planning to provide to the people.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "-This proposal addresses directly the challenge, creating Venezuelan community hub with a broad program in education, workshops and  meetups, as well as an active online presence.\r\n-The size of the project team and representation of individual members are not included in the proposal, this is one important matter that should be added to the proposal.\r\nI agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "-The plan of this proposal is very clear written and detailed, expressing details of a twelve-month activity.\r\n-They intend to build an online and in-person community in the capital city of Caracas.\r\n-The budget and goals are clearly described, with a complete, aesthetic timeline.\r\n-Under budget there is stated allocation of $5000 for airdrops, giveaways, special prizes and donations. I am not fully sure if funding of giveaways and special prizes is acceptable use of funds by the Catalyst Cardano community. I don't have confidence to make a clear statement on this matter, thus I recommend to address it and seek guidance from Catalyst Circle. What I can say with confidence is that this should not be a limitation to successfully implement this project. My suggestion is to exclude these funds from the proposal and seek donations and sponsorships outside from Cardano Catalyst ecosystem. These sponsorships should follow Cardano Catalyst community guidelines.\r\nI strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "-The timeline describes success by membership count in each consecutive three months periods.

Their goal is to add 5000 users by next year, but most Cardano networking groups already grow at a much faster pace than that. Based on the write up, I am not sure if this is supposed to be a website that they use to build this, or what the general plan would be. I think that building communities in latin america is a great idea and something we should do, but based on this proposal, I am not confident that this team will get that done with their funds.

All zoom meetings could provide the number of people who signed up, The in person and online meetings would be easy enough to verify with some type of attendance list that they could take for each meeting along with agenda's and other materials that could be provided to verify the meetings actually taking place. They also provide desired number of participants over the next year, which would be easy to vouch and track as well.
