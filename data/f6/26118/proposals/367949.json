While I think the proposal would be better in the language challenge it still can be seen as a \"hub\" that serves a specific community of people that are interested in NFTs. Right now, NFTs are gaining more and more traction and pull many new users into the crypto space. If the proposing team would receive funding to add the required plugin and videos to provide content in various languages, this would help onboard new users into the Cardano network. I would have scored this proposal higher, if it would have been in the language challenge and if it would have provided some statistics on the users of the website - how many users visit the site per month and from which regions? How many videos will be made available and in what languages? ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the proposers did not provide much information, I was able to look at the website which is up and running and has lots of timely content on it - this proposal just asks for funding to further develop the website to make it more accessible in different languages. So relevant experience matches the goal and implementation is highly likely. While the budget is not broken down it is only 500 Dollars in ADA and for this amount of funding I think it would be great if this project would receive funding to enhance accessibility for the website. However, it is not clear how many videos will be produced, especially seeing that the budget is not broken down.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided is definitely not sufficient. But the project is still auditable. The implementation of the language tool can be audited on the website, as well as the videos. But the proposers did not give information on a roadmap that would include metrics for the videos.  It is not clear how many videos the team plans to do - so auditability is limited for this part of the proposal. However, seeing that the team is requesting 500 Dollars in ADA and plan to implement the changes/ addon for the website in 30 days after they receive funding, this would make the project auditable and if referring to SMART goals for instance, the goal to build the addon is \"S\"pecific, \"M\"easurable, \"A\"chievable, \"R\"easonable and \"T\"imebound. As for the videos, not enough information is provided to audit the video-part of the proposal, since number of videos and number of languages is missing. But I think this would add a great deal of value to an existing website.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 9, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Adding WordPress Multilanguage will be helpful for non-english speakers to understand more about Cardano community and will be helpful to bring more people into the community. this addresses the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has enough experience and the plan presented is enough to be implemented successfully ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In the proposal, the proposer has provided a timeline and funds required this should be enough to follow the success of the proposal.
