The problem that is raised connects a community hub to support the community of the homeless in the UK to participate and learn about blockchain while aiming to empower this group by including them in the process. This proposal is targeting a marginalized group at the ground level and gives a clear program that empowers the targeted core group to launch a blockchain related project as on outcome, again empowering the people that are the targeted audience to be active instead of just delivering information from top down. It is a very well thought through way to (a) support and empower a specific group of people and (b) showing them one possible way to engage in a community in a  meaningful way ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Qualifications of the proposing team have been provided and strongly point to the proposers having a lot of prior experience (both with Homeless population and with Blockchain/Catalyst) and would point towards a very high likelyhood this project will be implemented. Besides the necessary experience in engaging with the homeless population, the proposer already committed greatly to the Catalyst community in several relevant roles. The financial budget is very clearly allocated and reasonable to set up the actionable steps that are provided through a very clear roadmap with milestones and an expected launch date for the group of the homeless and a later launch date for the public. Leaving the exact product that will come out of the workshops open is necessary since the underlying idea is to get a different and/or additional perspective on blockchain/Cardanao/Catalyst FROM the homeless instead of setting up a product that has to be launched by the homeless. This way, we might end up with something way more relevant to develop the Cardano Ecosystem to provide value for diverse groups across the globe. For a project like this that has a clear start and end, I recommend having the participants fill out a questionnaire at the end to evaluate relevant data about their experience which would give us great insights about possible future projects (what was perceived as helpful, what would be good to include in the future, general satisfaction of the participants and self-perceived likelihood of a participant to further engage with blockchain/Cardano).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and financial budget including the milestones and a product that will be launched gives full auditability. Additionally, Stephen is already committed to document relevant information throughout Catalyst so this project will add to further document strategies/methods/information throughout Catalyst and might be able to serve as a template or method to be used for further community engagement projects, which would add additional value. Problem statement and solution delivered match and address both the challenge effectively. Success criteria is relevant and feasable, making it not only auditable but also realistic. The team also did a great job at looking at the possible risks of their project. Especially sharing their methods of how to deal with high dropout rates. Generally, the proposal points to the proposing team having great experience in both the area of engaging with the homeless as well as in the Catalyst Community and Cardano/Blockchain area.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 9, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Absolutely marvelous and unique approach to tackle the challenge and tie the proposal around \"a shared experience\".\r\n\r\nIt is commendable that the proposers wish to focus on \"the strengths and skills of the homeless community, not purely on its problems\".\r\n\r\nI was voluntarily homeless for 5 years (2009-2014) and I know exactly what you are talking about. I have organized various Food Not Bombs events where the homeless get to enjoy free food and good company. I have also been exposed to the work done by a homelessness organization in my home country. There is a myriad of issues in homeless communities but so much untapped potential and untold stories as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is really well thought-out and has a step-by-step process of implementation with a humble yet holistic budget.\r\n\r\nThe proposers are just the right kind of people to make this happen, driven by personal passion and experience.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else this proposal creates real-world value, organizational learning and meaningful participation opportunities.

It is nice that this not only aims to engage the 10+5 people directly but also the 1,000+ indirectly.\r\n\r\nUltimately the success of the project will materialize in the Fund8 (or Fund9) proposal created by the participants.
