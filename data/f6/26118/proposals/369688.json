What is the timeline on this project to start and how many youth would he want to include for the first 6 months? Relevant questions that would need to be considered for future funding are:\r\n\r\n    How many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?\r\n    How many developers did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\r\n    How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?\r\n    What was the total reach of the Hub's initial marketing launch?\r\n    How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\r\nWhat kind of education would Leonardo want to teach those youths and how would he even reach them? Does he have connections to schools or youth initiatives?", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No information about any relevant aspects are given, making the proposal not auditable.
