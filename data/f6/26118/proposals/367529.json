They have a proposition: put q-modeler at the service of Cardano.  In the same way, they are promoving actively the access of the No-Coders population throught their No-Code Hackatons (as they named it). Their Hackaton \"Food Safety For Africa and South East Asia\" manage a content structure that has an rationale behind, simple to understand (a procedure to attack the problema that have sense).  \r\n\r\nFollowing the q-modeler footprints across the F6 and external sources, note that they are all-in in the Catalyst Project: Ferdon is behind of 5 proposals (No-Code for Citizen Developers $33000 in usd budget / $100000 total funds in ADA Proposer Outreached challenge , AI App Builder $220000 in usd budget /  $1,005,000 total funds in ADA Developer ecosystem challenge, No-Code Smart Contracts 114800 in usd budget / $1,005,000 total funds in ADA Developer ecosystem challenge, Food Provenance Data Standard $10000 in usd budget / $10000 total funds in ADA Metadata challenge, No-Code Hackathons $25000 in usd budget /  $100000 total funds in ADA Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs challenge), all of then with their own merits but each one spins around fundamental points:  \r\n\r\n-\ta product already in the market, open to be a bridge between Cardano blockchain and the No-Coders population.\r\n\r\n-\tthe clear understanding of the No-Coders public as a important source of adoption of Cardano ecosystem.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nI have no doubt the proposers have a clear understanding not only of the objectives of the challenge,  the have a rich grasp of the no technical population as a vital source of adoption of any tecnology.   \r\n\r\nIn fact, they build a hole business model around that.  So, I think they can be good allies of the Cardano ecosystem.\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a great description of the problematic but the description of the execution is not so great.  Futher explication about the activities in the budget is necessary.  For example, specifically in which way Fendon will reach out the Cardano communities, what type of localized content Fendon will use, why influencers are necessary  to create awareness, what type of training about how to host No-Code Hackathons individuals have to receive, why that training is necessary, and so on.  \r\n\r\nFor the complete understanding of the proposal and its feasability, the plan of execution and the budget should be separate \u00edtems.  \r\n\r\nIt's not clear if the budget required is for the realization of only one hackaton, or the development of a Hackaton's platform, or if it`s only for the promotion of q-modeler as a product (like a comercial stand).  That's a sensible point due to the size of the budged required in relation to the budged assigned to the challenge ($100000 in ADA).\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no a description of the possible risks that can prevent a successful implementation.  \r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal does not offer a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement.\r\n\r\nThe Metrics and KPIs of the propsosal are the same in the challenge, but there are no specific KPIs for the proposal.\r\n\r\nI consider that the audit at the progress of the proposal is not possible.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_541", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Statement -It's not clear if the budget required is for the realization of only one hackaton, or the development of a Hackaton's platform, or if it`s only for the promotion of q-modeler as a product (like a comercial stand). \nOur Response - The budget is stated very cleary and includes, out reach and  training people to run hackathons and localization.  This reviewer has stated we don't care about Cardano so it seems one could question his/her objectivity. \n "}, {"q0": "Bringing non-developers and non-technical people in the Cardano-fray is hugely important if we are to scale and reach un-reached pockets of users and consumers. So in this respect, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge of using the community hubs to drive adoption and awareness. That being said, it's not 100% clear whether the proposer is suggesting that they will be running the hackathons themselves or training others to do so. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers inspire confidence with their past experience of running such hackathons however, as I mentioned earlier, it's not totally clear whether they are intending on using their experience to run the events or to upskill others to do so (the budget suggest the latter). The topics look interesting and should surely get the interest of a non-tech audience, however, I'm not 100% certain I understand the direct impact on the Cardano ecosystem aside from marketing and awareness. This is not an unimportant part however so the proposer could provide more clarity and details on what the journey would look like, this could still be an executable plan and one that is deserving of investment.

Having managed training budgets for 10+ years in a corporate setting, the cost per head or the ROI is key in determining the effectiveness of any training.
