As a person who belongs to this community, I am a daily user of Alexa's news functionality and if Cardano news briefings could be added to my feed, it will allow keeping abreast of the latest whilst performing my normal home routines.

The amount requested is small and the proposal intends to produce two Alexa Skills (presumably one from the www.cardanofeed.com and another from other sources), which is great value for money. The plan defined, albeit brief and concise, seems straightforward. It would have improved the given score had the plan been presented in an itemised form but given the approach is looking like a one-person undertaking, no additional resources outside of the proposer is required.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Audibility is where this proposal is lacking. Despite the high level of confidence given in the implementation to success, the summary of the development approach does not provide the kinds of details that will make it trackable.
