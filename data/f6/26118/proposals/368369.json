While the project is planned to develop into a multi year initiative, this is the request for funding for a 6-month period to start off the hub. As for impact: the proposal focusses on a bio-region with an already large economic impact of around  $1.2 and $1.9 trillion so introducing members of this specific community to blockchain and Cardano can result in new users, developers as well as organizations joining the network in the future, hence scalability to start similar projects or evaluate and adapt the current project after the 6-month period is given. This project can drive adoption in a very active economic region and additionally can empower indigeneous participants. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Prior experience of this proposer points towards a high likelyhood of this project being implemented. Additionally, this proposer is a very active and committed member of the Catalyst community that would very well be able to transport the message of Cardano into a larger community with his skills and knowledge in the field. The allocation of the budget shows that this proposer has a very good overview on the parts that need to implemented to start a community hub. Additionally, the key metrics of success for this proposal have relevant and exact metrics both in the field of expected future participation in Catalyst as well as building the initial community during the 6-month trial period. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "When compared with SMART goals, this proposal is \"S\"pecific in that it aims to develop one hub with an online and an in-person schedule to deliver networking and educational features to the community of the SalmonNation. The proposed idea is \"M\"easurable since key metrics and milestones are clearly set up and will be auditable. The proposal is \"A\"chievable (set up an online hub on discord, have 3 educational seminars and weekly meetings....) and \"R\"easonable in that it definitely fits to the problem statement and gives a solution that very efficiently addresses the challenge to onboard new members, grow adoption of Cardano across the globe and include ground level adoption as well as empowerment.

The proposer wants to build awareness about blockchain and Cardano, create a networking hub to discuss use cases in a local community, also with the intention to invite and encourage the community to interact with both Cardano and Catalyst. Building from local hubs that have specific needs and use cases is valuable, because it creates a more clear perspective and goal for that specific demographic or region. If it is successful, it might inspire other communities or regions in doing the same when they see the possibilities of trying to solve problems through blockchain technology and Cardano. There is a case to be made that the funding should prioritize parts of the world where for example English isn't spoken as a first language (as implied in the challenge brief) but overall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In order to increase the credibility and feasibility of this proposal, I would have liked for it to include a little bit more information about the team and developers working on the project. Relevant experience is mentioned, but there is no way for the assessor to further validate that experience. Even just a LinkedIn-profile link would've been useful. The website link to the SANADA organization does not provide much information. It is also a bit unclear how many people are involved with working on the project, is it a development team of 10 people, or just one manager? \r\nThe budget is outlined and presented in a detailed and easy to understand way, presenting both estimated labour hours and how the budget is divided between the different areas. \r\nThe proposal also includes a detailed short term and long term plan, with milestones/goals and estimated timeframe. Every step of the plan is described in detail, and the proposer aims to hold constant evaluations/retrospectives (with the community) during the process of development, in order to stay on top of risks and challenges that rise during the development phase. I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is presented clearly with milestones and a time horizon for the achievement. The goals for each step is described in a detailed way that is easy to understand and follow. Creating an active discord connected to the community and for networking is an effective way to increase the transparency during development and after launch. The proposal lists a number of success metrics related both to the growth of the project/community, and the interaction with Cardano and Catalyst. In this way it can not only be audited by the community, but also by the interacting members within for example Catalyst. In order to further increase the credibility and quality of the proposal, some target numbers related to the KPIs/Metrics would be good to include. For example, out of the 33 million inhabitants in the Salmon Region, how many do you expect to reach out to/onboard during these months? How many people is your target to be involved in Catalyst Fund 8? In order to make this proposal even stronger, maybe also include a section where the proposer lists and assess the potential risks and challenges of the project. What if the community isn't growing at the expected rate, where do we allocate the resources and focus?

My first issue lies in the amount of money asked for, this amount seems fairly low for the amount intended to do, however it is noted that this is just for the 6 month trial in one place, revealing that this does not lead to introduction to the salmon nation, but instead just Victoria. My second issue lies in the overuse of in person meetings, although useful over the last year we have seen how virtual resources and meetings can be made effectively and have their own benefits, which may appeal to a wider audience.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is shown that this person has experience with engaging the community which is exactly what is required here, however the role as a teacher isn't an easy one and isn't addressed in this person's experience.
