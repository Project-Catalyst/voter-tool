Combining that with launching a token that can eventually provide revenue so the hub funds itsself is also a great idea as it will create a form of independency and economic stimulant. Great name for the token, by the way. It fits the sentiment for this proposal.

The proposers hold contact with Toshiaki Miyatake, which is the Japan Campaign Manager for IOG. \r\nAs I understood from the proposal, there is Yoshino-gawa city personnel involved in the organisation of this hub in combination with as much as 3 unknown youth business groups. \r\n3K USD to kickstart this doesn't sound like a lot. Are you sure this is enough? \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The slides and website link help a lot with determining the intent of the proposal. There is also a roadmap and rudimentary funding breakdown in place. There is even a location already selected where the meetups would take place to host this hub. It was not really clear if the hub would want to expand to other cities as well later on. As the city it wants to operate in has a limited amount of residents numbering 42132 people. This could use clarification in the proposal. In addition, proposing this partly in Japanese creates a language barrier for many CAs and voters. Thus limiting feedback and amount of people this can reach in the general Cardano community. I had to use a translator myself, resulting in this quotation for auditability. Consider completely translating it in English, as it's the current lingua franca of the world, to reach a maximal amount of people and greatly improving the auditability of this proposal.

I know it's hard to express yourself in a language that is not your native language but in Catalyst we have an unspoken rule to speak en propose in English.

Create a place to raise problems for meeting up and solving problems.' The proposal would benefit from a more detailed listing of key metrics and goals as only general metrics and goals are given.

The team members are only generally described, more information regarding their experience and connections with the Yoshino-gawa city area would be useful. The budget is reasonable but is only stated in general terms of $1k per seminar for 3 seminars offered over a three month timeframe. Development of the seminar materials and the resources needed to hold the seminar are not delineated. Additionally, if the goal is to train new engineers more direction might be given to the readers as to the audience target (HS students, University students, ...). Mention of how the seminars might be captured (recorded) and disseminated (YouTube and/or Nico Nico Douga ( \u30cb\u30b3\u30cb\u30b3\u52d5\u753b)) so as to capture and further grow the community beyond those who were able to attend the seminar.

The plan presented for this fund is preliminary in nature and the budget reflects this point. Of great interest are the future plans that the team intends to pursue in future funds and I like this approach as it allows for the Catalyst community to evaluate the team and their work without a large budget outlay and hence building trust for future funding rounds.
