The proposal does address a \"niche\" of the local community, the policy makers, and the project aims to educate & onboard \"100\" on a local Cardano Hub. This number is highly optimistic, and the proposer doesn't provide clear details about the impact for the Cardano ecosystem based on the project goals', and the statement of what problem is to be solved remains vague. A good approach is to define exactly what community areas' could benefit from the Cardano ecosystem, if policy makers are involved (i.e: better/improved Education System, adoption of financial services using blockchain etc.). Some Key metrics don't have a target value set. For a better auditability the proposer should set values for the metrics (i.e. number of users downloading an ADA wallet in a time frame - 1000, number of users onboarding on WADA - 500 - also this metric seems to not have too much in common with the Cardano ecosystem, as WADA sustaining only blockchain technology)", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of skills and experience necessary to implement the proposal. Adding \"+WADA team\" as a team member for the project, is very vague and not clear with its role.

A 6 months period for implementing this proposal maybe will suffice.\r\n\r\nImplementing such project in DR of Congo seems to be highly unlikely, because due to the highly risk of unrest and social disorder makes the political actors to be in unstable positions. This means that what the members of the project agree, this month, with the policy makers could not be viable after 3 months, taking into the consideration the time frame for implementing the proposal.
