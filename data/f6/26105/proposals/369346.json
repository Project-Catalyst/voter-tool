Using my 15 years of experience in delivering marketing projects, there are some concerns which the proposer may want to address.

The 12-month roadmap of 20,000+ directory entries and 100,000+ advisors would allude to the need for some form of continuous admin support. It would be good to understand how, once established, how the proposer would maintain and add value to the many people signed up.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the scope of the project needs to be clearer - there is mention of various audiences and countries, but I believe it would be better to create a proof of concept in one or two locations focused on a specific audience. If they deliver positive results at a smaller scale, then the project has a good opportunity to scale quite quickly to other geographies and audiences.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are specific criteria which the proposer is aiming to hit over a defined timescale, which means it should be simple to review success criteria. My previous concerns on how they would launch this in multiple countries/multiple languages and across a number of audiences makes me question whether the budget requested will provide enough resource to hit the numbers in the proposal. There is a lack of risk assessment within the proposal - I think that a risk register would benefit the proposal.
