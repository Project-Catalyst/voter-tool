Unfortunately, this suggests the proponent did not understand the challenge or did not pay enough attention to formulate a proposal that demonstrates how it is a response to the challenge. To be clear, this proposal does not effectively address the challenge it was signed on. This proposal was included in the \"proposer outreach\" challenge. The goal of this challenge can be summarized as [to] \"attract the brightest entrepreneurs from across the globe and encourage them to submit ideas which will have a positive impact on the ecosystem\" (from the challenge brief). Success in this challenge is identified as \"Bright entrepreneurs, and specialized firms from across the globe learn about Catalyst and submit high impact proposals\" (idem.), which is not the goal of the proposal. This proposal may do better in the following challenge or in similar challenges in future funding rounds: \"Dapps and integrations\". Because the idea and the proponent are promising I strongly suggest it is further developed and introduced in a future funding round.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proponent indicates they have extensive experience on the issue, this brings clarity and know-how to the proposal. From the information provided, it seems that the proposal would benefit from the formation of a team with strengths in Dapp development and integration with the Cardano ecosystem (Cardano stack), blockchain technologies more generally, and blockchain markets. The proposal suggests that it could correspond to a very valuable Dapp or a DAO, that is, if 1. the need has been adequately identified, and 2. there is clearly a need for this application. The former could constitute a new company or a social enterprise which would capitalize from the satisfaction of the need and gain value by allowing small business to participate in governance, further capitalizing form the expansion of the Dapp (including more business and, in the future, more governments). Unfortunately, the fact that the proposal was inadequately listed, the absence of a team, and lack of technical detail in the proposal (roadmap, milestones, detailed budget) impede a better suggestion of success in the near future while it clearly shows potential to be further improved.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, the proposal did not provide information for auditing its progress and success, Roadmap, milestones, team description, technical detail (software development, Cardano integration, governance, and marketing), deliverables, the definition of success, are all missing. Nevertheless, I will insist that there is still a great business/platform/Dapp idea here with the potential to bring significant value to the Cardano Ecosystem, I strongly recommend that this idea is further developed with the collaboration of the community, take advantage of Cardano's media outlets and Project Catalyst to improve the project, even if you don't end up doing it, somebody should. All of the previous (in my three assessment notes), is true if there is a proposal for development within Cardano/Catalyst here, and if this proposal is not only a mechanism for the entrepreneur/company to onboard additional clients to their existing/as is platform/business. If the case is the latter, then this proposal should simply be dismissed by Catalyst/Cardano, as it represents an attempt to take advantage of the community for private gains.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_183", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Has the problem needing to be solved been identified and articulated?\r\nYes it has.\r\n\r\nDoes this proposal fall within the scope of the challenge brief?\r\nYes it does.\r\n \r\n\r\nDoes this proposal show clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System?\r\nIt doesnt.
