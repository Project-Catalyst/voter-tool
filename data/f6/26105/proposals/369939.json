This can be done by acquiring quotations from artists/editors who have been verified to create high quality videos.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The number of viewers of the videos is an indication that at least the videos are being viewed.

The idea would be to first to show the potential of blockchain in daily life application and then how it is simple to build a proposal and get funded - with the videos!\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be very nice to have these mini clips linked, in a consolidated manner, in other Cardano platforms/networks - some proposal intend to crate things like this, if one get funded, it would be nice to have this integration.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It seems to be necessary 4 people to run this project but it is not clear if they are already committed or needed to be hired. It could be said somewhere in the proposal - that's the main reason I'm not giving a higer grade\r\n\r\nAlso, it is said the proposer has experience in video editing and project management but it could have more details on that like how many years he worked with each of these subject and where.\r\n\r\nAs this proposal is quite simple, the plan is sensible and costs breakdown are fair.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "KPIs are clear and have targets (though it could be an increasing target, as project advances).\r\n\r\nThere seems to have a really clear understanding on the problem hereby discussed and the solution is according to it - make the videos more easy to consume, reaching more people.\r\n\r\none major risk or challenge that should be considered here, as I said in the impact grade, is not reaching people outside Cardano community, making the content limited to those who already know Catalyst - it could be managed by a propper communication strategy.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_298", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "Some people like to read or listen, some want to see examples, some want to learn by doing. Videos are an easy onboarding medium to showcase the process of building proposals and convey the mood of our community to new people and how easy it can be to start a new adventure within the Cardano community and its Catalyst project.\r\nThis proposal obviously perfectly fits this challenge as it creates new media to demonstrate what is actually happening in the mini proposal workshops (see the related proposals) already taking place within our community. Producing easy to consume media for new comers is very important to draw in new people.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is a long term dedicated community member and is already providing this service for free and now seeks to improve it and to make it more sustainable for himself and all the people currently organizing these recurring events since several months now.\r\nThe plan is simple and is already partly being done through the various videos they have been releasing. This proposal will improve their current process with easier to consume material for new comers as a result.\r\nThe budget is very low and the possible ROI very high.

I find the problem statement to be clear and concise. The solution to the problem is clear as well, but only for people who already know what Mini-Proposal workshops are. I think that voters who will see this proposal before the \"Treasury for Mini-Proposals\" and \"Mini Proposals as a Service\" ones will be a bit confused (as I was), until they read all 3 of them. However, I don't believe the average voter has the time / patience to do that. I would suggest that if a term which references some content or idea that an outsider is not familiar with is used, it should be explained in the \"Describe your solution to the problem\", as clearly and concisely as possible.\r\nExample:  Showcase Mini-Proposal workshop sessions in easy to consume video formats. Mini proposals are a new approach which implies coming up with smaller proposals, allowing entrepreneurs to get funded and deliver faster.\r\nFollowing up on the point I made above, I feel the proposal could have done a better job of explaining how it actually adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. The implication from the problem statement is that more proposals will help the ecosystem grow, which is easy to understand, but the solution to the problem recommends the Mini-proposal approach, which again, is not adequately explained here and is an important caveat, I believe. My suggestion would be to have a more detailed statement here, like the one from \"Treasury for Mini-Proposals\": \"We introduce proposers to a new process where we can go through the funding process faster compared to the Catalyst process. (...)\"\r\nIn regards to the key metrics for this challenge, I feel like the proposal is a bit lacking here: the authors included measurements for tracking the popularity of their videos once they are out, but I think the main metric to be measured here is the actual adoption rate of the Mini-Proposals approach and the increase (or decrease) in proposals and proposers in the coming funds. In other words, people might watch the videos but not adopt the ideas presented in them.\r\nGoing through the related proposals linked here, I can see there are more details about these metrics, but I don't feel like this approach is correct. A simple voter (in my opinion) will not go through 3 proposals' worth of information just to find out the answer to a question in one proposal which caught his eye. I might be wrong, but this is the voter in me speaking.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan on how the proposal is going to be implemented is pretty solid in my opinion, but a few things are missing here. I'll start with the good and then move on to the feedback:\r\n- The proposer has been a member of Project Catalyst since August 2020 and has contributed to dozens of proposals over time. This makes me inclined to believe that he will deliver.\r\n- The proposer has a Miro board with a detailed flow of how a Mini-Proposal can be arrived at through a set of particular steps. I also have feedback here, which I will mention in the section below. \r\n- The proposer has provided a Linkedin, which helps build a little bit more trust, but as a personal recommendation, I think a few written endorsements here from some other active Linkedin users would be a big boost to the proposer.\r\n- The proposer has provided a *very detailed* breakdown of the time costs of each separate part of the proposal and the $18 average hourly rate is by no means exaggerated for the task, in my opinion. The 20% extra also seems fine to me and I believe this is contingency for unexpected problems down the road.\r\nNow the less good:\r\n- It is not clear to me if multiple people will work to fulfill the roles outlined in the proposal, or just Tevo. If it's the latter, I would suggest that is clearly mentioned, for transparency, since his LinkedIn indicates his experience is more in the area of project management and there is no mention of video editing skills. Again, if it's the former, then I believe we should know who the people who will work on the proposal are and if possible, some information showing they have competence in their respective domains. If they are yet to be identified, then that is also very relevant to how likely it is for this proposal to succeed.\r\n- While a buffer has been mentioned for unforeseen problems, I think it would also help make the proposal more solid if a few risks were mentioned in it. It would help to see that the proposer has thought of issues like, for example, if one of the (possible?) contributors is not able to deliver on their responsibilities, due to other engagements and how they would address that.\r\n- While the Miro board contains a lot of useful information about the Mini-Proposal idea (kudos!), I'm afraid I don't see the relevance to this particular proposal, which is just about creating useful short videos with condensed information on this topic. I apologize if it's here and I'm missing it. My concern is that it might confuse a voter who's trying to find information about this particular proposal on the Miro board (as I was). I think the YouTube video serves as a good example of the content the short clips will contain, though.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While the breakdown of the tasks and responsibilities into how much time each will take is good, I'm afraid I can neither agree nor disagree that the information provided inside the proposal is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. I have the following concerns:\r\n- While the tasks are broken down neatly, I know from experience that when certain tasks are blocked until others are fulfilled, figuring out how long it takes to do something is not just a simple summation of every separate part. For example, here, the editor cannot start working on the videos until he has requirements of what to do from the content manager. I think for the auditability to be great, it would have been nice to address this problem and how it would be solved (one idea is to send out the requirements in small batches and often, not to do them for a bunch of videos and then send them all at once to the editor). Again, this is assuming there are more people working on this proposal.\r\n- While an end date is approximately mentioned (\"content starts to be published just before Fund 7\"), the start date is not. It might be that work on this is ongoing, as indicated by \"The goal is to get videos out in 3 days, right now it takes about 6 days without any major edits.\", but I think it could be mentioned more clearly. I'm confused as to whether there are several existing videos that this proposal intends to translate to short clips, or if this is meant to provide funds to continue doing something that is already being done. Sorry if I'm being pedantic.\r\n- As mentioned earlier, I feel like the metrics that have been provided are not sufficient here. While a definition of success has been given, (\"We succeed if we empower proposers to pick up the mini-proposal template and create get their ideas out without a help of a facilitator.\"), I do not see any information in the proposal on how we are to track this particular goal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_546", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Showcase Mini-Proposal workshop sessions in easy to consume video formats", "experience": "Video editing, Facilitating sessions in general, Project manager\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tevosaks/"}
