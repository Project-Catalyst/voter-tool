It better have a great soft phone integration and a fast way to record the outcome of the call.

No doubt cryptocurrency world needs to be simpler. the problem is really clear and the proposal addresses it, in line with the campaign challenge (in this case, it would expand the presence of citzen developers in Cardano network).\r\n\r\nHowever, I would not limit it co-work spaces. It would be interesting to also reach education centrers (like universitites, collegres, courses) and even companies who could use blockchain programs in tis regular business.\r\nTheres also an additional barrier to coding itself which is the knowledger about blockchain, smart contract and Cardano. Many people around the world dont know its full capacity or dont even know it exists. In order to overcome this, it would be useful not only to \"hide\" the coding part of the application but also to clearly and simply explain/train people in blockchain and smart contracts and how its potential applications could be used in their daily lives/works.\r\n It would also be useful to have the Qmodeler in some different languages, to reach even more people. Built-in tutorials (about the program and blockchain/smar contracts) as well as templates for some basic general applications  could also be available.\r\nLast, it could be better explored here how this product differeniate from other no code blockchain application or at least how this is going to be levaraged during the marketing/selling part of the project (which is the main part).
