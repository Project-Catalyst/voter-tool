The authors intend to create a kind of event, called Cardonex, which will bring together university students and educate them about the Cardano ecosystem. In this way, we would be bringing to the community people with a whole professional future ahead of them, who would certainly have a lot to contribute, and if they were involved from an early age with the ecosystem, they would, after some time, be great connoisseurs who could bring many benefits and spread the ecosystem activities for a long time. I found the proposal innovative, because practically all the others I read about this challenge were targeting an older audience, already consolidated professionals. It is important to think about students, because they are a great source of knowledge propagation and can recommend ecosystem activities to colleagues, as they are all still in training and are almost always open to new experiences, waiting for opportunities to develop their own careers - very solo fertile for Cardano to grow and benefit (in addition to benefiting students, of course).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal authors seem very well qualified to manage the project, because as they say, they are familiar with the academic environment and have a lot of experience with the universe of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, claiming to have developed a dApp ([deqree.in ](http://deqree.in/)). They also have contact with a large number of people, which is extremely positive for the idea to spread and become popular. What I missed here was that they didn't make it clear that they would like to hire more people to make Cardonex, I think the idea goes beyond technical knowledge, it also needs an investment in production, after all, bringing people together involves several logistics, including organize spaces, transport, water supply and that sort of thing. I think it would also be important to hire a designer to make graphic material to publicize the event, even to circulate among the channels they already have, with a lot of visibility. For these reasons, I believe so, they are qualified for the proposal, but it is still necessary to think about other non-technical factors in the cryptographic world that are also involved here. Regarding the roadmap and expenses, we have information, but it lacks details, as I will explain below.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal authors describe very clearly and concisely which steps would be part of their larger plan, but I still felt there could be more detail regarding each activity itself. For example, when they say that the first phase is to bring students from different universities on board, it would be interesting to better situate, for example, how many students would be called, which universities would be targeted, how they would convince students to spend a little of their time to a cause they still don't know about... Another thing that could have been better detailed: how often the hackathons would happen, what is the average duration they intend to keep each encounter. A list of content that they would address, chronologically, in each hackathons could also have been listed, so that we could better visualize what each event would be like. Similarly to the presentation of activities, expenses were informed, how much would be allocated to each thing, but there could also be more details in this part, because, for example, in the organization of hackathons and deadlines, many things would need to be done. It would be positive to comment in more detail on each part of the budget breakdown. In terms of success metrics, we do.
