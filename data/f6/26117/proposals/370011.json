It also mentions that in the future the market would like to have something like this, and I agree with it, but I also believe that in the worst case, what would happen is that the SP would be abandoned and its users would realize after some time and migrate to another SP. Even so, the proposal is relevant and it addresses a real problem.

The proposer could have added some information about some risks or challenges he/she may face during the project implementation, and it could be discussed within the proposal, for example, if the mentioned label is valid for 1 year but something happens before that, how would it be addressed?
