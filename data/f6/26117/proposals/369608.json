The proposal outlines specific technologies (S3 buckets, cncli-ping, json files) and is well thought out in architecture and implementation details. I don't think there is significant amounts of unknown or ambiguous challenges to be solved, this just needs to be coded, tested, and deployed.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Having a working dashboard will prove success, but there is a lack of milestones and KPIs that would be nice to see to understand how the community can audit progress and success better.
