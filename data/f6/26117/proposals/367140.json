Would be great to add some \"report\" function on detected threats as well as a report on how many users the tool has to add to the knowledge base.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information about the proposers is somewhat broad but it seems that the experience fits the proposed outcome and plutus pioneers would probably be the right people to develop tools like this, finishing the program makes them experienced specifically for the Cardano network, so that\u00b4s pretty neat. The milestones and the information about the 6 phases are feasable and it is likely, that this proposal will be able to go through the described development process and offer support to SPO\u00b4s. Financial plan is somewhat broad, but I think the categories are very well chosen with \"DIY guides and tutorial..\" as well as an awareness campaign. We all are lazy sometimes, but if you\u00b4re running a stakepool you should really have your system up and running and this proposal would enhance awareness for SPO\u00b4s.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes. There will be products like guides and tutorials that will be auditable, although - again - the proposers are somewhat vague in how much they will be providing as ressources for the community of SPO\u00b4s. The milestones for the tool will help to audit and maybe offer support throughout phases 1-6, if needed.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "There is no clarity on the problem described in the problem statement, which makes it difficult to understand the impact on the challenge. Also, this will be the proposal header in the voting app and needs to be clear to improve clarity and voter engagement. I would recommend establishing a clear and explicit problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nThe proposal's premise is promising and addresses a problem related to the challenge, but it lacks elements/details to elucidate the problem and metrics that allow evaluating the impact of the results.\r\n\r\nThere is no detailed and clarifying rationale about the problem presented in the proposal description. Much of the SPO community runs on servers/cloud and this really brings risks and dependence on services like AWS, but there is no data to indicate the degree of dependence on these services and how this could become a major threat(disaster).\r\n\r\nThe proposal describes that the fundind will be requested in batches, so my assessment will only use items included in the funding period corresponding to Fund6 for impact assessment.\r\nPhases 1 and 2, which correspond to the funding request of this proposal, establish the delivery of tools, scripts and documents relevante to the challenge brief, but metrics and KPIs were not included, so the impact assessment becomes subjective.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team reported experiences as SPOs (did not mentioned the pool tickers) and participation in Plutus Pioneer. One of the proposers is the Certified Intern from CyberCell HQ, Gurugram (India) in fields such as Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing, OSINT, MITER ATT&CK model, and Forensics.\r\n\r\nBut there is not enough information/sources to assess the experience and qualification of the team. I would recommend including links/sources that allow us check their experiences and qualifications.\r\nThe information I could find on deqree.in wasn't enough to evaluate the team expertise.\r\n\r\nThere is a budget breakdown, but there is not enough detail to judge the viability of the required resources. What is the expected working time to complete the project? Is there an hourly rate set?\r\n\r\nThe team informed that the deliverables (tools, scripts and documents) to be created will be open source but the plan presents little information about what to expect from them and how these will cause an improvement for the operators in practice\r\n\r\nThere is no objective and understandable timeline over time.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a relationship between the problem and the challenge, but this has not been communicated in a clear way. I would start by modifying the problem statement and giving more context to the problem through data and articles.\r\n\r\nThe solution presented does not clearly indicate how it will address the challenge. I would recommend more emphasis on how the proposed delivrables can result in a positive outcome for the SPOs.\r\n\r\nThere are no metrics/KPIs that allow good auditability.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap contains few details and there are no clear milestones.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "FEASIBILITY NOTE:\n\nThe reviewer mentions there is not enough information about skills and the stake pool. We are already building another dApp: deqree.in (names mentioned in our white paper), also here is the LinkedIn profile and proof of being a Plutus pioneer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adnan-khan-x/, https://ibb.co/106xkWf. If the reviewer wants an in-depth tutorial of our dApp here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazDTaRKpjQ. For the stake pool, our ticker is (SKRPT).\nThese all clearly display our skills and experience.\nFurthermore, the reviewer wants to know more about the budget breakdown. It is carefully calculated as $35/hr for three months (3 hours of work per day) along with other costs such as producing high-quality DIY articles, guides, and tutorial videos. Running paid awareness campaigns and testing and debugging the tool for a smooth user experience.\nThe reviewer also asks how these will cause an improvement for the operators in practice. As it will be open-source on Github. Anyone is allowed to fork our project and improve the code by adding new functionalities. They can also raise tickers suggesting more functionalities on the original code. \nThe reviewer states that there is no objective and understandable timeline over time. It's not true as we have clearly mentioned each and everything in phases and the timeline in which we are going to deliver our product."}], "solution": "CardSec is aiming to build guides and open-source testing tools solely for Cardano stake pools and dApps running Cardano nodes.", "experience": "Cyber Security and Threat Intel enthusiast.
