While the idea of pulling existing recources together to align all forces, this proposal does not offer a clear pathway about what the intended framework would look like. Why did the proposer not reach out to the hackerone bounty team that he used as possible reference? It would be more credible if there were already some partnerships with active groups like the Catalyst dry-runs or the mentioned bounty group or stakepool operators that would be interested in joining the team. The proposal would fit better in the \"emerging threat\" as it does not aim to support SPO\u00b4s.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I would see the proposed idea of a framework and the shadow network being two different things at the moment. While I would agree that this proposer might be able to add ideas and get in touch with people, he will have to rely on future cooperations to install any technical developments on the blockchain so this is not likely at this point. While certain groups like the hackerone group, there is no indication of any existing partnerships at the moment, so it would be set up from scratch and there\u00b4s a high likelyhood that existing teams already have a framework. I do like the idea of trying to get most or all teams to share and work together, though. The incentives and the general financial plan are very broad and it is not clear who will be doing for instance the website so it\u00b4s difficult to see if this would be implemented - I suggest to - if the proposal does not get funded - try and set up at least a smallish team before the next round so that it is easier to see experience connected to the intended outcome.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Some things are: for instance to start a social media presence for this framework. And to start a team. Other points are very unlikely and too broad. I see a general problem with audit because the proposal aims to start a team and prepare a framework. Without any partnerships the proposed milestones are more of loose ideas without a solid background. I suggest reframing the proposal to setting up a team and establishing guidelines maybe, that can be stored and viewed by DEV teams that want to contribute to safety measures.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_19", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 8, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "While scams & hacks are a real threat to many dApps built on top of any blockchain, I feel that this proposer missed the point of the challenge.

But the proposer did not include why his business experience would add value to this specific idea. The proposed plan is to provide a framework for how a global network would operate to detect and avoid spam and generally how to deal with spam. Since the proposer is one individual and not a team and no reference to how the global teambuilding will take place or a discord where prior commitment to Cardano or Catalyst can be viewed is provided, implementation at the moment is not very likely. The financial budget is allocated too broadly and contains \"anti scam developers\". While developers can certainly provide programs that detect scams, this term is a bit weird and would not point to relevant experience of the proposer in this area. I also don\u00b4t think that in 3 monts the \"management of all social media\" will be wanting to cooperate with a scam website, the ideas are too ambitous and therefore seem a bit odd. Generally, the proposed framework is not established at the moment so the proposal can only be seen as a starting point. I personally would not like the connotation of \"war rooms\" and \"sheriffs\" and \"deputies\" and all. Given the usual framing Catalyst likes - so the least authority that is possible, it seems like a bad choice in reference with the community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditability is not really addressed or given - the ambitous ideas remain broad \"high profile individuals\" and \"management of all social media\" sounds strange and basically it sounds like a real plan or roadmap at this point is not really focussed on.
