Although, it's not possible to effectively know about its impact since the idea is only brief and was not detailed, for e.g., with more information about such a platform/repository, why this proposal is important, i.e., what motivated the proposing team. The problem statement briefly mentions that, but it's not possible to really understand the problems without being a SPO, at least. Some metrics should be added into the proposal as well in order to compare it with the Challenge's metrics to check proposal alignment with it. Also, the proposal could mention how it expects to sustain itself after this first work is finished to make it sustainable.

The proposer sets the proposal goals, but it does not mention how it would be implemented, i.e., there is no road map with the details about each step, timeline and milestones to understand when some partial results would be delivered, and what effort they would take. Also the budget is not well explained, and it seems to be low compared to what is proposed, since considering an average cost of $50/h, it would pay for 22h summing up all team members, and it does not seem possible to build such a platform with this amount of money.

I've also been delivering software as a QA engineer for 7 years, so I have experience with planning and executing projects.\r\nI think the problem statement is very clear and well formulated. To me, it's also placed in the right challenge, as it aims to improve the security of the network by empowering SPO's. I completely agree that they should have documentation available to help them set up their stake pools and test them properly. The solution and implementation plan also sound clear to me, although I think they can be improved with a few more details. For example, what is the plan for fostering discussions on the SPO topic? To make the proposal more robust, I think something like a weekly workshop for this could be suggested. Other options might include surveys sent out to SPO's to gather data.\r\nNext, I love the idea of having a website dedicated for this, or a section of an existing website. However, I feel like this must be figured out before the proposal can be funded, as it's central to the success of its implementation. Likewise, metrics of success and KPI's should also be identified before the proposal can be funded (maybe poll SPO's on how much they test their stake pools now and then again after the documentation has been aggregated and they had a chance to act on it).\r\nDue to the above mentioned reasons, for now I have to disagree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge, but I must outline that I love this idea and I hope that the proposers will come back to it and improve it. I would like to see this happen.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, I do not think it is highly likely for the proposal to be implemented successfully, as lots of critical information is missing from it. I will present my suggestions on how the proposal can be improved below:\r\n- The proposers should add their credentials (LinkedIn, Github repositories etc) in order to raise the trustworthiness of the proposal and make it more likely to attract votes\r\n- The proposers should clearly outline what type of people are needed in order to make this happen and how they will enlist them. For example: Designer, UI dev, backend dev, QA, project manager (which would also facilitate workshops, if they were to be held) etc\r\n- The objective should be broken down into specific tasks and then the tasks should be estimated (time & money). For example: Design - 8h, $20/h, $160 total. The currently outlined budget is more than reasonable in my opinion, it just needs to be more detailed (also consider adding in an extra for contingency).\r\n- A timetable of what needs to be done and when should also be provided. It's very important to have an estimate of when the work will start, when it will end and when it is expected to have the site operational.\r\n- Another plus would be to identify and briefly describe the technical approach to building the website, for even more transparency (for example, mentioning the framework that would be used for the UI, how data will be fed into the site etc)\r\n- I would also like to hear a long term plan on who will maintain the site and update it with new information, after the initial implementation. What resources they need for this, if the community would be somehow involved etc.\r\n- Lastly, it would be worth dedicating a section to identifying what problems / risks could be encountered while trying to implement this and what the approach to solving would be.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I do not think the information currently present in the proposal is enough to audit the progress of the proposal, since no metrics for success are defined, there are no KPI's mentioned and there is no clear roadmap to getting this done.
