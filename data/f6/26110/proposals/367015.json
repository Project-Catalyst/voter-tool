Cardano, as it's being built with the highest standards in many aspects, should have a way to verify and alert it's users when a project is possibly a scam. This project, if delivered, could impact millions of users in a very positive way. Although, the project lacks details regarding how this would be implemented and what kind of warnings it would give to users. Also, criteria for defining the risk of a specific project would be something nice to add, besides only categorizing them as scam or not. A very good idea, but these mentioned information are lacking and it would be great to see this proposal re-submitted with more information if it doesn't get Funded in Fund6. Score: 4", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has very relevant experience, since he's an experienced developer, Cardano Ambassador, Plutus Pioneers, besides also being a very active Catalyst community member. This makes me believe that he can deliver a project in this area without much trouble. Unfortunately, the proposal lacks information regarding the plan of development. It doesn't explain the technical details about how it would be implemented, who would be the mentioned 3rd parties, The budget is not so detailed as well, since only lump sums of each aspect are presented. Since the proposer doesn't discuss the technical aspect of it, which would be interesting to know more about especially because I'm also a developer, it's difficult to know if the proposed budget is appropriate or not. Some information about possible risks could also be discussed here. Much information is missing regarding the feasibility, as mentioned, and it would be good to have them included in a future re-submission.

It is a pervasive problem for sure, but if it were simple to resolve it - it probably would have been tackled successfully. So, a presentation of the main difficulties/challenges could have been good (categories of scam, identifying scam attempts, platforms that are used, methods that re used, why big tech is failing, etc...). I like the proposed approach of setting up a community-moderated scam database, open API, a web interface and browser extension that warns users of scams. But - it would be good to present examples of how effective has this approach been in other fields/IT circles or markets ... or even other blockchain communities. More questions emerge as soon as one proposes a solution. How easy will it be to use it? Will the community be compensated for populating the database? Will scammers be able to subvert the database by reporting genuine users? How will someone remove their name from a blacklist? How will this be maintained longer term? Furthermore, the problem statement does mention that \"New people in the crypto space fall for scams all the time\" - it would be good to focus on this group of new users - who are much less technically minded than the first and second wave of adopters. Many have lower IT skills, may not speak English and/or may not even be able to use browser extensions. A build-it and they-will-come approach may not end up resolving the problem.. This text you are reading has around 300 words and proposal around 130, which may be one of the problems \u2013 it is too brief to give a good picture of its proposed effectiveness. So, the proposal - narrowly speaking addresses the challenge - but I disagree that it \"effectively addresses the challenge\" and I would suggest a more comprehensive approach that might even be broken down in stages if the proposal is not voted in this time. This could be a valuable tool, but it would benefit from a long-term nurturing vision. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has listed relevant technical references for building the proposed tool and has a budget. However, will the budget be reasonable to achieve the set goals? Namely, a scam alert that goes online and is not maintained regularly and in real-time may be as good as an antivrus without definition updates. What is missing in my view is a vision for how to ensure a long-term viability of this scam alert mechanism - and a budget and a plan for that. If the proposer has a solution or possible ideas/paths, this proposal would have benefited enormously from some planning for the mid- and long-term. The CA guidleines indicated that the proposer should provide a \"sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how\". So, effectively this proposal does explain what is being done ... but I am not sure about how will this tool survive. I am not convinced the proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, apart from the narrowest technical implementation. For example, building a blockchain is easy today - technically one can clone it, but building a community around and maintaining it is difficult. Here, I see a similar problem. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal does have a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement, as well as Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal. What I do not agree fully with is that the proposal provides a clear understandable description of the targeted problem - meaning that its success may be limited. I think the proposed approach is limited by the narrow scope of building a tool. The issue of whether this tool (without plans for future maintenance) will suffice to address this large challenge (a functioning scam alert in the future) ... is glossed over. This in my view means that the proposal does not provide a clear understandable solution that addresses the problem. Rather it provides a partial solution - in the form of a tool. Let's make no mistake, this can be part of a wider attempt to resolve the issue of scams in crypto space - but then the proposal should indicate how it views its own role as part of the wider picture and what will be the outcome of its implementation. Even some minor details that could be explained in more detail - have not been explained. For example, the proposed browser extension that warns users of scams. Which browser will be targetted, how will the add-on be maintained as the browser platform evolves, which types of scams will be in its crosshairs specifically? With a proposal this brief on detail and implementation vision, the sky is the limit ... but in reality, with no meaningful future targets in terms of scam alerts, or ways to motivate the community to participate and metrics in terms of desired scam detection rates - it may have minimal impact. I would suggest to the proposer - if the proposal is not approved in this fund - to think hard about not only the technical aspects, but also about the hurdles that such scam detection systems face today ... and to layout a longer-term vision for the success of this project - by building on models that are already successful or tying it in with Cardano's smart contracts for rewarding the participating community.
