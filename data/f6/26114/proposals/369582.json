This makes the proposal feels more like an idea in the early stage rather than a well-developed proposal. The plan stretches out over more than a year but the budget breakdown only talks about 8weeks. The proposer is still a student and in the budget breakdown, you can see he plans on spending 2hours a week which means he does not have a lot of spare time. This does not really support the hourly rate requested for this proposal.
