The problem of disappearing languages is clearly stated, and the author references the connection to the SDGs. However I would have been interested to understand how exactly language preservation fits within the SDG framework. I also would welcome more details about how exactly the proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem. I can imagine a number of ways, but nothing is articulated in the proposal. Regarding scalability, it would be helpful to know if one language will be initially targeted, or if the idea is to build tools that could be used by any community with its own endangered language.
