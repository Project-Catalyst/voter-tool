By providing a precise location (Abidjan) and envisioning an event that would involve ministers that the proposers are already connected to, the proposers clearly articulate actions that effectively work towards the Challenge of providing blockchain solutions to local governments and populations. What would make this proposal even better would be more specifics regarding the areas of focus within the expertise of each of the ministers, and the specific ways in which the Cardano blockchain might solve the specific problems that these ministers would find important. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal states that the team has close contacts with officials and ministers, and has organized previous seminars. In order to judge the feasibility, it would be helpful to see references to these previous seminars. It would also be useful to know which ministers specifically are being targeted. The budget amount is large - $20,000. It would be useful to understand how the team arrived at that number. Will the ministers be offered a stipend or honorarium to attend? Are their travel expenses covered? What is the cost of the venue and refreshments? There is a reference to Josh's team and WADA. It is not clear to me if those groups are aware of this proposal and supportive, or if the proposers would only reach out to request participation if successful. I am also not exactly clear on who Josh is. I did some googling to see if I could figure it out, but I am not still not completely sure. Understanding those relationships would also help to assess the feasibility. Regarding the risks to implementation, even with close connections to government ministers, there is no guarantee that they will agree to attend this type of seminar on Cardano. More detail on how the team would mitigate that risk would be helpful. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "On the one hand, auditing this proposal would be relatively straight forward. Either the event will happen, or it will not. On the other hand, it would be helpful to know the timeframe within which the event will happen. Given that the event would be funded by the community, it would also be nice to have some deliverable from the meeting itself. Perhaps a video or transcript could be released to the public. If public officials are more willing to engage in substantive conversation when not being recorded, perhaps they could agree to provide some public statement or press release about their willingness to learn about Cardano. These tangible deliverables would also help with auditability.
