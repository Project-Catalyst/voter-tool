The amount requested seems reasonable for a DApp such as this, and the expected first MVP time frame. You mentioned smartcontracts and off and on chain usage, not very clear what part of the DApp the blockchain will support, I assume you have that figured out, per your experience. I do suggest though you clarify this as soon as possible if you get funded, to validate technical feasibility.\r\nAs an Entrepreneur and Business Leader, I don't see a clear monetization strategy, neither a go to market strategy, so the requested funds could potentially be not enough.
