I would like the team to explain if multisig is already on Cardano, why not built a tool so people can coordinate on Cardano instead of coordinating on a evm compatible chain?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Although the team provided a link to a website, I feel the proposal requires further development to ensure successful implementation. I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team's work history, education and past experiences. I would like the team to expand on the responsibilities and deliverables of each member of the team, this allows insight into whether there is a work overload in one area. I advise the team to develop a risk assessment considering the challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation, the team needs to think: \"what needs to be true for this project to succeed\" I would like the team to provide a deeper explanation about the architecture and language for the implementation of the back end of the product.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team provided no roadmap and single line budget. I would like to see the team further develop and define monthly Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) for the project\u2013 set measurables for performance and use it as a KPI, then connect the KPI to the milestones on the project roadmap. I would like to see the budget developed beyond a single line entry and broken down into monthly spending and connected to the monthly deliverables. By connecting the KPI's and roadmap milestones to the developer budget, the team can track performance and spending over a timeline. As the project stands at the moment, I feel the project might be challenging to audit.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_358", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge.
