Moreover, how all the project could be impacted if it stops in the phase one.

This is a reasonable use case for native tokens as a representation of some other external resource.

The requested fund is only for advertisement of the solution.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has very limited details regarding the experience and past work of the proposing team.

According to the author, this solution will make Ada more valued and Bitcoin will lose some of its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. But is it really? In my view, it's a bit illusory that a single project will make such a profound transformation in the way cryptocurrency holders see the possibilities. I believe that the best way to value Ada, Cardano and all the assets that involve our community is to promote several projects that bring a real positive impact on the world, as has been done through financing funds, and as the number of supporters of Ada grows, the currency will also gain more power and with that it will appreciate. The idea that this entire process is boiled down to a single action seems to me too ambitious and far-fetched. I think it would be positive if 1) the author redefines with a more realistic vision what he intends to achieve with the release of Hard Blue 2) that it be better explained how the project would work, as I will detail in the comments below. We also don't know if Hard Blue would work through a dapp, as the challenge seeks.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "About the author, little is known. He claims to have 10 years of experience investing in cryptocurrencies, but that's all we're told. It would be interesting if he presented a little of his trajectory: in these 10 years, where he studied, worked, some examples of investments he made and their results. Unfortunately, we don't have any information about who the team is. We are not presented with names, functions, a brief description of their professional trajectories so far, making it very difficult to visualize what they are capable of doing. There was a lack of detail, both to introduce the author and his team, as these issues are addressed in the proposal, we have not been able to create confidence and a solid vision of their work and also what is to come. The next stages of the project are mentioned in a superficial way as well, giving only an impression of what will happen, but not an understanding of the details.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "All we are told about the auditability of the proposal is that there will be a lot of publicity and how the financial amount would be used for this. But we don't know 1) who will create this advertising (who is the marketing person, the graphic design person...?); 2) how would advertising be done (through illustrated posts, videos?); 3) which target audience they want to reach (whether they are just bitcoin holders or also people who have other cryptocurrencies, or even who do not have any)... Besides, we don't know what will happen after all this publicity, if it it will only be done with the purpose of understanding how many % of the audience would be willing to use Hard Blue or for other purposes as well. We are not told exactly how Hard Blue would work, whether it would be through a dapp (after all, this challenge seeks dapps that are interesting for Cardano), how the transactions would happen in practice for those who adopted the token... Nor how community would follow the development of the project. I found it unrealistic when the author says that all the funding money would go to advertising and the team would work for free, with what motivation would they do this? If this is really the intention, it would be important to understand why; For these reasons, I believe the proposal needs to be revised and a lot of information added.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "For the use case of a store of value, creating a new \"BTC-like\" coin doesn't seem to be the best solution. Bitcoin's value as a store of value is that the supply side is fixed and transparent. However, the demand side can be highly volatile. I think stablecoins will prove a better store of value, by tying the asset to the demand. The supply becomes a dependent variable. Overall, users who are drawn to hard assets, could have a profile of stablecoins tied to anything they wish, gold, silver, water, oil, even BTC itself. Another coin built on Cardano will not convince current BTC holders.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal is just requesting money for advertising a coin.
