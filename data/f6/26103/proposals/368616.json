The marketplace one-stop-shop also provides users with another way to buy and sell tokens, rather than simply peer-to-peer. Not only will this marketplace be impactful for current users, it will also provide a more accessible avenue for newcomers to enter the space as well with its low barrier. The marketplace also has many use cases such as NFTs, Art, Music, Tickets etc...This is also a good use case of some of the first smart contracts on Cardano which is exciting in its own right. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As this project was funded in Fund4, and this money is simple to afford the developer to live for the remainder of the year, it is 100% feasible to be completed, as it already is.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is a one time lump payment to the developer to finish the product and share it with the community, that is very easy to audit. There is a chance that the proposer could not finish but having seen a demo of the product I am certain that it will be completed. Therefore, if the product is shared open source with the community upon completion, the audit is complete and everybody wins. Great proposal and really beneficial for all. ", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "e_assessor_4", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0}, {"q0": "This proposal represents a continuation of the proposer's previous proposal from Fund 4 to develop a Cardano-based Marketplace for selling any tokens on the Cardano blockchain using smart contracts. The previous funded proposal is in implementation and it has a unique value proposition -  namely decentralized trading of user-made tokens. This time around the proposer wants additional funding to continue development of the project post smart contract deployment. In terms of alignment, this proposal does fully align and - if realized - will have a unique contribution to the Challenge. The goals certainly do align with the outlined challenge settings, although the key metrics of the proposal are a bit difficult to pin down. There are some metrics that go beyond 2021 (until Q3 2022), however the proposal in this funding round stretches until the end of 2021. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, there are some good and bad aspects. The proposer runs a stake pool, clearly has the technical knowledge (visible through town hall presentations and prototyping work for marketplace with smart contracts in development) to work on the project. However, the proposal has not been sufficiently clearly presented. Fund 6 is no longer Fund 4. Clearer metrics and a budget breakdown are required. If this proposal does not pass in Fund 6 I would invite the proposer to resubmit the proposal and set a clear plan for success that has a very clear budget breakdown and timeline for delivery of components. While the following sentence might essentially be an informal summary (\"I am asking for an additional 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills for the next couple of months to ensure that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.\") - it does not work as a good budget breakdown. It would also benefit from a sharp, sensible plan of development until the end of 2021. Especially as the proposal clearly states that \"This funding round will secure development funds for the remainder of 2021\". If the proposal is not voted in this round, the weakness to address may be the form of the proposal - and the lack of a well-presented plan. I feel a firm plan is there somewhere - and that vagueness needs to be eliminated. For example, the proposer states: \"If everything goes to plan, I will have a working market in 3 months with many different smart contract solutions for any type of user. \" This seems to vague. What could go wrong? What are the risks. I would specify names of months (December 2021) for delivery of components and  what types of smart contract solutions... how many... The proposal needs to be tighter - so that it will also help serve the proposer as a roadmap with milestones and clear deliverables (not only by name - but also in terms of performance and quality). More and detailed information about the technical skills and experience of the proposer would not harm the proposal, they would probably strengthen it. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The problem is understandable and the proposer does seem to have a firm grasp of what he aims to achieve. What makes the proposal a bit difficult to audit is the lack of firm timelines, budgetary spending breakdown, very precisely defined deliverables and some quality parameters - in terms of functionality, usability, future maintenance, metrics of success. It will be difficult to audit the following: \"I am asking for an additional 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills for the next couple of months to ensure that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.\" Hence, the proposer can dramatically improve his chances by transforming this sum into a certain number of hours of work, a certain payment rate and linking this to a clear timetable for work - in a way that will help the proposer and the community to follow what is going on as the project advances. I would like to see much clearer Metrics/KPIs that define the success of the proposal. Although the proposer may have all of this in his head, he would do well if he put it on paper - so that specific dates can  help him keep the project on track. Also, as the proposal is linked to the previous one, why not expound (in writing!) on the KPIs from the previous one: Key Progress Indicators (KPIs):  Create LogicalMechanism.io , Build ReactJS Single Page Application, Build API -- - Model Smart Contracts in Marlowe and Plutus.
