Who is going to verify or sign those records affirming that they're legit? Every doc or lab need to use this Dapp in order to work.\r\n- Another point that worries me is that the budget might be undervalued, since you might have to think about a validation's solution to the data uploaded and some integration with various systems used in labs.\r\n- I've seen that there are 3 or 4 parts to the project being the PoC funded by this fund6, how are you planing to implement the others ?\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "- What might be added is some metrics defining success.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "An interesting idea that probably would provide value to end users, since control of health data is an area of concern for many, particularly with regard to data privacy. But this proposal isn't developed enough to really address the challenge. It does make a case for why it might theoretically lead to a \"novel and viable app\" as the challenge says; but it gives little practical detail about what it's actually going to build and how. The challenge setting also focuses a lot on profitability \u2013 so rather than just talking about the size of the potential market, some detail on projected profit would really help address the challenge. Also, the proposal seems very targeted towards the US or other countries where the patient owns their own medical data (which is not the approach taken in every country), and where healthcare is privatised and therefore the patient's financial info is relevant. This might limit its applicability and the number of new users it would attract worldwide.

It would be easier to assess feasibility if we knew more about who is working on it. Although a budget total is given, it's not broken down or itemised at all \u2013 to assess feasibility, we need to know how the money will be spent and whether the budget makes sense. A time-plan, with dates., or even just a rough roadmap of  the stages involved in delivering the project and what order they come in, so we can see what depends on what, is also pretty necessary to enable us to assess feasibility; ideally this would include some key points along the way where we could assess whether things are on target,. As it stands, although the proposal explains the basic idea and the vision reasonably clearly, it doesn't give enough practical  information about how that vision will be delivered, so the project does not seem feasible.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal outlines its aims in terms that are too general. To be able to audit it, we need specific, measurable targets , such as number and growth of users or outputs. The proposal does suggest a couple of qualitative targets (such as \"We want as well to promote data privacy, build trust and transparency...\") but this is abstract, and wouldn't be auditable; the proposer needs to suggest what they will measure to show that \"trust and transparency\" have been \"built\". But above all, the proposer should look at the challenge setting, and decide which of the metrics suggested there are best applicable to the proposal and how they would measure them.
