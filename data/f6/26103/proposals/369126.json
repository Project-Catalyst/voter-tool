The challenge is asking for novel and viable applications built on top of Cardano that will attract users. Easy, secure, less technical characteristics such as Human Readability as described by the proposer is critical to mass adoption of the Cardano Platform. While the proposal addresses a key characteristic of adoption, it did not clearly articulate how the use of the Adaly Wallet would achieve widespread user adoption. The proposal lacks key metrics that it will use to measure if new users are added to the platform. The proposal lacks a clearly identified set of tools it would use to gain insights into the growth and success of the project.  The proposal linked to a website (https://adaly.io) that was used to test the concept but I could not replicate the generation of a vanity address. While I agree that having human readable words at the end of a wallet address makes for easier identification I suggest editing the proposal with a detailed plan of how the Adaly Wallet will address human readability especially if assessors or voters cannot easily replicate the stated outcome using the live website.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the challenge is to create novel and viable applications that are built on top of Cardano.  This proposal fits within the challenge guidelines but fails to deliver a solid plan on how it will achieve human readability and therefore only achieves limited impact. A diverse Cardano ecosystem is highly desirable but those applications should be useful, secure and easy. If this proposal can sufficiently address how it plans to achieve this outcome it would create a bigger impact to the Cardano ecosystem.  Based on the information provided I can neither agree nor disagree with this proposal effectively addresses the challenge (Rating given: 3)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "FEASIBILITY:\r\nIn the \"How does it work?\" section, the proposers describes what the address generator can do, it does not address the team behind this technology. Part of promoting widespread adoption is transparency especially when dealing with Blockchain technologies. The much needed transparency in the ecosystem speaks to more assurance of security and trust.  The proposal lacks this level of identification.  There is no indication of the relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. The proposal did not identify the team members required for the implementation.    The budget section mentions \"development of the vanity generator\" but does not clearly outline identifiable parts of the development stages or set achievable goals for the completion of the development. A more comprehensive budget breakdown is needed to address the specific challenges the person or team will face that will become barriers to successful implementation of the technology. I recommend the proposers identify the person or people behind the development of the fancy address technology and add the credentials of the person or team to give more credibility to the project and to convince assessors and voters of the success of the project. Some recommendations for the proposers is to address:\r\n1. Does the person or team have any Software experience?\r\n2. Does the person or team knows how to use Plutus or Haskell?\r\n3. Does the person or team have any experience or is credentialed in Cyber Security practices?\r\n4.  How long has the person or team been in the Software Development industry?\r\n5.  Are there any prior projects that can speak to the person's or team's ability to implement the proposal?\r\n\r\nThe proposal lacks several key aspects that speak to its feasibility which impacts its ability to solve the problem that has been identified.  Strong Cardano ecosystem applications must be underpinned by compelling evidence of developers' relevant skills.  The relevant skills coupled with a strong budget that outlines iterative steps that address challenges will go a long way to proving feasibility in accomplishing proposal implementation.  Given the lack of experience indicated it appears highly unlikely this proposal will be implemented successfully. (Rating given: 2)", "q1r": 2, "q2": "AUDITABILITY:\r\nThis proposal lacks important tools in place to ensure intended implementation. The information provided in this proposal was not sufficient to audit the progress, implementation or the success of the technology. The proposal lacks key performance indicators that can define project success.  If the Cardano ecosystem of applications is to see widespread adoption, proposers must ensure clear understandable, approaches to decentralized application development.  This level of clarity can be achieved using road maps with targeted milestones and definitive timelines that address the different levels of success expected along the way. As user adoption increases security will become a major concern however this proposal did not include the metrics or indicators needed to address those concern.  The website has a privacy and security statement that state \"we are not responsible for user's assets in any given moment.\" While this may be the case I think their disclaimer could indicate more of a security assurance by first telling users that their Cardano never leaves the Wallet.  I recommend describing the security efforts they use to keep their services safe in the proposal as a way to show auditability and therefore increase the aspect of transparency. Cardano uses high assurance software practices however this proposal does not do enough to assure security through auditability and transparency.  Based on the above information I disagree that this proposal has the auditability necessary to prove its stated goals.
