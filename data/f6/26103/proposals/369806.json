Your game mechanics sounds interesting. The use of the NFTs is also a good approach. Allowing anyone to play the game without having to buy anything. That way, players that actually like the game will support it by buying NFTs and customizing their fighters. The free to play mechanic will attract more users and introduce more users to Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Already dedicated team with relevant experience working on the project regardless of funding. The budget allocation and plan seems sensible. The fact that you are relying on the Unity NFT plugin to get funded might hold you back and it would be wise to include a plan B in your proposal. You should ad more game art if possible. The visuals of the game can have a huge impact on adoption. Showing off more game art could boost CA and voter confidence.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Clear roadmap with milestones provided together with possible launch date.

Explanations about where the money will be distributed are often an overlooked area in any proposal, but I'm happy that it wasn't neglected in this proposal. The fact is the community and any man in general cares where the money is going.\r\nI love the ideas that bring the engagement level to all-time highs, such as having players contribute to the game in one way or another - through art and otherss.\r\nGood luck to you all in your endeavor!\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a bit of a lack in the way the community will be able to track the progress of the process.
