The element that is missing, however, is exactly how people will transact on the marketplace; do they use ADA? how are smart contracts issued? for user verification or for every delivery? Answering these questions would help establish the potential scale of the marketplace when it comes to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Let me start by saying that I truly appreciate the time this team put in preparing their proposal however, I must disagree with the feasibility of this plan for the following reasons.\r\nFirst, when it comes to the experience of the team it is presented in detail however, to build a web-app marketplace you do not need 3 non-technical co-founders. I have experienced this myself and the early stages are better with a 1-on-1 combo with 1 technical and 1 non-technical. So, I recommend that this team continue and find a CTO.\r\nSecond, the budget is rather well presented, and a business plan is provided. However, for stage 1 they require 35 thousand USD and 5000$ is to be used on team tools, it would have been better to specify which.\r\nThird, the plan is realistic and has stages of development that are to happen after stage 1 that is the one that needs to be funded. However, when it comes to explaining smart contracts or how exactly the platform back-end architecture will work not many details are provided (this is normal given my assumption that there is no one technical supporting or in the team).\r\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the audit, the plan & budget table does provide a good way to track the overall progress of the project. However, when it comes to tracking KPIs of specific milestones or steps of the plan none are provided. Another part that I am missing is what possible challenge they might face when building the platform. From my experience building marketplaces that would use a blockchain network the main challenges are:\r\n- Capability of the network and deciding what is on-chain/off-chain\r\n- Creating integrations with wallets and basic web app tools\r\n- Creating a token specifically for the platform ecosystem.\r\nI hope these tips help the team improve audibility next time, as I truly think this could be a good proposal with refinement and a CTO onboard.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_473", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "The proposal fits the challenge since the plan is to have a decentralized application that will help individuals and businesses to avoid middle-man and all related fees.\r\nI wouldn't say the impact is enormous since this is just a regular application that will \"Leverage crypto incentives to create a digital ecosystem for the independent workforce.\"  meaning that their token would be used as an incentive not as a payment method. There is a case where this is a true DeFi API in my understanding, but I'll touch on that later on.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "First, let me start off by saying I love the idea behind the application. It would be a great idea to have one single application to service several different purposes as mentioned in the proposal: food delivery, plumbing services, care workers, and a combination of those and much more gigs. There usually is a reason there are different applications for different services, because otherwise I don't know how the UI of an application that deals with all kinds of gigs would look like.\r\n\r\nI really like the extensive roadmap, although I hoped the app would be self-sufficient from some point on considering the 1-5% fee they would be charging.\r\nAnother thing I like was the LinkedIn credentials that were posted because that adds an extra layer of credibility to any project, especially for people with so much experience.\r\n\r\nA few questions arise having read the business plan which states: \" For the consumer, all\r\ntransactions are conducted in fiat unless the customer purchases our token and stores it in their Youbiquitor wallet. Then they\r\nwill be able to choose between using their crypto wallet or a traditional payment method for each transaction.\". \r\nAs I understand it, this means that people will be able to choose between a fiat and a crypto payment method, which has one important distinction. We have two situations:\r\n\r\n* Users of the platform can pay in some crypto token - this can utilize smart contracts which will be able to automatically verify the proper amounts in the user wallets, and a transaction between them would be safe. As stated in the examples given in the business plan about a plumber that works for a commission.\r\n\r\n* Users of the platform can pay in fiat  - now let's assume the users want to choose fiat as payment. This would mean one of two things: paying with cash or a bank transfer. Based on the business plan document the users will input their billing information in the application along with KYC which would incentivize correct actors which is great. The only problem is, once the smart contract executes and moves money from the client to the service provider through a fiat bank account, even though the smart contract would have done its job, there's nothing stopping the client from calling their bank and reversing the payment. In crypto this is impossible, but with the regular fiat centralized system you can just call a bank and code is not law.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I was wondering about is the fact smart contracts can deal extremely well with automated executions, because this is what they were designed for, but what they have a hard time of enforcing in human behavior which should be guided by the agreement in a smart contract. Because this sounds too abstract, let me share the example I found in the business plan:\r\n\r\n\". Karen is impressed with Lewis and they agree to a specific rate for\r\nthe tasks and lock in a smart contract that includes Karen paying for her son's and Lewis's\r\ndinner. She then goes into her profile and selects from the option 'order again' to make\r\nordering her favorite meals as easy as possible. Karen 'stacks' the task to be executed within the same transaction as her contract with Lewis. She selects the option to allow Lewis\r\nto complete the task and he is automatically connected with the restaurant upon Karen\r\nfinalizing the transaction. Lewis gets a notification to confirm the pickup time with the\r\nrestaurant and is given the address to pick up Karen's son as well as a contact at the school\r\nthat will meet him at the designated pick up spot. Lewis schedules himself to pick up his\r\nclient first and confirms an average ETA with the restaurant. He arrives at the school a few\r\nminutes early and sends a text to his point of contact at the school identifying himself\r\nand his vehicle. After meeting and confirming the pickup of his new client, he navigates\r\nto the restaurant to pick up dinner and then proceeds to Karen's house where he cares\r\nfor his client until Karen returns home\" \r\n\r\nThis sounds amazing but there are several points where the smart contract wouldn't be able to help like, what happens if Lewis doesn't pick up the food for some reason and does everything else. \r\n\r\nI love the idea, but the implementation left me a bit wanting. It looks like a regular application that doesn't take full advantage of the decentralization and security features of the blockchain and relies on regular fiat transfers that can't take full advantage of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nOverall I think it's a great idea and you should definitely continue to work on in future funding campaigns. Good luck!\r\n\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As a developer myself, I would have loved to have some thought-through way to follow the progress of the implementation of the project, but no GitHub repo was posted so I'm not sure if the project will be open source and anyone will be able to follow it's progress.
