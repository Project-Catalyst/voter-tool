At the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is  only specified with study research proposal and remain vague the implementation.\r\nHowever the objective of the proposal is interesting, but I think it's important to improve details about the solution for the challenge, so it's difficult to assess.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It's not simple to define if the proposer team states has the necessary experience, because it's clear the experience in general but I don't discover team member details and professional experience to imagine the project's success. \r\nIn my opinion (I'm 20 years experienced senior information manager on financial sectors) the budget requested isn't coherent with the elapsed.\r\nThe metrics for the assessment isn't given, so it's impossible to assess what the proposer wants to do, but the success of his actions is not defined. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones (incl. time horizon) are described, but the budget's information provided is very poor and need to redefine because IMO is too small for the elapsed specified,  and therefore say that  it is not appropriate.

But in the end I imagine that you were actually talking about advertisement of some kind of service you might provide to someone (laundry, coding, etc.), however, whatever it is, the problem and the whole explanation need to be more well developed in order to evaluate its impact.\r\n- It does not articulates exactly how it gonna aggregate value to the Cardano Community. I might assume that it will bring more people to use it, however I know several apps that unite providers and seekers and I do not know exactly how the tax works in those cases.

That is, you are not sure whether it is feasible or not. Therefore, this is just a brainstorming with no actual study about the subject.\r\n- About the timetable given (and budget): There was stated a need of 2K for \"feasibility study\" and then, in one month we get \"Identify test community, begin initial prototype development and outline test objectives.\".

Of course it would be an alternative form of advertising, in which people would relate through the correspondence between the 8 (without total) words they choose to describe themselves and define what they are looking for in the community. But once they got in touch, what would be the purpose? Buying and selling me products and services? It would be positive if the author of the proposal could clarify with an example how dapp would work in practice. But thinking like this: someone rescued \"travel\" as an interest, and \"graphic design\" as a skill it has to offer. In case this user looking for travel packages, tips, in general everything he wants related to travel, would he offer graphic design services on the platform? If working for that one, it's really interesting. The dapp would be useful for Cardano since it would use blockchain to record how interactions between users, on fees paid for the acquisition of new words, I think it was unclear whether it would be in ada or not, but we also know that digital wallets were used. I believe that the proposal has potential, but it lacked to explain more clearly and give examples of how dapp would work in everyday life.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, there is no detail regarding team members. We only know that there are 3 and the areas in which they operate. But it is not possible to understand who does what or what, within these areas, they do, because for example \"design\" is very broad, it can be several things, as well as advertising. It would be good if you were given 1) names 2) delegated team roles for each 3) linkedin profiles attached, if any, so you could get to know each team member better. About how the project would be developed, we have the main objectives, a notion of time and cost sharing, but nothing that would go in depth.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We know that a feasibility study, prototype development, and community feedback analysis will take place. These activities are divided into quarters, and the funding money is split between the three main activities (research / prototype / feedback). However, I find some problems here. It's not how detailed each phase would take place; for example, how would the feedback be given? It would be important to know how the time intends to release the dapp to the public, in which location it would be presented and how they intend to collect information from the first users to make improvements. Also, the research question could have been more explained, after all a research depends totally on the target audience with which it is done. Furthermore, it is not presented how the Cardano community could follow the progress of the proposal, as it is a very technical project, it would be interesting that some people like developers and community veterans could monitor and advise the progress of the dapp. It should be noted that the funding money would only be used in the first quarter, and with that it was good that the authors explained how it would be for the rest of the time - do you intend to apply the proposal for a next round of funding? Because of these issues, I believe that the auditability needs to be revised, and with that it would be more complete and satisfactory.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Create a social exchange platform to enable users to control their own profile of what they wish to seek or provide within the community.", "experience": "Our team of three people has experience in business, logistics, accounting, advertising, design and PKI cryptography."}
