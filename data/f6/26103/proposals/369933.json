With this problem, it would be useful to have a platform in which institutions could make a kind of document detailing what their needs would be, and donors choose or not to help. However, the problem here is that it is not said at all because that would be a dapp. Where would blockchain, ada, etc. come in? Are these donations made through ada, or a conventional currency?

All we know is that he's already maintained a few sites, but he doesn't know much about programming.

It would also be essential for the author to demonstrate the intention of forming a team, because it would be necessary, in addition to programming people, a UI/UX designer, someone from advertising to make this idea known to the people, someone who understood blockchain and everything about the Cardano universe and also someone to keep in touch with the charities.

It would also be important, first and foremost, to set dates and explain how the USD 2000 would be used to carry out the project.
