I believe the two team members have excellent skills. It may be a challenge to find the developer with the correct skills you will need. You may want to consider how this might impact your timeline and budget.  Given this I 'Agree' you are likely to implement your proposal", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As you introduce your final product to the Cardano community the Voters should be able to audit your success.

The budget breakdown items will not have a big impact on the treasury as the amount required is very low. \r\nI suppose the big activation step in the first 3 months will be starting collecting data and label them, to train the model.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_530", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "We can understand the soul of this proposal with the following excerpt: \"Blockchain will facilitate decentralized storage to record underwater inspection\". The idea is very innovative, it is about creating a ledger that serves to record and share information about underwater records, using blockchain technology to facilitate communication and exchange between people working in this area. In this way, the Cardano community would benefit, because its blockchain would be used in a new way, and especially the submarine branch, which, as they say in the proposal, has difficulty in gathering and accessing its contents. In fact it's a very different idea, I haven't seen anything like it so far in all the proposals I've evaluated, which could be very beneficial to our ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In relation to the pair, these are 2 highly qualified engineers, as can be seen from the descriptions attached in the details of the proposal. Their areas of training, work experiences and linkedin profiles are said, where we can get to know them more intimately. In this way, we have 100% confidence in their technical preparation to successfully execute the project. And not enough, the pair is interested in hiring other professionals, including self-employed developers, to work on the project's progress. It's a super complex idea, so as much as the duo is totally capable and prepared, it's positive that they intend to hire other people as well. On the roadmap, we have a division into phases of what will be done, and each phase is detailed in small actions listed in topics, through that we can have a solid vision of what is to come.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The duo is concerned with establishing success metrics, so the Cardano community can follow the progress of the project in a simple and direct way.
