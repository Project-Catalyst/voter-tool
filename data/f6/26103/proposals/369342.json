The concept of putting a wallet in the hands of users in a highly social environment comes with key benefits out of the gate. Transactions become very social and are done through Telegram usernames already creating more human readable addresses. The integration with existing banking bots is also exciting as long as it's actually possible to create a connection between them and the proposed project. I would recommend looking into how the Telegram wallet can integrate with DeFi that will become available with smart contracts. This could give your wallet further functionality and use cases to its end users. In regards to adoption I would say expanding significantly more on the \"Deployment and Marketing\" section would be clever. I understand what the project is going to be for the most part but do not have a good enough sense as to how its actually going to be brought to market first in Ethiopia and then to other parts of the world. The events and referral program is a clever idea but this section is extremely important considering the challenge the proposal is in as well as the fact stated in the additional document that only 15% of Ethiopia's population (15.75 million) has access to the internet. I am assuming an even smaller percentage are on smart devices and an even lower percentage that are using Telegram. 15.75 million is not a small available market at all but as mentioned that number gets smaller especially when you add in that Ethiopians can't currently purchase ADA and therefore have less exposure to it. I believe your proposal is really strong in its capacity to drive adoption to Cardano and I love the idea of a social wallet on Telegram but the lack of documentation and planning on how that will be brought to market is what leaves you all with 4 stars instead of 5.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For starters there are 2 proposers attached to the proposal and yet only one is referenced in the \"Relevant Experience\" section. If you could get a second go at writing this proposal I would strongly recommend including experience from both team members along with further details on your \"entrepreneur\" and \"software engineering\" background. Speaking to how many years you have been working in these fields along with a list of projects you have worked on or built can do a fantastic job of painting a picture of your skill set. In regards  to the plan presented I also feel that information is lacking. From what I can determine the features of your bot are:\r\n\r\n- In house wallet with capacity to connect other 3rd party wallets\r\n- Capacity to send and receive ADA through wallet\r\n- Capacity to purchase and sell ADA through linking a banking telegram bot like @Amole enabling a fiat on ramp\r\n- Loaning and credit system\r\n\r\nI would love to have had a detailed section on each of the features mentioned including a description of the feature along with the general user experience associated with it. At the moment the details of features are spread across the entire proposal and the first time lending/credit system is mentioned is in \"Milestones and Reporting\". I feel as though this is a massive feature that an entire proposal could be written on and would definitely recommend expanding on it. The last section \"Sustainability\" shares the problem of not enough context and details. I don't know anything about the staking and loan feature so I can't accurately understand if the proposal can truly sustain itself. Finally the Google doc attached to this proposal repeats much of the information inside the proposal itself. It was awesome that you provided a source to credit your information but this is your chance to provide new information not detailed anywhere else. There are so many exciting things about this proposal! There just isn't enough information provided for an accurate understanding of how it will all work and how it could be successfully implemented. For this reason I gave a 2 star review.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Good job with your milestones and reporting section. It was nice to have a concise view of the dev process and how long it would take. Additionally providing a budget breakdown was helpful but also posed some questions. $4k is not a large amount of money to cover 3 months of development costs. I would recommend speaking to why this amount is enough for development. Maybe you are providing equity in the company to your devs as the primary piece of payment, or maybe your devs cost of living is lower and therefore less money is needed. The reader doesn't know these things so describing it is helpful to build context around how a small dev budget will result in a quality product. The \"MOS and Timeline\" could also use additional context and further metrics. At the moment you are only measuring 2 metrics. Number of users and amount of those users who enjoy the loan function. Even further your 3 month metric measure \"subscribers\" your 6 month metric measures \"loan function\" users and your 12 month metric measures \"users\". This gives a sense of inconsistency in how the proposals success would be measured. I would recommend including a variety of metrics that are each tracked over a 3, 6, and 12 month time line. For example \"number of unique wallets\" \"transaction volume with wallets\" \"amount of Cardano native assets in wallets\" etc. This can give the reader a sense that you have thought through what measures success on your platform. I think there is a large potential for success with this idea and 100% believe if funding isn't achieved this round to resubmit the proposal in the next. Currently there is just a strong lack in available information from features in the product, the team building it, and metric to measure its success. For this reason it makes it very difficult to measure the success of the proposal and is the reason why I am giving it a 1 star. This should not be discouraging!

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The outlined milestones are good. However there should have been some more considerations. The linked Google Docs outlines a technical risk assessment. However some of the such as the 100 requests per minute should have outlined some design mitigations, for example it would be effective to have some kind of queuing system to handle any kind of flooding of the backend.
