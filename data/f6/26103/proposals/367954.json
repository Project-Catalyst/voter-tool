The \"perceived risk of their business\" might have to do with illegal activities in some regions where they are forbidden or simply with scam business, therefore protecting customers. What is the solution to this case? The proposal is too broad and could be more tailored to a specific issue to become more clear if the solution is really addressing the problem. \r\n\r\nIt is also not clear what the proposers consider a simple peer-to-peer form of payment, because there are indeed many forms of transfer crypto and to pay for goods using crypto. \r\n\"No simple application yet exists for peer to peer crypto currency exchange.\"\r\nIn this case, what would really be an innovation, or what is the new technology that has not been created yet?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As the proposal still needs to be improved, and it consists of a request for a very initial development, there is not enough evidence that it will succeed or that it will be fully implemented.

However, we are asked to assess whether it *effectively* addresses the challenges, and I have some concerns about that, hence the 3-star rating.\r\n\r\n        First, the proposal states that \"No simple application yet exists for peer to peer crypto currency exchange.\".  Maybe I am misunderstanding, but I don't think this is true.  For example, it seems to me that Valora (app for sending Celo) would qualify as such.  More generally, apps such as Coinomi support many assets, and Cardano is on their radar at least, according to this Reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/COINOMI/comments/hkf14d/hi_could_i_add_cardano_to_coinomi, which is admittedly a year old.\r\n\r\n        That doesn't mean that it wouldn't be beneficial to have something specifically for Ada, though and perhaps something along the lines proposed would help to streamline, facilitate and encourage use of Ada, which would benefit the Cardano community.  However, I think the proposal would be more effective if it explained how it would be better than existing apps.\r\n\r\n        Like most useful tools, if successful, the app could be used for many purposes, including \"good\" ones (e.g., charity, remittances) and \"bad\" ones (e.g., financing terrorism).  So I don't see the point of focusing the proposal on \"High Risk\" and (maybe, for some) \"controversial\" use cases.  If the proposers want to focus on *legitimate* businesses that are \"deplatformed\" by traditional mechanisms, that seems reasonable motivation, but also seems narrow to me, as there would be plenty of value beyond those if the app were successful.\r\n\r\n        Finally, I think a key challenge is whether/how these businesses could withdraw funds.  Is the idea that they would do business in Ada (e.g., paying their suppliers and other costs), or convert to other crypto-assets for that purpose?  If so, why couldn't they use one of the existing apps for that?  If the idea is that they would withdraw to fiat to do business, the question remains how they do that in the case of the motivating use case of \"high risk\" businesses.  Might it not be the case that they are restricted by exchanges due to regulations and/or social cost of enabling such businesses?\r\n\r\n        These seem to me to be key issues to address before building UI and demo app.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the descriptions of the team, it seems feasible that they could implement the proposal, although no specific experience in UI design and implementation is mentioned, which is the focus of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is not much in the plan that could be assessed beyond \"initial user interface and demo app\" with \"minimal functionality\".  While it seems clear that the team could produce something fitting that description, the description is not specific enough to assess whether the project is successful.  I think the proposal would be improved by discussing specific features that will be implemented and artifacts that will be demonstrated.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_499", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create a simple payment gateway for businesses to be able to use to accept Ada.", "experience": "Team members have over 40 years of combined IT experience in Systems and Network Architecture Disciplines."}
