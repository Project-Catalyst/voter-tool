Cornucopias 'The Island' is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn, and learn-to-earn, stake-to-earn MMORPG game where players can own land and other NFT (non-fungible tokens) based assets that have real-world value, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users). It was inspired from Charles Hoskinson's video - \"The Island, The Ocean and the Pond\".", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposer has a team of 9 and is dedicated to this proposal - it is highly likely to be successful. The budget appears reasonable, and the only challenge will be with building out the team and completing the implementation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While the initial metrics are difficult to ascertain, the ultimate goal is to appeal to the masses and have 1 million people engaged in the game within 3 years. The budget is reasonable to implement this Dapp, and the ability to audit the progress can be judged on the number of users.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_449", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This is a revolutionary and innovative idea to bring along a demographic that is deep into the internet of things and would love to earn real life value for their performance in game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The experience seams quite extensive as presented by the video teaser. There are developers, analyst and gaming designers integral in the process of creating this and linking it to the blockchain.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is no detail plan and the metrics are lacking to track the progress and the steps to achieve the solution posed by the proposers. It's  probably a good idea to expand more in the timeline and the deliverable against the various stages of the project progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_594", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We require Cardano community members to join us that have graduated the\u00a0Plutus Pioneer Program to write Smart Contracts for our game.", "experience": "20 years as a dev and I have developed on Cardano for 1 year+ and have built Catalyst Projects working with other Cardano community members."}
