Challengewise this proposalwould integrate or migrate the existing Gotiger tool to the Cardano network. Since the team has prior experience and clients and gives success criteria of migrating the three clients to the network, it would be important to add some numbers of expected value to the roadmap and information as well as how transactions would be facilitated before smart contracts will be integrated to estimate the value of this proposal for the Network, especially seeing that it requires 20 percent of the budget for this challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The company is already operating and will be migrating or integrating an existing tool so implementation is highly likely. However, the team does not provide information about how they plan to utilize ADA and transactions in general. The budget is about 1/5th of the challenge fund so careful consideration of the future value of the proposal is recommended. I looked at the first provided article and it seems that \"ravepub\" is a marketing and strategy agency so I do not see much value in an article that was written for marketing purposes. It would be good if the team would provide more insights on the experiences of the team. Additionally, since the 3 clients that are mentioned as success criteria are already clients of this company, it would be useful to give an estimated output value. Afterall, without smartcontracts (they are not part of the roadmap and are mentioned as \"could be used\"), tokens or other profit-related measurements, this project should specify how they would enhance value for the network.

IMHO since the amount of funding is quite high, the proposer  must give a very detailed explanation of each and every stage to the community. The text that is mentioned here is quite abstract, and the premise is just that since this is an established company we can just trust that product managers, devs and others will just do their job.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, IMHO as a developer myself and with many years of enterprise software buidling experience, and being involved with cardano community, i would like to see a more serious proposal from proposer. The team information is missing, and to me it is not clear the skill set of developers they have. \r\n\r\nI would suggest to have a look at funded proposals from previous rounds such as liqwid or gimbalabs proposals, and how detailed their plan was. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, if you are looking for 200k funding then your motivation should be reflected by the amount of time you spend in proposal :) ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "i disagree that information here is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of this proposal, I think if proposer puts in the missing pieces such as detailed motivation on integrating with cardano, then it would be much easier also to review the auditability and progress of this proposal. e.g. 1) how it will help their business grow, how it will help cardano eco system.\r\n2) Detailed explanation for the implementation plan, Skill set of developers (atleast lead developers with plutus/haskell knowledge)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my experience i have seen many times that management decides to opt for latest technology because its cool and try to fit into their businesses, however IMHO this is a wrong approach. The approach should be that what problems i have and how can i solve this problem ? Does blockchain (cardano in thiscase) helps me solve N problems with low cost and maintenance in longer run ?
