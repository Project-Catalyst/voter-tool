New people to the space are especially vulnerable.\r\nYou want to solve a lot of problems, but there is no plan to generate income. Creating a platform that incentivizes reporting scams is a good idea, but where would that incentives come from. Running a stakepool can help with this. Or maybe getting stakepools involved with this project to help pay incentives to community members reporting scams. People delegating to these pools receive extra rewards when successfully reporting scams.\r\nEventually if SPOs needs delegators they will come to you.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a lot of factors at play here and a lot of possible outcomes depending on the approach and team behind this. To attract more team members to actively join you, I would suggest you ad more info and evidence regarding your experience. Like past projects you worked on or a profile site. Github page etc. Even a prototype of what the website could potentially look like would give voters and CAs a good glance at your skills. Don't give up on this project.
