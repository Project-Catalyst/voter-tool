Phase I online bidding and business discovery have a strong case for online use. Phase II is for ERP which is not directly exploiting blockchain and the proposer plans to open source the code. And Phase II is for the Enterprise service bus, which will enable sharing of selected internal details over the blockchain which will establish trust with characteristics of nonrepudation. There's is a substantial use case for such a comprehensive Enterprise solution that can establish cross-organisation data exchange to establish capability.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a need to get clarity on what is the independence of the Phases. They seem to have isolatable tasks and are better if the deliverables are incremental and independent of future phases. Other than this issue the proposal has a clear list of deliverables in phase I and it is likely to be easy to audit the progress since the development will be open source.

The problem is I'm not sure I understood everything that was said in the proposal and that's kind of a problem because I might have misunderstood some key parts of the project description. \r\nThe impact on the Cardano ecosystem has a chance to be great in the future just because it's B2B.

With the context I have, others don't mean much and should be explained.\r\nI dislike that the company hasn't got a plan for self-funding before the last phase of the proposal, which is way too late when everything will be up and running which might take 2 to 3 years for phase 2 and 3. I misunderstand why the project has included phases 2 and 3 given that they only ask for funds to cover the first phase.\r\nOverall there are a lot of key pieces missing in this proposal IMO.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The statement \"Our code is private, and we will set it as public in the future.\" really pushes me to be defensive on the auditability side.
