There is a high probability of success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The milestones are clearly defined, but the development will be difficult to audit.

This is because the idea here is to create a place where people can bet, through tokens, and using various betting modalities, as the authors cite, whether person-to-person, sports betting, etc. And they would use blockchain and smart contracts to record their actions, preventing fraud. For these reasons, I believe that the proposal perfectly meets what is sought in this challenge, and if executed correctly and well publicized, it can bring many benefits to the community, especially new members who would adopt blockchain and use smart contracts to promote their bets.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As far as the team is concerned, I believe that they are well qualified to execute the proposal, however it would be beneficial if there were more details about who they are. In the proposal, we are only mentioned that they are a team that includes developers, blockchain specialists, gambling, etc., that is, everything the proposal needs. And we can see in a more individual way who they are, their names, photos and a very short description about their professional activities. My suggestion is that this description be further elaborated and attached to the proposal itself (not just on the website), so that we could get to know the team members more intimately. It would also be interesting if they demonstrate through examples some of their projects already launched, for example, people who work with games of chance. What games are these, were they successful, and if not, why? What would you change in this game? After all, the world of betting is very widespread and I've seen several proposals that address this; it would be important to know the differentials of this proposal, in addition to the fact that it brings together several types of bets in one place. We have an overview of the roadmap, what would happen over the months and how the funding money would be used, providing a solid idea of \u200b\u200bwhat's to come.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, the team provides us with a satisfactory amount of information, however, there could still be more details, especially in the financial division. I'll explain. Here we have the objectives for this funding round (would others be needed for the project to be carried through to the end? It was necessary for the authors to clarify this issue); through such objectives, the community could monitor whether the funding money was being used correctly. The team also sets the milestones achieved so far, which is very positive because it demonstrates that work is already being done, regardless of the funding round. About the roadmap itself: I found it a bit superficial. As it is a complex and long proposal, the authors divided the stages based on quarters, but for each quarter the activities are only mentioned in topics. It would be better if they were more detailed, as well as the metrics said right after. And finally, about the funding money, there was also a lack of detail, I will mention 3 examples: in the design part, it would be interesting to understand if there would be just one professional or another working and how the results would be delivered. In marketing we would also need more information, it is not mentioned at any time how the advertising campaign would be carried out, that is, through what type of media, channel and target audience. And finally, I would like to comment on legal expenses, it would be important to define what kind of expenses would be, who would be responsible for this part, etc.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 9, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "An easy-to-use app offering the most betting options.
