On the music industry side of this project, the proposer has relevant experience and claims of contact with developers to create this platform. It would've been nice to see some more information about these developers in the proposal to better be able to assess the feasibility of success; there is no mention of who would design the frontend DApp. \r\nOn the other hand, having 2 major music labels already showing interest, of which one already committing, is a good sign. \r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The plan is elaborately laid out and the roadmap is clear on the 3 - 6 -12 month scale. Yet there are 2 things that are not very clear: How you would compete with other platforms. And why there is a request for 60K USD when the development cost is set at 30K USD.

Sensible plan, but would want to see the budget broken down into identifiable items. I would ad a little more info about the devs that will develope this.

The solution to cutting out all the middlemen in the music industry and potentially slowing down piracy is very clear and attractive.

I suppose the label will get them more listeners in the end so it would balance out. Maybe the platform will have to evolve to meet everybody's needs.

Also, you must consider the price variation in different countries, e.g. the price in the spotify US, which is $ 9,99, is quite different from the price in Brazil, which is $ 3,9; b) As said, there are various participants in the production of a music, meaning that the Dapp must pay several parties.

The fact that he went and recruited a developer within the community who was a member of the Plutus program is a great sign that shows he is well active with the proposal. The company from the proposer has a red flag for me, the company was established in 2011 yet the link provided to the company is an adobe spark website. The website provided on the social media platform to the company gets a 404. The proposal is also missing a budget breakdown which doesn't clarify why they need the 60 000. I can get behind the 30.000 needed to develop a music platform however that still leaves 30.000 unexplained. The proposer stated that he has a plan to make sure every major label will use the platform but doesn't really give a hint as to how he plans it. Two major record labels are already interested and the proposer has a commitment from a record label but doesn't give facts on which record labels these are.

Including KPI's in the proposal would also benefit the auditability of the proposal, on which factor do you criticize the success of the dApp?
