I have a full-time job and one of my nightmares is that almost nothing is user friendly, almost nothing is intuitive and easy to understand. This will definitively create value to the Cardano community. As the community grow bigger, it will be mandatory to create some user-friendly platform in order to make it popular and allow common people (not technical) to enter in this universe.

There are lots of things and some of them with great value, however it's not well defined where or how it is going to be used. Because I'm not a developer it's quite hard to understand why would you spend $20K in 'userinterface for smart contract', e.g.. Besides that, it could be included all the resources needed to develop everything that you're intending.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "- It's missing a good roadmap with milestones in which we could expect to follow and see the development of each step.\r\n- There are no metrics and KPI (written) defining success (such as # of NFT added, burned, cash flow, etc). Moreover, it would be good to create a range expectation in different time frame and somewhere to display all these infos allowing us to keep track of the success of the platform.\r\n- Would be great to have a more explanatory budget \u2013 since you're asking 50K (20% of the fund)", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_25", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": " i agree, there needs to be more ease of use and accessability features if mass adoption is the end goal.
