Its not clear from the proposal, are you expecting transactions to happen on chain in ADA? It should be noted the proposers have submitted a basically the same idea into 5 other challenges, with different costs each time, though it fits reasonably well here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have outlined a relatively simple plan to get a minimal viable product up and running and have both the technical and domain expertise to get this going. It would be nice to see a little more about their plans to scale the project past the initial trial phase. Are they always going to need initial high cost vetting of tutors, or is there a way to decentralise this? Do they have ideas on how to make the ratings system objective rather than subjective? Ie based on outcomes of students? If rolled out at scale how do you stop tutors cheating and self dealing with themselves in round trip transactions then reviewing themselves? As the same proposal has been submitted 6 times with different budgets, I am not sure what they actually need to finance this. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is a relatively simple proposal to deveop an MVP and as such clear milestones for progress have been presented.

It provides a great usecae for peer to peer smart contracts via the Cardano network and the field of technology-based education is experiencing a growing interest across the globe. I have seen new job listings for \"digital education broker\" so mainstream has picked up on the gap of educational options in the digital space and highly skilled academics/ teachers/ tutors/ individuals might want to escape the institutional grip. Providing a platform that would not limit participation to a region would provide access to educational choices. Great usecase. According to the guiding questions of this challenge: the needs addressed would be (but not limited to) to include plutus pioneers and share those skillsets through the platform, hence it addionally serves value onboarding criteria for Devs. It is a rather big project and it would be very nice to see it grow on the network.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A developer and a professor surely make a good team to start a digital educational platform. Prior experience points to a high likelyhood that the project will be successfully implemented. The team is transparent and already set up a discord chanel which is great to reach out to the community and keep the project running and set up a team of interested tutors. By including the specific group of \"plutus pioneers\" there is already a good measure of success criteria on how the first steps of tutoring via this exchange platform could look like, contentwise. Hiring plutus pioneers will also enhance trust in the plutus pioneer program and might attract more interested Devs to the Cardano Community. Since the project is spread out across some challenges it should be addressed if the proposers will implement the project if any of the other parts will not get funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones are feasable given the prior experience of the proposing team and that they have prior successful projects with the community. Risks of fraud have been addressed and will be avoided through feedback/ ratings and Zoom features.

However, that doesn't change if the information provided is sufficient that provides metrics needed: and I do believe it does.

It applied to multiple themes in Fund 6 such as the DLT entrepreneurship toolbox. Additionally, this seems like a really good start for a DAAP as it is not as complex as other marketplaces such as connecting hotels and travelers. This can also support the Cardano ecosystem with a tutoring platform for people wanting 1-1 sessions to learn about Plutus or Catalyst in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Overall the plan and budget are very comprehensible, let's get into the details. \r\n\r\nFirst, the experience and details on the team are well provided and they seem like suitable candidates to build this type of platform, however, I do believe that it could help Gabe (technical founder) to follow the Plutus pioneer program to be able to delegate and check work done by Plutus engineers if contracted later on.\r\n\r\nSecond, the plan seems reasonable and executable with the given timeline, with the goal of launching the platform in 12-months, and provides quarterly milestones. However, there are no mentions of already building a database of tutors and students prior to launch. I believe that it could be a key activity as usually the hardest problem to solve when launching a marketplace is the chicken and egg issue; how many suppliers (i.e. tutors) do we need to have buyers (i.e. students) for the platform to thrive.\r\n\r\nLastly, in regards to budget, there are very limited details in regards to the number of funds needed and for what. More specific would have been appreciated to have a more detailed understanding. I saw that someone in the comments mentioned that they have a similar project called School of Life, they could help you make an estimate maybe.

However, the reason I only gave the 4-stars is that there are no metrics or KPIs provided in regards to the number of users.

The failure is a result as possible as the success.  I think that the proposers choose Cardano over other blockchains not only for the reasons exposed for them in the proposal, also because Carnado is not only a criptocurrency or a blockchain: It's an ecosystem, and like any other ecosystem in the Nature, it can give a sustainable form of life at the organisms that are borne inside of it.  The organisms take advantage of the system and the system take advantage of the organisms.  It's a mutual relation. It's a mutual favor.\r\n\r\nSo, I think this guys have the motivation and it's part of the innovation process to invest in motivated guys (and girls).  But, 12 months for having the marketplace is too much time (It's an eternity).  It's absolutely neccesary for the ecosystem to know if the new organism survives or not quickly.   6 months is a max in mi mind, better if it is 5.  \r\n\r\nHence, here the magic of the prototypes entry in scene.  A basic architecture, 1 or 2 tutors (the founders are excelent candidates), a short number of students (some free of charge, some at a symbolic charge of 1 ADA, some at full charge).  Students in Africa will be pleased of being part of the prototype (You could talk with WADA - https://wadalliance.org/ at respect).
