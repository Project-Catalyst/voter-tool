The problem for me is that there are a lot of intriguing ideas in the proposal, but some of them are very complex and not outlined in enough detail in the proposal that I can confidently assess how effectively it addresses the challenge.  I would like to see a new proposal in F7 that cuts down the amount of ideas outlined here into a smaller, more focused proposal that is easier to evaluate.  For example, from the proposal: \"talented individuals can raise funds to further their own careers through training and tech equipment \", and \"becoming the primary bank account for highly skilled individuals\", and \"Partners & Suppliers would have to be managed and vetted via a decentralised mechanism\",  and \"As the value of the skill in the market increases, the value of the \"hour\" of time would increase,\" (a DEX for time, in essence), etc.  Each of these is a complex idea/project that could take substantial time to implement and would require a substantial team with extensive skill sets to accomplish.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As stated previously, the ideas are solid but not fleshed out in any detail with each of them having a far reaching scope. It is possible given the task lists outlined in the proposal that you could have enough of an MVP to justify the ideas, but I do not find that likely.  Also, it would be very helpful to see a list of team members with extensive experience in the numerous skills necessary to produce even an MVP or prototype of the ideas presented.  I did not see that information in the proposal text or the accompanying slide deck, that is duplicated in the listed GitHub repository.  A follow-up proposal in F7 with that information including some form of skill set references (LinkedIn,  GitHub repos, whatever is available) would be very helpful.  I look forward to seeing an updated proposal in F7.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There are two basic task lists outlined in the Development Phases section but I don't see any concrete metrics. For example, how many career professionals will be acquired and by what date?  How many investors/clients ($time token consumers) will be acquired and by when?  The idea presented could end up having great value in helping the large number of people who are economically disadvantaged raise funds for themselves while providing reasonably priced, flexible work for potential employers/clients.  But a more tightly focused proposal that is reduced in scope would be a lot easier to evaluate from an auditing perspective.  The proposer is obviously passionate about the project so I hope to see their updated proposal in F7.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_551", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Smart contract for individuals to raise ADA based on a \"career plan\"; Investors receive $time tokens to vote, distribute funds, or redeem.", "experience": "Functional programmer of 20 years incl Haskell/PureScript\n\nPlutus Pioneer  \n\nFounder of successful fintech software development company"}
