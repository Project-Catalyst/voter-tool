Therefore, I would like to see a more detailed plan about how it would be advertised, how are you willing to create the platform that gonna sell/buy NFTs, how are you going to develop the games that will add value to the coin, etc. These points are important because they are the method you'll use to create the coin's value.\r\n- I really think that is mandatory add into the budget some marketing in order to create awareness about the project and the coin.\r\n- Building a game, most of the times, are very expensive. Maybe this much of capital required will not be enough to make it running.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "- How are we measuring success? How are the metrics throughout time such as number of transactions, number of NFT offered, number of artists join, games, expectation of fund, etc. These information are important in order to allow us to know if it is feasible and the impact that is expected to the community.\r\n- Another point is that we must have a way to verify (obligate) the project funded to be transparent enough for that the community be able to see its development.

I would like to see links to LinkedIn or similar to provide additional detail/evidence about the team's work history, education and past experiences. I would like the team to expand on the responsibilities and deliverables of each member of the team, this allows insight into whether there is a work overload in one area.

I would like to see the budget developed beyond single line entries and broken down into monthly spending and connected to the monthly deliverables.

This makes it difficult to understand how success can be measured.

Regarding the business model, I would suggest choosing the main one for now and concentrate on it. \r\n\r\nOverall from my experience working with many startups (i.e. mentor at seedstar.com, Givingway.com), the plan seems clear and focused.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Deliverables, timeframe and roadmap are all put in simple and clear terms which makes it easy to follow. \r\n\r\nMeasurebales KPIs are missing.
