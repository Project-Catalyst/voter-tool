It would be great to see what Dirk is capable of building and some of Chris' past works. Showing some form of Budget allocation for funds requested will boost voter confidence. You already have other funding models in place and on the horizon for extra support, which increases your chances at success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Very clear and detailed estimated roadmap with key performance indicators defining success. It is clear what needs to be done and how they will accomplish these tasks. Some potential risks needs to be considered. NFT drops can be very attractive to new players. But when all NFTs (or most of the good ones) have dropped some players tend to leave. I know these mechanics for your game still needs to be figured out.

The gamification linked to blockchain technology and the Cardano ecosystem and its ADA currency is interesting. The game idea could add value to the Cardano ecosystem given the recent hype for video games linked to blockchains. The objectives that the creators set out to achieve are clear and concise. One thing that I recommend to improve is the explanation of the mechanics and dynamics of the game, perhaps by developing a Game Sketch or a Game Design Document to be attached to the proposal as well as the teaser and mockup images.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan is presented in a truly optimal way, there is a good chance that this proposal can be successfully implemented in the manner described by the proponents. The roadmap is well estimated in my opinion, the terms seem concrete, the team is well trained and multidisciplinary in the gaming area. The budget is clear and reasonable to achieve the objectives set, however it is not divided by areas (eg Graphics, Development, Design, Sound, ..), doing this would certainly help to better outline the costs, perhaps even dividing them by phases. In essence, however, the plan describes the resources needed to implement the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I said previously, the roadmap is well defined with milestones in my opinion and with the achievement of the objectives. The description is clear and understandable. I could recommend adding a more detailed project GANTT in chronological order than a description as it was done, but that's already very good in reality.

Those users will most likely consist of future developers and the general gaming community that perhaps is not yet aware of Cardano tech capabilities. Introduction of gaming through blockchain is perhaps one of the most effective method of gaining traction for Cardano, for gaming and NFT is an economically logical alignment in the form of the sub-industry/market of skins and loot boxes. Add to that the ever-growing game industry which is predicted to onboard 400 million users in 2023, traction is probable. One aspect that kept this proposal from receiving a 5 star rating is the genre the team chose. MRPG growth has been minimum or stagnating.

Which includes; organizing the right team members with the right skills needed, determining a budget that fits the Catalyst funding process, determining the global budget needed to achieve a full operating game and it's ecosystem, a global overview of their timeline and etc. This proposal though was short of a 5 star rating due to lack of budget breakdown and lack of identifying potential challenges or risk the team might face during development. One form of challenge or risk is potential of bugs, which perhaps can cause unforeseen delivery delays resulting in potential unforeseen additional overhead cost.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal provides a general and quite in-depth roadmap with milestones that can be easily audited and understood.
