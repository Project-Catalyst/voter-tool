The experience listed in the proposal \"current member has experience with facilitating sessions, writing proposals and has experience working on open source projects as a developer & a product owner\" is a great starting point.

Also, mentions of metrics to track open source projects. This is again a great starting point and I would like to see some of these metrics across other platforms.
