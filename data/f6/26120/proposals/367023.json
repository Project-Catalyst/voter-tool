Any institution only exists because there are people to believe in them, they are self telling stories. In this way we must make sure that our story is told correctly.\r\nThis challenge aims to bring new ideas to solve these problems.\r\nWhile focusing on Cardano, the solutions submitted to this future challenge could be used in many other ventures...\r\nNew innovative solutions are needed to tackle this issue which is probably the greatest challenge of this century for the Human race (along with climate change probably). Soon deep fakes will invade the social networks and when no truths can be trusted there is no way to collaborate anymore as a world community\r\nSo from my perspective of SPO and long term community member I think that this challenge is truly critical to our success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposals that would fit this challenge can be of many forms but the most common will probably be trusted sources of data, we can imagine many different forms of implementation from a simple wiki to a smart contract based sources of truth concerning Cardano with proven timestamps, etc...\r\nAs a full stack developer myself I can acknowledge that our community does possess the skills to fulfill this challenge as the many proposals in all the different challenges also demonstrates.\r\nProviding an incentive to work on this specific aspects pointed out by this fund 7 challenge proposal is a wonderful way to laser focus our community's many talents towards the prevention of DDoT attacks on Cardano and probably on many other things!\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a number of proposed KPIs to assess the success of this challenge:\r\n- Number of better access points to data concerning Cardano in general.\r\n- Number of community driven sources of many forms of data concerning the use of treasury funds.\r\n- Historical data on scams, FUDs, etc.. (things like the bitcoin-obituaries websites...)\r\n\r\nHowever there are probably even other interesting metrics to take into account such as:\r\n- The diminution of FUDs and social media \"storms\"\r\n- The diminution of trolling\r\n- The diminution of stupid \"news\" article of supposed journalists.\r\n- The amount of trust and citations of the created websites in established quality news websites.\r\n\r\nSo in this aspect there is plenty of ways to assess the success of this challenge so no less than 5 in this criteria as well!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_40", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "importance": "Legacy systems have been brought to the brink by the inability of stakeholders, participants and the public to agree on what is truth.", "success": "Truth about Cardano and ongoing and past events is easy to establish even for newcomers.
