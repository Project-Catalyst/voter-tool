There could arguably be no better marriage of technologies than the crypto and the gaming industries. I myself am not a gamer but can appreciate the synergies between the two and the criticality of bringing along the gaming community into Cardano's journey. This challenge may well prove to be one of the more successful funding platforms for new applications yet to reach the market. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Past Catalyst funding rounds are a good gauge of this challenge's feasibility given the success of proposals which could have been submitted under this challenge had it been present at the time. One example would be PlayerMint from Funds 4 & 5. One could argue that this challenge is not only feasible but could lead to a more finessed DApp & Integration challenge, given this can now provide a home for the niche gaming proposals. The overlap may well occur with the NFT Business Models but proper education and mentoring of proposals could minimise chances of submitting one under the wrong proposal. Nonetheless, that is a good problem to have for Catalyst. Looking forward to the results of the vote as I believe this would be a popular choice with the Cardano community & its already thriving NFT market.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The gaming industry is well and truly established hence the presented 12 key metrics can be easily tracked and quantified from within Catalyst. As this segment matures in the coming months and years, the community may well add to these KPIs with the advent of more novel ways gaming and blockchain can interact, which may not have even been thought of as yet.
