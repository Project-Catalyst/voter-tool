If people are coming together only to work, it becomes tedious and boring. People must have fun with eaceh other, let loose and interact in social situations not only on work projects. That is why big companies always have social events for teams, departments and sometimes the entire company. Parties, picnics, Day trips, Weekend seminars where the entire family comes and enjoys the hotel and facilities etc.  That way they can socialize while learning at their conference or seminar. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\r\nThe budget for this project is reasonable", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\r\nThe Verifiability of this is clear.
