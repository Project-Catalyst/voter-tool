That's where the population will triple. What happens in Africa can decide the faith of the world: whether to succumb to the same mistakes done in the industrialized world or to leap over that into a sustainable future. I would not say the same about any other region in the world because everywhere else there's so much technological debt and they don't have this boost in population happening anymore. At the same time, limiting this to East Asia doesn't make sense. How about populous and innovative India in South Asia? How about Australia and Oceania? Nah, I think it's wise to focus now in Africa.

Let's then create a proper retrospect event and learn from the mistakes made and successes achieved. Then we can start taking those learning points to other regions of the world. I have 22 years of experience in both business and nonprofit world and I've seen it too many times: great initiatives fall when they lose focus. Strategy is about making choices.
