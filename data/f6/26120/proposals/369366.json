There are other Dapps challenges so there is overlap however the challenge makes a good case for focusing on quickly deployed Dapps to drive Cardano adoption quicker as the Dapps that take longer to build will not begin attracting new users for a while.\r\nI strongly agree this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Dapps and integrations has the largest number of proposals in Fund 6 so there is plenty of room to grow and split this category of challenges into more focused challenges.

There were some projects which got approved but not funded which would have fit within the $10k limit of this proposal.\r\nIt is not clear that these projects would have been more impactful than the bigger ones which were not funded (i.e. comparing the total funds set aside for dApps and integrations, both big and small, with this proposal which would dedicate some funds to small projects).\r\nAs a Solution Architect I can often see small enablers which make a huge difference to the solution landscape, so the idea is not bad, but at this stage of Cardano's development, the proposer has not made the case clear why small projects should have a dedicated budget.\r\n ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a lot a talented developer with a good idea can do for $10k which would promote the usability of ADA and the spread of Cardano, and keeping projects small will save overhead costs, so I agree that this might be a good approach. Having led both small and big initiatives I know that sometimes having one or two dedicated persons can achieve more than a whole team.\r\nHowever, there are not that many projects proposed and approved with a budget =< $10k. This might change, and might be many more projects proposed if there are dedicated funds, but will they keep the same quality as the bigger projects, if they \"play in their own league\" so to  speak?

That would be a sub-optimization of the Cardano treasury.\r\n If that is the case the projects funded through this challenge should get a lot more use per treasury ada spent.\r\n\r\nThus the evaluation criteria should be something like:\r\nRegular dApps and integration campaign:\r\nTr=transactions/treasury ada spent\r\nVr=volume ada/treasury ada spent\r\n\r\nLow-budget dApps and integrations:\r\nTl=transactions/treasury ada spent\r\nVl=volume ada/treasury ada spent\r\n\r\nWhere Tl>Tr and Vl>Vr after three months or so.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_533", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "importance": "In recent funds many small Dapps haven't been funded (but approved), as proposals with high budgets requests\u00a0exhausted funds.", "success": "At least 20 novel and viable small decentralized applications get built of top of Cardano in a short time horizon, attracting new users."}
