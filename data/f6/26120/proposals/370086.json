There is overlap between this Challenge and the Open Source Developer Ecosystem which has a more reasonable budget.\r\nI agree this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.\r\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Developer ecosystem challenge existed in Fund 5. There were 22 proposals successfully funded for $588,202 out of $600,000. In Fund 6, there are 102 proposals (2nd largest of 18 Challenges) in the assessment phase for the $1,005,000 fund. The community may have the capacity and interest in funding this challenge up to the $2M requested.\r\nThis is a very big request that represents a very large percentage of the total challenge fund. Developer happiness is important but does the general community really want to preclude challenge funds for solving global poverty or the like by funding such a large request? Several of the established challenge funds have doubled their requests from Fund 6, which in the case of this challenge fund becomes a particularly large amount. These increasing requests are effectively going to choke out any new challenge fund requests which will stifle innovation and the decentralization that the community was founded upon.\r\nI would like to recommend funding this challenge for $1M like in Fund 6 , as I think this request is too large for the good of the general community, and to allow new Challenge teams to form however that is not an option. \r\nI neither agree nor disagree that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge.\r\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The success criteria are relevant to the first half of the challenge question.
