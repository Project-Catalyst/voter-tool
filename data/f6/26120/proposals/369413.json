There are 32 proposals (7th largest of 18 Challenges) being assessed for $100K. The number of proposals was large relative to the size of the fund compared to other challenges which is indicative that this challenge has room to grow. The challenge is more than tripling its funding request in Fund 7.\r\nFund 6 proposals have not even been voted on yet so there is no way to know the cost effectiveness of this challenge yet. The recruitment cost should be under $5 per new user to be comparable to other challenges so a $10K community hub should bring in 200+ users within 12 months.\r\nI agree that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge.\r\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success criteria are relevant to the challenge question. \r\nThe key metrics are relevant to the success criteria. It can be calculated from the metrics provided however the final reporting should include calculating the cost per user onboarded for each hub and aggregated for the entire challenge so that its effectiveness as a recruitment strategy can be compared to other challenges.\r\nI  strongly agree that the success criteria and suggested metrics are set correctly to measure progress in addressing the challenge.\r\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_344", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "Scaling up of community hubs is essential for mass adaption and decentralisation.
