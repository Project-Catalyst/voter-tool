By challenge definition there is no overlap with any other successful challenges. In order for the community to push innovation boundaries there will need to be solutions that do not easily fit into categories. Given the limitations of the current funding process and the lengthy time for funding it is possible that a key funding challenge category does not receive funding for 3 months.

Therefore, the proposal has good alignment with Cardano's mission. Setting up a challenge that is open, is a chance to contemplate proposers around the world that cover topics beyond the \"traditional\" crypto-developer space. Therefore, creating this challenge is a way to decentralize funding resources - which I think is a great north for the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The challenge is feasible but lacks explanations on how it will be implemented, what are resources needed, or how they will be applied. It seems to rely on CA to be implemented, then it can be seen as an alignment between the community that requires good orientation to avoid \"free-funding-to-whatever-you-ask-for\". The proposers could provide more details on how it will fit into Catalyst's program approach. There's is the capacity to implement this challenge, but a bit more of detailing in the proposal would make it more appealing as a challenge that solves the issue of projects that don't fit into any other challenges. Another question is that it could make it easy for lazy proposers to tag their proposals as \"miscellaneous\" without caring too much about the work done so far to build the Catalyst Community and the structure of project funding.
