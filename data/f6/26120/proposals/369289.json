The challenge brief is very specific in that it will require a prototype vote using recommendations from the Diversified Voting Influence analysis then provide an analysis of the results. By my understanding, it does not appear that there could be multiple winning proposals under this challenge, at best there might be competing teams for a single contract to do the work. \r\nI neither agree nor disagree that this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The catalyst community has the technical capabilities to address the challenge however its not clear to me when and how the community chose to use the recommendations from the Diversified Voting Influence analysis as the desired voting methodology.
