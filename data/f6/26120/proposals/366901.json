Seamless transition between ADA and Fiat currencies is a very important element of onboarding new users and helping adoption and \u2026 using the system as a financial operating system for the world.\r\nAs this is the the Fund 7 Challenge setting campaign, where Catalyst sets challenges for the wider community to submit proposals, it would be good to improve the chances of your proposal to pass - by adjusting it to the initial target audience that may influence its chances - community advisors and voters.\r\nMy comments are just suggestions and ideas - and feel free to ignore them. I may be totally wrong.\r\nIn this case (DeFi/CeFi\u2026), I suggest that you could reformulate the part where you state: \"I have a solution, which will be given in Fund 7\" - as it may sound as if you are setting up the Challenge for your own solution. It may seem like nitpicking, but in fact will improve the chances for your idea becoming a future Challenge in Fund 7. Yes, it is counterintuitive.\r\nHere are some reasons for this:\r\nIf this challenge is selected, of course, it would be great for you to submit a proposal as a solution, but maybe it is best to separate the Challenge setting now - from your own solution that will become a proposal. If your solution is the best in Fund 7 - it will float to the top.\r\nCA and voters may not be able to follow the intricate links between the current Challenge setting and the future proposals and earlier proposals - and in any case Challenge setting is best done without proposed solutions.\r\nKeeping the challenge neutral - not mentioning a prepared solution that you yourself have - probably improves the chances of acceptance - of your proposed challenge. Strange, but true.\r\nIt may seem counterintuitive - but by tying in your proposals and setting future challenges across Funds - you may be reducing your chances.\r\nFor example, I may be wrong here - the attachment that you included with this proposal \"InExchange: Ada Card(ano) Cat(alyzer) i\" - as it seems that it is a specific solution that you may wish to submit later in Fund 7 as a proposal. However, submitting it now as an attachment (and integral part of this proposal for a future Challenge) - may lower the chances of this Challenge being accepted.\r\nIn this Challenge setting exercise - it is important to refrain from offering solutions. It is more important to set a - lets call it almost philosophical - framework by describing the future Challenge in the best way possible. In a general way. You may mention several possible avenues or approaches, or even hint about some other ones.\r\nIt is a highly technical endeavor and probably there won't be too many proposals - so if you later submit a great proposal in Fund 7 - it stands a good chance anyway. No need to tie it in now.\r\nAlso by not referencing your own solutions or potential solutions, this will open the way up for different approaches and different solutions and even solutions of smaller/larger scale - or proposals that target only certain elements of the Challenge. Maybe someone will appear with a better idea, or good enough idea for you two to work together. Or maybe the fund will be large enough for several projects to go ahead.\r\nIn the referenced project: \"Layer 2 Advanced Architecture\" - you mentioned \"Just in case anyone thinks I'm doing this just to get more funding for this project: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DeFi-CeFi-Cardano-TBC-in-Fund-5/333834-48088 , you are correct. \"\r\nI would suggest that you believe in your proposal sufficiently - not to reference it as the solution for the future Challenge. It will help your chances, as it shows you are confident enough to know that your proposed solution will be selected among the best.\r\nSo, let me recapitulate:\r\n1. Great ideas do need funding\r\n2. Challenge setting - is best used to inspire people for ideas how to tackle the problem - even if we may have a certain solution that is already in development or the conception stage (because Catalyst wants competition among ideas and the best presented solution will stand the best chances of winning anyway)\r\n3. This is not a comment about the merit of your ideas and suggestions, what I am trying to do is to help improve the chances of your Challenge setting proposal to pass - by helping its presentation.\r\n4. Effectively, I think that by disassociating your future solutions from this Challenge setting exercise - you stand a better chance to help set a future Challenge in Fund 7.\r\n5. As your proposed future Challenge asks for half of the Fund 7 USD800,000 budget for community challenges, it may help your proposal to address one of the guiding questions: \"What justifies the Amount asked for this Challenge? \"\r\nI am providing these comments with the wish to help your Challenge go ahead and I wish you all success.\"", "q1r": 1, "q2": "No breakdown of the funds in this proposal as well.
