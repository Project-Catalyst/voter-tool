The reason for this was my own experience as I saw a large gap in the needs and requests of the users. Tons of light at the end of the tunnel though, and it seems like the spirit of this proposal would be a great way to create a \"self-contained\" experiment to stimulate ideas to help scale to self governance.\r\n\r\nThe particular area that caught my eye the development of platforms for everyone participating in a challenge to connect & share, as there is a big opportunity to drive higher engagement, especially with certain demographics. These certain demographics (younger, less tech friendly, language and cultural barriers, will only further magnify any current challenges, and these improvements mentioned in this proposal could help mitigate that.\r\n\r\nThe only thing it would be good to see more of is a b it more on giving back to the community or how the community will be involved and engaged.\r\n\r\nGreat work!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "At first 4 stars seemed appropriate here vs 5 as it seems like a lot of challenge to overcome given the systems and processes involved. However after considering the measures of success given, specifically around measuring success based on adoption of other challenges, it felt more like a 5 star.\r\n\r\nFurther reinforcing this rating was the flexibility provided in the example directions, showing more objective ideas to design alternative frameworks as well as the development of additional tools to facilitate Challenge specific CA's really resonated with me as a CA and community member. Look forward to learning more about this in the future!\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above objective measures, more subjective approaches like the organization of challenges based on expertise, as well as the idea to drive engagement through sharing and connecting among the community show creativity which is key.\r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The verifiability area could use a bit more focus to get to a 5 star, but the overall idea of the project gives me a good feeling it can get there.\r\n\r\nHowever, when considering the end of the proposal the success factors that would be used to verify its success seemed a bit light compared to the rest of the proposal. Measuring things like adopting and engagement can be tricky. Its tough to track follow on adoption accurately as well in my experience. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand the below idea proposed in the budgeting was creative and is something that seems like it would be beneficial in other proposals/challenges.\r\n\r\n\"Remaining funds must match >= 90% of proposed funds or else a proposal is skipped (as opposed to 100%)\"\r\n\r\n \r\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_503", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"q0": "I interpret this proposal as providing the community a mechanism to experiment with new voting mechanisms/rules. If my interpretation is correct then I think this challenge is critical to Cardano's success because it's very unlikely that the first voting rules we come up with will be the optimal rules across all use cases. I'm of the opinion that the community will need to experiment with many different voting mechanisms to figure out which ones work best under which scenarios. For example, we may be able to shorten cycle times for projects requesting less than 10k in funding while we may need to do multi-round voting for multiyear projects. \r\n\r\nAll of this being said, I think this challenge is phrased very poorly and if funded it should be reworded. I had a very hard time figuring out the underlying idea from the words that are used and I'm not sure I actually interpreted the idea correctly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I interpret this proposal as providing the community a mechanism to experiment with new voting mechanisms/rules. If my interpretation is correct then I think this challenge is not very feasible since it will require very significant changes to ideascale and the voting app on a challenge by challenge basis. These changes will need significant one-off engineering efforts or a massive engineering effort by the both the ideascale and voting-app teams to make challenge voting rules configurable. Being an engineer myself (distributed systems, devops, ML infra) I can imagine that the engineering efforts could take months to implement just to make this possible.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that I'm underestimating the engineering talent/velocity/bandwidth of the teams in question. Because I don't have intimate knowledge of the internal dev processes I score this 3 for feasibility - it's hard to implement but maybe the dev teams are incredible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It's not clear how the technology to support these new challenge types will be created. It's not clear how these will be intergrated. The success critieria aren't phrased in a clear way, I have a hard time parsing the following sentence: \"Challenges using developed systems & tools for: proposing, assessing, voting, fund distribution or auditing\". What are \"developed systems and tools\"? \r\n\r\nI also have a hard time understanding \"A diverse pool of sophisticated and effective Challenges tailored to their goals making full use of the technologies they enable\". How do we know if we've achieved \"diversity\"? It seems to me that the current challenges are quite diverse. How do we measure sophistication and effectiveness? How do we measure if a challenge is making full use of the technologies it enables? \r\n\r\nWhat does \"Which initiatives provide support for challenge teams\" mean? I have a hard time understanding what you mean by \"initiative\" since it's not common in the Catalyst lexicon. \r\n\r\nI give this a score of 1 for verifiability because the challenge has a poor description that's difficult to understand. I think the language/phrasing of the challenge needs to be improved before it can be shown to proposers in a Fund.\r\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_531", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}], "importance": "With proper guidance, tools and research each challenge can become a small self-contained experiment on the road towards Voltaire", "success": "A diverse pool of sophisticated and effective Challenges tailored to their goals making full use of the technologies they enable"}
