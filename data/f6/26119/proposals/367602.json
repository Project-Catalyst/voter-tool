This DAO will function as initiative for onboarding a work force of auditors to perform independent audit procedures. The key element to this solution, the DAO, will be issuing its own token that will be utilized in various ways to generate revenue, to fund its operations.\r\nAll the statements are clearly articulated and defined to strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\r\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All information provided, including full deployed project web site, are easily accessible from the proposals page. \r\nThe manpower is not explicitly defined as the project will hire, onboard and train workforce within 3 months.

This is one low risk I recognize, the risk of low or unsuccessful financing by DAO Token deployment, as it partly depends on external causes & effects, i.e. creating liquidity by users of SCAT DAO Token. This is clearly stated on the SCATDAO.com web site.
