A single secure for media to be uploaded could be useful here. I do worry however how much this would be used. Individual proposals that are creating things for a given audience should be reaching out to their audiences anyway. As we grow to hundreds of funded proposals, can this scale in terms of the community actually looking at the all? Audits are generally done by independent parties, whilst this could help proposers communicate, there would be no vetting on what is supplied here thus I am not sure it counts towards auditability, though may help in terms of accountability.

That's 10%, or 24 hours spent on collaboration and maintenance. The collaboration and maintenance lack  description, this makes the budget declared difficult to evaluate.

Particularly, it is not stated why the community should provide any media on a specific project, run by a proposer or a Group of people (team). The people or the community, interacting with a project from the outside, can't have the necessary knowledge to decide or suggest what content should be added to the data. If the opposite is expected, this would imply the community has the know-how and capacity, to support the transparency of the proposals auditability. On this note, the clarification is missing.\r\n-Under success metrics, the proposer sees success in tracking the (user?) traffic to the proposal pages, I guess here, the proposer, is referring to the 'pages'(?) on proposers 'PACE' audit platform. Furthermore, as success metric, the proposer suggests that increased amount of proposal information will provide successful auditability of the proposals on this platform. \r\nAnd under 'what success looks like' it provides explanation how this increasing amount of media will have impact on communities engagement.
