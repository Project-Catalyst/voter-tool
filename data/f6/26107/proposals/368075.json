It would be nice to see more information on use cases of this however. Who are the end users? If it is just developers who can integrate into their own project, does this save them much over just comparing the hash to the blockchain themselves? \r\nGiven you already have a working website, how many users does it have, how many times have it been queried?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have experience and have already built a working version.
