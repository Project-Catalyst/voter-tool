However it requires a lot more detail to be a viable proposal. I have significant experience in financial markets and verifying the backing of a stable contract is not as simple as looking at the assets. If it is fully backed then, yes. But what about fractional backing (how all banks work)? What if it is set up like the SigmaUSD token on Ergo, or Djed, where USD value is backed by at risk assets? This requires stress testing and correlation analysis. If a national authority is providing insurance, then where does the blockchain come into it?", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has does not have financial markets experience and has stated that they will use the requested funds of $10,000 to get a developer to do it.
