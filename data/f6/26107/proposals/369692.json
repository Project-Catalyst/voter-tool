It is not clear if the proposer has the technical expertise to successfully implement the proposal. It would be nice to have a more detailed plan on the technical side to be able to evaluate whether the $7500 set aside for developers is sufficient to successfully implement the proposal. Ideally the proposer would join with someone with the relevant technical experience to at least design the plan for a developer to implement.

This proposal is exceptionally clear, concise and reads as an exact answer to the Metadata Challenge. This problem is begging to be solved by Cardano NFTs and Metadata on the blockchain.

The proposer is making this proposal with the blessing of an international organisation that represents his community. The proposer expresses openness to collaboration.

This proposal is fitting like Cinderella's slipper into this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposer inspires confidence in me that, if funded, the project would be executed successfully. The proposer has outlined a step by step roadmap and why this project would be impactful. In alignment with Cardano's mission and values this project intends to still be of utility in 500 years time using the power & immutability of the blockchain.\r\nBecause the proposal is so well written and the proposer references Lean Methodology it makes me think that the project would be undertaken with commitment and forethought. If this project is funded and has access to IOHK devs I think it will definitely be successful and useful in the world of rare and one of a kind books, preserving knowledge for us all.
