Without an ability to estimate whether a borrower will repay, how can you decide whether to lend, and what is a reasonable rate.  \r\nWhy would a borrower even repay at all? What is the mechanism? Allowing ADA holders act as a bank could be a good business, but lending can only happen with a requirement to repay, and  information on likelihood of repayment.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer does not provide any experience in relation to banking, which is the core of this proposal.

What is unclear for me is the problem itself. It is vaguely described as in for what loans do you mean? If you're talking about loans in the world I don't see this working out since it is not without huge risks. Banks won't see crypto as valuable liquidity for loans, and if you give out a loan on the dApp and the loaner needs to cash it first then how will the dApp seize the assets back?   And why did you propose this under metadata challenge if your goal is to create a dApp?\r\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The Github link provided by the proposer indicates that he has the necessary skills for this branch.
