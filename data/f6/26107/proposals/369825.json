The proposers claim to have access to the Columbian government. If so then it is likely they will succeed. It would be nice to have more evidence of this, maybe through a linked-in profile.

However the proposal needs some serious work to make it more understandable. I think there is a language barrier issue here that hopefully the other F6 challenge (multilingual resources) will address. I have emailed the generic IOHK contact to alert the team that there is potential government level collaboration to be fostered here. If a project such as this was implemented successfully it could be a catalyst for governmental adoption globally. I come to this assessment with 10 years experience working in a Public Health Service and have an understanding of the levels of corruption and intense disorganisation that can be found within, also as someone who is learning a second language. I really appreciate the efforts this proposer has made and I'm sorry I can not score it higher.\r\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think it is very unlikely that this proposal is ready to bring value to the Cardano ecosystem in its current state. It is an excellent idea and use case but the proposal itself is unstructured and very difficult to understand. There is no Information provided about the proposing team. There is no breakdown or roadmap of how they plan to achieve this project. The proposer references collaboration with the Colombian Secretary of Health but does not provide any evidence.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Unfortunately this proposal is currently underdeveloped  and doesn't provide a clear & understandable description of problem and solution. This proposal would not be easily auditable in its current form. It is lacking a roadmap or suggestions of metrics for gauging progress. There is no information about the proposers other than stating they are professors at a Colombian University and Government Consultants. I would encourage the proposing team to include more information about themselves, qualifications and provide evidence of claims of working within the Colombian Government. I hope this proposal gets the support and development it needs to action real social good through the use of the Cardano Blockchain.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_330", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge and is very much in line with Cardano's mission, being quite similar to the Ethiopian MoU for Atala Prism and academic tracking. Where this very admirable project missed out on full marks is the absence of an official and publicised engagement with the Sec of Health. A link to an agreement or a news item detailing this cooperation with the government would have been invaluable. Such an undertaking as recording health data requires government oversight which would require analysis on people's privacy rights, accuracy of reported data, etc. Secondly and ironically, one of the rationales given for this project is that government-reported data can not be trusted as it is used to shape the messaging to the voting public. If the Sec of Health is indeed involved, wouldn't that introduce a sense of mistrust and inaccuracy of the source of data desire bing recorded on the Cardano blockchain? If my assessment is false and the intended sources of the information can be trusted despite being government DBs (and its only 'announced' numbers are fudged), then that needs further clarification. Overall, a good undertaking. Good luck.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a high level of confidence that this can be implemented successfully given the bona fides of the proposers; an academic, a public health specialist and a comp scientist. It also claims backing and support of a major University in Colombia and the Columbian Secretary of Health. Access to such resources adds to the chances for success. The 12-moth timeframe with clearly defined activities on every 6-month interval indicates a lot of thought and planning has already been invested in this undertaking and the surprisingly small amount of funding requested means the project will not withdraw a lot from the funding chest. This provides a sense that the end goal is true to the vision of providing a secure, accurate and open access to health data for the Colombian population. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This assessor adopted a small measure of flexibility in this section and provided a relatively positive score despite the usual development pathways missing. The reason for this is the acknowledgement that the activities defined under the 6th and 12th month roadmaps are purely investigative and analysing in nature, of what metadata needs to be included and from where they will be sourced. Understandably, these activities may not yet provide a clear picture of what can or needs to be developed. It is however comforting to realise the value of what the requested fund represents in Colombia and that the small amount of $12000, in comparison to other proposals with less impact, would be able to recruit a number of developers to build the health data ecosystem. I would recommend given the build would not be conducted until after at least a year has passed, that the proposers either secure Plutus Pioneers (hopefully from Colombia or Sth America) to help in the build or have team members from its dev team to enrol in/watch Lars Br\u00fbnes' Plutus class.
