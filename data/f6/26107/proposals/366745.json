It would be better if the proposer gave more information of what the uses for this data are. I have experience with big data from the real world as a Chief Data Scientist at a prop-tech firm. Collecting and recording the data is only a start, there needs to be a plan for usage of this data and a clear explanation of why it all needs to be immutable. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proponent discusses collecting what will amount to enormous amounts of real time data. This cannot work be done manually yet there is no discussion of a plan for automating this. The proposer should pick a specific type of factory they which to make a minimum viable product on and detail what sensors they are going to use to collect the data and who they will reliably integrate this into the blockchain. This is no small task even for one factory. Do you need to install new sensor or can you piggy-back on data already collected? For instance in the built environment large amount of data are already generated an used by building management systems. It is much cheaper to tap into these than install new sensors. Many pieces of equipment in factories will also generate data in their operation.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "What does success look like in this project? Even if you collect the data you want, why is that data useful? Why would a factory want it. It would be great to see in addition to a firm plan to automate and collect data, a use case which a factor or end customer of products from that factory would use the data for and include production of an analysis suite which can query the block chain for the data and produce reports.
