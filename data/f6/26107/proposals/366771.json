A few questions however. What about privacy? Do all donors want their donations made public? What about the final receivers? Perhaps there should be some encryption so donor can see where their money went, but not anyone on the blockchain?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Whilst WADA has experience working in this space, there is no detailed plan other than the one line description, and the fact the funds will be used to help local WADA devs learn whilst working on the problem. Whilst it is a relatively small amount of funding, it is hard to give a high rating here as no plan has been outlined. Please provide a plan on how you are actually addressing the problem of tracking and tracing donations.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The first two success indicators provided are more about getting set up in the first 6 months, and not actually about solving the problem. The third is much better looking a framework being developed and engagement with donors, though it would be nice to see a definition of how you are measuring success against these. It would be good to also see some metrics related to actually recording the data as metadata onto the block chain, given that is the focus of this challenge.

If the title contains a punchline and a more detailed description of what's intended and what's important, it will have more impact. As a result, I suggest changing the idea description because it is essentially not clear and adding too much value to readers who are attempting to grasp its scope and purpose.
