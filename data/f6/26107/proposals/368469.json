It is not as simple as just building an app to commit the data to the blockchain. Who are the users? What is the data you are collecting, how are you collecting it, how are you ensuring data integrity before it is published to the blockchain how are you going to display it. \r\nIt would be good to have a more concrete minimum viable product. For instance choose one food chain and outline how you are going to collect the data and how this data solves a specific problem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposers appear to have relevant experience on the programming side. However there is a lot more to a successful project here. From my experience in the prop-tech and robotics space, physical collection of the data and provision is a useful end product of that data is a key component they have skimmed over. The proposers should produce a plan for a specific use case and show how they will robustly, efficiently collect untampered data and publish it to the block chain. They should also then produce analysis with this data that their end user would value. A plan to produce this minimum Viable product would be something that could then be evaluated and would make this project more likely.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There is no clear plan on exactly what is going to be done, who the end users are, or what success looks like.  A detailed plan in a specific use case should be developed and then metrics against that can be measured.
