The team have successfully identified existing work practices and issues related to  various forms of manufacturing in Africa and detailed a vision of how those problems could be addressed. In addition to simple problem solving, standards of openness, fairness, efficiency and sustainability are all enhanced. It is very clear that a successful implementation of a project of this type would be of great interest and benefit to its users and has the potential for the scale adoption that would help advance Cardano in Africa.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The management team has extensive relevant experience and is well aligned to the project proposal. The proposal and supporting material demonstrate a thorough understanding of the current market conditions and the activity required to develop the various components of the proposed system.

Very good list of supporting advisors. \r\n\r\nThe budget seems reasonable for such an ambitious project and the team understands they will need to raise more funds as they advanced to realize the project. Having some information about the business model would and market have supported the investment and scale opportunity.\r\n \r\nRegarding the budget, it would have been good to get more details of how each item was calculated and what will be deliverables. \r\n\r\nOne remark is that it would have been good to show already in the first 3 months a milestone related to the Cardano/blockchain integration. \r\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear roadmap and timeline over 3,6, 12 months.
