Not only are they providing a service to help educate Swahili-speaking individuals on Cardano news, but they are also bringing in young college graduates from Kenya. The proposal calls on the Cardano community to recognize that there is potential in the African space for Cardano. The young journalists and technology graduates mentioned in the proposal will be the future leaders of Cardano in Africa because they will be the ones spreading the message of Cardano. Thus, the proposal not only spreads awareness about Cardano in Africa, but also onboards individuals from Africa into the project. Additionally, the proposers have addressed the ongoing growth of the project past the end of the proposal -- continuing to build relationships in Africa while translating information using self-sufficient means. (score given 5).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The combination of the skillsets of the two primary proposers seems to set up the proposal for success. The proposers have technical, entrepreneurial, and the educational backgrounds, which are all relevant to the project. Although I do not have as much experience creating educational content in languages other than English, the roadmap seems achievable in the given timeframe -- beginning with the foundations of the website and relationships with translators, followed by the ongoing translation of information into Swahili. The proposers have already been in contact with translators, so there is no concern about finding individuals to work on the project. However, one concern is how to spread awareness of the website and information in a country where access to internet is not necessarily uniform. How will this obstacle be overcome to ensure that the project is successful? Addressing this question would allow a more definitive answer as to whether the proposal will be successful. (score given: 4)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have outlined sufficient plans and KPIs to audit the success of the proposal. The 1 month, 3 month, and 6 month milestones provide enough tangible evidence for the community to check on the proposal's progress. Additionally, success will be determined by the translations of the core content on the website and the news articles over time. Lastly, the analytics of the website, such as location of users, will be helpful in determining whether the website is driving traffic from individuals in Africa, indicating that the project is reaching the target audience. One question I have is, what number of (unique) viewers would constitute success? Is it 1000 individuals? 100,000? 10,000,000? If the proposers could clarify this information, that would greatly strengthen the proposal.

I hear lots of talk about banking the unbanked, but we keep making decisions without consulting the unbanked. This translation plan begins to build a bridge.

He would also meet the challenge of translating Cardano's contents into other languages. I found it very interesting when the author of the proposal mentioned that he is in contact with a group of young people who have recently arrived from Kenya, from the fields of journalism and technology, because it demonstrates that he has a direct connection with the audience he intends to reach and already has candidate translators for your content library. It is also very positive that this library includes contents from the basic to the most advanced in the universe of cryptocurrencies, because the proportion of people who are unaware of this universe to those who are already aware of the concepts is quite significant.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Certainly the duo that created the project is well trained, but lacking in detail. We know that it is an engineer and a teacher, some of their interests and areas of expertise. However, it would be interesting for us to know even more about their trajectories, places where they previously worked, other projects in which they were involved, how this relationship with the Cardano universe took place. It is always positive that linkedin profiles are attached, if they have them, because that way we can get to know more deeply who they are. Regarding the rest of the team, which from what I understand is made up of the site content writers (developers) and the future translators from English to Swahili, we don't have any information about them (a developer named Darlington is mentioned, but the information is shallow), which unfortunately leaves its presence somewhat abstract for us. For these reasons, I believe that they are, they are capable, they have demonstrated in practice that they know how to execute the project (through the attached website, which is ready, full of content and well structured), but it would be even better if we had more details about the team.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The authors make it very clear what their funding goals are: to translate content that already exists and is produced for their website for around 150 million Swahili speakers. They also outline an action plan based on quarters, which gives us a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will happen over time. However, as it is a long time, it would be interesting if the activities of each quarter were grouped in order of occurrence and more detailed. Regarding budget breakdown, we know how much money will go to each professional, knowing what he will do and for how long. A detail that I thought could have been explored further was the convection of the audio content for the site; how would they be made available? Would a person be hired exclusively for this, or would the translators themselves record? One more detail that I found crucial and didn't see mentioned: disclosure. This proposal is very positive and important, and its benefits should reach the maximum number of readers possible, both African and from other places. It would be important to draw up an outreach plan for the site!
