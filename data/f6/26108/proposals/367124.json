It is comprehensive in nature and provides overlapping examples of benefits from increased communication, standardised trading environments and the multitude of other benefits derived from the widespread use of blockchain technology. The combined use of trading, NFTs and stablecoins provide a potent mix that would benefit the citizens of Africa and would have significant impact on the development of Cardano utilisation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The scope of the proposal is huge involving the development and deployment of a new system across an entire continent. The proposal is comprehensive in nature and provides solution examples for identified challenges but confidence in success is not possible without significantly more detail about implementation. In my own experience of programme management as detail is added a better picture of the scale of larger projects is achieved. This proposal has many compelling ideas but will benefit greatly from a fleshed out implementation plan. For the budget being asked this may be better framed as a proof of concept.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal demonstrates market experience and understanding.
