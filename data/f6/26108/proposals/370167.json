There is no debt because the company has never traded, all assessments are copied and pasted on each of my proposals showing a general bias against all of my proposals.\nUnconstructive assessment: The UK Companies are all in good order, this assessor does not understand UK company law, the companies have not been dissolved even once, Notices were served to dissolve the company one time, when I thought about discontinuing the project but I decided to continue and filed the necessary document to continue the company. This does not indicate a lack of ability to complete the proposal.\nRegards,\nCarl Henry\n"}, {"q0": "Helping africans to get their hardware and connectivity in order to access the services Cardano has to offer is fundamental to help the whole continent.\r\nAlso, as mentioned by the proposer, training offered to newbies is going to be a key aspect for the project to succeed.\r\nThe language barrier has been thought so a part of the budget will be dedicated to translation", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan seems to provide equipment, connectivity and training to use a pc and internet, however there is no plan to necessarily involve a Cardano developer (e.g. Plutus Pioneer) to train new people to code as well for example.\r\nFurthermore, it seems there is no plan to expand the number of users and it's not clear how the project would auto-sustain (funding from charity, users contributing themselves ect. ?)", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap is clear however it seems there is a poor correlation with the budget breakdown.
