The Proposal is highly aligned with the challenge at hand and has absolute potential that infrastructures can be made available to help outsourcing of best solutions from ground devs to help push Cardano forward. Looking at the relevant experience, it's stated clearly that  the team already has started delivering this project even though they've not been funded for. They have a skilled team of Cardano Community Practitioners and entrepreneurs located in Hubs, which is a good form of infrastructure across Africa. \r\nThe inclusion of education and outreach in this proposal is also a good initiative. Reason being that the kind of preconceived knowledge most people in most African Countries have is very poor and requires that these people must be reached with the accurate information (facts) to help convince in supporting of Cardano growth in the continent. Infrastructures without good outreach and education I think would be of no relevance so kudos to the idea of education and outreach inclusion.\r\nWith that being said, there's expectation for quick implementation, which increases the potential for positive impact on Project Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From reference and past successes, there's quite a good experience which affirms that this proposal will be successfully implemented.

The WADA group, which I remember having already met in a proposal I evaluated before, is centered on African projects and, according to what they say, it has contact with other, smaller groups that will act directly in the investment, depending on the sector. For example, the money they ask for in financing will be invested on different fronts, from stable/quality energy supply and internet to renting physical spaces, chairs, tables and so on. In fact, it is sad to think that such resources, considered basic in other parts of the world, are scarce and expensive for the inhabitants of Africa, and even before investing in more complex projects - like several I have evaluated here, which involved the creation of sites, games and platforms that benefit the African people - it is necessary to pay attention to more primary resources, as this proposal suggests.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no doubt how prepared the team is to execute the project. As I said in the previous comment, I already knew the WADA group of previously evaluated proposals (from what I remember, at bottom 5). And there's a part of the website attached ([https://wadalliance.org/about-us/](https://wadalliance.org/about-us/)) where we can get an objective and satisfying view of who they are, what each member does, and some have also attached the linkedin profile. In this way, it transmits a lot of security with regard to the technical competence to execute the proposal, in addition to being an already consolidated group and possessing a network, it will certainly have sufficient influence and contacts to put its plans into action. About the project's applicability, I have some points to comment. It is true that the team tried to inform us more generally what would happen in each time period after funding, measured in months. However, as it is a proposal of huge proportion, the activities of each month are complex and I felt that they required more detail from its parts. For example... right at the beginning, 6 spaces would be acquired equipped with internet and all the infrastructure to perform the tasks. But where would these spaces be, in which countries? In each of these spaces, called hubs, would happen, for example: \"Organization of recurring events, education in functional programming and blockchain technology\". What nature would these events be, within the bed of subjects that could be addressed in the Cardano ecosystem? How would these education projects take place, how would the contents be passed on? I believe that with this proposal, the WADA group intends to make a real revolution in the Cardano universe in Africa, but precisely because there are many activities, it would be important for us to better understand each one. One suggestion is to set up a website or even a slideshow to better detail each activity in the phases.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "We are presented with success metrics by which the community could track the progress of this project. The financial amount is very well detailed, through a slide attached in a document in the docs. In addition to these more standard details, the team that created the proposal was concerned to expose the risks that would involve this project, emphasizing the legal issue, and how they could deal with them. In this way, the auditability is very well done, there is enough detail to understand how things will happen and how we can monitor them.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}], "solution": "Funding basic infrastructure in African hubs will allow us to collaborate, coordinate, educate and initiate building out local use cases.", "experience": "WADA: Skilled team of Cardano Community practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across\u00a0 Africa and the diaspora."}
