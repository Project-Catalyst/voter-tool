There is a wealth in Africa that needs to be tapped and this project's outreach beyond the continent, with partnerships in European universities and organisations being critical to its success.

There is currently only one person who commits code to GitHub and there's no explanation as to whether all codes of a team are handled by a single user or if there is only one coder so far involved in the project. There needs to be more openness in terms of the build as it is foundational to the success of this protocol. It would also be helpful if linkages to prove the partnerships mentioned are provided as they also prove auditability of this proposal. They were mentioned in the fund 5 proposal and given this is fund 6, there is a higher expectation to prove that those partnerships are secured. If this proposal is not funded in this round, I recommend a better description of the team, their credentials, the timelines of the build and the goals for each milestone. Also, if the claimed Fleming MVP is released prior to the end of Fund 6, then it could be leveraged as proof of on-going progress and success and would align it more with Catalyst's requirements.
