What value would it bring to its holder and how would it be used by them? I would recommend exploring the ideas of how and why it would be useful.

Hence, the target audiences are all applicable and relevant. And by bringing in more game developers and elevating Cardano-based gaming, I believe the project suffices in satisfying the main objective of the Gamers On-Chained challenge.

The opportunities emerging from procedural generated, out of the box gaming worlds, is a game artists' wet dream. Having a tool like this written with an  open source license and on chain would mean empowerment of a new generation of game designers on a new level. \nMany indie game designer and pixel artists ( to sell their art as game assets directly!)  would flock to Cardano to realise their ideas in a permission-less, sustainable (transaction costs and PoS) and scale-able (Hydra needed!) game-tech stack \n\n The risks are very well assessed and mitigation plans are in place (except for Hydra not launching, which on the other hand is almost impossible to mitigate for). Bonus Kudos for relieving Blockfrost (IPFS) stress with the \"single pixel then scale to sprite\" approach.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Evidence of tiling and mapping skills has been given on few occasions in other communities (AdaCafe and the HardForQ).\nGitHub shows activity around Plutus Pinoeers program and other Cardano related tools. The ADAgotchi website is showing progress already made and the adagotchi's currently minting.\n\nPlan is detailed enough for the amount of requested funds; Overall the budget is quite low (133 USD per hour for a plutus developer), a fact which makes up a small portion of the assessment score, since the team is already founded and the developer seems to be on board with the fixes amount. \nDocumentation is key here and is not further specified in the budget. Breaking the budget down even further would be helpful in providing a more just assessment.\nTesting the solution in an\"in house\" game production (ADAgotchi)  is sensible and a good showcase for future game projects. The \"customer\" focused approach to requirement gathering (\"customer\" here being (indie) game developers) is sound and shows  that there's software development experience within the team.  \n\nAll resources for a successful implementation are roughly described and budgeted in.\nThe technical details (on base protocol level) are not further defined, however also not deemed crucial by myself for the success of this implementation.\n\nThe risks, as mentioned before are well assessed and mitigation plans are in place.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap is only indirectly described and a timeline is missing. This might be due to the teams setup. An apprentice Plutus developer and the pixel artist having a full time job, most likely make it difficult to estimate a roadmap that can be committed to.\n\n\nMetrics and KPIs to measure success are only rudimentary defined. Working with leading and lagging KPIs would've been helpful here. For example: Leading = numbers of tutorials (one for each, artists and devs) released for using the tool; Lagging = number of repository forks; number of game worlds built...\n\n\nThe solution and problem are well understood and the team is positioned to continue development independent of Catalyst Funding. Seeing as they are already very active within the community this further shows strength and builds trust and is responsible for the relatively high assessment score.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_334", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7253, "q0": "This proposal identifies the problem that game assets occupy a lot of memory and on-chain storage is not an option for them and proposes a solution to create an open source standard for building game worlds with on-chain tilemaps.\nThe proposers argue that this standard for 16x16 pixel tiles would help indie game devs create games more easily on Cardano, it would have applications in the NFT space and later on, if integrated with Hydra, can even allow for users to interact with each other on chain.\nAs a risk, they only identified the fact that it will be difficult to get the tile maps on-chain and that they would have to start with assets smaller than 16x16 initially. I also think it would have been worth thinking about how to draw attention to this project during and after implementation, because all projects carry the risk of failing due to not being visible enough. I think this is especially relevant in the blockchain ecosystem, where success heavily relies on social media visibility and wide adoption. \nUnfortunately, even though I have over 7 years of experience in the IT industry, I do not have the blockchain competency to assess whether the solution here is viable or not, but it sounds like a good idea overall.

It\u2019s important to set time limits so that voters can form a good idea of when this proposal will be finished and what can be expected along the way.\nThe budget is broken down relatively well and is not a huge ask at 9500 USD, but it is still concerning that we don\u2019t have a clear timeline for the work that is to be done here. The highest estimation is 60 hours for researching and communicating best practices with indie game developers. Assuming an 8 hour work day, does that mean that it would only take 8 work days to complete this proposal? It\u2019s important to know if this is something that can be done in a month or if it might take 3, 6 etc.\nRegarding the team, the proposers have provided a list of 3 people, 2 of which have LinkedIn profiles, but the third, Derrick Oatway, a pixel artist and graphic designer who is mentioned to be founder of Adagotchi.io and currently employed at Atlantic Project Managers, has no link to verify his experience. Furthermore, I cannot find any information about this person on Google at all, nor about this Atlantic Project Managers company.\nI find this concerning, along with the lack of a timeline, so I can neither agree nor disagree this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully (score: 3).\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In the Auditability section, it\u2019s mentioned that the team would collaborate through Miro, Trello, Github and Discord to identify team member and game developer needs.

For example, a project github could have been provided (not Dominick Garey\u2019s personal one), along with a clear target of X commits per week or month, after the proposal is funded.\nThen, to assess the success of the proposal, we again should have seen metrics like \u201cX number of developers adopting this standard after 1 / 3 / 6 months, X number of games / NFT\u2019s created with it after a certain amount of time etc\u201d. Even if these would be very rough estimations, they are needed in order for the community to see this proposal sets clearly trackable targets that it wants to achieve, as opposed to just hoping for the best.\nDue to the lack of information that would help make this proposal more auditable, I can only give a score of 2 here.
