Thus, the proposal fits the goals of the challenge. By analyzing the game's website and its evolution achieved so far, we can see that it is a tangible and constantly evolving project, which is using the concept of NFT's as a differential for the game, which is not its only attraction.\n\nIn this context, using NFT's to generate fundraising for the game and also for sustainability projects is an innovative idea, largely also because the game has a 'body' and good lore. For the medium and long term, we believe that the success of the proposed art contest will bring more players to World Of Pirates, which generates more value for the Cardano ecosystem and helps to fund sustainable projects.\n\nThe asking amount of $9,800 also seems reasonable, given the campaign objectives and budgets for each stage are well detailed as we will see next.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When analyzing the proposal, we can see that there are many people involved who are fully qualified to execute it, their skills are not only focused on the dissemination and construction of the current campaign, but also for the continuous development of the game, which ends up strengthening this and also future campaigns and contests.\n\nOn the game's website it is possible to find the professionals mentioned in the proposal, as well as a phone number to contact and various social networks in which the project is present such as youtube, telegram and discord.\n\nThe steps to complete the proposal have well defined values \u200b\u200band as it is especially about the promotion of an art contest to promote the game and the project being helped, we can mention as a positive point that the biggest expense, $4500, will be exactly with marketing from the project. Another very relevant factor is that the team cited an increase in the value of awards based on previous experiences, this time to generate greater engagement. This demonstrates that the team, despite being experienced, is open to changes and adaptations when necessary.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The indicative metrics to measure the success of the contest are very clear and defined, and they fit very well within the scope of the proposal. Measuring the number of artists involved in relation to the previous campaign, monitoring the increase in the number of followers on twitter and also the engagement in social networks are good indicators to measure the success of a project that, a priori, depends on the general public. to be successful.\n\nAnother important, and not so direct, factor that helps us track the success of this and other future projects related to World of Pirates is realizing that the initial proposal for the development of the game did not get funding, but still, according to the authors of project, game development continued on a self-funded basis.\n\nThis leads us to have more confidence in the team, as it demonstrates engagement and real confidence in the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 6, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3740, "q0": "Proposal is very clearly written and easy to understand.

The team split into two main parts of their project, the drawing contest and the NFT fundraising. The drawing contest will allow artists in the gaming world to show off their drawing skills and receive rewards, which can allow more creativity to be expressed. And the team wanted from the drawing competition to take the winning pictures to create NFTs to put into their game universe from which players would buy them and contribute to the fund being built to help marine wildlife. \n        Currently there are still many people who think that blockchain games are a scam or can harm the environment but the team came up with the fact that they built their blockchain project with PoS that saves electricity and reduces the impact on the environment.\n         They came up with the first case study that wasn't great, but now they know how to make their project better. By raising the contest reward level for artists, they will be more enthusiastic to participate and in addition, have good judges plus community votes to create a fair contest.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's plan has 3 phases and they give clear tasks to do during that time.They give clear and reasonable cost rates for the project.\n\nThey have a team of 5 with full experience in project development.

Their team is quite qualified and reputable to build the project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team clearly sets out the KPIs they will measure to see if their project is successful, and the community can also track their progress.

The team, along with providing people with a game for entertainment, also bring in-game interaction to a whole new level by hosting an art competition, where artists are free to express their style and talent through the making of their very own NFT. The community, of course, can vote for their favourite art, and the winners will receive a prize, as well as their NFT will be integrated into the game universe for purchase. Moreover, the team does point out in the proposal that the revenue will be split 50 - 50 between the game development and fundraising. However, despite the lofty idea of donating money to professional organizations like WWF, Sea Shepherd, Little Fish DAO,... to help protect oceanic wildlife, I do not see any intention from the team to inactively raise people's knowledge about the present situation of the ocean, and that is certainly a field for future improvements. Nevertheless, this amazing project, if accepted, will still not only meet the requirements of the challenge but also greatly contribute to the Cardano ecosystem with its creative, enthusiastic and humane idea.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap  and timeline of the team in this part are honesty a little bit meagre. Although there are 3 phases and 3 campaigns with very specific deadlines, the goals seem to be too general and not detailed enough. Besides, there is almost no particular work item included, thus I think it will be beneficial for the team to put some effort into describing a thorough plan in the proposal. Fortunately, the budget breakdown is an improvement in terms of granularity compared to the previous part, and for the details of the team members, to be honest, this proposal is worth receiving applaud. They already have 5 members working in different roles, who have experience of many years in web development, blockchain, art, marketing. And for the most important part, the founder of the project - Edwin Tuzar, has a huge passion for the ocean and aquatic life. Along with a group of freelancers that they are already working with, I personally see the great potential in this project, and hence my rating for this is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal is impressive regarding the aspects essential to assess auditability. They have very granular KPIs, detailed statistics describing what success looks like and even more impressively, subgoals to aim in terms of aquatic environmental preservation. There is a list of achievements such as: preventing and significantly reducing marine pollution of all kinds or sustainably managing and protecting marine and coastal ecosystems;... It is also important to notice that this team did have an unfunded proposal, and now they even started bringing their idea into real life without waiting for funded money. From this, it can be clearly seen that this team is serious about its goals, and I am able to confirm that they have the ability to perform audit exercises at any time.

Generally, this proposal has high potential to reach the challenge setting by on chain gamers, following all of the reasons below: In the first point, the campaign targets game designers and gamers with great campaign details and attractive prizes aligns with big motivation for aimed group. Move to the next reason, this proposal will inherit practical experience from previous similar projects. The team addressed 4 risks with affective solutions-the right amount to invest, change the awareness of artists and gamers to attract them, increasing prizes to push willingness, promote about favorite artists for gamer\u2019s attention. On this part, I would like to know more about the promote strategies, like which channels will be used? Budget for each channel? This will also help to scale and predict the success of this proposal. Furthermore, not only the famous artists can be the influencers, some KOLs can also be the gamer\u2019s inspiration. I suggest the team to consider it for a better promote plan.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "the detailed plan and timelines are quiet matched with each other, I can tell that the team putted lot of effort on the plan.

Information about team members is also clearly listed with qualifications and experience related to the project. All members have enough factors to help contribute to the set goal.

All the stated goals are convincing proofs of a successful project. However, based on all the number of figures, I would like to know more predictions about the number of gamers who will be on chained after the campaign. Plus, I have some confusion about the 2 goals mentioned in the success section, the team aimed at \u201cmore than 50%\u201d and \u201cat least 150 per day (currently between 20 and 40)\u201d, which engagements are those goals target at?

It\u2019s something that\u2019s aligned with the Cardano community and also with the blockchain itself, since it\u2019s a low emission blockchain, which is going to become even more energy efficient over the time. The team says that they will also use the game to bring awareness about Cardano and its benefits, which will benefit the whole community. They developed a system to pay for artists and to split the money 1:1 with the supported projects. Even though, they didn\u2019t explain how the game would work, and why it would be a good investment for the crypto ecosystem, i.e., how players and investors would be incentivised to participate. It mentions the risk a low conversion between awareness and people getting into the game, and they say they expected this to be different with their game, but since they don\u2019t describe how it would work, it\u2019s difficult to evaluate this. To make this proposal better, I\u2019d recommend better explaining how the game works and what would be the incentive for players and investors to participate on this project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Although this is a game proposal, the roadmap doesn\u2019t include anything related to the development of the game itself. Which is not necessarily bad, and in this case it\u2019s clear that they are proposing to create another set of a NFT colletion to incentivize participation, increase awareness and possibly raise money from the sale. With that in mind, the readmap is well explained, dates are well defined and the budget makes sense. Half of the budget of this proposal is for marketing, which is not ideal since it could be better spent if, for example, they ran two campaigns at once, they could advertise them together and double the profits and impact of the proposal. But talking about the proposal\u2019s feasibility, this is not a bad thing. The team seems to have enough experience to execute not only this proposal, but the whole project of World of Pirates.

Here, we are aiming to finance projects that work on the development of games that use our blockchain and the various technologies that the Cardano ecosystem has to offer, because it is undeniable how the gaming industry is extremely relevant and profitable in today's technology sector. The idea here is to promote a project in which artists can create products that would be in NFT format, minted on our blockchain, this NFT would be associated with the larger project World Of Pirates, a game that also aims to raise funds for the maritime cause. I think this fits in a lot of ways with what we are aiming for, as it will help a game that has involvement with Cardano to expand, it will make new people know about NFT and especially our blockchain, as the NFT concept is fine. famous nowadays, and it would also be beneficial for an environmental cause, that is: several advantages in a single project, which achieve different goals of our ecosystem. This project would also help to clarify an issue that is very important: many people think that all types of blobkchain work in the same way, that Cardano has the same development mode as Ethereum, for example, and we know that some cryptocurrencies and blockchain have a negative environmental impact indeed, but this did not happen to our ecosystem, so this project would also be useful to clarify this issue for those who are not yet well informed.

As this is a larger project that is developing smaller projects in parallel, we have 2 projects already happening, from what I understand this third one would happen after the conclusion of them or at least one of them and who would decide these details would be the public. The proposal does not contain a very organized and detailed roadmap on which tasks would make up the whole, but it is possible to have a notion based on the information that was made available. If they were organized in a more linear, temporal and detailed way, it would be even better to visualize the process as a whole. However, we can get a sense of what is to come. Regarding the budget, I think the value is a little high, since it would only be a part of the larger project, an art competition, so I can say, I don't know why the jury payment would need to be 500 dollars, which their formations, what criteria they would use to select the winners and so on. The promotions part would basically take half the asking money, so I think it deserved to be more detailed, what would happen, how, when and by whom. Regarding the team, I think the level of detail is satisfactory, but it could be better, we know who they are and their roles in the project, but a small curriculum of each could have been provided and that could be proven in some way, via linkedin , I do not know.

As it is a project that follows this proposal, it would be interesting if the people who already follow it, members of the Cardano community, could continue this monitoring, establishing a solid bridge between the community and the project team. That way we can get feedback on parts of what's happening, this information can be taken to the rest of us through any of the various community media outlets, such as Town Hall or telegram and discord channels.
