I found the proposed solution is interesting because it tends to focus on Asian and allow player either using mobile or PC platform to play the game, hence it has accessibility compared to other games which most available for PC. Overall, the proposal idea is not new or unique since another proposal in this Gamers On challenge. Therefore, I recommend convincing the funder, the proposal should point out the outstanding features which make them differ from other ideas such as their UX design or the motivation to make gamers choose your game. Moreover, the challenge or risks section may require detail to measure the success and reduce the risks.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Firstly, the proposal is still a draft idea and there will be many features and work to develop a complete version. Regarding the team member, we haven\u2019t got the team information yet. The author described that he had 4 years in project management and vast resource connection in IT, but he didn\u2019t mention any previous gaming works or projects before, so I assume he doesn\u2019t have experience with gaming development or the Cardano ecosystem. To build trust, it is critical to provide a name, positions in the proposal, a summary of previous projects/works, and expertise with the Cardano ecosystem. Secondly, after 9 months, the development of the first level prototype will be launched, but at the same time, the project will still look for a new team member to join.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team is smart when asking for a small budget for each fund. I would recommend explaining how each amount will be spent. For example, the amount offered for character designers will be $6,200, so how many designers will be hired? And are they paid in an hour or monthly? On the other side, the proposal asked for funding for the prototype stage, it should focus on developing prototype detail and the method to measure the progress. However, the proposal expected a successful project is \u201cA successful sale of the founding NFTs and expanding the team!\u201d. Therefore, I believe more information about the successful project can concrete the audibility.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1815", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5968, "q0": "This proposal aims are creating an Anime NFT Game called Gliese 16c. In the IdeaFest video, there\u2019s just a brief explanation about the game itself and how it will look like, so it\u2019s not possible to understand in full how the gameplay is going to be like, the mechanics and objectives. Some more information on this regard could be provided in the proposal text, since it\u2019s not included in details in the IdeaFest video. The main focus of this game is the Asian community, which is, as said, not very involved with the current NFT gaming world, which is mostly western-centric. This is good to increase the gaming community of Cardano in Asia and eastern hemisphere in general. The proposal is well aligned with the challenge, and there are some KPIs to measure the impact of this proposal. The challenges and risks are only briefly mentioned, and there is no real suggestions on how to overcome them or what to do in case of partial failure, for example. I believe the proposal and game idea are good, but the proposal overall should provide more information about the whole project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposing team presents a brief roadmap and milestones for Q2 and Q3+Q4. Is just includes high level milestones, which may be more difficult for the community to keep track of the progress. They\u2019ve also included a Demo and Alpha versions of the game for future development, which is not included in the proposal but it\u2019s a good indication about the direction they are going to - as, for example, they mention they will probably apply for Catalyst funds again for the Demo. The budget included to executing all of this seems to be very short and in my opinion it wouldn\u2019t be enough to deliver the project. Even though, if they\u2019ve included it there, they might already have analyzed it. Also, the proposer mentions that he\u2019s the only one in the team, which is relatively risky in relation to the execution of everything, but it makes more sense related to the budget itself. I\u2019d like to see more information about the proposer and why his background is sufficient to make this happen.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal adds information about the success of the project based on some milestones accomplishments and some KPIs related to the game adoption, which is good to measure it. Although, some information is missing about how the community is going to keep track of the progress before the project is fully delivered. It could, for example, provide monthly reports, an open repository to have the progress visible and other ways to check what\u2019s being done.
