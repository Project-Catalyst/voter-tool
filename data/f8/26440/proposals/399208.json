Above all, you mentioned the future meta-verse of this game and want to create a phenomenon in the blockchain gaming community in order to attract players to the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, developing the game's combos as well as impressive NFT items will also make players more active.\nI am also a gamer and I think this game can grow in the long run and make a significant impact on those who invest in the ADA cryptocurrency.\nThe way you pose problems and explain how to solve them is radical, your game will create a highlight on Cardano's entertainment dApps ecosystem.\nThe way you build missions for players, special items obtained as well as token implementation with many programs like Airdrop for the community, ISPO for ADA holders especially has a big impact and is very necessary. real. I imagine your program will be as successful as Sundae Swap and also have great applicability in the game beyond just buying and selling tokens.\nPlease continue to implement unlimited ideas in your game, it would be great if someone is part of your team, which is a group that is passionate about technology and full of creativity.\nCongratulations and let's make our Cardano ecosystem even more valuable.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Find and read more in this proposal: Your team is from many big tech companies in Japan, I've looked through the linked links of some of your team members: they are from Nikkie, MOBA, IBM, Fortinet - certainly, these are technology companies at the top of the information technology industry. In addition, the members of the project have full functions such as artists, programmers, system engineers, and even the marketing team, this helps to stabilize the human resources for the project when deploying. I also see you have internal support teams like the blockchain engineering team (ADABoys LAB) or a Game Studio behind it. This proposal has a very good preparation of the members involved in the development of this NFT game.\nMoving on to the capital deployment section, the proponent clearly explains the parts that need to be invested: hours for game programming hours, hours for artists, money for game server costs, and technical parts. Other blockchains\u2026\nI have looked carefully in your excel sheet \u201chttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GB107AJq-hHkPF3vNDqTDaOp5IqUlSlKfhRpqAqnvM/edit#gid=0\u201d The figures in the proposal are very accurate.\nThere are many jobs listed by you with small costs, I think you are very modest about applying for capital to develop this project. But from my point of view, the disbursement of your capital completely convinces me and the community to invest in you.\nFinally, in the Roadmap section for this feasibility, it is an overly detailed roadmap for each specific job and time.\nI have to learn from you guys about this detailed planning in future projects, in this proposal I find the development roadmap for this game to be completely reasonable. Ensure tasks are completed within the established timelines.\nThrough analyzing and researching for hours on this proposal from the development team, roadmap, and required funding, I found the proposal to be completely workable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Wooww!! You have ranked TOP 1 and 2 in the community and Voter ratings in this gamers-on-chained section!\nCongratulations on a successful first step for your project.\nI took a closer look at your proposal at Fund7 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383932) and confirmed this.\nIn this fund8, you have said the steps to make and develop very clearly: Design the system, draw game characters, release a test version.\nEspecially the token-nomics design: About the amount and rate of token allocation and each project development item. With 44% tokens for the game's ecosystem, it's great for gamers to discover and exploit it in your game. The time to unlock the token is also quite long with 62 months for the developer team and publisher, this makes your game have a long life and ensures the interests of everyone involved. If it is not inter private plan, I would like you to talk about how to release ISPO to the community and which stake pools participate in this program? But maybe what I think is not necessary since you guys already have a very clear plan and graph for your tokenomics with the marketing team available in extensive collaboration in your gaming community.\nI see that you guys are showing growth and success, I totally agree with this project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1408", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1774, "q0": "How can you do it so well? That's the question that after going through many assessments of others proposals I stopped to comment on this one. You put a very core issue at the heart of this challenge. Create a high-quality NFT game that is both entertaining for the Cardano ecosystem and attracts players and investors by playing to earn. The proposal also mentions integrating the metaverse into the game so that players can creatively experience the space in the game. The solutions are very logical and logical to your game development progress. With the scenario of the game IRONSKY today I am completely convinced: the scene of the game from the earth space to the planets and stars, perhaps a child also dreams of having such an experience, the idea Your game is very attractive it will definitely impact and contribute positively to the Cardano ecosystem.\nEasy-to-measure KPIs like up to 10% of tokens or 100M tokens are released in the fund after funding, which is something I myself am looking forward to and excited about. The number of NFTs and ISPO items and programs are mentioned in the key metrics of this proposal, in addition, the communities and communication channels for it are also actively developed. \nThe risks and risk management problems in your project are listed, the challenges that may be encountered during project development are explained clearly and logically.

The proponent has a clear and timeless vision for his product. I appreciate that. In addition, both short-term and long-term goals are mentioned in the proposal, from completing the basic items of the game system to your first issuance of game tokens. It is the definite result for you to continue to complete your game.\nI've looked closely at your budget request, it's a very detailed breakdown of expenses. The number of servers running on the cloud service with an hourly cost for 6 months of the project is reasonable, I have tested it on https://calculator.aws/#/ with the price of a 16G Linux server as well. priced as proposed. However, in my opinion, it is the lowest price that the author modestly requires capital because it depends on factors such as:\nInstance Types, Region and AZ and also Reserved Instances or On-Demand or spot instances.\nIn general, the capital requirements section is clear and reasonable, I strongly agree with the proposed proposal.\nThe project team is a collection of startup experts with in-depth experience in computer technology and internet-based content. You have a wonderful team of specialized skills for the development of this project.\nThe role of each member is well described and assigned to small teams with their right experience and skills, this is the right person, what I see as a professional in the work. Above all, those members are easily authenticated with their personal links and also where they are working. You are showing a very high level of successful project execution.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "You use a variety of tools to track progress and manage your project, showing that the project is well prepared for its development. SCRUM, Ho-ren-so, and Microsoft Project Management are all good tools and processes to help manage the progress of technology projects in a methodical and scientific manner.

The more I read it, the more interesting and engaging it is, as a space fiction novel.\nGame players experience many different branches of the game with 6 consecutive scenarios (AURORA, LUNA, SOLAR, STARS, GALAXY, UNIVERSE)\nYou guys surprised me with the depth of this game, it's definitely what I would expect from a game on the Cardano ecosystem. Especially the NFTs, items and rewards that make your game even more attractive to players.\nThe proposal directly impacts ADA holders as well as existing gamers who want to migrate to the Cardano ecosystem in search of new experience opportunities.\nWith the 3 modules that you are designing such as Play to Earn, Playing Free, Play to Earn goto Travel, I'm sure it will make more players join your game. Your team is very clever in implementing game ideas that benefit everyone involved.\nThe summary of this section proposes to meet the criteria in the challenge set, attract players, create benefits for the community, and be highly entertaining, create liquidity for ADA ... Because of all of that, I fully support you to further develop the next stages of this IRONSKY game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A very important item that not many proposals do is that you have a clear and transparent budget breakdown of expenditures in your project. Details of disbursement for small jobs are listed as System Design including parts (Server system, network, security, cloud services ..) cost is: $3,200 similar to Game Design items: (Game content, UI, game-mechanics, game-token..) Block-chain developer: (Build code NFT, Token, integrated in-game, staking, framing ..)\nOr as the speaker about the $0 tax item is (supported by our government for entertainment content & IT Start-Up)\nIt's great with details like that, it helps those who vote for the project to know the right spending and enough development items of the game.\nBesides your two the Plan and Budget sections above, the project development team is also very impressive. With many members working in the technology industry and in many advanced countries and many years of experience.\nI see this as a development team with a good mindset and global vision. Members in different areas of expertise can take on the role of each person in each category of the project. System engineers, cloud computing, software engineers, artists, block-chain engineers, marketing teams\u2026 are really needed to develop a game project like this IRONSY. \nBehind that is a team of leading experts in technology and cyber-security, you are fully qualified to develop projects, wish you success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As if you have grasped all the milestones to be achieved in the project, you have listed many important indicators to be able to track the progress of the game development such as:\nThe number of tokens to be issued; The number of NFTs generated; The number of members in our gaming community; The number of ADA wallets registered in the game; The number of players and game downloads\u2026yes, I see these as the key indicators to achieve the certain success of the project.\nAnother thing is that you apply the project development process by SCRUM method, I appreciate you in this regard. It really should be teams that work together for a long time and grow, the SCRUM process will help you promote that. I have consulted a lot of data on the implementation of technology projects, the SCRUM process is quite convenient, the response is fast in groups of 10 people like yours.\nThe game's token deployment is very balanced and ensures your game ecosystem and focus on game content.\nIndeed, you have achieved certain achievements in FUND 7 such as\n- It has been ranked TOP #1 in the rating by assessment of Community Advisors.\nand TOP #2 with ~97% voted YES for the IRONSKY GAME proposal - I think it's an excellent result.\nOn top of that, the collaboration you are willing to share to grow together for the Cardano ecosystem.\nKeep these successes in Fund8.

A space game with specially designed spaceships with unique NFTs attached to items. This game brings players to very attractive space scenarios through the levels that the author has scripted for it. The game is like a spaceship war genre, surely this game will attract many players to participate especially those who are ADA holders who are lacking in apps and games on the Cardano platform. to experience. The proposal also explains the player's tasks in the game, which is necessary so that the player can imagine what they need to do when they enter the game. An engine of the game is described very fully as well as divided into 3 distinct playable models to be able to experience and learn gameplay for beginners.\nI really like the \"Play to Earn goto Travel\" mechanism, it makes me want to play and accumulate points so that I can exchange them for travel trips somewhere that I can use to pay, you guys have designed the game mechanics very well. Smart and full of creativity.\nThe indicators and KPIs mentioned in the proposal, such as token airdrop programs, token issuance, and the number of issues are clearly written down or ISPO for ADA holders. The potential risks to the proposal such as Funds may arrive late or less than expected, affecting resources for the project; Some stages are not ready for support from the Cardano blockchain for the game in the future; Negative influence from the cryptocurrency market.\nHas been given by the author with solutions when encountering those problems. It is true that the cryptocurrency market is always volatile and working with crypto-funded projects is also a risky venture. I believe the group of proponents are knowledgeable about market technology and its related issues. Your game creation also promotes and has a great impact on the Cardano ecosystem making sustainability and adding liquidity to ADA coin a great advantage of the project. Above all, I congratulate you very well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is extremely detailed and complete. That is the explanation of your budget: Game design, System design, Artist, marketing, game server programming .. all are calculated with small costs and Obviously, this makes investors feel secure with the money they invest in your game. Make sure you have very detailed financial planning to develop this game IRONSKY. I just wonder why the 10% tax but you guys don't ask for this part of the fund, looking closely, I see clearly that there is tax support = 0$ for startups like you. We are very excited and hope more teams like you join Catalyst soon to get this benefit from your proposal.\nThe team that developed this game, I actually saw your team members, they are IT experts, Marketing experts, artists, programmers, and even leaders. community. This is a strong team with enough skills to develop this project. You also have the technical expertise behind the Cardano blockchain project. I have seen the projects for sale in your game studio along with the YouTube channels. It has a lot of games that you guys have made, I really enjoyed the games you guys showed. The special thing is that your couple has diverse skills and the game project needs this variety and experience. It is recommended to separate teams that specialize in each role in project development. What's also great is that behind the main members of the project you are always linked with teams that specialize in the community. This is essential to promote your game to help reach gamers. And forming that community of players is also a core value in my opinion. Because for a game to come to market it will need to have a large community in it. In this topic, I also see that when you have very talented and international visionaries, they have worked in many countries with different roles such as IT specialist, Start-up, Expert network security.\nYou guys have planned a very detailed and clear game development plan, the milestones include the quarters in 2022 along with the tasks to be completed recorded in the roadmap. I've read it carefully and it makes sense, from the task of game design, system design, token building, to testing, everything is bulleted and clearly stated. So you guys have determined step by step to do your tasks in this proposal. I see the short and long term phases of the game's development, respectively, as a result of the project's milestones like releasing the beta game, continuing to work on parts of the 3-4-5 game, continuing to develop the game's functions, and building an ecosystem in the game, including plans to release ico, ido. This has been determined and clearly stated by you, I appreciate your work schedule, really this is a proposal that the team can completely succeed with such great factors as above.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The tokenomics design of this proposal is very good in my opinion, it is an important milestone in the blockchain game genre. The development team holds a moderate share of 23%, the community service team and in-game media is 10% which will help your game be enjoyed by the player community and benefit the supporters. friends from the Catalyst community. Here the proposal also provides a graph of token release and unlocking over time, which is very transparent and intuitive for your investors and gamers. I support this transparency.\nIt is proposed to introduce APIs to track the success of each part of the entire game project. Along with that is a very detailed project development process, it explains each role and task of the team involved in the development. You must be very dynamic software engineers to apply this scrum process with time rotating in the game-making process. You also appreciate the cooperation in the community for the purpose of developing the game ecosystem on Cardano.

Too great isn't it? It is true that in today's world, technology is very friendly to daily life, human needs are always met.\nI think your ideas are helping many people beyond Cardano. What I feel impressed with your proposal is a perfect game scenario, from stars, planets to cosmic galaxies, it is suitable for developing and applying Metaverse technology to this game. Of course, you are focusing on a high-quality game genre and attracting many players to Cardano, that impact is very positive and works well for ADA holders like me. Thank you for that. The proposal describes in great detail the game mechanics, gameplay, player tasks, in-game scenes, game features, and NFT items.., proving that the authors are experienced people. game development. Milestones and KPIs are also mentioned, completely recognizable and measuring the success of the game and each stage of development. I am particularly interested in the ISPO plan of this proposal. As a CA who is also an ADA lover, I think ISPO is an attractive place to start projects on Cardano. The proposal is of great concern to the community and is useful for the expansion of the Cardano ecosystem. The author mentioned the risks of the crypto market that could affect the project but I find that to be the case for the whole market, what Cardano excels at is having a strong backer community that always ensures trust in their organization as well as keeping up to date with the technology for the development of the Cardano blockchain.

In the previous fund, this makes perfect sense. Coming to a total capital cost requirement of $54,050 is a number I completely agree with, I think those who voted for you also understand my analysis of this project's budget.\nYou guys have an excellent team of developers, I see it as the top tech experts assembled.

The proposal to clearly explain the role of each sub-team in the project undertakes their own specialized work, which aligns with their skills, which is remarkable for the management. Moreover, the proposal is to cooperate and build specialized teams of workers in their groups such as collaborating with the media team, building a blockchain technical team, and also developing the community.

I know that the SCRUM process is an advanced process for software development teams, which requires continuous teamwork such as discussion, presentation, assignment, testing, evaluation meeting, product deployment. \u2026\nI find that the author of the proposal has chosen this tool for game development to be great, a very active and engaged game studio. The success metrics in each phase of the project are indicated with numbers like tokens releases, NFT releases, game downloads\u2026 so many that I won't list them all, these are important and easy to measure KPIs.\nOne thing that is more thorough is that the proposal presented the Tokens implementation plan, which is very complete and complete of gameplay to earn. I have looked at the files (https://bit.ly/3KKiqQ9) your token design and confirm this 44%Tokens for the game ecosystem. It's a really cool game and has a lot of content worth the wait.

IRONSKY Surely this is a good and attractive game that will attract gamers to this Cardano ecosystem, where, as you said, there is a lack of entertainment applications. The way you create a Marketplace and build items to trade on it is necessary and reasonable that will create value for your entire game system. It is the right solution to execute this project. In addition, the same KPIs that are clearly given are:\nDistributing about 10%-20% of game tokens through the following programs:\n\nAirdrop tokens for gamers and the community.\nISPO for ADA holders who are interested in the game.\nPerform marketing and distribution for partners of the game.\nI find it also beneficial to the Cardano community that ADA holders can participate in these programs.\nIn parallel with the implementation of the above smart solutions, the risks and challenges of this proposal are also mentioned specifically, even the risks of the cryptocurrency market are shown in relation to each other. regarding the project.

Don't worry about that, I read many projects and make sure a lot of information that the salary for your team is the lowest on this catalyst. How can I say this? I see you have great professionals in the tech industry using their brains for Catalyst and I wish it were.\nWith such a team of experienced and diverse skills, the problem of developing this project is completed within the plan without seeing many obstacles. I have looked at some Github resources of the members of the development team, who are indeed very senior and highly qualified software engineers.

Most of them are still under development and only few have successfully launched so far. In addition, few Metaverses are now being developed on Cardano but all of them are quite far from being released. This proposal states that the Cardano community needs to keep up with other blockchain ecosystems to attract new gamers and investors. Otherwise, it would lose its competitiveness in the gaming field. The team addresses this with their proposal. \n\nWith their P2E NFT game, the team wants to attract more gamers to the ecosystem. Since it is free to play, the entry barrier is quite low. Nevertheless, the gamer can hunt for items and sell them or exchange them for other items. Although it is free to play, the game seems to be aimed at gamers with blockchain experience. I come to this conclusion because several elements of the game involve staking, trading and farming of in game tokens and ADA. Traditional gamers with no knowledge about blockchain systems could have trouble finding their way around the game. \n\nThe story sounds fascinating, and it shows that the team has put much effort into it. The different game phases that are outlined in the proposal indicate the game\u2019s complexity (in a good way!). This could potentially attract blockchain gamers (from other platforms) who have high demands and want an exciting, challenging and yet enjoyable story.\n\nOverall, the proposal aligns well with the challenge.
