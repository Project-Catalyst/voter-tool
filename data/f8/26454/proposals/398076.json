I will explain my opinion. The project is about creating, as the authors conceptualize a \u201cplatform integrates third-party applications, merchants, online e-commerce stores and famous staking engine.\u201d In short, it would be an application to carry out financial transactions in cryptocurrencies, built on the Cardano blockchain. So far so good, it would be a big project using the technologies of our ecosystem, which is a positive point. Content, two things strike me as a problem here. To begin with, at no point in the proposal do the authors mention India, as this project could help, especially its population. The objectives of the present challenge are to promote projects that help the inhabitants of India, whether through increased interaction between the inhabitants of India and Catalyst, proposals submitted by Indians, dapps being built by them, etc. Will this platform have any focus on Indian users? Are the team members native there (from what I've seen, no)? So I don't understand why it was submitted in this challenge, it would make more sense if it was launched in the Dapps challenge, for example, where we seek to fund applications that use our blockchain to promote innovative ideas beneficial to people and to Cardano. Another point that worries me is that this platform, despite being built on Cardano, would facilitate transactions in several currencies, as stated in the proposal, including Ethereum, a very strong currency. In a way, we have to focus on Ada, our pools, the plutus developers and everything that says about Cardano only, and not benefit other cryptos and blockchains. Do you understand that I don't think it's worth it for Cardano to fund something that will ultimately help other cryptocurrencies to expand? Because of these problems, I think the proposal is not a good option for funding, at least in the way it was presented and in the challenge of India. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "That part of the proposal was presented very inappropriately, unfortunately. Starting with the script: there is no schedule to be followed, we don't know what the phases of the project would be, what would happen at each stage, which tasks would be done per month, by whom and how long they would last. For this part of the project to be satisfactory, he would need to provide this script. At one point in the proposal he says this phase of the project would last 4 to 6 months. What would happen each month? How long would these things last? Without a roadmap, we have no way of understanding the process of developing and building this project; therefore, this part of the proposal is overlooked. There is also no explanation of the funding requested, it is an extremely high value, 150k, we would need a very detailed explanation to know what is the need for so much money. This amount should be detailed as follows: informed of the salaries of the professionals involved (from what I saw there is only 1, but I will comment on that in a moment), how much would go towards other expenses such as legal licenses, marketing, etc. And each part of that should be very well detailed and justified in order to argue the amount of 150k. As we are told, we don't have any information about this part and that makes it very complicated to bet such a high amount on uncertainties. And finally, speaking of the team, as I said, there is only one person in the team description, which would be the bidder himself, which is extremely worrying. How would one person be able to carry out a project of this size alone? Due to the complexity, I would like to know how this professional would perform all the tasks necessary for the success of the project without anyone's help. It is more than necessary for him to establish a complete team, delegating activities based on their backgrounds. It would also be necessary for him to present himself better, there is not much confidence in his connection with the Cardano ecosystem, I would like him to talk about examples of previous work and prove this through some linkedin profile, for example. The rest of the team would also need to be properly introduced; ie their names, roles in the project, a small CV and how they relate to Cardano. Therefore, unfortunately the viability of this project is very low and needs a total revision. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proponent does not give good coverage on how to analyze the project. He doesn't set specific goals to be achieved, what he says in the notion of success are similar to what we read in the impact part, for what purpose this application would be created. For this part of the proposal to be satisfactory, it would be necessary that: direct and easy-to-measure goals were established, so that we could verify the notion of success quantitatively; more subjective but not abstract goals, such as the impacts of this project on the Cardano ecosystem, in order to carry out a qualitative analysis. Due to the complexity and technical nature of the project, it would be appropriate for the proponent to establish direct and constant contact with some members of the ecosystem who are from the areas of knowledge involved in developing the project. Through this contact, partial results could be analyzed and disseminated to the Cardano community. It's not enough to analyze the results, in my view, we also need to monitor the project development process, as this one doesn't have a schedule, it's also very complicated to do that. If a roadmap was detailed as I explained in the feasibility topic, we could follow the progress of steps, the development of tasks and so on. So unfortunately this is yet another topic that I will give a low grade, I suggest that the proponent review their evaluation, considering my observations and also those of other CAs who evaluate their proposal, so that it is more suitable and more valid to be funded on Catalyst. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1038, "q0": "I do not agree that the proposal addresses the challenge effectively, I do not believe that the Cardano ecosystem in India will improve considerably thanks to this proposal, taking into account that it integrates the Ethereum and Aurora blockchains as well.
