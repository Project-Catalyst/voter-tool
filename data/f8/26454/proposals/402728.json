In summary, the proponent wants to promote a series of actions that aim to introduce the Cardano ecosystem to the inhabitants of India. According to him, the adoption of new technologies is slower in this country due to the cultural and language diversity present in it. I would like him to explain how this exact point would be overcome - would the content produced be translated into different languages? How would these contents dialogue with such a diverse audience, respecting everyone's particularities and making knowledge accessible to different groups? Regarding the activities that are developed, there will be in general 3: the \"weekly meetings in Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad / Social Works\", and the use of the following platforms - \"Virtual platform for events - KonmaVerse\" and \"Communication platform - Tribe Cardano India in Konmahood\u201d. What I think should have been better explained is how these face-to-face meetings would take place. We know where they would be, however: what subjects would be addressed, exactly? I believe that at first, these are introductory subjects regarding the Cardano ecosystem, such as \u201cwhat is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies and what is Cardano and Catalyst\u201d. However, it would be necessary for the author to make this issue very explicit. Without knowing the exact topics that will be covered, we cannot clearly visualize what these events will be like. We also don't know how many people he seeks to bring together by meeting and how they will be captivated to participate, as apparently blockchain technology and Cardano are still little-known subjects in the country. The proponent could also have explained in more detail what the online activities would look like on the two aforementioned platforms, we know that the intention is to keep event participants and interested parties connected, however, would only conversation chats be created or would something else be done there? We know the target audience of the project, but it would be interesting, as I said, for the proponent to clarify how he will make them aware and persuade them to participate in these meetings and virtual spaces. It is positive how, right from the impact, the proponent tells us which KPIs are targeted for the project, as this generates a sense of purpose that is very useful from the beginning, that is, we know what will be done and for what it will be done. It is also positive how he foresees possible difficulties and ways to overcome them, which demonstrates a lot of planning in relation to the context. Therefore, I think the proposal makes a lot of sense with this challenge, as it would certainly help in the popularization of Cardano, generating benefits for both our blockchain and the local community. My only observation is really the need to better specify the subjects that would be discussed at the meetings. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I don't think the project roadmap is at an adequate level of detail. In general, we know that the last two weeks of April would be devoted to \u201cEvent Planning, Appointment and Training of Ground Teams (Event Organizers and Moderators) and Release of Calendar for Events and Marketing\u201d. However, it would be necessary for each of these activities to be well explained, because the rest of the script corresponds only to the dates of the face-to-face and virtual meetings. How would the events be planned? We have many things at stake here during pre-production, such as: defining a speaker (if any), defining what topics will be addressed at each meeting, how long the meetings will last, how people will be persuaded to participate, if there will be any type of dynamic so that there is more public engagement, if there will be awards in these dynamics, which awards, if there will be a time for networking, if there will be food... Anyway, there are many factors to be combined, this part of the planning should be better explained . Regarding the appointment and training of staff, this should also be detailed, how will the staff be trained, and who will train them? The budget is also explained in a somewhat superficial way. We know that the amount spent per event will be 700 dollars, but it is not defined why that price would be; we know that moderates will receive $100 per event, but we don't know what they would do and how many hours they would work before, during, and after the events; and 6800 dollars will be earmarked for marketing and public relations, but it is not detailed how the marketing will be done, for example, what strategies will be adopted and by what means this campaign will be publicized. As it is presented to us, the budget explanation is very basic, not being able to generate full understanding. Regarding the team, it's a duo, I would like as much information to be provided about Fred Jonathan as there was about Sathya Vijayan. Ideally, for both of them there would be a small curriculum explaining previous work, it would also be important for them to clarify how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. It's positive how they attach their linkedin profiles, because there we can see in practice some of the experiences they've had so far. Anyway, I think the feasibility is ok, but there are points to be really improved. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponents give a lot of information that can be used as a way to monitor the project development process, I believe it was lacking to clarify how this information would be taken to the Cardano community. Would monthly reports be prepared with partial results included? Would online and collaborative tools be created, where bidders would periodically post updates and the community would have access to check what changed from time to time? There are several ways to establish this bridge, either through the community's own communication channels (such as telegram and discord) or through online tools such as Notion, Miro, Medium and etc. It is necessary that direct contact be established between the proponents, their tasks and the Cardano community. In addition to knowing if the goals for a certain period of time were reached, we also need to understand if the pair worked properly, that is, if they fulfilled all the tasks that were planned for that period of time, if there were problems and how they were overcome, etc. . Regarding the final results, I found the visualization of the success scenario to be correct, but superficial. The desire here is \u201cto see a community of India actively participating in the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst and taking on various roles as CAs, proponents and voters\u201d. However, how could all this be perceived, how would such information be monitored and how would it become known to the Cardano community? I think proponents need to outline ways to verify such a scenario, prove that such impacts really happened through real life examples, maybe even some project participants could join us and we could all talk after Town Hall, to deeply understand that consequences this project generated. So I think the auditability of the project is ok, as is the feasibility, but it needs more detail on how the information would reach the Cardano community and more detailed explanations on how the success scenario would be perceived in real life. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 511, "q0": "This proposal clearly relates itself to the challenge of needed more local presence and Cardano community in India.\n\nTheir proposal to hold 12 live AND virtual events over 3 months, in 3 local cities, is totally aligned with the goals of this campaign. \nIt's not clear if the proposers are really thinking \"beyond\" the three months of events and meetups, but three months of successful localized events would indeed be a success unto itself. If the events are successful, we can assume or hope that there will be some grass-roots energy to carry the effort forward. These proposers have done a really good job of explaining their plan such as it is, and ideally I would like to hear more about how they think future sustainability of the meetups could look.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skills and experience of the organizers seems right on the nose for this effort. Perhaps most significantly, they have already hosted a couple of India events, they have contracted with at least one physical venue, and an online platform for virtual events. I give high marks for proven success, which gives me great confidence in their ability to do more of the same.\nThe budget is clearly broken down for event cost and paying the organizers, and the numbers seem sufficient and reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand even more about your experience and ability to deliver, I would love to hear more about what happened at the events you already hosted: Who presented and what was the topic? How many people attended and what was their feedback? What did you learn from those experiences that you will apply to this proposed effort?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap for planning and hosting 12 events over three months is clear and makes sense to me. The key metrics for measuring attendance and participation make perfect sense for this project, and are extremely well-aligned with the challenge. I assume that the team would be reporting directly to Project Catalyst leadership, of course, but I would like to understand better if and how you will report back to the community, like if there is a website or some other public-facing platform where we can learn about your work.

There is a clear structure on how this project can be realized. It's good to build a social media platform where people can work together. This also creates a community that can keep growing. The accessibility of the event location has been taken into the proposel.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is clearly described with the corresponding link. The people involved in this project have relevant experiences and skills. The budget is limited. There is no plan in the proposal stating what will happen if there is not enough money to carry it out. The timetable for achieving this is good. In this proposal it would be useful to share the exact locations. There is nothing in the proposal about how they are going to get new people excited about this project. It would also be useful to write approximately how many people have to cooperate in order to give this prospects for the future. The makers know what the risks are. It is useful to make a kind of reserve list that people can subscribe to. These people will therefore have to be screened.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Various KPIs have been drawn up to monitor the project. No forward-looking vision has been made about how it will proceed if this is a huge success and there are too few places for people who would be interested. I think this project has a chance of success if many more community gatherings take place over a larger part of India. The idea is certainly good to involve the population in this project. There are very many talented people in India who could make a great contribution. If this project is successful, it will first have to become very large to really have an impact. India consists of 1.38 billion inhabitants. In order to have a major impact here, many of these community gatherings will have to take place.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1606", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5131, "q0": "India being a major tech hub, there is a lack of awareness about the Cardano ecosystem and how one can get involved. Therefore, this proposal comes up with a solution about creating an avenue for enthusiasts to meet in person on a regular interval, build relationships & get involved in the Cardano ecosystem.

There is a good reasoning why the three locations where choosed and why it will add value to the Cardano Ecosystem. While the cohice of location was as local technology hubs the target market does not does not mentioned tech people - could have been good to mention it as it is an important target market for the ecosystem. Creating a local hub and meetups is inline with the challenge and the key matric and goals are outlined in the challenge setting. However the challange KPIs are more directly related to projects in catalyst and the proposal KPIs focus more on KPIs around the event and only partially how it will impact projects on catalyst. In the execution, I will recommend focusing more on this point to comply with the challenge goals and it could be part of the future plan.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team already started to work and created a few events according to the proposal.

For example, what does it mean \u201ca good turnout\u201d?  \n \nThe proposer provides a very description about them and LinkedIn profile which is for 2 proposers, provide basic information only. However, the proposal is led by Konma and linktree shows the various needed information and links. It could have been good adding it in team section and mention that all the 3 memebrs are related to Konma. Another thing that is missing is the involvement of the team with Catalyst as could help to assess also the relevance of the meetups to Catalyst. As an active member of Catalyst we know at times it could be complicated to newcomers and your involvement in the community will be important to facilitate info and link to new commers. Connecting also to other communities such as Catalyst school could be a plus.    \n \nThe budget is broken down clearly into 3 main categories but in my view missing some more specificaiotn. For example marketing and PR represent +40% of the budget but with no specificaoitns and especially as the KPIs does not have as well specific number targets it makes it difficult to asses if the budget is reaosnable or not. \nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work.

The proposer mentioned that the main two areas of seeing the impact of this project are that as they create awareness in the various ways explained in the proposal, more participants will become proposers, community advisors and voters from India; the second is that as a result of the growth in participants the community will become strong with many potentials in the locations mentioned above, with a large number of tech enthusiasts and startups to grow Cardano in India.
