Hence translating the contents of Cardano into the regional languages would reach a lot more people than expected and also be appreciated for translating as they can learn from their comfort language.

In addition, India has about 5 million employees working in the IT industry, which is a good resource for Cardano's growth. The proposal also offers a well-prepared plan and content. It has been divided into sections and chapters very clearly such as: Content creation; accessibility and communication and promotion channels. In addition to translating, they also plan to conduct advertising campaigns in the media and newspapers. They also mentioned some possible risks, but did not identify measures to reduce risks.

The proposer also mentioned that KPI of 100 people in 4 months in the communication channels, if we divide it per language it is 20, what will be the numbers in 6 months?
