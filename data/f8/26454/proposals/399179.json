It can be very well summarized in the following excerpt: \u201cConvert plastic waste for reuse, improve sustainability, reduce CO2 emissions and commercialize Carbon Credits in the Cardano Ecosystem\u201d. The proponents intend to create a Hub whose target audience is Indians and the main activity is recycling, with the aim of transforming the linear economy into a circular economy, which avoids the burning (hence, the generation of pollution) of waste that could be reused. The proposal is clearly very beneficial for India, as it will act in the environmental cause, helping this country to be more sustainable. However, it is not clear how this project would benefit the Cardano ecosystem, I read the entire proposal carefully and I still don't understand it very well. It is said that the carbon credit would be traded in our ecosystem. But first, what is a carbon credit? And how would that relate to Cardano's technologies? What transactions would be minted on our blockchain, would Ada be used to trade these carbon credits? Would NFTs be generated somehow? Unfortunately, I do not consider the impact of this proposal to be clear for our ecosystem, I am sure about the beneficial consequences that the project would have for the country, and this is one of the things to be taken into account when thinking about whether the proposal aligns with the specific objectives of the challenge; however, we would also need to be sure in what ways this would all be interesting for Cardano, how it would help our blockchain gain more visibility and investment. Because of this very fundamental issue, I do not consider that the impact of the proposal is clear and, therefore, I am not confident in saying that it is in line with what is requested here. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I do not consider the proposal's roadmap to be adequate. We know, through an extensive explanation, what would happen in the next months of the project's development. However, the problem is that the temporal notion is too abstract. Starting with the fact that the proponents say that these activities can take, together, from 3 to 6 months to materialize. One time interval is twice the other, so I wonder why such a large variation. Regardless of how many months the process as a whole takes, it would be important for proponents to be more specific about the timing of the script. By this I mean that it is critical that the time intervals are at least in months, that is, what would happen in month 1, month 2 and so on. In fact, the ideal is that there was a greater degree of detail, that the proponents, in addition to determining what would happen in each month, specify what would happen in the weeks of those months. Therefore, in my view, the script is superficial, even though they have described many activities to be carried out. Regarding the team, this part of the feasibility is great, we know the names of those involved and a lot of information about them, a small curriculum by which we can understand what their past experiences were. All, with the exception of Prem Philip, make their linkedin profiles available, which is very positive as it allows us to see in practice a conformation of the information given. It would have been better if everyone had made this link available, but maybe Prem doesn't have linkedin (I would like this to be clarified). That is, in relation to the team, trust is passed on, they seem to be able to successfully carry out the project. Finally, speaking of the budget, the team provides a link that theoretically should detail how the requested money would be used. But when I entered, there was nothing about this proposal, the content of the link actually refers to other proposals. We have no idea how the requested money would be used, so on this unfortunately no trust is passed on as we have no information. I believe that this failure is serious and profoundly compromises the viability of the proposal. The only part that I found adequate was the presentation of the team, the others (mainly the budget) being necessary for a revamp. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The ways to audit progress are very superficial, proponents claim that an online hub will be built first. Okay, but how could the Cardano community monitor this? The link to the online Hub is provided, however the roadmap is not very specific, we know what needs to happen but not when it would happen, so a proper audit of this part of the proposal is also not possible. Proponents say that \"success will be measured by the number of individuals attracted and geographic coverage by the number of hubs formed\", but again, I don't see clear ways in which the Cardano community could verify this data. I think that in order to properly monitor the construction part of this project, there would have to be ways to audit the tasks and the partial results, not just the goals. Therefore, I consider that the audit of the process is quite inadequate. Now, talking about the end results, the success scenario, basically there are no specific goals, measurable objectives. The said information is extremely abstract, unfortunately the proponents do not define KPIs, metrics, quantitative and qualitative data that make it possible to safely monitor the project. We don't know how to measure the consequences of all this for India or Cardano. In other words, I think that this part of the proposal left a lot to be desired, the proponents do not provide enough and adequate information so that we could follow neither the development nor the results of this project; In my opinion, this topic would need to be completely reformulated to be satisfactory. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7710, "q0": "Having an impact-driven Hub is a good idea. As through it, you attract people for a purpose and therefore they might be ready to hear more info and get engaged. It took me a few reads to try and understand the proposal. The problem statement is more part of the solution, I would consider rephrasing differently, saying for example it is difficult to engage new people with out a \u2018hook\u2019 (as described in the proposal).  Also, it is not clear how the solution statement is related to the problem or to the hub \u201cTo convert plastic wastes for reuse, improve sustainability, reduce CO2 emissions & trade Carbon Credit on the Cardano Ecosystem.\u201d and how this is relate to the challenge. \n \nIn the Impact area, the solution is a bit more elaborated but still confusing to understand the connection between the hub, the Tamil Nadu (the second largest plastic waste generator in India), and how it is going to reduce Carbon or achieve the key matrics mentioned in the proposal. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings.\nHowever, are you looking to the KPIs is relation to plastic and Carbon or in general, so how it is being related to each other? For exmaple \u201cIncreased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects\u201d relate to plastic or in general?\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has a fund 7 funded related proposal, and according to the proposal it is mentioned that they already started the work.

The video shared also provide a lot of info about the vision of the services it is going to offer but it is not clear how and the direct relation to this proposal; I do understand that hubs are teh center of the two, but from my experience as an entrepneure for many years focus is important and more clear specific details will be helpful for success.   \n\nGreat team with evidence (references, links, etc.) of experience needed to implement the proposal is provided, It would have been good to know who is based in India and how it connect to the local hub activities. \n\nThe link provided to the budget does not go to the budget and therefor not possible to evaluate this part. https://gerolamo.org/our-projects/fund-8-proposals-and-data \n\nThe timetable is species as \u201cActivities over the next 3 to 6 months will include\u201d, could have been good to have a more specific roadmap with monthly activities.

As mentioned under the Impact section, the problem and solution could be better explained to give confidence about the plan and focus and to be ale to audit it accordingly. \nBased on my experience, I would recommend to provide more details about the inidia hub, how it related to Carbon (as it mentioned in the problem) and specific timelines and KPIs, this would have make the audit by the community easier also during the proposal implementation.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_636", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3082, "q0": "The intention is to establish a few Cardano Community Hubs that are concerned with the environment (sustainability, CO2 emissions). These Hubs would be set up in certain areas where a lot of waste is produced. If enough Hubs can be built, this project can certainly have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. The difficulty will be to get enough people involved in this project. It's good that a few important metrics like actually built apps, number of submissions have been taken into account. One future challenge has been taken into account and that is the size of the country. You can also include the approach related to the language barrier.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team working on this project has been funded in FUND 7 to establish a Cardano Community Hub.

Listed are some of the other projects the team wants to do. There is no budget so it is difficult to have an idea if there is enough money. The time span is very unclear to me. It says 3 to 6 months. I think this is a very big difference in time. Is there enough budget for 6 months? The technical aspects are not defined in the proposal.

Or even make the bridge between recycliclers and cooperatives and people from Cardano, so this problem could be tackled along side with local communities.

The amount of funds this proposal is too much in my opinion because it does not help the Cardano community in India. The proposed solution in the beginning doesn't align with other stated Goals.
