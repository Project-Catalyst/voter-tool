Hence translating the contents of Cardano in Assamese would reach a lot more people than expected and also be appreciated for translating into Assamese.

In all other respects they are essential the same. Hence it is almost impossible to write 19 distinct assessments, I have tried to find specific differentiators but have also looked at the package of proposals as a whole as, I believe, this will add greater value to the voter. Looking at this specific proposal for translating videos into Assamese, it largely meets the challenge brief in seeking to broaden the horizons of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposer should be praised for taking the initiative. I would suggest the proposer uses the comments section to explain voters their rationale behind this multi-proposal approach. That should help with transparency and help people make an informed decision. For example: Are they looking for voters to decide on which languages they prefer thus restricting the choice to the existing community. This kind of defeats the purpose of reaching out to new communities. If this is the case I have done a rudimentary research on number of people speaking each language to help the voters make an informed decision. Given more time, an in depth analysis of demographics would be useful showing current literacy levels, access to technology, levels of education, English speakers, etc in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Assamese ranks bottom so maybe not the highest priority? 1.Hindi:615M 2.Bengali:265M 3.Urdu:170M 4.Punjabi:126M 5.Marathi:95M 6.Telugu:93M 7.Tamil:81M 8.Gujarati:61M 9.Kannada:56M 10.Bhojpuri:50M 11.Odia:38M 12.Malayalam:38M 13.Sinhala:17M 14.Nepali :17M 15.Assamese:15M Where the voter needs to pay particular attention is the entirety of the ask.

In simple terms we are looking at a total ask of $135,900 of which $38,000 (28%) is contingency. At a proposal level that is $7100 budget with $2000 contingency. My project planning head immediately points to the 28% contingency. It is not clear what this is set aside for. A risk of ADA price fluctuation is noted in the proposals, however one of the proposed mitigations for that is a 10% contingency, the other being to sell funds privately to ADA holders. In addition the proposals states \u201cWe have ample resources to complete the project on time and within budget\u2019, once again raising the question on the need for such a large contingency in proportion to the budget? Now looking at what is to be delivered. Each proposal states the YouTube channel will be launched with 6 videos. We have to assume that means 6 videos translated in all 19 languages should they all be funded. After 3 months 10-20 videos (each translated in 19 languages) That gives us 380 translations in total at an average of 4 per day. I have run this by someone with experience in this area and their reaction was \u2018its going to need a considerable team\u2019. So, let\u2019s look at the evidence of a team with the skills to deliver this proposal. The proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator. Specific languages are not mentioned so very difficult to validate of if they have the skills for this specific proposal Two other individuals are listed, their LinkedIn in profile are well populated but don\u2019t display the skills required to deliver this project. That leave us with the \u201cextensive network of Master translators\u201d. Again no evidence of their existence of previous work exists so impossible to evaluate. I believe the proposer has a lot to offer the ecosystem and can suggest the following: 1. Help the voter understand the need for 19 similar proposals 2. Provide evidence that they have access to the skills required 3. Look at a small scope with a set of languages he or Muthiah are comfortable with. Use this as a POC on both the translation and engagement side. SHOW the community this proposal is growing adoption. 4. Take the learnings (e.g. which types of video are interesting your audience) and if a larger (multi language) proposal is what is required submit it in a future fund leveraging in the economies of scale that will naturally provide on the maintenance of socials, contingency & marketing.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The metrics are sensible in terms of measuring engagement on youtube which is a great basic piece to measure. However to really get to the crux of the challenge we need to see the conversion rates into Cardano and/or Catalyst \u2022 increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects \u2022 Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions \u2022 Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_45", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\n\nThis has to be filtered out.  So many reasons..\nCombining into one proposal may make sense to this proposer who may not be from India and recognize the huge diversity from state to state or region to region. All languages cannot be done by same people or same social media campaign.  This is why we broke up. Smaller proposals enable people to clearly see we are not here to grab money.   Each language needs its unique Social media campaign to reach people.  We cannot lump everything into one.  This assessor clearly if from India is of a tech back ground, knows English and Hindi and thinks everyone in the country speaks Hindi and ENglish as well as he/she does.  This is ignorance, bias and absolute discrimination since he should know that people in other states much prefer their own language to Hindi. \n\nSecondly Why consider the total ask?  The rules state that each proposal has to be considered on its own merit.  Therefore even if  i had a hundred language proposals, if i had a hundred teams of two Master Translators and Two Proofreaders, then it will get the job done. We are doing this for 25 years buddy.   We know exactly how to run a translation project.\n\nHe goes on\nThe proposer claims to have many years experience in this field but this is impossible to verify based on the evidence (LinkedIn profile) provided. The other key resource (Muthiah) presents as a trilingual translator.\nI have stated as below, we have and use our extensive network of Master Translator Partners.\n\n\n\n\nThe assessor has not read the proposal. It states clearly as follows\nThe number of people required to complete this task has been calculated.  \nWe will be using our inhouse resources as well as obtain our Master Translator Partner network to handle overflow of work to ensure that our deliverables remain on track. They would be brought on board as and when needed and budget would include their costs\n\nI can see clearly that this assessor is merely following the wrong ideas of some CAs to say that the feasibility is not good because they believe I alone  is doing Or Mr Muthiah D is doing,  the translations or this internal team is doing the translation of all the 10 languages.  This is completely WRONG.  As mentioned above we are using our External partners who are Master Translators with many years of experience and qualifications in translating as Native speakers of Tamil both in Sri Lanka and India. So his feasibility assessment is wrong. \n\nHow the budget was calculated has been clearly laid out as follows.. if he claims he has read the other proposals he will know that we are doing 15000 words per project. Each word costs 0.08 for complete translation to voicing. This cost comes to 1200 and into 3 months it is 3600.  Then this language needs its own Social media campaign since the users of one language would not care about social media campaigns in another language. So all languages cannot be lumped together to do one campaign.  The cost of that being 1500..  Then for contingency we have allocated 2000.    \nSome specific statements that are absolute nonsense=\nHowever, because the primary responsibility of this position is to translate text from English to Tamil, the proposer should include more specific information on their translators' expertise in their Master Translator Partner Network.   As stated we have been doing projects for over 25 years. The definition of Master translator if this assessor doesn't understand is a MASTER OF HIS CRAFT.  A SENIOR IN THE INDUSTRY.   Each one will have different qualifications.  As for our specific master translator, he is the ONLY ONE IN SRI LANKA to write for the Mahawamsa which is like the BIBLE OF HISTORY of SRI LANKA for over 4000 years. It has been written from the time of kings.  This is a role that he alone in Sri Lanka has. So this assessor is talking nonsense\n"}, {"id": 7354, "q0": "I found an inconsistency in this proposal, as at the beginning the proposer says that the content will be translated into Assamese (\"Summarize your solution to the problem: Provide translated videos in Assamese about the Cardano ecosystem\") and then he made the lack of content in Hindi about Cardano (\"Lack of official Hindi content for Project Cardano. So Assamese speakers cannot learn in their native language\"). I did a brief research, as I am not from India, to identify if these two languages \u200b\u200bare spoken in the country and in fact, both Assamese and Hindi are official languages \u200b\u200bof India, but it would be necessary for the proposer to make it clear, after all, for which language he intends to translate this project. Now analyzing the scope of the project itself, the idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, because it proposes to translate content about our blockchain into a language accessible to Indians. First, I will highlight the positive points: the proponent makes it very clear what the KPIs are already in this section of the impact, I think this is good, because if we are clear about where we want to go and what should be done, the whole project is guided more safe. He also points out some challenges that may be faced along the way, and already proposes solutions, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and planning. However, I disagree with two points that have been raised: the proponent claims that Ada's volatility is a problem. In fact, it's not pleasant to see our money fluctuating so much, however this is a characteristic of cryptocurrencies, and it's something that affects all Catalyst projects, so I don't think it should be considered a problem especially in this case. It's a fact that we need to learn to deal with. And I also disagree when the proponent says that it is difficult and time consuming to convert Ada into the local currency, this can be done through exchanges like Binance, very simply and quickly, and it makes no difference which currency we are buying or selling. What is at stake is the delay in carrying out the transaction on the blockchain, but this is something that, once again, affects everyone. From a negative point of impact, I thought that the proponent should better detail what the translated subjects will be and how they will be presented. I believe that, at first, more general and introductory topics of the cryptographic world will be worked on, but it would be very important for this to be better defined. Therefore, my grade will be 3, as I think that the confusion about the language and the lack of specification on the subjects covered really shakes the confidence in the impact of this project. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Starting with the script analysis: the accounts of how many videos will be released don't make much sense. It is said that the channel would already be launched with 6 videos, and that the goal is to post 1 video every 3 days. That way, there's no way at the end of 3 months to have only 10 to 20 videos there. Regarding the roadmap, the proponent explains what would be the work each month, but this information is somewhat superficial. In general, in the first month the team would come together and 120 minutes of video would be produced. In the second, partnerships would be established (with whom?) and the same amount of minutes of videos would be produced. In the third month, the information is basically the same. I really think that this roadmap deserved a better detail, we should have more information about the activities developed each month, for example, how the team would be assembled, how these partnership forms (how the proponent would establish an initial contact and also what your goals with it), how would the work routine of everyone involved so that the goal of 120 minutes of video was possible and etc. Talking about funding, I also think that this part should be better explained, starting with the values \u200b\u200bof the translations themselves. It is very complicated to prove that the exact number of words that was promised was translated. Regarding, for example, the social media campaign, we do not know which media would be targeted and how this disclosure would be made, so it is not possible to understand whether the asking amount of 1500 dollars for this is fair or not. The same I say for contingency fee, it would be important for the author to explain what this is and why it would cost 2000 dollars. Now talking about the team, this is certainly the best part of the feasibility because we know a lot of details about each of those involved in the project. We know their names, we have access to their linkedin profiles and we are also provided with a good explanation of their CVs. So I think there's a lot of trust in the team. However, I think that both the roadmap and the budget division should be better explained, more detailed. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I do not think it would be necessary for the proponent to repeat here the information already mentioned throughout the proposal. In any case, it is quite possible to audit the development process of this project, as we have KPIs established from the very beginning. This auditability activity would be even better if the roadmap was better detailed. I think it is more appropriate for a member of the Cardano community who is Indian and available to do so, for this person to closely audit what is happening, all the individual activities of each month and also the results that are being achieved little by little. . In this way, monitoring the process would be very accurate. In the part of the auditability of the final results, again the proposer repeats things that have already been attached to the proposal. I think it is not established exactly how this initiative could be analyzed from a more human point of view, without being so based on numbers. I believe that it would be important for this team to research directly with the viewers of their youtube channel if they were actually getting involved with the Cardano ecosystem, what activities they were developing, what was the impact of these translations for them, etc. And it would also be important, of course, for us to know how all this interfered with the Cardano ecosystem, if the number of active members has increased, if more Indians are getting involved in Catalyst, using or even creating Dapps and etc. In other words, I think that the final auditability is already well underway by the metrics provided, but it should be better explored by qualitative aspects. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "pls filter this out\n\nTHese projects are not intended to build Devs. they are intended for 99% of the population who are non devs to onboard to Cardano as well, hold some ada, learn how to invest, how to increase their holdings in qty and value, and get used to a crypto economy.  \n\nDOes the community not understand simple KPIs?

So thank you once again!"}, {"id": 8589, "q0": "The \u201cCardano in Assamese\u201d proposal in the \u201cGrow India, Grow Cardano\u201d challenge intends to set up a projects for translating Cardano related video content into Assamese. The same team has submitted functionally identical proposals, each covering a different language, for 15 different languages of the Indian subcontinent. I would like to point out that in this case, this is not necessarily a problem as each proposal covers essentially a different service. The aim of each is to translate a YouTube video every 3 days, in this case into Assamese.\n\nI have meticulously verified the text of all 15 proposals in a text editor that allows for snapshots and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener), to make sure the text of the proposals is the same. With a few minor exceptions of paragraphs being present in some proposals, but not in others, I can say with confidence that they are functionally identical proposals. As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven India\u2019s importance in the IT world, and especially considering its potential future growth my view is that this group of proposals would represent a very good investment for the Cardano community, and could have a great impact on attracting Indians to the ecosystem.\n\nThe main thing that I think is missing from this proposal group is the fact that they do not reference or acknowledge each other. If they did, the voters would get a much clearer picture of the project\u2019s scope overall and be able to make much more informed decisions as a result. I would advise that in the future, if the proposals are to be resubmitted separately, the proposer should clearly indicate that the proposals are part of a proposal group and perhaps write a paragraph or two about the vision behind the project as a whole and how they plan to implement it, especially since the same people will be responsible for the project management, logistics and implementation of the whole set of proposals.\n\nI can understand the reasoning behind submitting each language translation as a new proposal, so that the Cardano community can choose to fund as many as they think is necessary, and that the project can still go ahead if only a few languages are funded. However, I also feel that the average voter, who may only come across 2-3 proposals should have been made aware of the existence of the proposal group. \n\nThe proposers provide the number of speakers for each language in each category, however as the proposals do not reference each other I will make a list of all languages the proposers have submitted proposals for, in order of the number of worldwide speakers:\n\n\t1)\tHindi - 528 million speakers globally\n\t2)\tUrdu - 280 million speakers globally\n\t3)\tBengali - 250 million speakers globally\n\t4)\tPunjabi - 113 million speakers globally\n\t5)\tMarathi - 83 million speakers globally\n\t6)\tTelugu - 83 million speakers globally\n\t7)\tGujarati - 75 million speakers globally\n\t8)\tTamil - 75 million speakers globally\n\t9)\tKannada - 56 million speakers globally\n\t10)\tBhojpuri - 51 million speakers globally\n\t11)\tOdia - 39 million speakers globally\n\t12)\tMalayalam - 39 million speakers globally\n\t13)\tNepali - 25 million speakers globally\n\t14)\tSinhala - 25 million speakers globally\n\t15)\tAssamese - 24 million speakers globally (this proposal)\n\nI have cross-checked these figures with the information provided in the Languages of India Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India , and for the most part they check out. There are a few small discrepancies, but that is perfectly understandable given the dataset, even the Wikipedia article feature 2 separate lists with slightly varying numbers. Not on the lists in the article are Nepali (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language) and Sinhala (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_language), languages mainly spoken in Nepal and Sri Lanka respectively.\n\nI have also compiled a list of links to all the proposals in the group for easier reference:\n\n\t\u2022\tCardano in Hindi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398838 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Urdu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398847 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bengali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398841 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Punjabi - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398857 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Marathi -  https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398842 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Telugu - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398843  \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Gujarati - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398845 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Tamil - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398840 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Kannada - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398850 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Bhojpuri - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398981 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Odia - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398853 \n\t\u2022\tMalayalam - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398856 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Nepali - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398858 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Sinhala - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404484 \n\t\u2022\tCardano in Assamese (this proposal) - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398980 \n\nThere are a few inconsistencies, meaning the authors failed to update each proposal with the correct language, or, in a few instances, the number of speakers internationally is not consistent within a proposal, however, that is understandable given the number of proposals they had to keep track off.\n\nOverall, even though the proposal itself could definitely use some more work and could have been better written and more refined in a number of areas, the initiative itself is worthwhile and it\u2019s a big plus for the Cardano translation effort that we have access in our community to such well-connected individuals in the translation field that are offering their services at very competitive rates.\n\nThe budget for translating a single language is very reasonable at $7,100, however, all the languages combined add up to almost 3 quarters of the total category budget, $106,500 out of $150,000. While the initiative to make Cardano content accessible in various Indian languages is certainly worthwhile it is up to the Cardano community to decide which to prioritise and fund and hopefully this overview will assist with that.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The other sections of my assessment of this proposal also note that, \u201cCardano in Assamese\u201d, is part of a group of proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. As the proposals are functionally identical, my reviews will also be almost the same.  As such I will be assessing the proposals as a proposal group. However, reviewing a group of 15 proposals took almost the same amount of time as assessing 15 unique proposals, because of the steps described in the Impact section of my assessment. \n\nThe roadmap is very detailed and easy to follow. It makes perfect sense for the projects.\n\nThe budget requested by the team is very reasonable and a portion of it, $2000 out of $7100 is set aside for contingencies, meaning that even if unforeseen situations were to happen the team should be able to deal with them and deliver the product.\n\nAll the 15 proposals promise to \u201cTranslate the entire content of IOHK in stages\u201d, however since that is a monumental task I would have liked to see more indications about their plan of action, and what they plan to start with. The proposals mention applying for future Catalyst funding if the project is to continue. \n\nSince the proposals\u2019 primary focus is translating YouTube videos from the IOG channel, I would advise contacting them and coordinating with IOG on this effort. Especially if multiple proposals will be funded.\n\nThis could result in multiple benefits. For instance, the proposals don\u2019t specify how the translations are to be handled, if they intend to bake them in, hardcode them in the videos, or if they are to be presented as CC (close captions).\nIf the translations are baked in, it would make sense for IOG to provide them with the original video files. This way the team won\u2019t have to download the highly compressed video file from YouTube and upload a video file that has gone through multiple compressions, greatly reducing quality.\nIOG could get access to the text of the translations to be included in its primary videos, if wished, as CC (close captions).\n\nThe description of the team members involved with this project is very detailed and they seem more than competent to get the job done. The included LinkedIn profile links were helpful, however the LinkedIn profiles were kind of sparse for some of the team members. But, that didn\u2019t constitute a problem since enough info is given in the proposals themselves.\n\nThe roles that the team members mentioned in the proposal will take within the projects are not exactly specified. However, I assume they will be mostly responsible for the project management of the proposals and the translations will be handled by the \u201cMaster Translators\u201d mentioned several times in the proposal. If this is the case, I would have liked to see more details around this and how they plan to recruit. However, given the stated experience of the proposals my level of confidence that they will get the job done is high.\n\nI particularly appreciated that, unlike many other proposers, the team behind this proposal has taken the time to properly identify and address a long list of risks/problems that could occur during the translation process. This definitely increases the feasibility of the proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Impact and Feasibility sections of the assessment for \u201cCardano in Assamese\u201d also mention the fact that it is just one in a group of 15 proposals that aim to translate IOHK YouTube content into 15 Indian languages. Assamese, in the case of this proposal.  As such I will be reviewing the proposals as a proposal group.\n\nGiven that translated YouTube videos are the main deliverables to track for this group of 15 proposals the metrics presented in the auditability section should be sufficient to verify the evolution of the projects as they all have to do with engagement on the platform.\n\n As the output of these projects is YouTube videos, the quality of the translations will only be able to be verified by speakers of the 15 languages which the projects aim to produce translations for, but that is beyond the scope of current Catalyst auditability requirements. \n\nThe definitions of success given are more or less a copy/paste of the metrics presented in the initial section of the Auditability part of the proposals and various other parts of the proposal. However, the initial paragraph does offer some info about what the team hopes to accomplish with this overarching project that spans 15 Catalyst proposals in this round.\nIn the future, I would definitely recommend giving more thought to this section of the proposals and rewriting it. For instance, attaching clear values to each of the metrics given would have turned them into milestones/goals; an example: \u201c15000 average views per video\u201d. But, ultimately this doesn\u2019t carry much weight in this case, given the nature of the project and the set of proposals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for your fair review"}, {"id": 10065, "q0": "Comprehension and communication is an indispensable trait for a rapidly expanding project such as Cardano, specially within majority developing-country areas of the world which are of the utmost importance for the mass adoption and spread of Cardano.

India has the characteristics of a high inequality region, with a very large population, high percentage of people who don\u2019t necessarily speak English or Hindi and high engagement with new technologies. However, as opposed to the positive impact estimated for translations of Cardano into the Top 5 most spoken local languages in India (Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu and Tamil), Assamese is only spoken by approximately 25 million people in India. We believe minority languages, though important, are not ones into which translation of Cardano material should be prioritized at this juncture, specially considering the investment in terms of funds required is the same for a significantly lower number of target population.
