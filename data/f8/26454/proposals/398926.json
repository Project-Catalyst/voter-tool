I think that the proposal is effectively address the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes mentioned plan and roadmap seems very clear and achievable. Because of covid lots of people got to know about digital education, zoom and other tools it became their daily life part so one can easily get mentored using those tools easily.

", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes the information provided here is sufficient to audit the process and success of the proposal. they have good plan from starting weekly online session on various social media platform like twitter, instagram, facebook etc to host start up events and live working session that will bring more people also their continues feedback and monitored tools will be good to track the entire process effectively.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1792", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6438, "q0": "This proposal fits well and addresses the challenge with the goal of supporting the growth and expansion of cardano in India by organizing recurring cardano workshops making good use of several social media channels. This for me is game changing since its in alignment with the metrics of this challenge by increasing the number of participation by Indians into catalyst through engagements and proposal submission, number of dapps actually built on the cardano ecosystem among others. This inniattive by the proposer and team is laudable and has the potential of bringing value to the entire cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team seem to be the people of the task.

Furthermore  the documents / reports the proposer intends to turn-in to the catalyst management team such as Weekly campaign reports, Workshop participant reports, Feedback report, Session report etc. is a great initiative and key to measure the success of their project should they be funded. I think this is a great idea by the proposer and should be emulated by all other proposers.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_420", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7350, "q0": "This proposal certainly fits very well with the objectives of the challenge, because it intends to develop a series of activities that have the common objective of providing a mentoring service so that Indian startups can learn ways to relate to our blockchain and manage to raise initial funds for your projects. The proponent explains very richly what these activities would be, which would be quite varied. The so-called weekly Workshops on \u201cDecentralized Fundraising\u201d would take place, in which educational modules would be produced that are intended to circulate on various social media, such as linkedin and facebook. I found it extremely positive that the proponent informs us of the specific topics covered in each workshop session, this gives us an exact vision of what he intends to create with this program. Generally, when proposals are about promoting events, it is not explained which exact topics would be covered, which does not cause a full understanding of the process. In that case, we know exactly what would happen in each encounter. In addition to these workshops, there would be \u201cWeekly events at the Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces\u201d and \u201cInteractive sessions and training modules in Zoom or Konmaverse (virtual meeting space)\u201d, that is, the activities would not be fully face-to-face, which would allow all Indians who wished to participate in this project would have this possibility, without necessarily depending on being in the exact place where the meetings will take place. We also know what subjects would be covered in these sessions (\u201cmind mapping, Design Thinking, How to write a proposal?, public speaking\u201d), which generates, once again, a solid visualization of the activities that will be developed. Finally, the proponent will promote what he calls the \u201cStartup Idea Festival\u201d, among the startups that participate in the activities described so far. However, it is not very clear what kind of competition this would be, how they would be compared and so on. But overall, I think we have more than enough information to understand what would be done and how it would be done, and all activities are aligned with the objective of the challenge of expanding our blockchain to the inhabitants of India. With this, there will certainly be a double benefit, both for the popularization of our blockchain and for the Indian members of the startups, who would add Cardano technologies to their actions and all the benefits that this can offer. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script allows us to have a very accurate view of the process, since the activities that will take place each week during the months of April and May are defined. I was surprised about the duration of this proposal, because there are so many activities I thought the time would be longer, however, the way it is presented to us, the timeline related to specific actions for each week creates a very solid understanding of the process development of this project. So in relation to the roadmap, I have no criticism to make, I can't even say that the activities could be more detailed because all the necessary detail is presented in the impact part, so when we analyze the feasibility of the project we already have in mind how everything would happen. . Now talking about the budget, the \u201cProgram Planning and Management Team\u201d part is perfectly explained, as there is a lot of detail, we know who would receive how much and also the value of the working hours of each of the professionals involved. . However, the parts cited first should be better specified. I will explain. For example, in the marketing part, 2 thousand dollars would be allocated monthly for this. But how would this project be marketed? Which dissemination strategies would be adopted in which media would be launched? In the \u201cIdea Showcase Festival Prizes (3 Cohorts) - $3,000 x 3 = $9,000\u201d part, how would these prizes be distributed? How many divisions would the $3,000 value have, that is, how many monthly winners are we proposing? I would like those parts that don't talk about the salaries of those involved to be better detailed. Finally, speaking of the team, some people give more information about themselves than others. Generally speaking, we know the full names and we have the linkedin profiles of all participants. However, some inform in the proposal itself what are their professional attributions, their academic formations and some previous works. When seeing see, it would be ideal that all the participants had informed all this information, in this way we would have more leveled knowledge about all those involved. So I think the feasibility is perfect. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proponent suggests that various types of reports be generated so that progress tracking is possible, such as \u201cWeekly Campaign Reports, Workshop Participant Reports, Feedback Report\u201d and so on. I think that if all of them were actually developed and made available to the Cardano community, the auditability of the development process would be perfect, because we would have specific feedbacks for each part of the project (which is quite multifaceted). However, it is unclear how these reports will be made available to the Cardano community. If the proponent intends to create them, surely he has already planned some platform on which he will make them available. But which one? It would be necessary for him to clarify this issue for members of the Cardano community, would he post these reports on our community's telegram and discord channels? Or in online tools, like Miro, which is mentioned in the proposal? If this doubt were resolved, I would say that the auditability of the process was perfectly thought out. Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is that \u201cactive participants from India propose in the next Project Catalyst Funds and bring quality proposals that can add value to the Cardano ecosystem of Indian startups\u201d. But how will this be ascertained? I think that in order to analyze such broad and extensive information, it would be necessary for the proponent and his team to carry out a direct survey with those involved in the project, in order to understand how they would be putting into practice the knowledge acquired in the workshops and in the various events of this project. It would be interesting to see in practice some examples of how the statups would be adopting Cardano, as some professionals would be proposing in Catalyst and so on. All this could be researched, the information gathered and organized, and finally transmitted to the Cardano community through a synchronous meeting, after Town Hall, for example. In this way, we would have a very well-perceived and monitored success scenario. Therefore, my opinion is that the proponent was doing very well in the part of auditing the process, but unfortunately this analysis was very abstract in relation to the final results, requiring real improvements. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8587, "q0": "The Leveraging Indian Startups proposal by K SPROUT is an initiative to promote the possibility of Catalyst funding to the Indian start-up community.
