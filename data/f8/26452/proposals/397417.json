The idea is to carry out a professional report with information about Ada, Cardano and other technologies that involve our ecosystem and broadcast it in consolidated newspapers in Vietnam. I believe that everything we are looking for in the challenge is found in this proposal, even if it is relatively simple. It doesn't take complexity to successfully achieve the goals of all challenges, and the task in this challenge is clear: expand Cardano-related content into new forms of media in order to reach different types of audiences. As the author of the proposal himself says and also as he is present in the explanation of the challenge, on youtube we already have a good base, but the audience that consumes this platform is certainly not the same that sees the national newspaper. And we want to reach as many people as possible, get out of the bubble. I think this will work, because from what I've already noticed along the funds, especially in fund 7, several proposals were about Vietnam, the cryptographic community there seems to me promising and in my view the impact of this proposal aligns perfectly with what the challenge asks for. The author considers it as a challenge that there are not enough people to do research on Cardano and Ada and that they do not find an opening to expose this content in a more traditional media, yes, in fact, these are problems that we can face with the project, but I believe that they can be overcome and totally worth investing in this proposal. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author of the proposal provides a good roadmap, where the activities that will make up the whole project are listed. It is positive how he establishes phases and divides activities over time. We just needed to know in which month all this will start, which month is expected that phase 1 will end, that phase 2 will begin and so on. This is the only missing point for understanding the process; otherwise, everything is as it should. The explanation of the budget is very detailed. $10,000 is asked, and we understand a lot of specifics about how that amount would be divided. We are told in great detail how each part would be divided, for example: \u201cSurvey Activity (Make a survey and collect questionnaire and analysis results) - 40h * $40 = $1,600 - (40 hours working and 40$/hours) . Thus, the need for such an investment is very clear. In fact, I think the value is not high, compared to other proposals, but it is still fundamental that we understand the need for this amount of money, as it is done. The author divides the total amount into smaller parts and argues the need for each one. With that, we would have more confidence in the need for such an investment, giving us complete security about this part of the proposal. And finally, regarding the team, we are presented with its leader and the leader of the communication part. In relation to this duo, we also have a lot of information, such as their previous experiences and their linkedin profiles, so it also conveys a lot of confidence in their ability to successfully carry out the project. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, we know in detail all the fundamental information - about script, budget and team (in this case, about the duo) - and with that, it is possible to understand very precisely a) what would be done b) when would be done c) how it would be done d) by whom it would be done e) how much each specific part would cost f) who are the people involved and why they are prepared and qualified to carry out the proposal satisfactorily and successfully. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author views auditability with mostly numerical data. It would be necessary that we had a qualitative analysis, in addition to the quantitative one. It is certainly important to analyze in numbers how many downloads the report had, the number of newspapers that will accept it and so on. But it would also be interesting, for example, to carry out research in order to understand whether the expected impact was achieved after this project. In other words, has there been a change in view of cryptocurrencies in the country, especially Ada? Were the inhabitants interested enough to look beyond, to research Cardano? Has our blockchain caught mainstream media attention beyond the report in question? It would be important for the project author to gather this data and take it to the rest of the Cardano community. Another thing: we need to follow the phases to know if the process was being done as promised. This is quite possible to do based on the information given by the author. It would be interesting if a member of the community that inhabited Vietnam would follow up this closer, on a constant basis. This information would also need to be brought to the rest of the community, it could be through some discord channel aimed at tracking funded proposals, for example. In general, the author outlines good forms of auditability, but I don't think they are entirely sufficient to safely face the whole project result, beyond the numbers. My opinion is that yes, the proposal is quite auditable, however this auditability could be even better if he had provided more qualitative information also for the analysis of the process as well as the final results, as I suggested during the evaluation of this topic. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 615, "q0": "This project doesn't really seem in alignment with the challenge setting, but it is kind of a gray area.  The proposal is essentially for a Vietnamese multimedia site that covers Cardano, with a comprehensive market report at its root and driving the starting content that goes on the site, and an unspecified schedule for keeping it up to date or dynamic, but rather trying to market the created content to large media outlets, perhaps television or major media outlets in Vietnam.  The challenge setting seems to me to be more about projects based around creatives and visual artists. The proposal only plans on making one introduction video for introducing the report, and it was unclear if this was planned to be a regular event or a onetime, landing page type of event.  I really apprecaite a dedicated Cardano site in the Vietnamese language, where Cardano adoption is set to explode. It is worth noting one thing from the proposal that may concern or confuse readers:  the proposer notes that crypto is illegal in Vietnam...while it is illegal to make purchases with it, it is widely bought and sold as an investment asset.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer seems well qualified to build out the report and website he proposes here, with an already working prototype and a whole host of content ideas for articles and ways of parsing the report.  Delivery of the market report really seems to be at the heart of the project, which seems odd for a Film&Media project.  The report, once completed, would be used to create an introduction video, then parsed and chopped up to create a bunch of content on the website.  The timeline lays out the order that all these thing are expected to roll out.  There is an extensive section devoted to a major data gathering campaign for crypto users...that doesn't seem likely to be either accurate, or particularly helpful.  The survey is also intended to gather information regarding Cardano adoption, which, while a useful metric, doesn't indicate a connection to the challenge nor to driving new adoption.  The survey goes on to detail many more pieces of data and information to collect, including trading systems for Cardano, compilation of research studies regarding Cardano, and gauging opinion of Cardano among influencers and media figures in Vietnam.  As far as the approach to generating a marketing survey, this methodology seems comprehensive and sound.  Beyond that the media suggested to be built out looks like the standard Youtube channel crypto-fare.  With any luck it will at least be positive towards Cardano...assuming the survey supports that premise?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The well structured proposal has clear deliverables lined out, and a steady timeline for their delivery over four months.  Almost all of the content is either documentation, or web content like articles.  There is the open question about the videos and how many are expected, beyond the first introduction, but all in all, these deliverables are all easy to report.  There is a big question about how much visibility this project will have, during implementation, outside of the Vietnamese community, so coordinating with Catalyst leaders in Eastern Townhall would be a good mitigation strategy.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1718, "q0": "There is a lot of misinformation about Cardano, and a lack of information about Cardano in the media.

The team will produce relevant content to impart knowledge and raise community awareness about the ecosystem. The proposed team considered the risks for its project.

Although I disagree that there is a lot of disinformation about Cardano rather there is not enough information about Cardano in the mainstream (mostly people know about ETH and Bitcoin), the author does mention a lot of scam projects and hacking Catalyst projects in the Vietnamese population recently especially when it comes to CA work. I believe this report will potentially draw good public relations if the channels of marketing are correct. On the other hand it can also do more harm to the Cardano community if the report is disseminated in the wrong channels. News and Film channels would be good channels and thus this proposal fits in the challenge and addresses it pretty well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal and the available information on Cardano is quite available just not put together in a neat professional format that's easily consumable by the readers. As a digital and content marketing specialist, I can tell this is very feasible and can be done for a lot less even however you get what you pay for so the budget is on point especially if it includes further marketing of this annual Cardano report. I wish there would be more detail on how this is going to be marketed because 1000 downloads from a bot also would count as 1000 downloads or views, etc. Legitimate downloads will require time and audience, especially reaching a new legitimate audience on a shoestring budget is quite hard but very doable if the content is very high quality.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs and metrics are very reasonable and auditable, especially when it comes to marketing content/white papers/similar reports if they use a marketing automation landing page or even a register to download form it will be clear who downloaded it, when, and if it's a unique desired download or not.

I find it meets the goal of the challenge. Providing quality and accurate content adds value to the Cardano platform. The increase in value is also reflected in the result that more Vietnamese people have knowledge (or awareness) about Cardano, so they will see Cardano as a professional project and hold more ADA and projects. Startup with Cardano and Catalyst is more impressive. I like this idea. It is solving the reality in Vietnam that there are many scam projects based on users' ignorance about blockchain technology as well as Cardano. If the project is successfully implemented, it will contribute to creating a healthy environment and increasing the reputation of the Cardano platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has been involved in crypto for 3 years and has expertise in digital marketing and marketing, having many articles about Cardano on media sites and small communities.

Although it can also be written in the challenge \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" as I can see the proposers come from Vietnam and the proposal will serve the Vietnamese community. It will add up a lot of value to the community if it is successfully established in the future, it operates in almost all of the media channels that an online users can reach, Youtube, e-newspaper, workshops. The name of the proposal in my point of view still not address all the information it send out, it will be conducted annually and the content will be delivered base on the data collected from the Vietnamese community - investors to be specific. They also address the risks of not collecting enough data and the fund requested is not enough. I suggest for the number of data, they might give out reward for people that take their survey or any other kind of encouragement methods as people seem to step back when asked to do a survey. In general, this is a great idea and I hope the proposers will have enough capacity to manage all the webpage that they post the content to as well as the quality of the content.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility, there are many point that I want to note out. First of all, there are a lot of links and references given, there is also one Vietnamese link that address the scam concern, the proposers might take their idea from here, to protect the community from scam :) and a lot of e-newspapers link that they will post their content on.   There will also a landing page, KOL and workshop, if all of these mentioned can be managed, it would be a big hit. But with the number of current team members, I don't think they can handle everything, a bigger team set will be a better plan but I don't see they mention the number of total team member if they are funded. This will be a big challenge for them. The 2 members of the proposers are well-described and easy to track their profile, showing that it is not a scam project. The budget is broken down in detailed with 3 phases. There are detailed plan how to operate each phases. However, I don't see the time set for each phases, how long will each phase last? and there are many works still does not has a detailed plan (e.g workshop). Will this proposal be done in 1 year time which is in 2022, there will be a report for 2021 and the updated content in 2022? They said the content will base on the data collect from the survey, there are a lot of risks what if they do not collect enough data and how they make sure the quality of the content is good to use. My suggestion is that they narrow the number of media deliver and focus on 1 or 2 channels that really matter and focus on the content they deliver.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As regards the auditability, they already have a Vietnamese landing page with a lot of useful and informative information.
