In an odd twist, they don't include the topics of what those other proposals are, and why that would be engaging.  The assumption here, I think (and which I can't say I entirely disagree with, though there is something here that just feels off to me), is that regardless of the proposals, they are Creators, and their story will be interesting.  So much so, that they worry getting caught up in the emotion of it all may be one of the biggest risks this project faces.  Will the project be a case of omphaloskepsis (navel-gazing) or will it be a universally resonant insight into creativity and passion?  Based on how the proposal is formulated I lean towards the former, but who really knows?  That the proposer hasn't considered that maybe the other proposals won't get funded, or that we might want to see some evidence of what kind of impact the team's stories might have, doesn't really speak to a broader perspective needed to deliver the value they suggest is here.  What I would like to see is some narrative here with some idea about what they think a Creator's story is about, or even better, some evidence of that narrative, like any parts of the story that had already been told, so that we could gauge it.  I believe that every person that is willing to attest truthfully has a story worth hearing.  Without exception.  But the key is in that \"truthfully\" part, and for that we need to have some context to know if that is what we are getting.  Lastly, I do not see a clear correlation to the challenge setting, except for the idea that the other funded proposals are presumably Cardano related, and thus would obliquely reveal Cardano as a part of the landscape these Creators are working within.  However there are really no explicit attempts to draw this element out and frame it within the context of this proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The basic idea is a sound one, and who better to film themselves than themselves, it is like a two for one deal.  With the budget presented, it seems like they are looking at a decent sized production, with $15k for the filming part, but neither the budget nor the timeline are broken down with any clarity.  For example, there is no suggestion here about what length the film aims to be, or if it is intended to be more than one, or what style it aims to emulate (I assume for the sake of this assessment that it will be a straight documentary...interviews with some b-roll).  The 3 month timeline hasn't included the film as a deliverable milestone (of course we will assume it is) which leads to some confusion about whether it is a 3 month project as indicated, but they didn't think to note the completion of the film on the roadmap, or if the timeline actually extends beyond the 3 months presented in order to accommodate release and distribution.  On that final note, there actually isn't any information at all on how they expect to distribute the release, or what format it might be.  The team doesn't have any clear strengths for filmwork, as it looks mostly to be project management and a possible developer.  The main asset seems to be the core proposer who has a lengthy resume.  I would have liked to have seen any filmwork he had done (actually, even a reference to specific work, given that from the sound of his bio, the actual work itself may be hard to get to at this point, understandably) just to get a feel for the skill set here.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The included metrics of # of minutes filmed, etc. can describe the accumulation of film material, but leaves a vacancy for some KPIs related to the challenge setting.  It is an understandable challenge to measure the impact of an art project, which is not what I am suggesting, but rather to consider the impacts  noted by the challenge setting and to bring the project into alignment with them, such as to highlight the diversity and equity of the teams, especially if it sprawls broadly (I can't tell from the proposal if this team is the sole subject of the film, or if there will be many teams brought together for this), and to show how learning and adoption of Cardano could be accomplished.  And I haven't mentioned it elsewhere, so I will mention it here, NFTs were in the title but not in the body of the proposal...it is possible there is some critical piece of the plan that is missing (or a typo in the title).", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4823, "q0": "The idea of making a documentary on progress of proposals from ideas to realised projects in Catalyst Funds is a good and interesting one and it addresses the challenge.
