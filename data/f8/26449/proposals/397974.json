Principles are ultimately political, no matter how much we might wish otherwise. The proposal does lay out a map for developing a guiding set of principles, but the questions I come away with are \"how will these be used, and by whom?\" Google's famous \"don't be evil\" guidelines were insufficient, which is why Web3 is trying to take the approach of \"can't be evil.\" \n\nWith that in mind, to make a good case for the utility of such a project, the impact statement may want to discuss how the proposers plan to get their statements of principle worked into systems and code. While the implementation itself may be outside of the scope of this phase, it could go a long way towards making the project look like more than a navel-gazing exercise.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer's team, with academic backgrounds in economics and sustainability, should have little trouble delivering a statement of principles within the timeline mapped out. The involvement of the community in creating the guidelines should help the proposers take the temperature of the Cardano community.

Transparency could probably be improved by disclosing the methodology the team plans to use when it comes to evaluating the results of the survey.

Our proposal focuses on the design, but we believe it will have inherent enforcement power too:\n\nSetting Principles is indeed a first step to drive communities in the \"good\" direction. Like in any web3 project, or with DAOs, communities are guided and rewarded based on actions in line with cultural manifesto, expressions of values and beliefs, guidelines and principles which set proper directions and best practices when designing and implementing projects. Setting the Principles represents this first step. \n\nPrinciples can be translated into concrete systems and code when they are designed and adopted by credible organizations, ideally not done in fragmented and silo approaches. This is why we see great benefits in teaming up with different communities within and outside the Cardano ecosystem to create these Principles.\n\nWe believe that having organizations such as the Cardano Foundation, Cardano4Climate, SustainableADA adhere to common well-thought Principles will directly or indirectly translate into building the system of values which will be embedded in the code of future projects. \n\nMore concretely speaking, we would like to drive co-designers and endorsers of the Principles to do themselves the enforcement of the Principles. Like it is done when projects need to sign Charts or Codes of Conduct when receiving funds, signing engagements and joining programs. We will integrate the comment in our project approach to highlight the \"enforcement\" role of co-designers and endorsers of the principles."}, {"id": 2484, "q0": "There is a clear problem statement, focusing on the increasing use of, and interest in, blockchain for social and environmental impact, without any clear guiding principles in this area.

However, i would like some clarifications when it comes to your solution to the problem. How are the Cardano stakeholders going to be involved in this whole process practically? You describe the whole mission right down on the impact session but I would like it to be clearer from the start of the proposal as it is the first thing a voter sees and then proceeds to open the proposal and see the whole description of it. As previous projects had a very positive impact on the ecosystem, I have no reason to believe otherwise for this project as well.

A strength of this proposal is the transparency provided behind the background and relevant skills of the proposals - the proposal team is stacked with a deep pool of experienced members. Further, they have show-cased their ability to understand and build within this ecosystem through many projects active in this space. \u0391 quite detailed plan (clear enough to understand each phase) and the budget are there. No budget breakdown is needed because the fund considers only the work of the contributors. The only thing i would like to be added is in the risk section. I can't think of another risk besides the low engagement but does that engagement refer to the contributors or the members of the community (or even both)?
