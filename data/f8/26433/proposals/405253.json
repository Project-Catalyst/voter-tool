A well thought out proposal that takes an innovative approach to support the important onboarding work this team has successfully carried out. As far as I know, according to Incentive theory by Clark Hull, with reward-based then individuals are primarily motivated to take action followed by rewards that are shown through simple loyalty points such as Starbucks points which can be exchanged for drinks that can encourage people. to buy Starbucks again and again, and this also applies to developers (if you find a bug, you can get a badge/achievement/point as described above). Apart from that, I also like the idea beyond loyalty points which is to share solutions, create certain challenges that can attract developers' interest so that the developer community can expand, and training for new developers/technicians so that they can also know about certain programming languages \u200b\u200bthat are relevant. required and also regarding the cardano environment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have not provided any information about their skills and experience.

For example, for market penetration, what are you doing?, who are the audiences?, is it enough for two months to penetrate the market with the existing target? and others.

More specifics regarding metrics, tasks, and objectives would be helpful. in the other hand, there are no risks or challenges mentioned. Yeah, we know that making it to github and accessible is a good idea but not enough and need more key metrics that make sure this program is auditable and run smoothly.
