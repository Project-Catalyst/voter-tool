Their animal care jobs will be converted into game missions, which upon completion will receive rewards through the platform. The idea is quite refreshing but the proponent failed to present their proposal addressing the Challenge KPIs? The platform doesn't seem to live up to Cardano's expectations of attracting developers to participate in the Cardano ecosystem. I do not appreciate the feasibility of the project and the value it brings to Cardano. As a record-keeping platform, the risk of information security is huge, I have not seen them mention this risk and how to deal with it in general.

The budget section should clearly state the categories including the main work, tools, and equipment to build the platform, how many people are involved in this project, each person's role, working time, and costs allocated to those categories.

On an NFT platform, farmers can communicate with one another. The proposer should be more descriptive about the NFT platform and how it contributes to the Cardano ecosystem.
