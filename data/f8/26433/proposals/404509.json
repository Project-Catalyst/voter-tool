It aims to build a 1 click solution that would let new develops to get started quickly developing and prototyping on Cardano. The challenge setting asks for tools to bring devs to Cardano fast and let them have a pleasant experience and the proposal aims to do that (something similar to Truffle on Ethereum) by 1) creating ad-hoc private networks on Cardano; 2) click to deploy; 3) Generating smart contracts; 4) Deploying smart contracts; 5) Rest APIs; 6) blockchain vizualisation; 7) Education\n\nThe proposal looks a little like a template that could be repeated for any blockchain and I would have liked for a little more research to have gone into what actually is needed, as a lot of the tooling already exists and the challenge making it all talk to each other and running as a 1 service rather than multiple services. Also no mention is given of the existing services that the team would need to include into the solution. For example there isn't actually a deploy of a smart contract on Cardano as it doesn't reside anywhere on the blockchain, but only a an address that is generated from the CborHex of the contract (in contrast to deployment of the contract does atcually happen on Ethereum which this proposal suggest) therefore this looks little like a template proposal. For this reason I give a 4 as it fits the challenge, but lacks on the specifics", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This section describes a generic project plan and lacks specific on the components of Cardano. This suggest that the team has not done material in depth reasearch of the difficulties that they might face during integration of the components. It also lacks market information on what tools are already available and where it would be smooth-sailing and where they should expect more challenge. For example, querying the blockchain data on Cardano is well understood and there is a graphql docker that can be deployed quite easily by anyone and there is also a 3rd party services (blockfrost) that offer this, similar to integrating a wallet is well understood as there are now 5+ wallets available plus a reliable wallet backend released by IOG. However, the topic of how to generate smart contracts is much more difficult as this is more recent release and generating and interacting with the smart contract will be much more of a challenge to streamline.\n\nThe team is made up of capable engineers and scientists with track record on linkedin. They do not however have a connection to Cardano and are coming fresh. The proposal could benefit from more research and specifics on how it would be done on Cardano rather than treating Cardano as a generic blockchain. For this reason a significant portion of the 114k budget would likely be spent on getting up to speed and proof of concept. This doesn't hover take away from being able to deliver, but just makes it more expensive. In summary a capable team, but coming fresh, so at that budget delivery is possible, but there is a risk they face unforeseen delays given the apparent lack of prior knowledge of Cardano", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project will be judged on if a new dev can get up and running within a short period of time, or can't. This is fairly binary and can be judged by asking an experienced Ethereum developer to have a go. And test each of the promised aims from the Assessment. The proposer gives a comprehensive delivery schedule, although there is some vagueness in what some of the statements mean such as \"backend and frontend are 100% integrated\" this is most likely from the still needed research of the key components of Cardano that will need to be integrated. For this reason I agree, but can not strongly agree which would require a KPI plan for the services to be integrated.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1076", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 328, "q0": "The proposal would be within the challenge goal, this is a great idea, and I think that this proposal probably will increase utility & adoption of Cardano blockchain and builted for a great community (developers and consumers). At the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is explained with a technical elements of the offered services, so I suggest to define use cases and offering, because in the documentation provided there are only component use examples.\nHowever the objective of the proposal is very interesting, but I think it's important to improve details about the proposal services solution for the challenge (eg. Typical services use case for developer, example benefit for service creator and community, \u2026)\nThe proposal clearly articulates the contest, the problem (actual difficulty in view Cardano building application ecosystem) and how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and for all of the stakeholders.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal is well written and clearly demonstrate the experience and the team's commitment, guarantees solidity in deliverables, support transparency and accountability for all Cardano community: The core team consists of 5 people with several years of experience  and with proven professional skill in Linkedin throught given direct link.\nThe proposer team  is well skilled about the whole context of the proposal  (Manager, full stack developer, marketing, research)\nThe scope of the solution is very well explained (e.g. how the funds will be spent, what features will be implemented, and so on\u2026) and it\u2019s convincing.\nThe proposer provides a step-by-step plan for the implementation with clear milestones and a defined time horizon,\nThe budget is high and the deliverable plan provides POC and MVP to reach small term objective.

Therefore, this project aims towards a more user-friendly and intelligible experience while using the Cardano blockchain by creating a BaaS platform, which, in theory, should lessen the amount of work in the development phase and enable developers to focus more on the client-side tasks, and it is also stated that there will be educational materials and tutorials for all levels of users. I become more of a follower of this project when the proposer claims that the ADA-specialized BaaS service will be free of charge to users and only charge some fees if users tap into the cloud resources. With all those said features, I believe the preferred success for the project, which are the faster and easier mastery of Cardano process and the extra adoption of users to the ecosystem as a whole, should comfortably fit the main objective of this challenge. The proposal also introduces three possible challenges in the foreseeable future, and creditably, encloses three viable resolutions to mitigate said challenges", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I must congratulate the team on putting up such a sophisticated and detailed performance for this criteria. Going into details, this is a well thought-out and crafted plan, which includes a specific deadline of completion for each phase of development, what tasks will be assigned in each phase and the respective expected milestones.

Nonetheless, one interesting feature that sets this project apart from the others is the divergence of success metrics at two stages of the project. Still, the metrics chosen to measure success in both divisions, which are the desired state of user-friendliness and ease-of-operation and the envisioned great amount of user adoption, are closely related to the initial ones in the challenge setting", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1664", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3650, "q0": "The proposal is well-written in terms of how this solution solves the problem of the given challenge and how impactful it is to new developers.

This solution provided the first Cardano Bass web application that offers easy prototyping of Cardano through blockchain as the first step to make Cardano applicable to as many business use-cases is easy prototyping of private Cardano blockchain networks. In fact, it makes the process of building apps on Cardano easy, user-friendly, and streamlined, so that it enables new developers without sufficient skills and knowledge to engage in Cardano. This will gradually lower the entry barrier for people to join and exploit blockchain technology. Besides, It clearly mentioned its components, its functions in a description with a given graph to better illustrate.
