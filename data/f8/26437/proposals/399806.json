The proposal sets out to make SPO more environmentally friendly and easier to be set up and operated by non-technical people by delivering pre-configured Raspberry Pi servers. Running RasPi servers will also result in more SPOs running decentralized servers without cloud hosting. Even though this mission is commendable, I fail to see how this will make Cardano more scalable while we wait for Hydra. The proposal is unfortunately only adding more regular (layer 1) nodes to the network, but this is not what the challenge is asking for (layer 2 solutions). \n\nThe proposal use the word Rollup to mean something like \"Fast setup of nodes\". From the proposal solution summary, the following is stated: \"Simplify setup and SPO guides so that non-tech people can perform rollups\". The word Rollup means (according to Google) \"Rollups perform transaction execution outside layer 1 and then the data is posted to layer 1 where consensus is reached\". The proposal writer seem to have misunderstood what this challenge asks for. The proposed project will not deliver such a solution. It will deliver only regular layer 1 servers to the network. The proposal is also said to have been part of Fund7 Global Sustainable Indep. SPO's challenge, which is a much better match for this proposal as it stands. \n\nIn a future fund, this proposal should be posted in another challenge, for example \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" or \"Global Sustainable Indep. SPO's\" if the challenge reappears. It is totally understandable that not everybody knows English, and it is therefore great that proposal wants to create Vietnamese documentation and help the Vietnamese SPO community grow as this proposal would have done if implemented. \n\nI would suggest one addition to the proposal, namely a clarification about the script used for \"pre-configuring the servers\" and wizards. To not pose as a potential security risk, I would recommend introducing more openness regarding these components. A future proposal could make use of an open-source wizard script and emphasise this fact in the proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer team consists of experienced SPO's with proven record block producing stake pools.

Though approved it was not funded. Initially, I thought the re- Proposal for F8 may solidly fit this Challenge setting due to it's solution statement of \"...so non-tech people can perform Rollups\". While Rollups are one of four examples listed in the Campaign Brief, the proposed usage is not in line with my understanding of Rollup ( to me it is a Blockchain Scaling Solution). The proposal meaning of Rollup as I understand is 'the growing or scaling of stakepools'.\n___________________________________________________\nThe Campaign Brief does mention Decentralization, which this Proposal is seeking to solve. The Challenge also, mentions Novel Ideas, Market Specific Scalability Solutions and, Other Growing Markets; though to my reading and understanding it is targeting BlockChain purposes. Due, to the intent and potential misunderstanding, on my part, I am not rating this as if it does not belong to this challenge, but I am choosing to rate this as a 3 or a neutral to whether it belongs in this challenge. My suggestion to the proposers would be to clarify their meaning of RollUp so the voters will better understand intent and have more depth to make a solid decision with their vote.\n___________________________________________________\nSuccess to this Proposal looks like an increase in ISPOs in Vietnam, with specific, understandable  key metrics of how many ISPOs the proposers plan on onboarding.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The Project as proposed is likely to be implemented.
