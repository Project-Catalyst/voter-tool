It tries to focus especially on those who are not currently covered by existing outreach initiatives. The authors of this challenge provide a whole set of helpful guidelines ensuring the efficiency of funds use and the maximal impact from the funding. For example, they indicate a preference towards tools and services that can support all global hubs, etc. This challenge is well-aligned with Fund9 Challenge Setting objectives since it directly focuses on \"preparing a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem\". The only suggestion that I have is that this proposal would be stronger if it has given a more explicit focus to the other two Fund9 objectives \"turn Cardano into an open-source project\" and \"grow the development and app ecosystem\". For example, by providing specific guidelines on how to incorporate the work on open-source solutions or hubs for developers within its scope.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This challenge proposal builds on top of a series of previously funded challenges in Fund 5, 6, and 7, and provides examples of already built hubs around the world and links to the previously funded proposals. Given the previous deep experiences of the Catalyst community with community hubs, it's clear that the Catalyst community has all the necessary skills and experiences to address the challenge. In addition, this proposal comes from two proposers suggesting that at least two people will be able to help future proposers during the proposal preparations. One suggestion that I have is the challenge would be stronger if it explicitly presented the skills and previous experience of the challenge team members, so that it's evident that they can provide the future proposal with the needed advice and suggestions during the proposal cycle.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The authors name a whole set of KPIs to measure the progress in addressing the challenge, such as \"new hubs\", \"countries with a least on hub\", \"new tools\", \"new developers\", \"new users\", and others. The suggested set of metrics is adequate given the challenge's objective to \"drive adoption and awareness of Cardano\". The only suggestion that I have is that the challenge can better monitor its impact if it provided a metric to measure the return on the impact of the challenge overall. For example, measuring the cost per user or developer onboard. Having these metrics provided would allow judging about how much budget and time is needed to onboard 1%, 10%, 50% of the world's population.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1011", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1143, "q0": "I must start by congratulating the team that prepared this proposal, just by comparing the challenge setting of Fund 8 vs. Fund 9 you can see the growth and maturity, since it is clear that there is a strategic vision behind it. After establishing a number of new hubs around the world, I see the gaps that the community has identified, namely 1) the need for resources to ensure the sustainability of these hubs over time, 2) that the community can benefit from the successes and failures of hubs already launched, and 3) by establishing contact and collaboration agreements with relevant supporters to enhance our mission. Upon evaluating the challenge setting of this challenge in relation to the strategic objectives of fund 9, it is evident that it assists us in preparing community members to contribute to the ecosystem. Despite the fact that in the \"Tools & Frameworks\" section the question is asked whether the tools require a fee or are open to all, I believe that more emphasis can be put into the definition of the challenge so that there is a clear alignment between it and the need for Cardano to become an open source project, however, I still think it deserves a score of 5, regardless.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since Fund 6 we have continuously faced this challenge within Catalyst, and we can always observe a large number of proposals within it and this fund is no different. It is clear that the challenge team has done an excellent job of highlighting the reasons for requesting a tripling of the budget for this challenge. However, I would have preferred to have seen some key statistics on the impact of these Hubs globally in order to strengthen their case. Also, I recommend presenting the current values of the metrics presented in the configuration. Accordingly, my score is 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Generally, all the metrics defined by the team that prepared this challenge proposal are designed to measure the performance of the challenge itself, rather than to serve as a guide for potential proposers when setting their own metrics. The most obvious risk is that we see metrics in the proposals which are very diffuse and far apart from one another, which makes an audit of previously founded proposals a challenge for the community and the challenge team. I believe that only three of the seven defined proposals can be slightly adapted and considered for future proposals. However, in the section entitled \"additional metrics,\" I see a better alignment with the metrics to be expected by the proponents. My score for this section is 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_130", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6128, "q0": "This challenge has been popular for several funds now and a key part of the community growth strategy. The introduction of the tools and frameworks sub-category helps the challenge better meet the Fund 9 Strategic Goals although the Challenge could improve its promotion of Cardano as an open source project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given that the community has been able to address this challenge for several rounds of funding and there is an established challenge team, the only real issues to consider is whether the new tools and frameworks sections introduces any feasiblity concerns (short answer it does not) and whether the very large increase in budget causes any capacity concerns. The challenge brings in some very large partners with a heavy emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals which will be seen as a positive by some members of the community while others will see it as a negative. Given that proposals in every challenge already include a section for SDG scoring, it is a concern that the rapidly increasing trend towards  emphasizing SDG scores in challenges and proposals is going to drive out a significant segment of the community that is wary of the implications of SDG scoring. As written the challenge currently includes the capacity for this diversity of opinion.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success criteria and metrics are very well done.

Any apparent trenda in emphasising SDGs as goals and objectives such as quality education for all, and climate action, and the use and integration of such goals from the UN SDG framework, must be done holistically in order to have a positive impact. Individuals who are averse to the use of such goals are not obliged to use them as goals in their project. So long as Catalyst remains a decentralized community of proposers, CAs, VCAs and voters, and if the ambition is for global mass adoption, then it is important that the global, diverse Catalyst community is aware of and has access to frameworks and the language used by 193 nation states, multinationals across sectors and mulilateral organisations."}, {"id": 6804, "q0": "To achieve more awareness about Cardano and Project Catalyst in particular you need a community that is providing data and help for new members that are not yet familiar with this community and ecosystem. In order for us to do this, we have a need to create community hubs where this is possible. With this challenge settings, you create a means that helps community hubs thrive and scale up. I surely believe this is critical to help Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Looking at the track record of this challenge setting we see that there is still a need for this. In Fund6 32 proposals were submitted which 11 got funding and in Fund7 21 proposals got funding out of the 62 proposals. In this fund, we see an increase again of total proposals in this challenge up to 70. The budget amount requested for Fund9 might be a bit too much. Seeing as it is an increase of 3x the amount that it is now for Fund8. I completely understand the reasoning behind the upscale of this because we have a factor that was not present in previous funds, but when we look at the numbers of proposals they are not exponentially rising the same.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The criteria and success metrics are both in the proposal and relevant to the challenge.

This should provide a good indicator by which to forecast what interest and types of proposals may be submitted into this category given the networks these partners and stakeholders operate within."}, {"id": 7653, "q0": "\"Cardano's\" mindset was always about decentralization. The common understanding of decentralization is fair influence/power/decision making throughout the community. Which I believe Cardano has successfully done. Although imperfect, Project Catalyst is on it's way to be not just the largest DAO but the leading DAO in terms of governance and engagement. Technology  wise it is miles far from the top chains who has their own dashboards. But to keep Project Catalyst as the largest and leading DAO, the initial community now needs to be empowered to retain them, but not only retain also to grow them. This is essential for Cardano's growth, which in marketing terms is using the oldest technique of marketing, word-by-mouth. \"Weaponize\" word-by-mouth and you get genuine and loyal communities. Do not just take my word for it, but we can just view a parallels that already happen in our community. The parallels between Liqwid and SundaeSwap. Both originated from the community, both are supported by one of the three prongs of Cardano. One delivered on their targets, while one fell way short. This is transferred to the trust of the community in their tokens. We have these kind of cases throughout Cardano. Like the case between NFT Maker and Fibo. One build their community from ground-up, while one use the corporate approach of bottom-down. And we can see their traction. Cardano is all about community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Even before this Challenge was set up, the community have already step-up their game and established hubs even without funding. There is the SWARM, there is WADA, there is Catalyst School, there is Eastern Town Hall and etc. The notion of permission less or leaderless system although is still in it's infancy, I can see the embryo is growing. We have AIM, we PMM we also have ETH DAO, I am growing confident we are heading the right way. We are to my surprise align with Cardano's timeline, which ends with the beginning of Voltaire.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Iteration after iteration, this proposal keeps improving and keeps redefining it's parameters. One such refining attempt, that is placed in their additional/sub key metrics is; \"Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\" is a great addition to this Challenge's key metrics.\n\nThese communities I believe should be tempered to understand or to at the very least start to explore financial sustainability. Project Catalyst I believe should actively pursue also this attitude. So we can transition the community from the -pardon- \"asking for funds\" group of people to the \"funds as a spring board\" group of people. Eventually Project Catalyst CAN NOT be identified as the dad or mom where can always ask for money. Financial sustainability/independence is critical for eventually it will become unsustainable for Project Catalyst itself. There is only field I agree should receive continuous and endless funds are one related to developing a developer ecosystem.\n\nIn regards towards funds use, since the notion of financial sustainability/independence has been subjected into the Challenge then a new parameter should be involved.
