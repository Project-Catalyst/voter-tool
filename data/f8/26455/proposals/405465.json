We can\u2019t compete with other ecosystems if we don\u2019t fund our developers properly.\nThe fact that the DApps and wallets that I mentioned above have been so successful in the last few months (over 300 million USD TVL so far) is all the proof we need that people in this ecosystem are capable of addressing this challenge (score: 5).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success criteria for this challenge is very clear and easy to verify.
