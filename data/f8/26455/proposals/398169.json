The Metaverse is built of 6 pillars that the proposer presents. These are largely overlapping and often overlapping with other Web3 concepts such as DAOs/governance, interoperability across digital ecosystems and crypto-based economics. What differentiates Metaverse is the ability to live a \u201cdigital life\u201d, similar to how people created new lives inside of the World of Warcraft, but now on a greater scale and with interoperability between systems. \nThe alignment score is set based on two sets of metrics that define whether a given challenge is critical to achieving Cardano\u2019s mission: the fund9 strategic goals and the guiding questions for challenge setting.\n\nIn terms of the first strategic goal, this challenge does meet the goal of preparing people to contribute to the ecosystem. However, many, if not all, Metaverse proposals are dApps or would fall into that challenge. In terms of opens-sourcing, the proposers correctly identify that many mainstream projects are likely to be \u201cclose\u201d, e.g. Facebook/Meta. By emphasising Open Metaverse, this challenge differentiates itself, and possibly Cardano, from other competitors. Lastly, this would accelerate growth in the ecosystem for developers and dapps.\nIn terms of challenge setting guiding questions, this challenge is likely to engage voters. Many users are likely to have dormant ideas for the metaverse and this would be a clear signal to them. If there is indeed a large Metaverse project on Cardano then that will naturally lead to wide adoption. This is difficult to achieve, as I will elaborate on the Feasibility section. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Metaverse projects, however, often require network effects and are typically large scale with highly sophisticated technologies. For this reason, I am hesitant to confidently say that the Catalyst community has the skills to address this yet. The building blocks of digital identity is still being developed and in order for our unique selling point to come to fruition, this would need to be in place before serious metaverse projects would want to prefer Cardano over competitors. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The challenge team does not provide any clear and measurable metric that would be used to track progress of the challenge and its ability to solve the problem that it has identified. Some suggestions would be to simply say \u201cNumber of catalyst funded metaverse projects that receive VC funding\u201d or \u201cNumber of users in Metaverse projects\u201d or \u201cGithub repos using open sourced Metaverse tools stemming from this challenge\u201d.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_582", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for the suggestions for metrics!

It is a subject of growing interest in the society and must be considered as an opportunity. The brief reminds blockchain\u2019s ability to bring trust into transaction and enable decentralization, and claims that Cardano should be the blockchain of choice for future open metaverses (in opposition to centralized metaverse): this is the reason why this challenge is so meaningful for Cardano Ecosystem.\nAlignment with Fund 9\u2019s 3 strategic goals is well demonstrated.

Directions for this challenge are broadly defined on purpose to make it open to innovations, but I could also create a risk of overlap with other challenges. If not voted this fund, I recommend adding to this challenge setting proposal some specific directions in order to guide proposers. A challenge team is identified but limited so far to the proposer.

Despite the fact that i find very useful the full description of the pillars of the Metaverse, it's not clear to me the contribution of the Cardano blockchain to achieve this mission. I can surely imagine how that can be achieved with Cardano's decentralized projects, its CNFTs, its academic research and so it goes on. Giving a clearer view of that i think that this challenge would be a nice one to get Cardano closer to achieving its mission.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As an active community member, I am confident in my saying that the community, for sure, has the capacity to address the challenge.  There are already so many proposals that align with the goals of the proposed challenge setting. In fact in this exact Fund, there are more then 15 proposals within different challenges considering the Metaverse space. From my point of view, the success of the challenge, for sure, would attract many new and innovative ideas. It  is also very interesting to see and open call to join the challenge team within the proposal description. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unfortunately, there are no obvious success criteria or key metrics that are described fairly well and will help the voter bring this proposal into the Project Catalyst space. Some questions that arised when reading the strategic goals of the proposal are: \n--> How are you going to measure the acceleration, growth and evolution of the ecosystem and what do you define as there words?\n--> How many people will you need for your training? Where are these people going to be found? How are you going to train them and for what purpose?\nI would like the vision of the proposal to be a lot more clear but because of the fact that the team can work on these points if the proposal gets on the next Fund, i don't think we should penalize them badly.
