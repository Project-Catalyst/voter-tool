In this way, the proposal in question fits the goals of the challenge. Regarding the work that will be applied to achieve the objective, we have that the amount of capital ($4,000) requested is plausible.\n\nIt is not an idea with strong innovative characteristics, but it certainly fits well with the proposals of the challenge and is quite relevant. There is a concern of the author to demonstrate what the purpose of the project will be, that is, it is not only intended to carry out the translation of the materials, it is also indicated what benefits will be achieved with this realization.\n\nHowever, already in the explanation of these possible benefits, we can perceive a lack of greater depth in the elucidations. For example, in the question about the main risks for the delivery of the project, the answer was that perhaps the participation of the users of these new materials is not very great at first, and that it would be necessary to continue promoting the benefits of Cardano. But what would these new promotions look like? What changes would be implemented in relation to the previous phase?\n\nAs we will see in the continuity of the analysis, this lack of specificity will become a very considerable problem for the project to become more viable.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the professional involved in the project, it was not possible to find any contact link or curriculum to confirm the experience indicated by the author at the beginning of the proposal (10 years of experience in development). Thus, we do not have a clear indication that the proposal has a reasonable chance of being successful.\n\nAdditionally, it was not stated at any time that another person would be involved in the project, to be responsible, for example, for the dissemination of the materials being generated or even to monitor their adoption by the Chinese community. We also note that in terms of budget detail, one point does not make sense. $4000 is requested for the project and two costs are mainly cited: cost for the translation and cost of time to establish communications that promote Cardano. But what funds would be allocated to cover the costs of these communications, if the stipulated budget was spent entirely on translation?\n\nTaking into account all these factors, it is not clear to point out that this project has a sufficient organization to fulfill its objectives. It would be interesting if the budget details were better structured, if information proving the author's experience were made available and if there was also someone on the team (or at least there was a strategy) to better trace the path of dissemination of the translated materials and the impacts benefits of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the metrics used to measure the impact and success of the project, two main aspects were indicated. Although these are possible parameters to understand about the adhesion of materials, the impact and engagement around the project result are not very measurable in these ways.\n\nThe first idea is about capturing detailed information about the people who are accessing the site with the translated materials. But as the purpose of the project is to impact the people of the Chinese community in a way that this captured attention is converted into the use of Cardano's ecosystem, it seems essential that metrics to observe this future engagement were established. For example, a search for the number of new initiatives using Cardano's technology to solve problems in the Chinese community. And these metrics for looking at later engagement have not been proposed.\n\nThe second strategy, GitHub commit, was also a little vague. What information would be being posted on GitHub, and what is the purpose/utility of this information in the scope of measuring project success?", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7315, "q0": "The proposal meets the requirements of the challenge very well, because it will translate into Chinese articles that explain Plutus, Cardano, Haskell and SPOs, as I understand it. These are already existing articles in English, and the proponent intends to make such content accessible to Chinese speakers. I think this is the kind of thing that we are really looking for in the challenge, we want to encourage the use of our blockchain in East Asia, benefiting its residents and also making Cardano popular there, and by providing some guides on how to understand the languages computational tools used by us and how the pools work (how to acquire Ada and delegate them), we are certainly encouraging China's residents to enter the Cardano ecosystem, fully benefiting the country. This could generate employment, if those people who have contact with the articles are already in the technology area, there is no shortage of developer vacancies for Cardano's various projects, I believe that in relation to the number of vacancies, the workforce is still scarce, so it's a good idea to educate people in strategic places, like China. The benefits for its population are undeniable. The proponent also says that he will contact Start ups that have blockchain transactions to consider using Cardano, I didn't feel very confident about how this could be done (needed a more detailed explanation here, I think), but if that possible, it will be an exponential gain for our community. In fact, the proposal aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge and does it in a direct and simple way, so in my opinion it deserves maximum marks in terms of impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, this part of the proposal was not good, in my opinion. Starting with the fact that the proponent says he will work alone, he claims to have experience as a developer, but we don't know if he has any experience with translation, which is the root of the issue here. What country is he from? How did you learn Chinese? Is it your mother tongue? Do we have some examples of your previous work, to prove what is said? We would also need to understand what kind of connection it has with the Cardano ecosystem: whether it develops within our blockchain technologies or not, whether it invests in Ada, how this person establishes a bridge with the rest of the community, and so on. In my opinion, it would be more appropriate if he hired a professional translator or at least provided some proof that he is prepared to do this job. The author does not provide a very detailed roadmap, it is said that translated articles will be delivered approximately every 2 days, and the amount of articles he expects to deliver in the month. But how many months would this work take? It's not possible to calculate your salary as we don't know if it would last 2, 3 or 4 months, I don't know. I would like to better understand the process of how he would get in touch with start ups too, how would he get a space between them? How would it pique your interest in Cardano? And as for funding, it's entirely about his salary, that is, how much he'll earn to translate the articles and contact these companies. But as I said, without knowing the amount of content to be translated, there is also no way to understand the value of working hours. Therefore, I believe that the author could review this part of his proposal, work in more detail, in order to increase confidence in the feasibility of the project. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This part of the proposal also left something to be desired, unfortunately. The proponent cites a very vague way for us to understand if his proposal was successful, which would be for Chinese speakers to understand how Cardano works, how to develop projects on the blockchain and expand our ecosystem. That is indeed what success would be, but in a very abstract perspective. It would be necessary for us to understand these goals on a smaller scale, for example, how many people does he intend to reach per month? How could we find out if those involved with these articles are actually learning about our blockchain and putting it into practice? I think it would be necessary to establish a notion that is both numerical (expectation of people to be reached in a certain amount of time) and qualitative (how, in fact, reading these articles has interfered with your way of seeing blockchain and if they are actively participating in our community ). It would also be necessary to monitor the translation process, that is, if the proponent would in fact be delivering a translated article every 2 days, as he promises. In addition, it would be important for a Chinese speaker in the ecosystem to be able to verify that the articles are translated correctly and adequately. So yes, we could audit the proposal with more specificity. Therefore, my conclusion is: no, based on the information given during the proposal, it is not satisfactorily auditable. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 228, "q0": "Translating Plutus, Haskell and Cardano related manuals into Mandarin Chinese is an excellent way to bring more Asian users to our community, since not all Asians are fluent in English and since Plutus is such a new programming language, there is hardly any information in English, which makes its adoption very difficult.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer indicates to have 10 years of experience as a developer, which is extremely important to translate a technical manual, since it is not enough to be able to speak the language.\nAdditionally, the amount requested is extremely low, and it is clear that this person wants to contribute to our community, so I am sure that his work will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer mentions the use of a web page with statistics from google and baidu (chinese search engine), which will allow to visualize the amount of visits received by the page.

The challenge setting states that proposals should aim to grow cardano\u2019s influence in east asia, and this proposal does exactly that from the developer side. I imagine that translating the Plutus documents into Chinese would help many individuals because it makes the information more accessible to a huge audience \u2013 Chinese is one of the most spoken languages in the world, so the potential impact is huge. More individuals who have the necessary Plutus knowledge to work on cardano projects would be a huge benefit to the ecosystem as a whole because there could be so many more projects going on at the same time, which would make the cardano ecosystem a better place for everyone. Hopefully, this proposal will lead to more Chinese developers who will also contribute their ideas to catalyst in the future. The proposer has acknowledged that their short term reach could be smaller than anticipated, and I agree. However, the proposer has come up with the solution of continuing to promote cardano.

In the future, it would help me and voters have more faith in the proposal if the proposer provided more information about themselves with more specific information, such as exactly how many years of developer experience the proposer has. The proposer has set the goal of publishing new documents every 2-3 days, and I think that this is achievable since they currently are only a single person. Their output of a constantly updated website is also achievable. With regards to the budget, I would encourage the proposer to add a more detailed breakdown of the budget in the future. As of right now, I don\u2019t know exactly how much of the requested 4000 will be divided between what tasks.

Additionally, I would encourage the proposer to include some more specific quantitative KPIs so that the cardano community can have an exact comparison number to make sure the proposal was successful. I know that it is hard to set a goal before the project has begun, but any specific number would do just so there is a reference point in the future.
