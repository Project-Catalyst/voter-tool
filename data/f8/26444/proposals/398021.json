It does not get boring and helps the recipient of the information more excited. The Philippines is a very populous community of over 112 million people. Moreover, this is also a country where people's interest in Blockchain is huge. The successful proposal will help Cardano reach out more to this community, thereby helping Cardano lay a stronger foundation in Southeast Asia.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Pinky Manzano is a person who has very good writing skills and has a lot of experience in this field.

This character must then represent a fictitious cardano. This project will mainly be shared on social media. The target group for this project is the Philippines because these people spend the most hours a day on social media. I think this comes across as childish to people who work professionally with cardano. By having the character speak in English, a large part of the target group will not understand the information. The project would have a greater impact if translators were hired directly to translate the information into the major languages in Asia. It is assumed that there are no risks to successfully deliver the project. There is nothing in it that the project may be carried out in these areas. There may be local authorities against the project.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Pinky Manzano is the only team member who will be working on the project. I think it would be useful to hire some translators to translate the project into other languages. Pinkey has relevant experience. (account management, marketing, written a book) I think Pinkey lacks the educational skills to make a useful character. A timeline has been included in which it is stated per week what needs to be done. I think it will be difficult to build a decent website in 2 weeks. There is a clear budget overview that states what the costs are to complete this project. I think a budget of $4950 is very tight. Risks such as the language barrier have not been taken into account enough. It is also assumed that enough advertising can be made via social media. It would be useful to involve schools in the project to see if the content is understandable.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The milestones are included in the proposal.

Creation of Character - achieve a good feedback minimum of xx % in Twitter poll (example) or another platform of choice\n2. The website gets a minimum of xxx visits within 3 months of launch or growing visitors\n3. The social media accounts (Twitter?) followers growth of xx % per month\n4.
