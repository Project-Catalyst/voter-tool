It is possible to present as one of the differentials of the project the platform that will be used, GoodWall. We realize that it is an already established medium to transmit knowledge, having millions of users and reaching several countries. As a result, several barriers are instantly broken, as a possible need to develop refined dissemination strategies. With the growth of popularity among young people in this region in relation to Cardano, it is possible to perceive several benefits to our ecosystem, such as a greater emergence of ideas to solve local problems that can result in possible proposals. Therefore, the impact of this project is positive in the long term. And as the app has a good part of its audience being in Asia, we can also see a real scalability of the materials produced by this project. Regarding the concepts that were structured and also considering the professionals involved, we see that the budget being requested of $22,500 seems consistent.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Perhaps the biggest difference in relation to this project, and what makes us believe in its viability, is the infrastructure behind the educational mission described here. We noticed several nuances in the team plan that go beyond the singular purpose of producing educational materials. Several other organizations and concerns are cited for this content to be taken full advantage of by its users. In this context, we can see a great focus on the design of the project, as well as the support that will be given by the team during the process, with the answers to questions and collecting feedback from users. Furthermore, the periods for carrying out the main tasks (preparation, execution and results) are well defined. Another positive factor is the constant involvement of the team with Cardano to understand which concepts to use in the production of materials. In short, we can see that the project is not just creating material, but a path of knowledge, which even motivates its participants to be active, which seems to increase the feasibility of the proposal.\n\nRegarding the professionals involved in the project, we see that the team has impressive characteristics for carrying out the work. There are several attributes they have, such as planning, project management, marketing and creation of educational content. We also see that the professionals involved are generally very experienced. For example, Michaela Usakova has more than 12 years of experience in product and brand design and other attributes. Additionally, we see that the professionals involved have made their resumes available and also a section on the GoodWall website where you can learn more about them (https://www.goodwall.io/about).\n\nRegarding the details of the budget, we see a consistent distribution of capital between different areas for the development of the project. It is interesting to see that the team was even concerned with reserving part of the budget for awards, encouraging even more public engagement.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Good ways of tracking progress were established, as well as ways of measuring the effectiveness of these ways. We can say this from the parameters exposed as indicative of development: impressions, engagement and submission of challenge materials. These three factors demonstrate well whether:\n\nPeople watched the video (which is on average well matched by impressions)\n\nEngagement was generated from that (people liked what they watched and reacted to it)\n\nEngagement was effective to the point where people produced materials on the topic (this is accompanied by the submission of materials)\n\nAnd in terms of success, we noted that numbers were given to make these earlier concepts quantifiable. We noticed this from the expected numbers of engagement (30,000), impressions (1,000,000) and challenges delivered (2,000).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1146", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 5, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1261, "q0": "As a platform with a huge customer base, I believe Goodwall has the ability to create a considerable impact. \nImplementation of the proposal helps in onboarding a large community to Cardano and Catalyst along with educating youth on Blockchain tech as a whole.\nThis is a great proposal for creating the next generation of Cardano developers and community leaders.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very experienced and I have no doubt that they are capable of implementing the proposal in terms of community outreach.\nThe reason I gave a rating of 4 instead of 5 is that there is no one mentioned in the team that has specific experience related to blockchain tech or blockchain education.\nIt\u2019d be really helpful to add the team member who is responsible for creating the specific educational content mentioned in the proposal.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The audibility of the proposal is clear and specific in terms of impact created. \nThe end report shared in the proposal is very detailed and paints a clear picture of the process involved.\nTo add to that, the number of impressions, engagements and challenge entries goes a long way in terms of auditing the proposal\u2019s impact.\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1330", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2925, "q0": "Looking at the apps & the channel of Goidwall which has over 2+ members,  the aim of educating the youth in East Asia between the ages of 16 -24yrs on the ABC or basics on blockchain, it's application  & social impact possibilities are highly recommendable.\nI believe,  such education to the East Asia youth,  will go a long way to identify talent/skills, abilities/capabilities to be tapped & sharpened for equality & inclusive opportunities for all. \nThis,  will drastically enhance the maximisation of potential which will largely impact positively on East Asia society ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Implementation is highly likely to be successful with its programming with stipulated time to be achieved. \nFirstly, is the Preparation Prog., where resources are gathered n put together towards its execution & its duration is from 8-12 solid weeks. \nNext, the Execution Prog. & its the action or demonstration stage n for 16weeks.\nLastly,  the Prog.

In addition, the completeness and detail of each question they answer shows how serious and confident they are about the project they are going to run, regardless of the existence of this Goodwall app. First, we see that this goodwall is aimed at young people, especially Gen Z and also young entrepreneurs about what blockchain is and how it works. The initial steps they took were extraordinary, such as conducting a Dialogue with Goodwall's Student Council, regular communication, counseling, focus groups and post program surveys to make this application more relevant and increase scalability to be even better in terms of infrastructure and UI. /UX. With their long term vision expressed for the next 6-12 months on how to target the market, whatever they are doing is a good step to get serious about expanding the blockchain community and education about blockchain. What I admire about this proposal is the information about micro tasking for youth who participate in this program which gives us an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat they are doing and what they will achieve. Addition of key objectives to be more convincing and provide a brief but concise and clear description of this proposal.

In the end, The problem statement can't be more specific and The solution statement is sufficient to meet/relate well about the problem statement that they crafted perfectly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team proves to be very well prepared to carry it out, because they provide a small individual description of who they are, which is summed up by their contacts on social networks, making real the possibility of making direct contact and getting to know them better. About the script, they present which phases would need to be completed to reach their goals, but I believe that these phases could be explored further. For example, \"Promotional assets design\", what kind of marketing strategy what you would use ? (If social media, what kind of social media, and how do you exploit it to make it more attention?). t is always good to explain each term in detail, so that people who are not familiar with it fully understand the proposal. In relation to the budget, I believe that the level of detail here was medium and still needs more detail for every section such as the budgeting plan, in promotional budget --> needs to be breakdown more (for example digital marketing by facebook ads for 1k dollars, and so on). In the end,  We know what each part of the project will cost, and regarding variable costs, they are very well calculated, broken down and explained so that we can understand exactly what would happen here. So I think the only thing I would suggest would be a little more detail in the phases.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I found it interesting how concerned the team is with auditability. They are not only careful to pass on information that would help the rest of the community to monitor the progress of the project, but they drew up an aubitability plan in which they would monitor of Impressions - Impressions are defined as the number of times branded content has been displayed on screen.\nEngagement - Engagement is defined as the number of times branded content has been liked/commented on Goodwall.\nChallenge Entries - Challenge Entry is defined as an uploaded video or picture related to the program. And they are also giving us example of their report to show how they report about the result of each KPI. However, there is something odd that I found, namely regarding the timeframe of the KPI they will achieve, namely the unavailability of for example every few months it is achieved. So they have to determine for example the KPI of 1 million impressions must be achieved for each post within a month or I suggest SMART goals for instance, the goal to build the addon is \"S\"pecific, \"M\"easurable, \"A\"chievable, \"R\"easonable and \"T\"imebound \n to make this project more auditable.

I really like the idea of starting dialogue amongst the younger generation because it allows the students to get involved in projects that they are passionate about. Beginning to teach students about cardano early will allow them to develop their passions for the ecosystem and eventually contribute to the ecosystem in their own different ways. The students can then also improve their own communities with blockchain use, which is another of the challenge setting\u2019s goals. \n\nThe objectives for the students that were listed in the proposal are almost similar to catalyst school but for a younger audience, which I think is really important. By engaging the students now, they will develop their skills, which will lead to big creations and developments in the future. Even if students from this program do not end up creating their own catalyst projects, I do think that the educational part of the project will encourage students to interact with cardano in other ways, such as voting, staking, or even becoming a CA/vCA. In the end, this proposal will help to grow cardano from the younger members of east asian society.

I think that all the items on the list can be achieved in the given timeframe. It is good that the project has been subdivided into three different categories: development, execution, and results. This way, the cardano community can see what exactly will be happening when. One minor question I do have for the proposers is whether the three sections in the timeline will be happening in sequential order or in tandem? This small detail is unclear to me after reading the proposal. \nWith regards to the budget, I think that the proposers have done a great job of breaking down the funds and listing out where money will be going to. It is very clear to me what parts of the project will cost how much money. Although I do not have experience with running an educational company, I think the funds requested are reasonable given the scope of the project and the number of team members working on it.
