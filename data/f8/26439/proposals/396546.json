The campaign brief emphasizes that CAs should have their assessment score favoring proposals that: \n1. Have a budget.\n2. Do not exceed 5% of the total Challenge budget.\n3. That account for local needs and infrastructure concerns.\n4. That show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery.\n5. That are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainable practices.\n\nMy justification is that the proposal satisfies all the above challenge emphasis except for point two (Do not exceed 5% of the total challenge budget). The budget of this proposal is $35000 which equates to 7& of the total challenge budget. \nI suggest that the proposer, in next iterations, should pay attention to every single challenge emphasis in order to grab all 5 stars.\n\nThe proposal clearly identifies a problem needing to be solved in this challenge setting. Usually, when we say \"Hub\", the attention lays on brick and mortar structure that's been put up to house a certain group of people for whatever purpose it may be. These structures normally requires huge sum of money (not less than $100K) to completely build and furnace and this is indeed  a problem for scalability especially when you consider the total budget of this challenge ($500K). It literally means that only 5 or less hubs could be established out of Fund 8. However, the solution provided by this proposal, I think is genius. From the YouTube video provided, it's clear that this structure is not built out of a mortar and brick but out of recyclable materials  and duration for assembling could take not more than 48 hours. \nThis is absolutely fantastic, as key metrics aligns with the challenge setting and clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano Ecosystem through the concept delivering information through the hub to people who would not otherwise have the access to a host of services that would have previously been unavailable to many of these rural communities.\n\nI wish this proposal all the best of luck!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I will start off with the budget aspect of the feasibility criteria. In the exception of the challenge setting placing a precise cap on how much should be requested by proposers, the budget sits well and is feasible for the successful implementation of the project. The budget, $35K, is broken down to showcase how the money would be spent in view of project implementation. The only thing I'm wondering to know, which was not stated in the proposal is how many CIK is going to be built out of this budget. However, from the BOXABL website, it looks like $50K could be used to secure one Kiosk, which means a least of 3 kiosks could be achieved out of the stated budget. This, I believe would be awesome prototypes to help the proposal come back for more to do more.\n\nI have been an active member of Catalyst since Fund 3 and I can boldly say that the core team behind this proposal is able to successfully implement the project if funded. \nAs stated in the proposal, Josh F, has been an active member of Catalyst since Fund 2 and that's evident to his IdeaScale profile which states that he's been a member since 17/10/20 with 16 ideas posted so far. My research indicates that he's successfully implemented 1 idea (West Africa Proposer Outreach) even though his IdeaScale profile is tagged 0 idea implemented. For me, it indicates that he has the capacity to further implement more projects.\nWada, on the other hand is also a community in the catalyst community with 25+ members of diversified expertise that's known for their collaborative efforts in driving the adoption of Cardano in Africa. From their website and the Project Catalyst - Funded Projects Report, I could tell that they've implemented quite a good number of projects both from individual and collaborative perspectives. This also confirms to me that they're a good stakeholder to have on this project for successful implementation.\nThe description on the website of the relevant partner (ADA sustainability) \"Sustainable ADA is a space where you can learn more about the transformative potential and impact of Cardano & collaborate with others to receive guidance, access to tools, and community support while integrating solutions to challenges faced by you, your business, or your community.\" is an indication of indeed their relevance to the success of the project.\n\nOn personal note, I clicked all links provided by the proposer to verify their validity and efficiency and the outcome is that all links are valid and efficient.\nThe proposer knows clearly the number and type of team members required to have the project implemented successfully.\nA sensible and conductible plan that shows what and how it's going to be implemented has also been showcased by the proposal.\nRisk assessment has been done as well and it gives the proposal a lift.\n\nThe proposer has done an excellent job with regards to feasibility and hence my 5 star scoring.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "According to the proposal, 6 months after funding, the CIK should be readily accessible to the public with at least 100 service events hosted. I think this is a clear milestone that can be measured by the community. Since is  a product (Kiosk), it should be visible for everyone to see, feel and touch if need be. Clear metrics that defines what the community should expect out of this proposal at the end of the stated roadmap is well written and I strongly agree that it'll enhance the work of auditing for anyone who picks up the project proposal.\nThe proposer does well by projecting in the proposal what success would look like after 1 year of implementation and I am certain that 500 people could be serviced by the CIK.\nThe proposal problem statement \"The large capital requirements for a brick-and-mortar community hub are prohibitive to wide scale adoption.\" gives a clear description of the targeted problem whilst the solution statement \"Create a stationary minimum-viable hub unit that can be set up at a relatively low cost. Flat-packed, portable and set up in under 24 hours.\" also clearly addresses the problem. This is so because, immediately you read these two statements, a clear image of what the project is seeking to do is exposed to you.\nI do not see any fault that could prompt me to deduce a star from my rating, hence my final score, 5 stars for auditability. Good job done! and good luck to the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_69", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 479, "q0": "The core of Cardano is for technical people with blockchain expertise. Hence the need for users on the ground level to make the technology a reality brings the need for the Hub. I just love to hear the name ''Hub in a Box'', this is exclusively in line with the challenge's purpose. This proposal shows to qualify on the important criteria needed under this challenge given activities that seek to account for local needs and infrastructure concerns. There will be the provision to construct small scale, cost-effective hubs that will create access to a host of services like DID services, Exchange services and mobile money, wallet set-up and Defi banking and many services. Also, this proposal seeks to use local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices. Taking a look at the problem statement which mainly looks at the cost and time of building a brick and mortar community hub, this proposal looks to get a set up in under 24 hours all things being equal. This is just an amazing project that needs over 100% rating for its rationale for impact. Reading deeper into the proposal, you can clearly articulate the great value this project will have on the Cardano ecosystem and which has a positive impact on the proposal being able to scale to address future challenges. Another important criterion we have to bear in mind is the success metrics that channels to the key performance indicators(KPIs). As we all know the KPI serves as a measure to ensure long term performance which helps with operational achievements. First of all, there is good evidence that this project satisfies the minimum viable hub(MVH) and thus the smallest effective unit for a hub. I strongly believe in effectiveness when it comes to working in small groups and this project seeks to attain that. It also can be seen that the team really has an understanding of their target audience and that is also a key metric. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The world is now trying to go green to save ourselves from environmental toxins and pollutants. Given this, the use of recyclable materials is vital to ensure sustainability concerning this project to achieve a sense of feasibility. The proposer has laid out its detailed plan and a concise timeline which will help the team achieve success and also accurately project their reach both physically and online within a period of time. Taking a close look at the financials which is a key model of sustainability, there seems to be a well-developed budget with a detailed breakdown. Despite being okay with the content of the budget, I was expecting to see the budget cost versus the cost to launch. So can I know what the team will do if only 1/5 is to be applied as the cost to launch due to demand pressure of acquiring funds from the treasury?. Overall, the proposer has a good potential partnership a project can have to scale well and given his potential partnership, there are world mobile, Boxabl, Raspberry Pi, Brightbox. With regards to technicalities, I strongly believe in the WADA team's support to assist with their pool of great expertise in the field of human and technological resources. Considering the several risk factors that were outlined in the proposal and the provided means of mitigating those risks through strategies that will help either to avoid, reduce or transfer those risks when they occur shows readiness by the proposer to achieve success. Realistically, the project seems to have a workable timetable that will ensure successful completion. Kudos", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has really provided sufficient information needed by stakeholders of the Cardano community to help get clarity in his proposal. A very well laid out plan has been outlined with the timelines for delivery looking at the first 30 days, followed by the next 3-6 months projections. As a criterion in relation to this Scale-Up challenge setting, a proposal should not exceed 5% of the total challenge budget and I can very well say that this proposal has met that target with their total budget outlined. The key performance indicators that explain the success of this proposal ha been touched on and some of the metrics that were in the proposal are the MVH principle, having a financial sustainability model and also having an understanding of their target audience.

The proposal raised the idea of building a Cardano Information Kiosk (CIK) but solved many related issues in it at the same time. It provides services of Cardano platform such as DID service, Stakepool, Defi bank...to facilitate community participation in rural and disadvantaged areas. I think this is a very useful idea to develop Cardano's community network far and wide, creating a balanced and equal development, leaving no one behind. The proposal is the answer to the difficulty. Difficulty in spreading Blockchain technology, including the Cardano platform, to disadvantaged and underdeveloped areas compared to the rest of the world. In particular, this proposal is extremely feasible for worldwide scaling in the development journey with Cardano. It not only helps the Cardano community grow stronger but also has a very human meaning in the development. general development of society.\nThe proposal correctly identified a few issues in the challenge. Present the problem clearly and convincingly. The proposal identified the problem of helping the Cardano community grow by expanding its reach with the Cardano Information Kiosk (CIK) idea. There are very practical Cardano platform-related services for participants. You guys have built on the success of the Internet Kiosk idea to develop, helping the Cardano community to grow widely even in difficult areas. You have demonstrated a deep understanding of the Cardano platform to painstakingly design the services included in your solution such as DID Service, Charging and Repair, Stakepool Service, Oracle Data Provider, Service exchange, and mobile money, Set up Defi banking and wallet... To me, it's a \u201cbig value small house\u201d! So your goals are also clearly stated: Providing information to those who do not have access, providing services that many rural areas do not have, \u201cBanking without banking\u201d service. In particular, I am impressed with the extremely civilized solution that is the network of CIKs that will be owned by the community members themselves, jointly organized and managed by smart contracts - This is what the platform Cardano is moving forward, very possible. This proves that you have a very in-depth study of not only the Cardano platform but also the characteristics of the countryside, where there are many difficulties in accessing new technology.

However, I would like you to present specific results with numbers, the more convincing it will be. The proposal has identified several risks during the implementation process and proposed solutions to overcome all of those risks. Your proposal also identifies four major risks in doing your job. The first is 'security', this is a big issue that the community cares about and you guys come up with a very professional and highly academic solution to this risk, that is, CIK will have a high IoT security system. provision as well as remote locking and SMS alerts for tampering. As a source of connectivity, the 'always-on' nature of the hub prevents any tampering or corruption; the second is \u201clocal demand\u201d, This is the decisive factor for the success or failure of any project and the nature of your proposal is also an answer, specifically you propose a solution with CIK's portability thanks to its form-factor design. flat package, it benefits from both the flexibility of a mobile hub and the community presence of a traditional mall. By renting a moving van for a day, with power tools available, a CIK will be able to be moved and repositioned in a few days; The third risk is \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d, this is an objective risk that you also have a very feasible solution to, All CIKs will be assessed according to sustainability assessment, in terms of production. , using recyclable materials and transporting them to the site. CIK will use renewable energy sources to power its operations. And the last risk is the \u201csustainability of the project\u201d, you guys come up with a very creative solution, the financial model of the CIK project (Future Design, Specification, and Material Orders). hybridization from future CIK holders and crowdfunding to build local CIKs) and CIK's financial model itself (Services provided by CIK and advertising from local businesses on CIK side panel, In addition, I would like to advise you of a potential risk that is fire, explosion, I hope you pay attention to this risk!. \" I rate: 4 point\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has given clear, detailed, and reasonable work implementation timelines with specific goals.

In other words bringing the action to the people. the use of iOT locks and tracking is also great and could eventually be tracked on the blockcahin. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Integrating with Raserry Pi and World Mobile is a great way to synergize since they are also on the ground locally to distribute connectivity and computing power to Africa and other remote locations. \nThe temmembers involved in the project Wata are active and have shown a good understaning of Cardano ecosystem. \nFinally the buget around preparing the mobile Kiosk is ambitious and very competitif. In my opinion as an engineer I would recommend at least a prototype phase where 1 - 2 units are fully built before starting to receive orders. \nOverall the idea is based on previously tested and implemented technologies. They overcome many risks by including locks and security mechanism. Very impressive and overall covergage of the proposal. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The physcial aspect of the Kiosk and building this is part of the proposal would be easy to audit. Simple picutres of the final design and built kiosk would prove that the propsal was acheived and completed satisfactory. \nAlso the short / medium / long term milestones of visits and people is well described. \nFinally I would like to see a small comment on the financials for setting a Kiosk cost price or material cost. As this is the majority of the proposal fund.

I've lived in an area where certain services where available only a specific day of the week (when a bank employee, the mailman or the cobbler was in town), and this Kiosks could enable the same thing for Cardano based services.  If World Mobile Network is successful, this could fill a void while they reach more territories. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a well tought-out plan, but there are significant risks that affect feasibility, the biggest one in my opinion is the reliance on a yet-to-be-found provider to actually manufacture the kiosk. If that's dealt with, the rest of the plan seems well within the reach of the proposer. \nI appreciate the budget covers design and build of a prototype, but I'm concerned about the overall project feasibility if the stated costs can't go significantly down for production (e.g. $2500 for the IoT security system with GPS and remote locking). The proposer might consider a speced-down version, as I guess the kiosks would require an operator, so maybe physical security is not that relevant.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposed metrics are appropiate, and more importantly, measure significant impact to both the Cardano and local communities served by the kiosk.
