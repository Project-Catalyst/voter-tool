Therefore, the voting process will be more favorable. Due to the increasing number of proposals, the increasing information, this is a proposal that will bring a very positive effect to the evaluation process of voters. It has a very good impact on the selection of proposals and the sustainable development of the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nIdentify a few problems of the challenge, make reasonable arguments.\n\nCreate short 2-minute English videos and podcasts containing information analyzed for 25% of recommendations in each Catalyst Fund. I think this is a very useful and suitable solution. Creating a short video and podcast in less than 2 minutes will give the most core, concise, concise information of the proposal accompanied by an analysis that will greatly help voters easily update, understand the proposal and vote more accurately, more quickly.\n\nSome risks have been raised and there are solutions to all risks.\nThe proposed group presented two risks:\nfirst, it is possible that in the process of analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information, there will be some quality proposals disqualified that will affect the quality of the information delivery process as well as the electoral process of voters.\n\nThe second risk is that the group is concerned about the fund being disbursed by ADA, so when the ADA price decreases, it can affect the implementation of the proposing group. It is clear to me that this proposing team has experience in this area, so I have come up with a full range of optimal solution to complete the implementation of the proposal under any circumstances.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal has clear, reasonable timeline with specific goals. The objectives and tasks in this proposal are clear. It specifies each job to do in fund 9 and fund 10. The team has the knowledge and experience of implementing proposals in Fund 6 and Fund 7. I found the goals and tasks they proposed perfectly appropriate and feasible. Fund proposals of less than 20% every expenditure is explained. All expenditures in the proposal implementation plan are detailed by the team specifically associated with each task. With the team coming up with a spending plan that closely follows the tasks and objectives of the proposal, I find the level of transparency and success of this proposal very high.\nMember is assigned, appropriate experience, identity is easy to authenticate. The proposed team is full of experienced members in the blockchain. They also have a deep understanding fo the Cardano ecosystem, members are community manager and stake pool moderator at TIGER pool. They are Catalyst (CA) and vCA community advisors-having evaluated more than 1000 proposals in Fund 4, Fund 5, Fund 6 and Fund 7. They have proposed 2min reviews and they have funded in Fund 6 and Fund 7. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are KPIs/indicators, they are easy to measure and check. This proposal clearly defines the important indicators for the whole process and also clearly states the specific number that must be achieved after each disbursement. With detailed meticulousness to each of the smallest tasks, the level of transparency and success of the proposal is very high. We can easily measure and evaluate the proposal at the proposed stage as well as when going into implementation. Success has been identified, successful testing.\nThe proposal clearly describes the success and purposes it brings. It specifies the measurements in specific numbers for each timeline. The average viewing time is 1.5 minutes per video. Average viewing percentage: 75%. New registration rate: 10%. 600 proposals are made videos in fund 10. The proposing team has had some funded proposals involved in supporting the community's approach to evaluating the proposals in Fund 6, Fund 7. The team also has an app to help the community filter and evaluate recommendations in an easy, effective way. The videos guide the community to reach out, evaluate proposals in fund 6, fund 7. This is a clear, feasible, highly practical proposal. The team has the experience and enough personnel as well as a clear specific roadmap to complete the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1638", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7284, "q0": "I think this idea is brilliant, but I have my doubts as to whether it fits well with the goals of this challenge. The present challenge aims to finance projects that help to disseminate Cardano-related content in specific communities, taking into account local characteristics such as the language that is spoken and cultural factors. In my view, the challenge of hubs is like that of new members on board, being a more micro view of the thing. The proposal in question aims to summarize proposals launched in funds 9 and 10, as we can clearly see in the following excerpt: \u201ceach short video/podcast lasting approximately 2 minutes/video containing information compiled, analyzed and evaluated for about 25% of the proposals in each Catalyst Fund\u201d. I think this idea would fit better in the challenge of Dapps, because if these summaries are coined in some application, it would certainly be a platform that would benefit the Cardano community in full; because it would make it simpler and more accessible for us to know what (at least a part) of the proposals of the chosen funds are about. In other words, it would be a Dapp that would add value to the community from the moment that the engagement of its members would be boosted, because in fact, it is very complicated for us voters to read so many proposals; there is no time or patience for this, there are lots and lots of information to be absorbed in a short space of time. That's why I believe that the idea of \u200b\u200bsummarizing these contents in a few minutes, in a more practical format to be consumed, such as videos and podcasts, is extremely relevant. I just really don't think it has as much to do with the challenge because it would be a way to benefit the Cardano community as a whole, and not a way to create a hub, to bring specific people together in a specific context, as is sought in this challenge. If this proposal were aimed at a particular community, I believe it would be more aligned with what we are looking for. One observation I would like to make in this part of the impact is on the issue of the number of proposals reviewed. The proponent states that \u201cbuilding a list of 500 to 600 proposals depends on the 2Min Review community. As a result, there is a potential risk that multiple high-quality proposals will be filtered out of this List. To deal with this, the 2MIN Review team has set aside 5% of the total budget as a reserve to ensure the quality of the content.\u201d How would this reserved money contribute to ensuring the quality of the chosen proposals? I'll give it a 4, because the idea is really good, but it doesn't fit, at least in my opinion, 100% with this challenge. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I found the division of the script of this proposal very interesting. Here, we have two faces that complement and depend on each other: goals and tasks. In the goals part, the proponent explains what the specific objectives are for that phase of the project, what they want to achieve until then, and in the tasks part, we are informed which activities would need to be developed for those things to be conquests. I think this division was great, because usually people just explain what they want to achieve, and they don't make it clear how that would be possible. My only suggestion at this point is precisely that the temporal division should be made more exact. We know exactly what is intended and how it could be achieved, but we have no information on when these things would be done. When fund 9 starts, how much time is expected to elapse before proposals are filtered (choose proposals that are translated and summarized)? And the review of articles? In which months of 2022 would each of these things be achieved? It is not possible to understand the time that each task would take to be executed, nor in which months of the year they are expected to be ok. So this script issue prevents us from having a complete understanding of the process. Now talking about the funding, I really have no criticism at this point, the team explains in a rare wealth of detail how the $50,000 (approximately) that was requested would be achieved. With this, we know the hourly value of the professionals involved, as well as the specific price of video production, administration of the youtube channel, etc. In my opinion, this part of the proposal is perfect. Finally, speaking of the team, we also know a lot of information about each stakeholder, so there is a lot of credibility and confidence that they are prepared to successfully execute the proposal. To begin with, they are a well-experienced team, we are informed at the end of the proposal that they have already launched (and been funded, as I understand it) several proposals in previous funds. This fact alone is a good indicator that they have the necessary technical experience to develop this project, but we still have specific information about each of those involved. We know their names, their main functions, a little bit of their work history and we have several social network links where we can get to know them completely, and not only professionally, as they also attach twitter profiles, in some cases. Therefore, the feasibility of the project is very good, my only caveat is that the issue of temporality would be better specified in the script. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is quite high. Regarding the development process, we have 3 main indicators, listed by the bidder: average viewing duration + average percentage viewed + new subscriber. I have been observing that in most of the proposals that I evaluate the authors are very concerned with drawing numerical statistics that will demonstrate in a safe way the success that is obtained in a gradual way. However, I think the most appropriate thing would be that, in addition to such data, which is clearly important, we also constantly monitor the work routine of those involved. Remember the script, where the proponent divides the process into goals and tasks? We also need to audit the tasks, not just the goals. In this way, we would carry out a more complete audit of the process. It is necessary that at least one active member of the Cardano community closely follows the work routine of this team, preferably someone who is already very active in the voting process, so that they can more easily understand whether the partial objectives are being achieved. This person could meet at the end of each month, or week, it depends because everything revolves around the total duration of the project (which is not clear), and in these meetings he or she would relate to the team's work routine, knowing if everything is happening as it should, if the agreed deadlines are being respected, etc. And as for the final scenario, I think the bidder very richly traces the overall success (I've noticed that this bidder is great at detailing what she says, which for me is essential). What remains pending is how the Cardano community will be aware of such information. Will a final report be prepared, explaining whether all intended milestones have been achieved? Will a survey be carried out directly with the community, in order to see if the main objective of the project (facilitating the knowledge of a greater number of proposals at the time of voting) was successfully achieved? Anyway, I would like it to be clearer how the Cardano community would be aware of all the information mentioned. So I think the auditability is great, as are the other two topics in the proposal, just needing a few tweaks to make it perfect. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8722, "q0": "The concept of the proposal is nice, upon reading the title for the first time, I thought a community was going to be created where proposers could join to at least have the opportunity of expressing the length and breadth of their proposals in two (2) minutes recording for the videos to be attached to their proposals so voters can briefly watch and grasp all needed information to make decisions but unfortunately, diving deep into the proposal, I realize that's not the case. The proposed solution doesn't sound too clear to me and it's making it hard for me to determine whether or not this proposal aligns with the challenge setting. \nA better description of the proposed solution and a clear justification on how this proposal seeks to address the challenge as requested by a community member in the comment section should be made by the team in order to ensure successful funding by the community  in the subsequent iterations if not funded for this round. Good luck!", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The presentation of the roadmap is raising some uncertainties for me as to whether or not this project can be implemented successfully. It is stated in this proposal that it is the voters who are expected to utilize this wonderful solution to their problem of not having enough time to read on proposals before making decisions. However, the roadmap doesn't seem to be clearly pointing at that. Except for the fact that they make mention of \"500 videos for 500 proposals uploaded on the 2Min Review YouTube channel before Fund 9's voting deadline.\" which is not clear which particular deadline they are referring to. I think it would be great if they can specify as to whether they're referring to the voting registration deadline or the voting task deadline. By doing so, the feasibility and impact of the project could be measured easily. I do not mean to be harsh if I'm sounding so but I will be extra glad if that can really be expressed for subsequent iterations.\nA total budget of $50.8K looks very reasonable for achieving success with regards to its breakdown but the problem here is that this proposal is requesting for more than 10% of the total challenge budget which breach the emphasize placed on budget request by the challenge setting. To be in the safe zone, I think they should have focused on implementing their roadmap for Fund 9 which had a budget of $23.1K successfully out of Fund 8 round and later propose again n subsequent iterations to come to take care of the Fund 10 roadmap.\nIt is evident that the team behind this proposal has the requisite experience needed to successfully implement the project as all links leading to their individual profiles are valid and efficient.\nFrom the proposal, it's mentioned that they got funding for Fund 6 and Fund 7 which is true. However, from my findings, the Fund 6 project is yet to be completed whilst Fund 7 has no progress report yet. This implies that the team may have the capacity to successfully implement the project but I advise they lay some focus on the successful implementation of the already funded projects too.\nAll the same, I wish this proposal good luck!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. The information provided in the roadmap of this project is too complex and I think it should be broken down into monthly milestones to enhance transparency. For instance, Catalyst requires that there be a monthly report on KPIs by funded proposers, although there are clear goals stated in the roadmap of this proposal, the community has no clue when exactly to expect what and that's where I remain uncertain about the clarity level of this proposal. I will advise that the roadmap of the proposal be broken down into monthly deliverables at least to allow transparency.\nGood luck!", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_69", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1367, "q0": "The number of projects of Catalyst in each next round of funds is much higher, and CAs just only have 07 days to find a suitable, interesting proposal to make an assessment. CAs must read huge information and take a lot of time and be terrible if they are busy, talented people that their time very important and they can make much money with this amount of time. So if we have someone summarize the main point of each proposal and busy CAs can read it, I think it can create a huge impact because the proposal can receive a lot of good or excellent assessments and can improve their job better. I was very excited when I read your idea is create a video in just only 2 minutes to summarize the proposal which I must spend at least 30-60 minutes to cover. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I think if your team can create a qualified video in only 02 minutes for each proposal it is very helpful for CAs, but the quality of the video is also your challenge. So to make voters have more insight, I suggest your team can brief the criteria of the video that you think to make the video qualified. For example, in the first 10 seconds, the video must so the problem and the idea of the proposal can solve this problem, the next 10 seconds will show the team member or their experience,...I think if \u201c2Min Review by Voice for Busy Voter\u201d can show this brief video, then the proposal can be more reliable.\n\nFurthermore, if you create the qualified video, but can not reach enough CA, it can not be achieved our expectations. So to ensure the success of this pr\u1ecdect, I think your team should add a communication plan for the 02 min video, how it can reach a suitable person, which channels are good for this kind of content. I believe that your team acknowledges it when you mention it in the budget, but if it is written in detail plan is better.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To measure the performance of this project, I suggest after Fund9 ends, you should make a survey to ask busy CAs about these videos, it is helpful for them or not. Because maybe the thought of the user is different from what we think, so asking them is the best way to understand rightly and we can get more insight to improve our project in the future.\n\nBut I also agree with the indicators and goals your team uses to measure, with these metrics we can see the behavior of the audience based on the video.

In particular, with the development of more and more Catalyst fund proposals, this proposal will facilitate those who do not have much time to search and evaluate proposals easily and quickly. The proposal correctly identified a few issues in the challenge. Present the problem clearly and convincingly. It presented solutions to a problem in the development of the Cardano community, which is the development of the Catalyst fund's co-advisor. The specific solution of the proposal is to create short 2-minute videos and podcasts that make it easier for co-advisors to access information on proposals in fund challenges. In 2 minutes video / podcast group gives general information, advantages, disadvantages of each recommendation, and put on youtube / spotify.Thus, based on the recommendation engine, the community advisors will shorten the time in searching and evaluating other proposals in the funds so that each community advisor will have access to many proposals. more in the fun, thereby increasing the performance of comments and reviews in their community advisor role. That is proposed by the group to give specific evidence in the presentation with arguments with specific and feasible numbers, with high efficiency. Show that the proposal team has carefully studied the development of proposals across each fund and the needs of the community advisors, how to increase the efficiency of evaluating proposals that meet the requirements of the voters.

The proposed group has pointed out two risks in the process of doing the work and has solutions to overcome and limit those risks. In the first risk, the proposal team pointed out that it is possible to miss quality proposals throughout the fund, this is inevitable and the solution you come up with is to budget for quality assurance, that is. is a viable idea. In the second risk, the proposed team correctly identified the problem that many other proposals also raised, this is true, it is the price fluctuation of ADA Token in the market and you have come up with the right solution. with the current cryptocurrency market, including the ADA Token.\nHowever, I have suggestions for the team on solutions to overcome and limit the risks that you have pointed out. In the first risk, you can only solve one side, which is internal, I suggest that you should separate the product into groups of challenges, it will be effective and highly specialized; In the second risk, you need to come up with a long-term solution, when the price of ADA Token in the market fluctuates strongly, it will ensure the interests of the participants and the success of the proposal.

Therefore, both the quantity and quality of assessment are still limited. Instead of reading the whole proposal, with just 2 minutes, listeners can briefly understand this proposal, helping to evaluate more and be more excited about the evaluation.\nBut the proposal itself also has its problems:\n- When the content is summarized 2 minutes may not cover the full meaning of the project. Because when reviewing a project I have to read very carefully, especially in the cost breakdown and refer to the background of the human resources department. When summaries are available, reviewers are sometimes more irresponsible and negligent.\n\n- Another problem is that many times the person who made 2 Min will bring his or her personal opinion into Youtube videos about recommendations, making it easy for listeners to have no opinion.\nIn summary, I think this is still an acceptable project if the above points are kept in mind.

Specific and very detailed data. We can see many projects that put costs but are very sketchy, completely not understanding what they will do in each item.

If a proposal is more complex, thus requiring more time to be completely understood in order to be reviewed and presented to an audience, means that those complex proposals will have incomplete reviews, possibly leading to misinformation - that is why in Catalyst CAs are being paid per review, not per time spent on writing them, the purpose is quality, not quantity.\nTwo, is the standard price per hour being paid, no matter the work being done - writing, editing, recording etc. Someone who has the equipment and knowledge to do more complex work cannot be paid the same amount as someone who does not need expensive equipment that needs to be maintained or purchased.\nThree: Are the people doing reviews also CAs in the Catalyst community? Will they be paid extra for doing these reviews as well, or are they outside the Cardano Ecosystem as a whole being paid a fraction of the CA work?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs that have been provided are easy to follow, the roadmap is clear and concise making the evaluation of the proposal uncomplicated.

A short video and podcast in which a proposal\u2019s information is analyzed with advantages and disadvantages in English would help voters as well as Cardano community easy to understand that proposal with a covenient way and saving time (a video just 2 minutes long). We well know that a fulfilling detail proposal has never been short, voters need to take time to read through all of it to understand it and summarize its information by themselves then decide that would get good vote or not. If this project is executed successfully, it will help voters to choose proposals to vote better and our community will have more quality projects which are capable to get fund. This is extremely important because increasing the quality of voting is rasing the growth of Cardano system. The proposal is also able to scale to future challenge. For example is that the project can be broaden to summarize 50% (even 75% or more) amount of proposals each Fund. It\u2019s just an example which might be considered if the project would be in collaborations and be supported by partnerships in future, especially the 2Min Review Integrated Platform, which was funded in Fund6, are going to complete soon. \nActually the team is also planning to produce short videos and podcasts in other languages to help voters who do not speak English easy to catch up the increasing of information of proposals each round.

I would like to know more about the 2Min criteria to filter that 25% among thousands proposals that will be submitted in F9 and F10.
