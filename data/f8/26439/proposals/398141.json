In summary, that was all I could absorb about this proposal, because I didn't define more details such as: where these meetings will take place; approximately how many people are expected to participate in each of them; which specific subjects within the thematic axes of the Cardano ecosystem will be addressed (for example, an introduction to Cardano could explain what blockchain is, what cryptocurrencies are, the basic differences between Cardano and other blockchains; while more in-depth topics could discuss how to propose in catalyst, how to program smart contracts, study about Plutus and etc). I think the nature of these meetings is too abstract, the proponent states that he attended the Cardano Summit 2021 in Berlin, and that he intends to continue promoting these events. But little is understood what they would be like. And in relation to the alignment with the challenge, from what I understand we are here seeking to finance projects that talk about a very specific target audience, groups that have their own cultural characteristics, which must be respected, also have unique linguistic characteristics that must be targeted. in the preparation of the proposal. This proposal, on the contrary, aims to expand something that already exists, to several cities, that is, several audiences, not focusing on a particular group. An example that I last evaluated in this same challenge is the proposal \u201cFrench Haskell + Plutus Curriculum\u201d, in which the idea was to translate knowledge about Cardano\u2019s own programming language into French, and the target audience was African speakers of that language. Notice the difference? It doesn't mean this idea is bad, it just doesn't fit well for this particular challenge. In my opinion, it would make more sense for her to be submitted in the challenge of the new members on board. Therefore, unfortunately I will give a low grade, I would like the idea to be better broken down so that I could have greater clarity on how these events would be, and that it be submitted in the challenge that I mentioned earlier, so that the alignment would be greater and consequently the impact as well. was more accurate. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is low, we have very little information about script, team and budget. Starting with the script, we don't know anything about how the first date will play out. Would it be necessary to know what activities would be part of the pre-production, if there would be speakers being hired or if it would really be something more informal, in which location in Berlin, specifically, would it be an art gallery or an NFT market? How many people are expected at this inaugural meeting and how would it be possible to get in touch with them? Would there be some kind of record of what was happening? Neither is described about how the event would be organized, nor what would happen in it itself. In addition, we would also need to understand what is to come. Where would the next meetings be, who would organize them, through what activities, how many people are expected, what subjects would be addressed? All this information should be described with great accuracy and richness of detail, being established phases, the phases related to months of the year (for example, in phase 1, actions would happen in hypothetically May, June and July). The activities of each month should be explained, as well as small deadlines to be respected within that time interval and also who would do what. Now talking about the team, we are not presented with any team, all we are told is about the proponent, who claims to be \u201ca pioneer of cardano and in touch with an NFT streetart gallery\u201d. Right, but what would his name be, how does this person relate to our blockchain, what is his professional background, what examples of work inside and outside our ecosystem he developed, is he a linkedin through which you can check all the information you ask? It would be necessary for him to attach a small professional resume, as well as the rest of the participants, it is clear that this project would be developed by a team, as it is not possible to organize meetings individually, but it is not said how many people would be hired, what they would do , what are their CVs and so on. So this part is also quite incomplete. And finally, $10,000 is asked, and the amount is not justified in detail, which is said that $6,000 would go to a number of things (artists, speakers, drinks, and the first venues hosting Cardano community gatherings) ; ideally, the proposer would explain how this 6 thousand would be distributed to each of these parts, how many hours the artists and speakers would work, what drinks they intend to buy, what places they intend to rent... And the other 4 thousand would be destined for advertising and marketing, but we don't know how this publicity campaign would be, where it would be done, through which strategies and so on. In summary, there is much to be improved in the viability of this proposal. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I disagree with what is said in the following excerpt: (the proposal) \u201cwill be easily measurable by the number of events we organize, the people we attract, the local Cardano Projects we help build\u201d. We do not know how many people are expected at each event, nor what people the proponent seeks to attract or what types of local projects they intend to target. In reality, no small goals are set, so I really can't identify how we would auditability of this project in relation to the development process. My suggestions are that the proponent draws up a roadmap with well-defined activities, related to very precise time intervals, so that we can find out what is being done, and measure whether the right thing is being done at the promised time and by the agreed people. Also, in addition to tasks, it would be important for the proponent to suggest specific goals to be achieved gradually. And it would also be necessary for him to establish frequent contact with the Cardano community, so that we are situated on what is happening. This bridge can be drawn in many ways, on telegram channels, video calls, email and the like. Regarding the final results, we know that the successful scenario would be to \u201cestablish a large local community, with regular meetings (every month), potentially at some point with a permanent space in a cafe/gallery to allow people to come and hang out. inform\u201d; but how can we believe that this has been achieved? I would like the proponent to be more specific about how this big goal could be audited little by little, give us smaller indications to see the overall success. And, in the same way, it is necessary that such information reach the members of the Cardano community in a clear way. As I said, there are several ways to establish this contact, it is enough for the proponent to focus on what he thinks is most suitable for the project and actually get in touch with us. Unfortunately, it is a very unaudible proposal, I think that the reformulation of the script and the establishment of gradual milestones to be reached (in other words, partial results), would be a good way to make this monitoring more possible. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8727, "q0": "This proposal, although simply written, addresses the challenge pretty well. The idea of utilizing the interest sparked by last years' Cardano Summit to create a community in Berlin is a thoughtful idea that satisfies the campaign brief. However, my concern is why wait this long? Cardano Summit happened somewhere August/September last year and I think it would have been extremely great to have put this proposal to the fund cycle that took place right after the summit in order to have a maximized impact if reference was going to be made to the Summit. Either ways, this proposal clearly identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved and it provides a clear understandable solution to address it. However, due to lack of information exactly how the community hub is going to look like, which's relevant to this challenge, I'm skeptical that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "To talk about feasibility, this proposals' budget which is $10K fits well to the challenge requirement that proposers don't request more than 5% of total challenge budge. However, the breakdown seems to not be broken down. I think the proposers should've made extra efforts to break the budget even down such that amounts estimated for artists, speakers, beverages, and locations be known individually instead of just stating a bulk figure like $6K. For all you know, it may be either less or too huge for that and as far as auditing by the community is concerned the exact figures for each entity (artists, speakers, beverages, and location) be known clearly. Again, the actual number of meetup events estimated to host, if known, would've helped CAs to judge pretty well if indeed the budget is reasonable or not.\nFrom the information provided on relevant team needed to implement this project successfully, it indicates that Habacef (proposer) and Robin (LACE pool) are the only people available to implement the project successfully if funded. However, the proposer states that he is in contact with a streetart NFT gallery that is capable of hosting events but unfortunately there's no link to verify who any of them are. From the information given, it appears to me that the relevant experience needed here to implement the project successfully is missing even though the proposal states that he is a Cardano Pioneer. Links to verify what has been done by the team before and as well who the team really are, would've been really useful. Also, it looks like the team would need to either collaborate or hire an event organizer to take care of the event so I would urge the proposer to find one, visit the various workshops hosted by the Catalyst School on writing proposals and I'm really sure that the great idea would be turned into a great proposal for possible funding in the next iterations of Catalyst Funding cycle.\nAs it stands now, I disagree based on the information provided that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\nBut, good luck!", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Unfortunately, no roadmap has been provided by this proposal which makes auditability very difficult with reason being that the community and auditors who chance on this proposal do not know what to expect and when to expect either. The proposer could've done a good job by at least telling the community what to expect and when to expect it.  For instance, the proposer could say that at 3 months post-funding, our first event at Berlin central should have been hosted successfully unless any inconveniences. With such information, the community and auditors, at least knows exactly what report to expect (first event at Berlin Central) and when to expect such deliverable (at 3 months post-funding).\nIn the proposal, the proposer states that \"It will be easily measurable by the number of events that we organized, the people we attracted, the local Cardano Projects we helped to built.\". However, no detailed information on how these events will be organized is provided and it makes it quite difficult for me to believe that this proposal provides sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_69", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 370, "q0": "We realized that the proposal in question fits the premises of the challenge, as it would bring more visibility and possibly new participants to Cardano. Additionally, it also seems simpler to establish a regular meeting in a city that has its technological side already more developed, like Berlin. Therefore, if well executed, we can see that the project has a real possibility of positively impacting Cardano's ecosystem in the medium and long term. It even influences so that the indicated SGDs are achieved. However, as we will see below, despite the concept of what you want to achieve is defined, we noticed the absence of a better structured plan, making the requested amount of $10,000 not feasible.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As mentioned earlier, we could not find many details in the feasibility plan that indicate a cohesive path to be followed so that the community in Berlin is well established. We realize that actions aimed at attracting members to the future community and also to promote visibility have not yet been defined, and will only be carried out after receiving funding. To increase the chances of success of the project, it would be interesting if some actions were previously organized, such as filling out a form for people interested in participating in the community or other possibilities of places to hold the team meeting, in addition to what was indicated. There is also a lack of detail in the organization of the budget.\n\nFor example, we see that $6,000 will be allocated to artists, speakers and venues. But how will this $6,000 amount be allocated among the aforementioned expenses? Other questions also arise, such as, have some possible speakers already been contacted? And as for the artists, has a prior conversation already been established about which art style best fits to expose the ideals of the Cardano ecosystem? The way the information was made available, there is not much confidence in the project's viability. It would also be interesting if the professionals involved in the project could make their CVs available.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Since not so many details were provided in the feasibility plan, it would be interesting if the ways to measure the success of the proposal were well designed. Indeed, we can see that there are indications to track results, such as people being attracted or projects related to Cardano that were helped.

It also touches on scaling to other cities around Europe and beyond. The proposal meets the minimum viable hub requirement of the challenge because it focuses on starting small with minimal capital outlay and eventually scaling to make a greater impact. \n\nThe title of the proposal is quite misleading. I got interested in this proposal because of the word \"franchise\" and I was expecting to read about how the franchise model was going to be used to create and expand hubs and more importantly, generate resources to make the hub network self sustaining because the essence of a franchise is that the franchisee pays a franchise fee to the franchisor for the use of its branding or intellectual property etc. It is a bit of a let down that nothing was mentioned in this regard neither does the proposal indicate a strategy for ensuring sustainability of the hubs.\n\nBeyond eventual scaling, the proposal does not indicate other areas of growth that are expected to be achieved nor does it provide a structured onboarding process for hub members.
