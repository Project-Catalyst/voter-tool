It clearly understands the central issues and aligns with the challenge to grow the growing Cardano community in a broad, Eastern Hemisphere. It solves many problems of the challenge at the same time. Because the problem raised is universal such as building, sharing knowledge and information about the Cardano platform; connecting and supporting to develop the Eastern Hemisphere community; breaking down cultural barriers between countries. so this proposal is very feasible to scale to the whole world. It doesn't just help grow the Cardano community and make it better. \nThe proposal correctly identified a few issues in the challenge. Present the problem clearly and convincingly. It has identified many core issues in the development of the Cardano community, which not only helps the individuals involved with the knowledge of the Cardano platform but also facilitates the operation and development of organizations. development, which contributes to the development of a rich and diverse Cardano community in the Eastern Hemisphere. With the active operation of the Eastern Hemisphere City Hall, members and organizations have the opportunity to meet, share and develop together, which is a great thing that any community wants to aim for. To do that well, you have come up with impressive and highly feasible solutions: building knowledge, sharing information, connecting people; and I'm impressed by the solution of breaking down cultural and language barriers - this is a dilemma for community development in any field. Especially when you come up with a solution, you have studied very carefully the problems related to countries in the Eastern Hemisphere such as population (1.6 billion people, accounting for 60% of the global population), energy English language force in the region. . provides a very reliable basis for the presentation. Moreover, to achieve the goal, you have had coordination and collaboration with Catalyst Swarm, The Catalyst School, Association of Ambassadors. have shown the long-term vision and strategy of the proposal. The goals and results of the solutions are very specific to the Eastern Town Hall of each country (Indonesia, Vietnam), and you also give specific evidence by the statistics of popular social networks. like: Telegram, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Github. \nThe proposal has identified several risks during the implementation process and proposed solutions to overcome all of those risks. The team's proposal identified two very real risks in the course of its work. The first risk you identify is that the harmony between different cultures, time zones, and languages of different countries is difficult in the cooperation and common development of the community which is completely grounded and you give workarounds using tools like GitHub, GitLocalize, Orbit, etc... is completely reasonable and workable. But it's great if you have a specific time frame to organize activities so that the community can meet, exchange, and share at the same time, it will be more attractive; there is a section introducing the cultures of countries in the region. With that, I'm sure the community will be better. The second risk you identify as the biggest obstacle is using English as Cardano's primary protocol and providing a solution for Cardano education and development through Project Catalyst and community-proposed initiatives as well. possible solutions. However, for the solution to work, I would like to see a specific educational program, I hope you consider it. I rate 4 points.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has given clear, detailed, and reasonable work implementation timelines with specific goals.

All the work of the group is easy to check and follow the community through popular social networking platforms such as Telegram, Youtube, Twitter, GitHub. However, to help people vote quickly Approaching this solution, I would like you to briefly cover the \"timeline actions\" section. Since the first 4 goals of all 3 months are the same (only the goal is different in point e), they should be presented together. \nThe proposal has been disbursed by the pre-fund of less than 20% and has a reasonable and clearly explained plan to allocate funds for each specific activity. Your proposal already has a budget allocation plan for each department, but to ensure clarity on the level of allocation for each task, I would like you to be more specific, for example: in task number 4 - marketing and communication: $1,725 of which 5 sub-tasks need to be budgeted for each section. In addition, you have also been interested in the contingency budget ($1,000) but have not specified what the reserve budget is for. In this section, you can propose ADA price fluctuations or pay for unplanned events. \nThe proposal has assigned specific tasks to each member; Experience relevant to assigned tasks; The identity of group members is easy to verify. I am impressed with the members of the proposed team, who come from many different countries but collaborate very successfully to have this wonderful proposal. In the Proposal, you have assigned tasks to each specific group of members (you have the main group and a consulting group), suitable and have high professional capabilities, each member will be in charge of a part. work commensurate with ability.
