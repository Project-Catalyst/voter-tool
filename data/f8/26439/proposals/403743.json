This proposal raised a critical, small-scale problem: How to raise awareness among Vietnamese about Cardano so that it can be applied in real life in 2022 and so on? According to statistics, at the beginning of 2022, Vietnam entered the top 10 globally in terms of the percentage of people owning cryptocurrencies. But most of them are in the form of surfing investment and do not understand the mechanism of operation and its practical application in life. As a Vietnamese, I have been involved in crypto for 2 years. After costly failures in this market, I realized that it takes knowledge and profound research to be successful. But the limitations of language, expertise, and time made it difficult for me. Therefore, creating a communicating channel in which some elite people learn deeply about blockchain in general and ecosystems in particular to introduce to the community is necessary. I see that Cardano is a very potential ecosystem and has many applications in life with my basic knowledge. I also hope more Vietnamese people can know and understand Cardano. The reward to encourage members is entirely reasonable.\nThe solution proposed by the proposer, I found that it identified most of the problems of the challenge and the logical argument. They give evidence of the current situation to show the impact of the problem. They describe the solution in detail and precisely; the topics to be covered are relatively complete.\nTo successfully implement the project, they have anticipated the risks. There are 2 main risks raised: ADA slippage and too many topics to be requested from the community. Every bet has a solution to overcome. However, I find that, if only giving technical presentations, expertise can cause boredom and an unfocused audience. To stimulate excitement and best convey information to listeners, I think organizing mini-games after each talk show is advisable. The questions are in the knowledge section of that talk show, and there are prizes for those with outstanding achievements.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal has a systematic plan and specific time. The route is relatively simple, and the process is iterative primarily. The budget of this proposal represents 9% of the challenge's total budget. Each expense is clearly listed. However, according to my opinion in the previous section, I think the team should balance out a small budget to reward the community in the mini-game part or can apply for more funding for this.\nThe group includes Mr. Do Manh Hung and the Community of FIMI. Information and identity are easy to verify through Youtube channels. In Vietnam, I attended his financial training courses. He is a passionate, experienced person who motivates his students. I have great confidence in his ability. I came to know Cardano through him and the FIMI community. FIMI is too familiar to most Vietnamese people, not only in the blockchain field but also in the financial sector.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To help the community measure the project's s progress and success, the proponent has provided detailed KPIs that are easy to measure and check. These are the number of spectators attending the weekly Zoom meeting; the number of topics that were presented and discussed; the number of questions in the conference; the number of views watching the uploaded meeting video.\nThis proposal is a continuation of the previously funded proposal. The team already has a funded proposal in Fund 7, \"Reward for Community Translators\", which can be checked via the updated link by the proponent. The project has been successfully tested and has clearly defined success. They have been learning about blockchain and found Cardano since 2017. During the last 5 years, they built a Youtube channel dedicated to Cardano, so far the channel has achieved: more than 120 videos about Cardano and Blockchain have been published; more than 15000 channel subscribers; over 554,000 views; over 138,000 hours of viewing.

So I truly believe that the proposal \"Vietnamese Cardano Talk\" can receive huge support from the community and will create a big impact.

So the weekly meeting is so necessary for the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "About the quality of content used for the talk show, I pretty much believe in your team.

The proposal matches the Scale-Up Cardano's Community Hubs challenge. I agree with this idea because nowadays the demand for information about blockchain technology or market news is huge. But the sources of knowledge are very academic or documents containing many mathematical formulas that require the reader to have a certain understanding. Therefore, it will be difficult to reach the vast majority of people. The proposed team is a collection of people with a lot of experience in the market who have spent a lot of time cultivating the basics of blockchain technology and the Cardano ecosystem.

It identified one issue in the challenge which is the development of the Cardano community in Vietnam. The proposal aims to raise awareness among Vietnamese about the Cardano platform and its applicability in real life. I find this to be essential for a platform that is still considered new in Vietnam. Because new things are often difficult to disseminate to everyone, especially many people who are not good at English, making it difficult to access and fully understand the Cardano platform. The proposal correctly identified a few issues in the challenge. Present the problem clearly and convincingly. It pointed to the growing size of the Cardano community in Vietnam and the growing need to find documents related to this platform. Therefore, building a repository of documents on the Cardano platform is very practical and meaningful. Especially for those who are new to this field, it will be very difficult to properly understand technical and specialized terms. On the other hand, the Cardano platform is in the development phase, not yet completed, so updating information about that development is regular and continuous, so the Proposal will help Vietnamese people access it promptly. with the development roadmap of the Cardano platform. The proposal pointed out the need for Vietnamese people's tastes to listen to other people's presentations. To do this, you have come up with relatively specific and detailed solutions and are very creative. Mobilizing the power of the community, the forerunners with the Cardano platform insights share weekly, this is an effective way to create a community attraction effect. And to encourage everyone to build a community, you have come up with a very appropriate reward mechanism, stimulating the enthusiasm, enthusiasm, and initiative of the participants. In addition, for those who need to learn the Cardano platform but are busy, the solution you offer is to record the live sharing session and publish the video, which will also help the community to have a choice suitable for the situation. his scene. However, your plan to build weekly sharing on specific topics needs to be quantified how many sessions; With the current information explosion of the Cardano platform, I think 2 or 3 sessions are needed. And also need to specify the start time for those sharing sessions (eg 20:00 local time) so that the community has conditioned reflexes and always remembers your \"spiritual food\"! The way you present your plans and solutions is concise, clear, and easily accessible. As such, the solution you came up with to do the job solved the problem of expanding the Cardano community as the goal of the challenge. The solution is easy to implement, has a clear and consistent operation. The proposal has identified several risks during the implementation process and proposed solutions to overcome all of those risks. I realize, Your Proposal has pointed out 02 risks and there are solutions for all of them. However, the first solution only solves the problem for the time being (in 2022). In the long term, if the ADA Token spikes and has large fluctuations, a more optimal solution is needed for this. In the second risk solution, I agree with you, but I want to give you one more solution for your reference: consult the community by voting on topics, which topics receive More attention will take priority to perform sharing first.

Have a detailed plan for budget allocation, specific, clear, and transparent. The proposed plan in the additional budget is quite reasonable.

It also assigns tasks to each specific, appropriate, and highly specialized group of members, each core group will take on a specific topic.
