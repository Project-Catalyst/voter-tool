The proposal is very generic and if it was not mentioned that it is used by a team in a different, but specific game development proposal for Cardano I would not see how this is related to Cardano. It is opensource, at a very reasonable budget and produces software that others can use for designing games on Cardano. Due to its generic nature I can not give full marks as it could have been as well funded by any other blockchain and Cardano devs would be able to use it.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is very passionate about this topic which shows from the detail that he describes the nuances of running on different operating systems and where possible bugs can appear. He is asking for 8k for part time compensation for 2 people and consultants to fix bugs that they can't. The software already exists to the point that it is being used by other proposals in Fund8 and the proposer knows the underlying game engine (Godot) well, having spent 13 years working with it. The idea is narrated from purely technical angle and lacks the selling points - it looks to be a case of a good idea, written badly. For this reason I suspect it was not funded in fund7 as the proposer himself described. The key takeaway is that it is game engine that generates assets for game designers in Cardano (that other blockchains can use as well), the funds being asked for are very reasonable and there is concrete plan how to deliver broken down by month and actions for each of the months. I suggest that next time the proposer reaches out to community advisors early in the proposal stage to check that the proposal is structured effectively for a non technical reader", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a clear deliverable and a detailed 3 month plan with activities delineated for each of the months.

While the proposal is sound and technically understandable, there might be a problem with the challenge setting: The Challenge is about building the Cardano-Ecosystem, which is not strictly the case with this proposal. The proposer claims that his solution could be used within the cardano-community (eg. Metaverse projects) \u2013 which is indeed correct, but the Cardano-Community does not benefit from the proposal much more than anybody else doing something with 3d. There is a connection to an existing Cardano-Project (Aedou: Realm of language), in which the proposer is involved, and they are using the tool of the proposer. The impact is therefor rather specialized and minor regarding the whole cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has the required skills to complete this proposal.

The goal of a working version, able to generate a small-scale city is also relatively good defined. The proposer admits that not every step can be clearly defined in advance which is understandable.

Also, lots of people in the Cardano ecosystem would benefit a ton from stronger open source 3D capacities."}, {"id": 934, "q0": "There are already game engines available as open source to get budding game developers the tooling to start \"on a shoestring\". Not just Godot which is given as an example in the proposal. A free and easy way to support game creation with 3D assets is however missing, and the proposal fills exactly that niche. So despite being quite niche and on the verge of being \"only\" useful for Gamers On-Chained or some comparable category, I see this as a very impactful way to support open source contribution and gaming on Cardano in general. What is very important is to not just make this about gaming per se, but gaming on Cardano. So in order to qualify for the challenge requirement that future Catalyst efforts benefit from the proposal, this could have received more elaboration from the proposers. Otherwise I am confident that the already existing engagement on Github and Youtube with the prototype/alpha/ product will ensure that we see an increase in the number and the quality of Cardano projects and contributors thanks to this open source project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility assessment is making good use of all the recommended tools, like roadmap, budget breakdown, discussion of goals and how they relate to timeframe and costs.

I remember this project in the previous fund, because I liked it but it simply wasn't up to the standars and didn't provide enough information, but let me say this is not the case for this funding round. I am very excited about this proposal and seeing the proposer comming again this funding round with the same and improved proposal really is a joy. This proposal fits into the challenge setting perfectly as It's an open source project. It's clear that this project will bring one more piece to the puzzle of the cardano ecosystem.\nThe project is alredy up and running and has some adoption already. Considering the type of the project these are already two very good reasons for anyone to support it. As a developer myself I need to say yes to refactoring. For those of you not tech oriented, refactoring is the process of rewriting code so it's more maintainable, and for any open source project that is key in order for any project to grow, because with a lot of people contributing the code needs to be understandable. The fact the proposal follows the linux ideology of 'do one thing, but do it well' really resonates with me and this would be a building block for many project including NFT ones and I believe it's just a matter of time.\nAs a developer I'm really excited for this project and I will vote for it and recommend you do too!\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided all the necessary links meaning github profile and already built project and has a video explaining how the engine works. One of the things you do as a CA is see if the proposal has real people doing real work and I have no doubt the proposer is a proffectional that knows what he's doing with seemingly bettered proposal skills as well. The budget is clear and at hourly rate of 11$ it's an amazing project to support. The proposer has a clear view on what needs to be done, as well as the technical skillset to do it. I really like the way this project and repository have evolved over the past 3-4 months since I last looked at it, this shows me the dedication and continuous work done on this project. \nThe technical parts of the proposal are really well explained and I'm really impressed by the foundational way of doing safe scaling. It's not something you see too often in practice. There's a clear implementation path and plan to folow and the release cycles are often gathering feedback and moving on, which is the definition of agile development.\nAll these factors bring a lot of credibility to the project and makes it more than feasible! Really god job on the proposal this fund and I commend you for your persistance and growth!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There's a github repo. I could just end here and give it 5/5 because for a project to really be auditable and have a place when people can go look on what the progress is and what's happening there needs to be a single source of truth and in the developing world github (where the code is) is that place. Creating a small city is more than impressive because it has many parts and is complicated.\nThe proposer offers a clear problem and a partially implemented already solution which is the best way of getting funded.

The idea for open source is so that the community could add and enhance the functionality of this program, which will scale with further community engagement. However, this proposal didn\u2019t include the reason on why this is important to improve Cardano community.
