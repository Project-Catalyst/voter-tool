The proposal proposes to build a mobile app through which users can track their CNFT portfolio, monitor prices, trading volume and buy/sell opportunities. \n\nHowever, it is not clear from the text if they are planning to release the source code of this  mobile app as open source ? The main idea of this challenge setting is that a non-core part of business could be contributed back to the community so that the open source ecosystem in Cardano grows. It is not clear if the tools provided as part of this proposal will be freely available for all wallet users OR would there be a pricing model ?? \n\nTo me it feels like this proposal should belong to dapps category OR developer ecosystem OR B2C category, but not in the open source category. After the MVP is done and there is more clarity then the team could decide upon what to open source and what to keep closed, and then propose a further proposal like Blockfrost team did in the previous round. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team details are presented and profiles are public (LinkedIn links provided). The budget is justified (well split with each of the areas required to fulfill the proposal successful implementation) and a well detailed plan up to 6 months is laid out. The team is well versed in technical and business experience that would be required to build this app, and I can see that every month deliverables are already well thought through.\n\nThe risk section lays out the risk and challenges associated with this proposal, and like any other product I agree that user traction is always a challenge, but the proposer has provided a detailed plan by promoting the application via Cardano Feed website. It would have also been nice if they had added more technical details such as which APIs they would use to access on chain data and also which tech stack they would use (React Native vs nativescript ??) so that they could focus on all devices at the same time ? Overall the plan is well presented and hence I agree.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability section is more focussed on how the app success will look like and whether the app achieved its purpose can be tracked. However, the details on how the community will be able to track the progress of this proposal is missing. An example would be to have Github commits OR medium articles/Jira boards etc to keep tracking of active development so that the community can always follow the progress of this proposal. The success metric is understandable and quite clear. Overall I find some improvements needed in this respect and hence can not agree strongly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_454", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Your comments were really very positive and we will already include these issues as annotations and comments in the proposal, as it may be doubt from other people.

There is no mention that this will be opensourced despite being under the Opensource challenge.

It shows that the plan has been thought through and it is not the first time they are doing something like this. I would have liked to have seen a little more on the tech stack that will be used (e.g. will it be react native, or specific codes bases for android and ios) and what backend services will be employed (e.g. cardano-graphql, cardano-wallet?). And it would have also been nice to see a mock up of the app. Not withstanding the team is capable to deliver, but does not received full marks as lack of this detail could signals that not all the tech stack has been thought through", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The deliverable is objective - it is an app on Android and Apple phones that tracks portfolio values of NFTs.

In order for me to lean towards a positive score, I need to be shown what is specifically unique about a proposal and why that uniqueness matters. The big thing that is missing from this section of the proposal is an explanation of what a post-project world looks like. What tangible impact does this project make on adoption, user impact, and the innovative trajectory of the CNFT space. Without a very clear argument/explanation of these points, it doesn't matter to me if the project could feasably be completed or reasonably achieve their definition of success. In order to achieve this, the proposal could pull out all of the unique features that are different from other CNFT services and why those features make an impact that is worth $34k+. Also, I want to know how the platform intends to algorithmically estimate the value of individual CNFTs within a collection that has 10k assets with varying rarities. The proposal is plenty reasonable in terms of price but this proposal needs more work. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The feasibility section of this proposal is good but has some weak points. There's a very detailed timeline of what tasks are going to be accomplished over a 6-month timeframe to achieve a complete product. I wouldn't mind tasks included about what marketing and partnership endeavors will also be taken during this time period. There is SOME concern that there is only 1 developer on the team. This means that 100% of the roadmap efforts are reliant on one person. I'm still optimistic that they have the capability to get it done because this one person appears to have the right education and a little bit of experience. However, this person or this team doesn't list any blockchain development experience. I don't think the development of cardanofeed.com counts because it seems to be more of a news site with the added feature of a price feed (that might not necessarily integrate any blockchain development. The budget is VERY reasonable though. Developers get an hourly rate of $16/hr if you assume 40 hours a week. Even with some possible overlap in some categories (like marketing assistant, social media, and marketing budget), the amount of money they are asking for to fund each of these categories is extraordinarily low. The only reason I can't lean positive on this section is that there's not really any assurance that the experience on the team is sufficient to accomplish the roadmap. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditibility section here is far too simple. I think they target some of the right metrics that I would like to see. I usually don't care so much for the metrics regarding product completion but I kinda like the number of assets available to track. All the other metrics are what I want to be seeing because they measure usage of the product, which is what makes a legitimate impact on the world. There are 2 reasons I don't land on a positive score. First, there's no method of providing updates for these metrics to the public (Github, social media, website updates, etc.). Second, the KPIs are not as tangible as I would like. They're good categories to measure but I want to know what metrics they're aiming for and maybe even what time-based milestones they want to be seeing. Too simple here.
