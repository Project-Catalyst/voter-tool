My suggestion for the authors would be to elaborate more on the details of their solution and what will make it possible, what economic incentives there are or good will, or something else that will help bring experts onboard.\nI realize the idea and the end goal of the proposal is to bring more development in the open source cardano ecosystem, but I see no clear vision on how to achieve that. Other than that the proposal seems to be in the right challenge and is in alignment with the challenge setting, but there are some big parts missing from my point of view as a developer with 7 years of experience. It's nice you have rewards planned for the final project, which is a start.\nIt's a really noble effort to push expert developers to contribute, but in order for this to happen you need to take the charge and have concrete steps in mind. Currently a lot of goals listed, but no specific way to get there. Describing the details of your idea will give me the understanding and help me see the impact your project might have over the cardano community, but as it stands now, I don't see it.\nAnother thing I noticed is you have realistically answered the challenges you might face, but I see no proposals for the solution of these challenges. I can see your drive to push this idea forward, but drive is not enough, you need a plan to execute.\nOverall I couldn't say this proposal will have great impact given the aforementioned reasons.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposers have provided most of the relevant link so I was able to verify 3 of the 4 mentioned team members and their relevant skills, but because there's no concrete plan of execution only an end vision, I couldn't say if their listed skills will match what needs to be done in order to bring this project to it's success.\nSomething about a tool for recruiting experts being developed, but there's no details on what that tool is, and how will it get the job done, because an answer to such a question might bring a lot of HRs on your side. As my wife is an HR, I can guarantee she'll be all ears about such a tool. Currently linked in is used for exactly this purpose. You also have an idea of conducting some kind of training, but there is no more mention or details on what course would that be. I was thinking something along the lines of 'how do you contribute to open source projects the right way' or 'how to benefit from open source?'. I imagine these would have been interesting topics for the audiance you're trying to recuit.\nThe roadmap can use a little work and again a bit more details, because after reading it I was left with a lot of unanswered questions some of them mentioned already.\nThe budget breakdown needs to be even more broken down, because again I have more questions like 9000 expert salaries for who? and what's their hourly rate so I can compare it to the average and can better advise the voters and proposers. Developing a tool for requruiting experts for 3000 - is it a site, is it a mobile application, is it a series of articles highlighting someking of benefits? My suggestion would be to look at other proposals in this challenge like this one: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398299 or any of the excellent proposals from the previous rounds and think about improving your own and comming back strong with a new and improved and polished proposal.\nOverall I can't say this project is feasible as it is. Good luck!", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I see the proposers have copied the roadmap from the feasibility section, but that can't measure the progress and development of the project. It can give a user milestones to follow but measurement of the proposal can maybe be measured in number of onboarded people through the use of the training curriculum or projects completed from aquired and onboarded expert developers.\nThe KPIs are the goals you need to set for yourself so you can keep yourself to standard and to set clear expectations for what you want to reach and then the metrics are there to help you see if you're on track or not. Metrics are there to help you see any weak spots you have or simply to help you optimize your project execution. Currently both these important parts are missing from the proposal unfortunately.\nThe problem statement needs some work, because I had trouble getting the core idea of the proposal and the solution statement is a bit vague as well.\nOverall I can't say this would be an audiable project for the aforementioned reasons, but my suggestion would be to read your proposal with the eyes of voters and see what questions are left unanswered.

I have a question about the training class: how many workers or experts will be instructing 50 new people? I am not sure whether we will need more than four persons. I see that the team will be comprised of four main people: one Open source expert, three Plutus trainers.
