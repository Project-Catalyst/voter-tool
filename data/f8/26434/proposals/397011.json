Basically, this solution matches the key metrics of the challenge, which is a project developed in an open-source framework, provided as an accessible open-source library. The plus point is that the author clearly understands the challenges he will face while solving the problem, the author is also focused on the security factor and looking for a solution. However, the outline of the project's success and what it can bring to the Cardano ecosystem is still very vague.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general, the author has clearly defined what he/she will do to develop the project, built a roadmap that provides a full solution with the necessary information, the timelines, the main activities that will take place and the goal/product to be achieved. As for the budget, I encourage the author to allocate the budget at an hourly rate so that it can be easily compared with similar projects to see if the budget is properly allocated or not. Basically, the budget table already includes the necessary information, which is the work categories and the budget allocated for each category, the categories that are consistent with the development plan are mentioned. In terms of personnel, the plus point is that they have determined how many members will participate in the project, what is the role of each member/organization, attached the link of the members/organization. The author has made every effort to provide us with information about the biographies, working specialties, knowledge and experiences, and achievements of the members. It can be seen that members not only have deep knowledge in the Blockchain area but also actively participate in the Cardano community. However, some members still have not been able to update their profiles, if possible, I encourage the proposer to use the Linkedin profile to be able to confirm the members' qualifications.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since this is a project developed in an open-source repository, those interested in the project can easily access the project's GitHub to keep track of ongoing project development, In addition, the proposer also provides another environment for the community to access information on project progress which is the blog posts on their company page. I appreciate the auditability and reliability of this project. Unfortunately, they still haven't outlined the success of the project with specific KPIs, we can't understand specifically how this project has brought an effective part to the community and Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1724", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4768, "q0": "This proposal's team wants to create a role-based access control smart contract that controls and secures organization membership. In a nutshell, I agree. However, it appears to be a rather broad statement, as the same may be said for a variety of other industries. Such a project would have a positive impact on the Cardano environment, and if correctly designed, this solution may easily scale up. To allow for evaluation, the proposers should have included some KPIs about the challenge's impact. If the proposal does not receive funding in this round, I recommend looking for a different challenge with better alignment with the proposal goals, as well as including a section in the proposal explaining this alignment to make it clearer not only to the assessors but also to the team itself how well aligned the proposal is.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposal does not include not just a description of the team's talents and experience, but also a reference to back up those claims. The proposer's information is quite restricted, making it difficult to verify the abilities and expertise described in the proposal. As ideas, the proposal would benefit from adding links to Github profiles or LinkedIn profiles of technical staff, or individuals who would be managing the project from that aspect, to demonstrate those technical skills. It would be wonderful to have some offered connections (LinkedIn profiles, previous affiliate projects, etc.) that could prove the team's expertise, at least for the key team members. I like the budget allocation, but I'd like it to be a little more specific. Finally, I would have liked to see a more detailed explanation of what the project wants to accomplish in order for the proposal to be more tangible. I have no opinion on whether or not this plan will be implemented successfully", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In order to measure the audibility in a clear and structured way, I would suggest that the proposer should add much more detail in regards to the development and process of the project. It would be really helpful if we could see a clear roadmap with milestones and an expected timeline. I would also recommend incorporating some success indicators to track the progress (KPIs and metrics). A short paragraph of text detailing the dangers and obstacles, as well as how the team plans to address them, would boost trust in the team and demonstrate that they have a multi-perspective view of the project and a thorough grasp of it. I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to measure progress toward its stated goals, based on the lack of information provided", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1772", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5606, "q0": "Many DAOs and smart contracts would implement similar functionality to manage memberships and their users, by providing a standard and rigorously tested component that is open source, it would greatly increase the security of projects built on Cardano and reduce the time to market. This all helps in making Cardano a more attractive place for developers to come and build out their ideas.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Timeline seems feasible given that both of them are quite experienced developers with open source contributions in the Haskell ecosystem. While the budget breakdown is a little vague, it seems to be a reasonable compensation for two developers and a code audit. Though specifying which companies will do the audits will add more credibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The code is open source so anyone can check it as well as documented on their blog.
