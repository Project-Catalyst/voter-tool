I can find a sentence in the Auditability category however that I use to assess this Impact: \"Creation of open source community for the project, including public github repository and community discussion channels such as Discord or Telegram.\" Some links or videos showing that the proposers are serious about inclusive open source would have helped, but overall good effort!

We are not informed if the stake-pool-operator on the team has the skills to test and refine smart contracts, or if the code created for the betting app can be used partially for the oracle tool. No link is provided to the previously funded proposal. Despite the short-comings mentioned, the overall strength of the team and innovation of the idea (AI for Cardano oracles - it's based on betting data but should be applicable much more generally) seem to add up, and my background search into the Fund-7 proposal and proposer team also produced satisfactory results.

Maybe they could have scope it down to for example machine learning or deep learning, so that the reader are more aware in which approach they are aiming towards there model approach.

From what I udnerstand oracles help with the resolution of the smart contracts by providing them with valid information. When a consensus is reached the smart contract is executed althrough I don't know any more details and althrough I'm a developer, I don't claim to be the judge of the technical implementation or resolution. I was really hoping for a bit more elaboration on these topics in the propolsal, because this is a complicated matter and a regular non-technical person (voter) will be hard pressed to understand the proposal. In that train of thought my suggestion for the proposers would be to take their time and try and explain what they're trying to do in a more simple and understandable manner. This is one of the risks you take when doing a proposal in such a vast ecosystem, because not everyone will have your experience and expertise and will sometimes be difficult to communicate your idea as is the case for me.\nI understand they'll leverage AI to help smart contract resolution but I don't know how exactly, just that it will which is unfortunate for me. Having said that, I see this is a team of proffecionals and I'm sure they'll create a great product, but my advise for them would be to polish their skills when creating a proposal.\nThis project will surely have an impact over the ecosystem and will be beneficial for evenyone using it. I find value for the cardano ecosystem as long as they lower the technical terms usage a bit and elaborate on topics it seem to them too simple to elaborate on. Overall I like this idea and it will be impactfull for the cardano community with some small caveats mentioned.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers provide links for some of the team members, but not for most of them. This is somewhat of a problem because it's hard for me to verify all ther credentials and skillsets which brings the credability of this project down a notch. It's good the authors know the concrete number of team members that will be necessary for the project completion and I skillsets required.\nThe budget breakdown is simple and clear enough mostly containing salaries by an acceptable hourly rate and a hosting solution between acceptable boundaries. I think the requested budget is reasonable considering the number of team members and the expected work. One part of the parts that needs a bit more work in my view having seen 30+ proposals is to work a bit more on the timeframe and roadmap of the proposal and more specifically on the milestones, because milestones are the identifiable taks that the community members will be able to follow along with once the implementation starts if funded.\nAs a developer I was hoping for more elaborate explanation on what's the implementation plan or the platforms and technologies they are planning to work with. All open source solutions usually build on top of other open source projects and I would have liked to know what AI solution would they would build on top of. I like the considered challenge of aquiring the data to build successful models and the provided solution of colaboration, because in an open source community is usually wealcoming to newcomers to the space.\nOverall I see this project as feasible, but for the few small caveats I mentioned. Good luck!", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately I don't see linked github repository althrough it was mentioned in the proposal. It just seems like a lost opportunity, because creating an empty github project takes about 2 minutes top and gives a link for any interested community members to follow along with the project and it's evolution. The metrics and KPIs seem reasonable although they could be expanded quite a bit.\nThe problem statement is clear, but the solion needs to be simplers in my oppinion as a dev. I'd suggest to the proposers to put themselves in the eyes of the voters and read their proposal.

Furthermore, the statement \u201cOnce a minimum of value of the smart contract has been staked. The AI system will then determine the result based on the amount staked, reputation of the staker and consistency of data\u201d is very vague, and don\u2019t really explain the inner working of how the system works, almost seems like a gibberish.

I also like to question the usefulness of betting data from the ALLIN app alone, and although it is hinted, collaboration with other oracles should have been sounded out prior to proposing and also the acquisition of large amounts of data for the sake of training the AI, even if the results have to be published separate from the data. There is no mention of the huge amount of free, open source time series data already available, inside and outside our ecosystem and oracles on Cardano, also including vast off-chain and legacy databases from universities, betting enthusiasts, public markets and so on.

I would have liked to see a more detailed timeline, milestones or roadmap broken down into intervals and generally I get the impression that the short proposal itself could have received a little bit more love, with weblinks, attachments etc. This lack of attention to detail may not bode well for a complex project like AI-powered oracle and sophisticated use of tokens.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "If you are asking for other people's money, just stating in the Auditability section of the pitch that you are \"aiming for a Q4 2022 availability\" is in my opinion not good enough.
