This is great, the design course not only provides knowledge but also provides an environment for students to practice through small projects. I totally think the solution fits the key metrics of the challenge - Education for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem, project development in an open-source framework, and accessible knowledge. The course will bring new career opportunities to the students and a resource of potential developers for the Cardano ecosystem. The author has very well described the course content, outlining the positive impact of the project on the Cardano ecosystem. However, about the form of learning of the course is online or offline, the proposer has not mentioned it yet.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author has built a project development plan divided into 3 phases: pilot phase (ongoing), review project quality and feasibility phase, continuing course implementation phase. Right at this point, the viability of the project is still a mystery, the core aim of the proposer is to raise funds for the next iteration of the course and keep it free. Regarding the budget, the author also points out the main resources to support the project implementation and the budget allocated for each resource. For the budget to pay for six-course facilitators, I encourage the author to allocate the budget at an hourly rate, which means the total number of hours worked by these six staff members. I'm not sure about the Canvas on-boarding & annual subscription fee, how many subscriptions will this budget cover? In terms of personnel, they have made effort to gather members with deep knowledge, work experience, working skills in the field of Blockchain and education, which can ensure the project is well run. However, besides describing members' biographies, the proposers should reinforce their description by attaching Linkedin profiles, previous project profiles (if any) of each member.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since this is an open-source development project, anyone in the Cardano community can access the GitHub link provided by the proposer to measure the progress and development of the project. However, the author has not provided us with a roadmap including milestones and achievement timelines, it is difficult to imagine and consider how successful the project would be without these specific KPIs, the information provided by the proposer is only conceptual.

The idea here is to make plutus project based learning (PPBL) free and accessible to everyone. The team behind this proposal is from Gimbalabs, a pioneer in Cardano ecosystem, which has already trained a lot of developers on plutus. They focus in this proposal to keep their PPBL course free, which will coexist with PPP program from IOHK. As a developer myself, I agree that project based learning is the best way to get familiar and start contributing to any technical topic. Hands on experience always wins, and this proposal will exactly do that for future developers, making their onboarding to Cardano developer ecosystem faster. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that this proposal is likely to be implemented. However, I see some gap areas in the proposal writeup. Firstly, the team is well rounded and well experienced. THey have really good experience with respect to training and educating developers/non developers in Cardano eco system. The timelines for delivering the first iteration of 10 weeks course is clear. However, I would have liked to see some further explanations on budget. The terms such as - apprentice facilitators, Canvas on-boarding & annual subscription fee - could have been explained further in details. The risks mentioned are actually my concern too : which is how to make this free model sustainable, which means will for future iterations again this has to be funded OR only a certain percentage of currently asked fund will be asked ? Nevertheless, the team experience and their expertise makes this proposal highly likely to be implemented, but since proposal could have explained few details a little better I will not be able to strongly agree.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability is quite well explained. The KPIs mention about how many people onboarded and how many % of them completed the course, and how many % of them actually provided good quality of the capstone project.

I have been a part of a couple of such courses, and I would be happy to take part in the next round, because I'm learning how to be a better participant in the ecosystem. Learning how to build on cardano is no small task, and the fact there are people trying to ease the process makes me optimistic about the outcome. This project would give back a lot to the community so it fits right into the challenge settings and category. The impact from the realization of this proposal would be immense and even though it might have a slow participation start, I'm sure it will grow.\nAs a developer I'm excited for this and wish good luck to the authors of the proposal. I will vote for this to be funded for sure!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I was able to verify the listed team members' credentials, but it would have been a lot easier to do so if there were links to their CVs or linkedin profiles instead of just names, so my suggestion for fututre proposals would be to add the links to make the verification process easier. Help your friendly neighbourhood spider.. i mean CA. The budger is prety clear. Basically paying fair salaries to the trainers, relating to the guidelines. There's a realistic timetable to complete the project and I'd say the credibility for this project is really high considering they're already working on it, and the process has been proven to work. The considered challenges are real, but I'll help on the adoption front and participate in this or the next one.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The gimbalabs gitlab is linked in the proposal, so auditability is easy to do. The project is open source so anyone can have a look and learn a thing or two. The roadmap is good, the KPIs are suitable as well. The one suggestion I have is to have actual expected numbers so the projects' progress can be measured and goals achieved or optimized and that can't happen without proper expectations or at least estimations.\nThe description of the problem is relevant and the proposers offer an already working solution.
