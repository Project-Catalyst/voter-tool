It is therefore refreshing to see a proposal that is thinking outside the box to isolate an area where Cardano is very strong (climate-conscious adopters) and attack a flank of Ethereum where it is very weak (talk of even banning Proof of Work blockchains in Europe and elsewhere). I was not aware that \"carbon tokens\" is such a big market, but after reading about the market cap by the proposers, it is a good area to start doing some \"poaching\".", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The collaboration of a previously funded proposal and highly successful token distribution service Dripdropz to meet the challenge of strengthening Cardano vis-a-vis Ethereum is very promising and should go smoothly due to the vision of the involved parties and them working together creating synergies and \"peer pressure\" to achieve the goal.

The team has attached a detailed diagram which shows project in detail. They have a very clear path how to make this migration project a success.

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) constitute $1,000,000,000. Compared to these figures the $200,000,000 dollars locked in ERC-20 carbon tokens is not much but migrating even a fraction of that to Cardano would be a great start.\n\nThe BlockCarbon team (https://blockcarbon.io/) is on a mission to make carbon offsetting an investable asset class in Cardano DeFi. They\u2019ve only got started with their Fund7 proposal and now they wish to create a converter to migrate \u201cdirty\u201d ERC-20 carbon tokens to a new home in Cardano.\n\nNeedless to say, potential for financial impact is nearly limitless. The team raises another valid point, however: should they be successful with this, it creates a whole another reason for the \u2018Great Migration\u2019, one that is not only tied to a superior technology or lower gas fees but to an environmental cause. The team has truly identified a problem worth solving, one that can supercharge Cardano RealFi.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This ingenious design is well thought out and it is likely to be implemented successfully due to the multi-disciplinary competence of the team, as well as that of their partners. There are some caveats, however. First of all, it is still unclear whether Cardano is able to scale to truly become the DeFi powerhouse it has been promised to be. Secondly, as the team has pointed out a \u201ctransition to Ethereum 2.0 could make migration from ERC-20 less attractive\u201d and therefore it\u2019s a bit of a race against the clock. Another \u201ccompetitor\u201d is IOG with their ERC-20 converter. Needless to say, the team is ready to collaborate. All in all, a sense of urgency is a good motivator for timely delivery, and whichever team or consortium ends up winning the race doesn\u2019t matter so much as long as the end result is beneficial for the environment. These questions cannot be ignored however, so that naturally casts a slight shadow on the feasibility of the project.\n\nRegardless, with a budget of only $27,000 this is definitely worth a shot. Their main proposal in Fund8 is for a Carbon Marketplace and Exchange: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398034", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The BlockCarbon team has made clear projections to reach three issuers and investors after one month, six after two months and 10 after three months. Likewise, unique ERC-20 tokens we can expect to be on-boarded are one after a month, three after two months, and five after three months. For the following months, August-October 2022, they have made similar projections, expecting in the end a $500,000 increase in Total Value Locked and migration of three unique carbon liquidity pools. The roadmap and budget reflect this ambition level and information is provided on a good enough level, although the plans are clearly still quite fresh.\n\nThe team hosts a Telegram group and a Twitter account through which they give regular updates.

This proposal is one of the first to really give me hope that there could be a migration (en masse hopefully) because it targets a niche area. By its very nature this project fits into this Challenge perfectly hence my complete agreement and I don't need to rely on my experience as a former assessor of projects for a university to give it my seal of approval. What makes this stand out and even deserving of a 6th star is the targeted approach with the Carbon Offset tokens. It is a pity the proposer didn't include whatever rationales they will use to convince ETH project teams to move over because that would have been compelling reading (and that would have been the 7th star) but it is undeniable that comparatively, Cardano's credentials in the Environmental space sits at a higher level than Ethereum on so many levels, notwithstanding the basic process of achieving consensus. I have great confidence that the KPIs mentioned will be surpassed particularly after AGIX moves across in April when the technology is proven on Mainnet. And I even believe one of the risks mentioned, i.e. of DeFi projects potentially slowing down Cardano to make it unpalatable for ETH projects to move across, will not even be an issue given the Vasil HF planned in June. Good luck team. This is one to look out for.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team presented is a good mix with the necessary skillsets to pull this off. They do not only have the valuable experience in the dev space with Cardano-specific language skills but also in risk, derivatives & commodities, which frankly speaking, are at the heart of the carbon offsets. Whilst we are assessing projects' compatibility with Cardano, we  can easily forget that there are real world problems to solve and the ETH-migration is but a process of the whole. There are links provided which further provides info to team members' experiences. Both BlockCarbon and Dripdropz are operational projects in Cardano and this further gives confidence that the ideas presented are very-well thought of.  The idea of using DripDropz as the distribution mechanism is novel and in a way, a smart move given people's growing familiarity with the platform. Its utilization by ADA projects is expanding and the SundaeSwap token distribution is testament to the quality of their work. The plan from June onwards is presented at a high level and I would suggest this be described in a more granular level, should this proposal ever have to be re-submitted. I would have preferred to see a parallel development track of the conversion smart contract/s running alongside the June to Aug 'processes'. That said, I did not deduct any points because as it stands, this proposal is very well-written and presented and gives great confidence that success can be achieved.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Measures for success of this project are clearly stated so from that point of view, auditability can be easily assessed. In addition, the types of reportable KPIs mentioned; TVL and migrated ETH-carbon tokens, are surely news items or values that people in our community aways seek and report on. So even if this project team does not report on it, I have a feeling there will be others who will report any wins by this project independently. As mentioned, even coinmarketcap and other trackers take note of such numbers so if any projects move from ETH to ADA, they will surely make waves and might even make it in the news. To further improve this proposal, I would suggest adding their socials and the GitHub repo as this would make it easier for readers to do more research and to connect with the team for updates as the project progresses. But I maintain my strong agreement that this project is highly auditable since those channels are available on the BlockCarbon website. On a final note, should this proposal miss out in this fund and will need to be resubmitted, it would be an improvement if the development path was described as they could add to the auditability of the project and justify the budget requested.
