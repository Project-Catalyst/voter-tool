The challenge [The Great Migration from Ethereum) specifically states that the problem statement to be addressed is \"How might we make it easy and fast for dApps and other projects to expand or completely move from Ethereum to Cardano?\" \nI think the proposer misunderstood the word migration as a synonym for attracting new users. The \"migration\" really means to bring over existing players from Ethereum and the proposed game has NOT been developed on Ethereum. \nThe proposer in this case is suggesting that he desires to build a high quality game on the blockchain to achieve mass adoption of Ada. This is a laudable intention, but the proposer does not have a dApp or other project that he wants to extend to Cardano (from Ethereum) or fully move from Ethereum to Cardano. \nSeveral commenters below the proposal on Ideascale have suggested that the Gamers Onchained challenge would be the best fit, alas the proposer did not move it. \nIn this case, the proposer views his game project as a catalyst for the great migration, stating that his proposed A list quality game \"would bring in more industry changing game development opportunities\". However, this is verbal semantics. \nBuilding one game directly on Cardano is likely to have a negligible impact on fostering The Great Migration from Ethereum. \nThe metrics for the challenge are: (i) Number of projects that migrate and (ii) Number of users of these smart contracts once migrated to the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal \"How did Sony take on Nintendo?!\" does not directly give answers to these metrics, instead it attempts to address them indirectly and with a very low likelihood of realization, in my assessment. My understanding is that the proposal - although a good fit for Gamers Onchained - does not fit well into this specific challenge category, hence the low score. \nI would advise the proposer to resubmit this proposal next Fund in a more appropriate category - Gamers Onchained, or if it is not present in Fund 9, then to the Miscellaneous challenge - depending on what Challenges are approved for Fund 9. The good thing is that the proposer does have a specific game concept and plan in mind. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer wants to build a  build an A list quality  3d fps/3rd person battle royale game on Cardano. THe proposal state that the intention is to  \"make an A list game on cardano on par with a big game development company\". This is a very high bar that has been set and the current funding that is requested is $50,000 that \" barely covers a year of development\"  in the words of the proposer. As far as can be seen, the project does not have the funding secured for the remaining two years - which is a definite risk, as the partially developed project will not achieve a Migration from Ethereum. I have not seen a realistic plan for securing the funding for the rest of the project - apart from seeking a continuation of a \"previously funded project in Catalyst.\" The budget for this first stage is outlined and broken down into identifiable items. The proposer could have improved his chances with voters by submitting proof of his relevant skills and experience - especially as the stated goal of making an A list game on Cardano on par with a big game development company - has never been done before, not even by a big game company.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In a proposal for a game, I would have expected to find a detailed breakdown of the essence of the game and its uniqueness, but the proposal mostly includes a general categorization of the game \"a 3d fps/3rd persson battle royale\" with \"Blockchain gamefi features such as play to earn\". However, the devil is in the details. I mention this as there is not enough information provided to be able to audit the success of the proposal - in terms of expected game quality, game storyline, artistic ambitions, musical score. Apart from this, some hard coded milestones are required - but the proposal contains a spec of a schedule with the first deadline coming up in November of an unspecified year: Late November \u201820xx... THe proposer suggest that a more detailed roadmap in the vein of Cardano's technical and formal methodology would have to be established.... However, I view this as insufficient as the proposal should already contain a detailed roadmap with specific KPIs and milestones. Some components of the plan are very general: \" Announce that [NAME OF GAME] is under development\"  or \"Begin Cardano, Plutus, Marlowe/ basic research\" ...  \"Research trip or more research\" etc... The proposal as it currently stands looks more like a concept that could serve for creating an implementation proposal with hard dates and hard deliverables. I would advise the proposer to go back to the drawing board and try to develop a very air-tight plan, if the proposal is not accepted this time around. As it stands now, it is very hard to audit. The problem statement is not well expressed in my view (\"Not being second fiddle to Eth. We need to learn from the the old videogame console wars from the past an make cardano the prime console.\") the offered solution to the problem statement seems tangential (\"Sony rose to the top with good hardware and software. I want to build a high quality game on the blockchain to achieve mass adoption of Ada.\") Hence I would advise the proposer, if he does not get funded, to focus the problem and solution on the game and to try to improve the prospects of the project by preparing a detailed plan for funding the entire game, so that the entire vision is visible from the start.

There seems be a lot of hiring to be done (no position is filled), this is a risk since there is a lot of job to be done and finding the right talent can be hard. No further evidence of the proposers experience can be verified, it would be credible if something could be included to further verify their experience.
