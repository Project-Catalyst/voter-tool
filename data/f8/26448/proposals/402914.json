In my opinion, this is a good idea, not many people know the meaning of Cardano perhaps due to its low market price and little attention like ETH this makes Cardano overshadowed by other crypto communities\u2026\nThe author offers a resource mining solution on the articles of LidoNation.com, which has a large number of followers, the author wants to create chapters to introduce the Ethereum community to the creative values. of Cardano that Eth hasn't been able to do.\nIn addition, the author team also increased the number of in-depth articles to 16 introductory articles about Cardano, to be more effective in reaching users, the requirements for professional website design are proposed. I think the solutions explained are necessary for the idea of this proposal, which should have a landing page that conveys clear information and well-invested quality visual content.\nMore specifically about the solutions the author team offers: Future/Scaling, Our Content, Motivation, Our Values I have read through these detailed explanations, it is a very reasonable method to help the author solve the problems. in this proposal.\nThe KPIs mentioned are the Number of projects that migrate / Number of users of these smart contracts once migrated to the Cardano ecosystem.\nAbout the benefits that users from Ethereum switch to Cardano such as gas fees to attract attention and convince those people to use services on Cardano.\nThe authors rate their risk as low and many fear it can only come to group members if accidents happen in their lives. I think the capital for the project is also a risk or when users turn away from Cardano the number of people conveyed and interested on their site will decrease significantly. Of course, I do not want that because I am also a holder of ADA coins. I really like your proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I commented carefully on the FEASIBILITY part: The milestone of 3 months is to publish at least 5 new Ethereum specific articles\nThe 6-months milestone is completing the landing page and delivering the content on it.\nBy the end of 2022 is to complete all the work of the project and deliver it.\nIn addition, the proposed work details are given specifically for each item such as Regarding Articles, Regarding Twitter Spaces, Regarding Website redesign. Unfortunately, job details are not mapped to specific timelines. There needs to be a clearer roadmap in my opinion and it is advisable to do so, your proposal will really stand out and be trustworthy.\nThe proposal asks for $6,000 for 16 articles, $2200 for article content storage space, and $3500 for website design. This part of the budget I consider reasonable and acceptable for the product that the project will complete in the future.\nThe team behind this idea are people with the right expertise like engineers, teachers, web designers looking for more content creators and translators.\nBesides, the LinkedIn lines are also mentioned fully and it is easy to see the identity of the people doing this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This project is easy to track their progress and, as far as I know, is clear and transparent.\nThat is the success of the landing page after a month of funding and will be updated every 2 weeks.

But a translation process needs the team to also have a vast Ethereum knowledge, something that the team may have, but does not certify.\n-The budget assigned to the web page seems a bit excessive, but since prices vary a lot from country to country, I can't spend too much time on this point.\n \nMy general opinion about feasibility is very satisfactory.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As is the case with this type of project that, to some extent, is a continuation of work that is already being carried out, auditability is a simple process.\n \nThe proposers define their KPIs and the milestones of the project well.
