It\u2019s quite reassuring to know that the team covers a wide working range of Cardano-related knowledge and also shares the passion for Cardano amongst one another, so it makes sense that they\u2019re the right people for this project. I\u2019m personally in favor of the plans they have in mind to lure in more users from Ethereum, and the ones they use to retain them in Cardano, especially the open-source JavaScript utility package, which, if exactly as advertised, will undoubtedly fulfill its purpose. I must say I love the dedication of the team, as illustrated through the willingness to travel to crypto conferences to simply spread the words about Cardano. The proposal is also able to put forward 3 pressing problems in 3 respective aspects, though from what I\u2019ve seen, apparently only one of them is getting a viable resolution. Therefore, I cannot give a full rating", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the plan and timeline presented in this section, I am with high confidence that this project will very well be likely to achieve its desired outcome, and the total number of requested budget seems reasonable, given that it is proportionally allocated to each factor of the plan. And I particularly like the LinkedIn profiles attached to their respective team members, and for a closer verification, there is also an affiliated link that covers all aspects of the team.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For one thing, the envisioned success does contain figures for the metrics used to measure the outcome, all of which I find to be relevant and closely related to the objective of bringing Cardano into the lives of more users (though it may seem like the project benefits more than Cardano itself). As for the development progress tracking section, however, it\u2019s basically the same thing as the envisioned success, but without the figures. I can\u2019t argue whether this is effective to prove their point or not, but I could certainly prefer that the proposer included perhaps the utilization of tracking tools to not only keep pace with the process more conveniently, but also enable the public to join in on the process as well.

This project will accelerate Carnado\u2019s growth thanks to the creative measure to solve these concerns. By thinking of many risks and challenges during conducting the project, it is straightforward to get rid of factors preventing successful implementation. However, I would like to suggest that the authors should come up with feasible solutions for each risk mentioned. In conclusion, this proposal is pretty commendable.

I personally like how the authors have organized the budget for each event, it is appropriate and well-specified.
