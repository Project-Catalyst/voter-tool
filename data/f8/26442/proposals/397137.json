I felt this should be made clearer in the proposal because it\u2019s easy to misunderstand and believe the proposal is for funding a product - rather than simply investigating if a market exists for providing Zanzibarians with a trusted way to show their credentials to potential employers, built on PRISM and the Cardano blockchain.  \n\nA market study on its own does not benefit Africa or Cardano unless its conclusion is to move forward with development.  Therefore, it is not possible to confirm this proposal meets the challenge requirements to grow Africa and grow Cardano.  The market study findings could be negative resulting in the project not being launched, and no benefit being created.\n\nNote that in the hypothetical scenario where the market research was favourable, and the project went ahead, the new project would meet the challenge requirements (given the ability of job seekers to provide trusted employment credentials to potential employers is positive for Africa, and utilizing Prism on the Cardano blockchain to facilitate this strengthens Cardano adoption in Africa. ) \n\nHowever product development is not part of this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A detailed list of team members and their qualifications are provided in the proposal.  The team appears appropriately qualified and has members in the Prism Pioneers program, and Cardano dev experience.  It is likely the team can complete the proposal\u2019s goal of market research.\n\nA good budget is provided and the funding applied for seems reasonable given the roadmap, number of people involved and travel costs.\n\nIn relation to their business, the team has not provided any business accomplishments, track record of work completed, any existing products, or completed developments on Cardano.  \nSearching their website shows that functionality is currently limited to contacting them through an online web form for more information.  There does not appear to actually be any mobile apps yet.  The team mention they are a startup, so this is understandable.  However, it does introduce uncertainty into the feasibility rating.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a specific list of KPI\u2019s under the Audibility section.  However, these KPI\u2019s are already assuming a final product is being used, and do not relate to the proposal which focuses only on market research.  \nThis KPI list needs to be corrected to focus the proposal\u2019s objective of market research.  Therefore, currently this proposal does not provide sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n\nExample KPI\u2019s relevant to the proposal could include successful travel to relevant locations in Zanzibar, number of meetings with relevant persons and a final report on the market research published publicly.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1614", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3659, "q0": "After reading through the Impact part of this proposal, I understand you are looking to introduce the idea of bringing complete recruitment SaaS into Zanzibar to drive innovations into the African recruitment market. Still, first, you want to get started with a market study project. That's what I - a non-specialist in this field understand what you are trying to say. Maybe I got it wrong, and I\u2019d like to apologize in advance for that. But to be honest, this proposal's wording and information distribution are still riddled with lengthy and confusing errors. To take the simplest example, in the solution request section, you only mentioned the background in Zanzibar and the reason you want to make changes here but never said how you would change and by what. And you have to go to the next section to start introducing Fairway and the proposed solution. Moreover, when presenting the project\u2019s risks, you don't say what the risks and solutions are, other than the words \"if\" or \"might be\". So, I hope you can correct the wording and arrangement of information, but I think you have done well and appreciate your project in terms of content.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unlike the slightly confusing Impact part above, the proposal presents the Feasibility part very well. First, you have clearly shown the roadmap, the milestones of the plan and what the project will deliver at the time of that roadmap or at that milestone. Second, you clearly define the positions and the number of people needed to perform the proposed work. Third, you give the reader details about the costs they will use the budget to spend on the project and pay for the necessary assets that the plan clearly states. Finally, you introduced the team members transparently and attractively. Therefore, with a Feasibility part that clearly shows the \"feasibility\" criterion like this, I believe that investors will be interested in your project thanks to the minimal support that makes them could feel in the success", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Most proposals often present this last part briefly and not as elaborate as the first two. So, I can understand you when this Auditability part only provides KPIs and bullet points for future goals. However, if possible, please include additional information, roadmap milestones and timelines to achieve the plan, and key metrics or specific KPIs to define that this proposal will be successful based on what and how the number. Because these data will be the basis for the community to monitor your project\u2019s development progress and clearly show the seriousness of the whole team for their dedicated project.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1666", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4226, "q0": "As metioned in this section, the project targets people in Zanzibar who are using World Mobile with the aim of assisting them in the process of verifying information in the recruitment process. By incorporating PRISM into their recruiting platform, they will become a provider of Proof of Employment credentials to individuals who have been hired through the site. This is a fresh idea. Furthermore, as the proposer said, this is a market research project, thus the problems they foresee are nearly reasonable. They also provide remedies that I believe can address those issues. But that's all I see in this part. It is nearly hard for proposers to convincingly demonstrate how the application would affect the audience they are targeting. At the start of the project, the proposer just specified the characteristics as well as the present general situation in Zanzibar without analyzing whether or not their application truly benefits the user. In particular, I'm not sure what Cardano will get in return if this project proceeds in the near future. To persuade investors, the proposer should conduct more research or demonstrate the project's connection to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In contrast to what is revealed in the Impact section, the proposer has done exceptionally well in this area. Activities are detailed, including what has to be done, where to work, and a completion schedule. And I am confident that with this careful planning, the project will be completed on time. In addition, the expenditure for the project is also listed for each item and the purpose of use. And, as far as I can tell, the expenditures are enough; there is neither shortage nor surplus. In particular, the project owns an impressive team. Besides the 2 co-founders with amazing profiles, they also have masters, software development engineers, or people with information security and data protection consultation. With this lineup, the project's path to success is no longer as daunting.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer essentially explains what is required in this part, from development progress to project success prediction. However, for this last section, it would be preferable if the proposer included an estimate or the precise number of successful DID applications or successful hires. In addition, timelines must be added to make the process more obvious. If doing well in this section, the proposer will get maximum points from investors. And there's one more thing I wish the proposer will address. Its purpose is to demonstrate what the project will contribute to the Cardano community, such as popularity or a rise in the number of users. This is necessary to ensure the project's success.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1713", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9655, "q0": "In the information  provided \nZanzibar has gained a lot of recognition in Cardano Community due recent development by world mobile.
