Most folks in Africa thinks blockchain and crytocurrencies issues are scam and therefore the solution to the problem stated in the proposal which is educating 2000 tertiary and high school students will go a long way to enlighten them and clear that misconception. This in the long run will help attract more individuals into cardano blockchain through project catalyst when they learn about the opportunities available in the cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience presented,I believe it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented.

In all this proposal is promising and when funded would bring the awareness of cardano to a large number of the Ghanaian youth since learning is continuous they also pass the information on cardano to friends, neighbors and all people closer to them and by so doing the awareness of cardano scales higher, good and promising proposal ", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1603", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3099, "q0": "The intention is to inform the youth about Cardano and its advantages. For example, people are familiar with the concept of Cardano from an early age. They will tackle this by informing about 2000 schools in Ghana. If these information sessions could take place every year, Cardano would no longer be unknown to the population. The proposal may have an impact on the Cardano ecosystem in the longer term. They are now starting with 2000 schools in Ghana, in the long term it may be possible to expand to other areas in Africa. The main problem identified in the proposal is the delay factor. Arrangements must be made long enough in advance for the sessions to take place. It is good that statistics are included to measure the impact. It would be helpful to publish the statistics publicly on social media platforms (number of students, students becoming active community advisors). The sessions should inform the students about the possibilities that Cardano has. This creates a consciousness.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Jeremiah Baani has already started this project without getting any funding in Fund7. He gets support from the Wada team. His relevant experience and skills are hard to trace on his twitter. A timetable is included which includes 1-3 months to achieve the objectives. It will certainly be feasible to involve 1000 students. It is good that the information that will be treated is present (evolution of money, blockchain technology,\u2026). There is a budget that includes the costs. I think the budget to have T-shirts printed with Cardano is very high (4500 dollars). It is good to provide rewards for the participants to motivate them. In order to complete the project properly, the delay factor must be taken into account. Some documents can be approved with a delay. The advantage is that this project is already underway. Only additional financing is required.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal states that the KPIs of each funded Wada proposal will be included. It would be useful to include these factors in the proposal. The timetable lists a number of goals to be achieved (200 CAs, reaching 1000 students). There are rewards to motivate people for this project. It would be good to do some sort of test at the end to see if people understand the content. In this way it can be checked whether the information is understandable for the young people. At the moment there is too much ignorance about Cardano in Africa. This proposal gives young people the opportunity to discover Cardano very early.

The return in investment to the Cardano community will be very great if this plan is executed perfectly. So, the proposer would really have to put much effort than usual in this. Overall, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The content for education is relevant and beneficial. Though the team members have the right skills and experience to work on the project, I feel the time period allocation to executing the plan should be reconsidered to at least 3 months instead of just 1-3 months.

The proposer would work to reach out to over 2000 students in Northern Ghana to introduce them to cardano and the ecosystem. By doing so, students would be encouraged to participate in catalyst in whatever capacity they see fit, whether it be as proposers or community advisors. Meetups and conferences will be held to get the attention of the students, which I think can have a big impact on the future of cardano in Africa. Getting students interested in cardano from a younger age can inspire them to work towards making an impact on the ecosystem and their own communities. If the proposer reaches out to higher education students, then they will be likely to get involved with cardano sooner because they may have some technical knowledge that can be channeled towards developing catalyst proposals. I see this proposal checking all of the boxes for the challenge setting. (score given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the information provided, I think that the proposal will be successfully implemented. The proposers have the necessary skills to make this proposal come to life. For example, they have skills in IT services, lecturing, and blockchain education. All of these skills will be necessary to teach students in northern Ghana. With regards to the roadmap, I think that it is easy enough to follow. The proposers will use 1-3 months for the entire project, which includes reaching out to schools, teaching at least 1000 students, and training at least 200 students how to be community advisors. The proposal team plans to host 15 community events. I think that this number is pretty ambitious, but is achievable in the timeframe given. It would have been nice to see more of a detailed timeline, but I understand that the details haven\u2019t been finalized because the proposers will reach out to the schools after being funded. The proposers did acknowledge that the schools might not get back to them in a timely manner, which could affect the progress of the proposal. However, they did also mention that they will reach out to the schools first, which should hopefully limit this issue. With regards to the budget, the proposers have provided a well thought-out list of costs that will be covered by the funding requested. It is very easy for me to see what funds are going where, which gives me confidence that the proposers understand what they will be doing. (score given: 4)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Given the information provided, I think that this proposal can be auditable, but it is lacking some key information. The proposers mentioned that they will have supervision from Wada, a well-known proposer group in this space, who frequently provide good reporting for auditability. Additionally, the metrics of success include mass on-boarding of students who will participate in catalyst, the number of local developers who learn Haskell, and the creation of dapps by those local developers. These are all very good goals, but I would also encourage the proposer to have some additional quantitative KPIs. For example, how many students who get involved with catalyst after attending a session would constitute success? How many developers? Unless the proposers maintain contact with the schools or students and can conduct some sort of retrospective survey, I imagine that it would be hard to check up on each participant to see whether they are involved with catalyst or not. My last question is, how will this information be shared with the cardano community? Is there a plan in place to present a post-completion report? What platform will be used? In the future, the proposers could address these questions to greatly strengthen the proposal. Even though this proposal is backed by Wada, more information could be provided for voters to better understand this proposal from an auditability perspective.

I believe the greatest challenge facing most young people in this part of Africa is nothing than ignorance and misinformation. Some young people have fallen for scammers and fraud activities in trying to be adventurous. And so they seem to be reluctant about the need to get unto the Blockchain and it's attached benefits. This proposal will be a panecea  to this long held myth. The way to go is education. That is why I think the proposers were able to actually identify the right solution to the problem of ignorance about Blockchain and Cardano for that matter. Education is key to adoption and use of a service as far as Cardano is concerned.

Their experiences shows they are capable and have also partnered with WADA for several other activities that involves Mass Education of people about the Cardano ecosystem. The can see from their plan that it does not offer any technical difficulty or oppositions, I think this is because their concept or proposal is more focused on offering the right education of students in Northern Ghana. And so when this students are properly educated they can help broadcast across to all about hoe Cardano work and the opportunities that exist.\ncurating information/data on a website. I however suggest you bring in specifics with the timing of the implementation of your proposal. Create definite timelines along side the various activities.\n\nAlso, as they raised the timing for some institutions to respond to their letters as a major concern, I suggest you work with the Metropolitan Director of the Ghana Education Service to ensure they give you approval before you move to deal with the schools.
