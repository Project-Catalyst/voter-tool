Proposer shows the challenge and also shows how this project solves that challenge. Ho also shows how the project will work and its characteristics. In addition, the founder also clearly stated the risks and had a plan to overcome. This is a good point because it shows that the whole family worked hard to plan the plan in detail.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The tasks are planned quite clearly on a monthly basis, which will make it easier for voters and the whole team to keep track of the tasks that need to be completed.

The expression ways of the proposer can lead audience to understand that solutions will be solved step by steps, from foundation phase up to fund allocation.  . The strategy of proposal is suitable to contribute in addressing challenges. Ideas of implementation is mentioned to let readers understand easily about approach as well as more convincing. \nI would like to deduct one point in this proposal relating to explanation of key metrics. The proposer can write them down in details with expected quantitative data to make all audiences catch them easier as mostly, the roadmap is relating to the incubation.\nRisk management is considered well by the proposer in terms of mentioning on both internal and external risk. By the itemized risk, the proposer can minimize the risks might happened to ensure project be achieved. \nAlthough the challenge focuses on spreading Cardano in different regions, the proposer has not mentioned about how the influences of this project to Cardano system, although they set the KPI of Proposal regardings to Grow Africa, Grow Cardano Challenge . Proposer can add more information of this matter in the proposal.. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer worked very well in this part with careful considerations on knowledge and skills of necessary human resources, detailed break-down budget and practical timeline. \nRegardings to the timeline, the proposer thinks thoroughly on what they are going to do in the first 6 months, from finding potential candidates until announcement of the winner. To follow this roadmap, the proposer also consider to make a team of experienced people in various sectors, that ensure the transparency and accuracy from the guiding steps to awarding the excellent one. All these key persons have practical experiences which will ensure the feasibility of the incubation. \nBudget is breakdown in detailed with itemizing amount in each activities. The amount is not too big with the scale of competition and first mentoring period to let the incubation happen. With the appropriate amount of money, the proposer can ensure that the proposal will be done in such a efficiency manner.

This program aims to connect its goals with those of Cardano's project Catalyst in order to focus resources and efforts on Cardano promotion as the phases progress. At least three teams of participants will have transformed their business ideas into a viable and scalable business model by the end of the program, as well as been guided in finding the appropriate investment through decentralized funding, exposing them to the new digital economy model and thus to numerous opportunities for business and technical development.
