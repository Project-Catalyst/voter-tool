This proposal aims to make use of existing networks and projects to establish an easy solution to boost Cardano awareness and availability. Because there is a scarcity of information and access to Cardano in Africa, the proposer intends to collaborate with current initiatives and networks, as well as tap into university programs to incentivize knowledge gain using Cardano. This will increase awareness of and access to Cardano throughout Africa, paving the road for Cardano to become the blockchain of interest in Africa.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has evidently shown that he has necessary abilities to carry out the plan. The proposer clearly states the team members needed to carry out the plan gives a budget that is acceptable in order to meet the established objectives. However, the budget could be further broken down into pieces for better understanding and auditability. The proposal also includes a realistic timeframe for completing the work, as well as a clear and actionable implementation strategy that demonstrates what is being done and how it is being done. The proposer has taken into account the challenges that may arise during implementation and provides possible solutions to these challenges. Hence, problem solution listed has a high chance being implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides me with sufficient information to audit and evaluate the project's progress toward its stated goals, given on the well-developed material from the impact and feasibility categories, as well as the metrics and KPIs the proposers will use to measure the project's success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1501", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3148, "q0": "the proposal is an interesting idea, and goes straight to the point about how how it will help create awareness about Cardano by collaborating with universities and creatives, and organising a creatathon.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Even though the budget was outlined clearly, it was not broken down into identifiable items. It was too general and not specific, simply put.\nAlso, the time line provided was not realistic. This is because, it might take more than a month for the team to get universities on board considering the bureaucratic processes that  organizations have to go through when they want to collaborate with tertiary academic institutions.\nThe statement that \"The main risk is lack of interest in the technology, but through incentivising, we are able to increase uptake and involvement in community,\" is highly vague. Here it is difficult to understand what that \"lack of interest\" means. Giving specifics will be helpful.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Here, how the proposer with measure the progress and the development of the project does not make sense. This is because, how the \"engagement\" by the 60 students will be measured was not stated.\nIndicating that all the participants successfully completing the program they have in mind is a sign of success is unrealistic. This is because in every project it is not likely to get all participants to completing a program. There will almost always be participants who will not complete.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1622", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5933, "q0": "The proposer has identified a problem and a solution to the problem, but they are presented in a vague manner.

Also, it is not very clear if the project aims to address only English speakers or the natives in their mother language are also taken into consideration.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are not traits about the proposer (or team members) experience (social media links, previous successfully implemented projects etc.) so it is unclear what is her (or their) expertize.\n\nA timetable is presented but it is unclear what is the output of the presented stages (i.e.: month 1: topics selection, material preparation, challenge setup - venue, attendances, promoting activities etc.).\n\nA budget is presented but some of the items are presented in a vague manner (\"Engagement and support\" - this statement has to be rephrased in a more specific manner i.e.: space renting, speaker accommodation etc.). Based of the items presented the needed amount is $10.000 but the requested amount is $9.000. The proposer should clarify this aspect. The proposal does not provide a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how. The proposer has not considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Based on the info provided is somehow difficult to assess the proposal: the problem and the given solution are not presented in a clear and understandable manner.
