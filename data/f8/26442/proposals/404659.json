These should all lead towards Cardano becoming the blockchain of choice in Africa by 2023. The six (6) UN Sustainable Development Goals that this project covers further bolsters the local impact and therefore likely seeding long-term projects by providing great PR for Cardano.\n\nAssuming that the geographic range spanned by this project will be similar to the massive coverage of the linked 2013 YouTube video, with the incredible network/partnerships like PUKU Books, Nal\u2019ibali, NRTI, CodeCan, PWIAS, STIAS, and NRF, this Proposal should have impact well beyond just one local area, but all across the eastern half of Africa, which again has powerful implications for Cardano expansion. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The africanstorybook.org/ website they linked to shows that they already are connected with resources to make this a reality. 500 stories seems a bit ambitious at first, but over 3 months\u2019 time, spread across 10 different schools, and given that the project has already begun somewhat from previous round funding, it seems very realistic. Further, the proposed team seems quite strong with great credentials and experience, apt to put plans into place. The price breakdown looked a bit steep, but I trust that the listed team has the experience and network to put the funds to efficient use. \n\nI found it a bit peculiar and notable that the linked/advertised 10-minute YouTube video link for the African Storybook Project is dated from 9 years ago, in Nov 2013. That gives me pause, at what changes have happened over the past 9 years and whether momentum remains to continue the project at full strength/speed. \n\n\nThere were a lot of acronyms used that weren\u2019t clarified or spelled out, so I found myself struggling to follow along in meaning, with what things like \u201cCounty school managers from MOE TSC .

About 500 stories from 10 different schools are clearly measurable. When things go wrong, feedback can always be given during the visits to make everything go better.

In this scenario, how are you going to continue giving voice to those children? \u2013 this may be overcome by adding ADA donations and payments, another aspect is train and allowing children to create their art NFT and sell it, probably there is a market for this; 2) there is a risk of teachers no wanting to have another job with no salary change (they\u2019re going to supervise the children, I imagine)\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I fell that if you add some more objective kpis the proposal would gain, like # books used in X time, # of downloads in time, # of transactions, donation\u2019s volume.\n\nAnother thing that should be added is a roadmap with more specifics milestones in order to allow us to follow all the development more closely.\n\nA good thing to do is add all these statistics in the current website.
