The Proposal Team will work with the organizations above to help shape and execute the challenges in Catalyst to bring Catalyst the most revolutionary, high-quality proposals to the Cardano ecosystem space.\n\nI really like this idea.

These tasks are appropriate for each stage of the project's development. The way the team proposes is presented very clearly and in detail.\nThe proposed group has great ambitions to be able to expand to countries such as New Zealand, Switzerland, and Singapore. My suggestion to the proposal that this ambition can be realized is to add more human resources to survey and learn about the education in the above countries to understand and orient the proposal writers (with be it researchers, entrepreneurs, students), creating truly valuable projects.\n\nThe members, the support team, and the members of the partnering organization all have in-depth experience in the field, especially in blockchain.\n\nHowever, one point that the proposer needs to add to be able to successfully apply for the fund is that the budget expenditure must be specific. For example, no one will understand what the $5,000 Incentives for the Cardano community includes (is it a reward in ADA?, how much is the reward in USD for 1 contribution?) or $5,000 Design of the innovation process, no one will know what Mr.Tomi Astikanen designed for that requires $5000?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I agree that the project success milestones are expressed in numbers.

This proposal indirectly answered the question of the given challenge of how Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs as they are creating a platform for people from different backgrounds to come up with creative innovations that help solve real societal and business needs based on Cardano. These solutions will be consulted on the virtual meeting, then brought to Catalyst where other Catalyst members can join as a co-proposer.

Being a partner of the Helsinki Blockchain Center, the Blockchain Forum Finland, and the academic partner LUT University in Finland is a special feature of this project. This combination demonstrates that the proposer considers an in-depth emphasis on the quality of ideas to be a major priority. Furthermore, running the project in Finland, a country known for its bright individuals in a variety of sectors and home to a highly educated digital culture with a great capacity for creativity and cooperation, assures the project's quality. Moreover, suggesting cross-chain collaboration for projects that are tough to complete on Cardano is a wise approach. It will not only assist the project continue to run, but it will also ensure that it appears in the Cardano community, attracting additional viewers. However, it appears that the proposer has been unable to identify the fundamental goal of the project, as well as the advantages it would provide to the Cardano ecosystem. Losing such critical aspects would make it harder for investors to approve the proposal. So, my advice is to supplement as soon as feasible.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As previously said, the proposer places a high value on the quality of each idea in this project, which is demonstrated once again in the team members.

In addition, the funds to be spent are also very clear and detailed, and I am completely satisfied in this regard. . However, the project's execution strategy, although indicating that it will conclude in September, is still unclear. The proposer should explicitly state timetables for each aspect, such as how long they will conceptualize and design the innovation process, which might be one month or two weeks depending on the proposer's aim. Defining each implementation phase not only helps team members meet deadlines but also allows investors to follow the operation's development more precisely.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For me, the last stage in finishing this job is satisfactory. The proposal provides enough detailed figures to demonstrate the project's development progress.

The particular goal of creating reproducible processes has the potential to bring very high quality proposals to the Catalyst doorstep. So many proposals are good ideas, but having unspecific potential for making high impact.

A great advantage for widespread dissemination of the Cardano message, and Catalyst opportunities. As, well, the partnering organisations suggest broad reach. The objectives are realistic, predicting implementation of public aspects in the autumn. Realistic plans are much more likely to succeed than overly optimistic projections.
