This proposal is judged partly through its individual merits, and partly through the way it fits into the wider DLT360 project. My assessment takes into account aspects common across all proposals (team specific like adequacy, competency, workload, or similar reporting mechanisms / budget logic). You shall therefore find common parts across these proposals (labeled as such) and parts specific to each proposal, which should offer a good balance of looking at each tree but not missing out the overall health of the forest. \n\nSpecific part: this proposal is about researching a part of the industrial value-chain: Consumer Packaged Goods industry. The goal is to run a project in close proximity with large vendors and to integrate the findings in form of a Whitepaper.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "COMMON part: Great team. DLT360 is operated by an outstanding and growing team of regulatory experts, very active in the Cardano community. They also benefit from a scalable network of contributors from the Cardano community, academia, industry and EU institutions. In terms of team competence, skills and experience, they are well positioned.The multitude of projects funded under their umbrella showcases the great capacity to identify opportunities within the Cardano community and clearly articulate them into actionable projects. \n\nCOMMON part: Significant existing and future workload. DLT360 is a wider project initially funded in Fund6, and greatly supported by at least 5 proposals in Fund7, for a total funding so far of 85.000 USD (own calculations), many of them being still ongoing. During Fund8 the team is casting a very wide net with 13 additional proposals across several challenges, for a total funding of 295.000 USD. Onboarding so many projects so quickly can potentially lead to: too much workload, overlapping deadlines, increased risks of under-delivering, inability to distinguish added value of one project versus another, unnecessary stress and a lack of focus on and core scope and competencies. Future iterations that can bring comfort to these worries will of course be highly appreciated. \n\nCOMMON part: ALL of the 13 projects have overhead items included in the budget (project management, social media, back office, etc.) consuming an overall 30-40% of each budget (an educated guess let\u2019s call it). I think there was a missed opportunity there in terms of gathering all overheads under one roof and simplifying the budgets for all proposals by keeping them strict for core-activities.\n\nSpecific part: project would comprise basic research by senior & junior contributors and various meetings & discussions including travel.  For budget core-work rates are 80 USD/hour. Core research + meetings take up 60% of the budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "COMMON part: Existing track record. DLT360 projects are interlinked and since there are a number of running projects the team is definitely familiarized with the standard procedures and reporting process of the Catalyst team, so there are very low risks in terms of failing to communicate properly or inability to implement the necessary KPIs. \n\nCOMMON part: The website is a great opportunity for improvement. A concern is the fact that glancing at the DLT360 website, there is no reflection of recent live presentations that were perhaps delivered to the community in Q1 2022. I am aware that it is a work in progress tool, and a very nice-to-have feature would be for such live presentations / slides / supporting materials to be uploaded there as soon as possible and be accessible for the community as an intermediate deliverable until the projects are finalized. Also for the sake of transparency, a user-friendly list of funded (any why not unfunded) proposals would definitely be appreciated, at least by future CAs.  \n\nSpecific part: project - specific KPIs are inserted. They include project-specific network growth, no. of industry and consulting partnerships, Whitepaper published.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1454", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3374, "q0": "The proposal has  covered the background information of the proposed project and identified their target (CPG Industry).

I see the team's thorough preparation and solid foundation thanks to the experience gained from previous funds. The actual context of the GPG industry facing challenges with Digital Transformation has inadvertently become the driving force behind the development journey of the DLT360 team's project. And the proposal demonstrates what this project can do not only for the GPG industry but also for the Cardano ecosystem.\nHowever, I still have a suggestion for you.
