In my opinion it would be very helpful to expand upon what kind of people will be invited to these types of events and how you plan to market to them/get them there. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The founder of the proposal seems to have significant background in the food industry, however it would be helpful to have 1-2 other team members who are maybe connect in the blockchain world or have experience with marketing. The budget also needs to be explained, saying the budget is for venue is not enough. There will be many more costs associated with this.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not give a good idea of what steps are needed for these events to take place. In order to properly audit this concept and see progress, we would need some steps that will take place. Such as: 1. Book a Venue. 2. Advertise to ___ target market. 3.

I suggest the proposer review the Community Advisor Assessment guide, and apply for future funding rounds with a detailed explanation of key measurable metrics that can be audited by the community.

This risk is of the events do not bring a amount of new people and connections that justifies the efforts and funds. Another issue we have to think is the feasibility of making a presencial event these days that we have more acceptance in online events. I think the proposer could explain better how he would deal with these risks because this information can influence on the project impact. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal could add some information in the proposal in order to possibilitate a better assessment of feasibility. Some information like a broken down budget in identifiable items, the phases of the project with deadlines and explanation of the tasks inside each one, the actions that would be done to mitigate or manage risks, the kind and experiences of the people he would have to bring to the project (if it's necessary more members).I think if we have this kind of information, it's going to be better to have a reliable assessment about the proposal feasibility.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal can be audit if the proposer adds some information such as milestones with each ones deadline, some metrics and KPI's to measure the project progress and some goals with the respective numbers, for example the number os events per bimester, number of people participating in each event, etc. I think that with these informations it's possible to audit the project progress and success.

In the presentation I did not see the logic of this idea. First, how do you shift the customer's interest from dining to blockchain? Second, how do you talk about blockchain to other customers while they're still eating? Expanding blockchain knowledge to the community is good, but the method and audience are very important.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The new presentation stops at the idea of \u200b\u200borganizing events, inviting customers to eat, and introducing blockchain through photos, videos and exchanges.\nThis makes the promotion unfocused, if the content is not attractive enough and the focus is on the interests of the listener, it will be difficult to convince customers to come to the event.\nYou also need to incorporate new blockchain experts to bring out the remarkable content of the event, otherwise it will be a waste of time and money for both parties.\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "If you have just formed an idea without a detailed plan, you should spend more time thinking about it. Spend at least a few months researching it instead of general ideas. You have experience in restaurant organization, food and drink without any experience nor have worked with any blockchain technical team before. This is a huge hurdle. It is difficult to see how effective it is in the events you are going to organize and to introduce or direct the discussion to blockchain.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_652", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9771, "q0": "This proposal describes how to help blockchain businesses promote their image to potential customers through Luminary dinner events in Boston.\nThrough events with the participation of famous people in many fields, he will help end users to access product information displayed here.
