The proposal also mentions the main features of their NFTs and updates the current status of 15% community royalty. They explain what royalty is along with a breakdown, allowing the community to easily understand. The impacts of their project are also well illustrated and directly link to the Cardano community. They want to expand the Cardano ecosystem by inspiring the hospitality community to join. This desire is well portrayed by a specific example, enabling the community to follow their direction and better assess the potential of their project.\nAs they mentioned, the main challenge is that many workers may have very little knowledge about cryptocurrency, hindering its large-scale adoption. However, they should go to details in their addressing plan. It would be better if they can clarify what they gonna do to cast their net wide.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Main activities in their implementation plan are indicated in the proposal. However, to help the community easily follow and track their progress, they need to have a detailed plan and specific timeline including the main tasks and subtasks. This will allow the community to know what the project will accomplish in particular periods of time, facilitating their process of assessment. \nA careful budget breakdown has been provided, including the cost for staffing, hardware and software acquisition, brand development. These expenses are clear enough for the community to monitor how they use the funds and examine the effectiveness of their spending. \nAlthough the team is in a small scope with 2 members, they have proven their transparency through the working journey in the proposal. A small suggestion from me is that they can add their LinkedIn account for the community to further analysis of their ability, thus making all information presented more reliable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Their goal have been firmly set in the proposal. Yet, it is important for them to provide specific KPIs that are relevant and suitable to measure their strategy. These indicators will demonstrate how effectively they achieve the key objectives of their project and help them operate any adjustment if needed. The expected results are also mentioned in their vision of success, setting up a clear guideline for their project. However, as mentioned above, the specific metrics and measuring tools are really important for the community to assess the performance and identify their success\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1651", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4253, "q0": "I'd want the proposer to clarify two points about this project. To begin, what effect does it have on the Cardano ecosystem? Failure to properly describe the benefits that the Cardano community may gain exposes the project to rejection by investors who do not see its potential. Second, the issues raised by the proposer are quite hazy and ambiguous. When the proposer states that a broad network is required to assist, the proposal does not define how that assistance would be provided. Furthermore, if just one risk is forecasted, it is simple for the project to get stalled if a new difficulty unexpectedly surfaces, making it difficult for investors to trust.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For this proposal, I have some advice to support this project. First and foremost, they should separate the implementation plan into two distinct phases, as is now proposed. In the case of ties with social networking sites, the proposer should explain how they intend to use this chance to market their project or how those social networking sites will aid them in the project's execution. The techniques for testing Cardano food and beverage-based concepts and systems also should be provided. How will the outcomes be tested or evaluated? Furthermore, it is critical to include a timeline for completing each step. This not only assists the proposer in adhering to the plan but also allows investors or stakeholders to witness the working process. Furthermore, while launching a project, it is a bit short to have only two core members. I notice no connection with Shem Baiei ABOC NCLE \u2013 an ophthalmologist on this project in particular. If the proposer desires to assure the quality of the cocktails, food specialists or people with industry skills should be used instead. Finally, for a detailed budget breakdown, I am pleased by the detail and care taken by the proposer in specifying the purpose of each sum. But there is one thing the proposer should clarify: why the amount to be spent for the Coordinator, assistant to the project leader, while it is not mentioned in the staff section.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Overall, there's a bit to add to this section. The proposer should include the completion time of each section. For example, how much effort does it take to organize a weekly Cardano Twitter Space on Sunday nights through the Cardano Wine and Spirit Mixer? It may take 1 to 2 months to have a better understanding of the project's progress. Or perhaps for a longer period of time if the proposer has creative efforts that make discussions more active and attract more individuals. However, I'm pleased with the proposal example that discusses #Rezcard recipes, which are available for purchase on their merch tab. This demonstrates that they will be able to successfully harness it to help this NFT development project.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1713", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4817, "q0": "The project has a very clear and big concept. If the project is successful, it will, more or less, help spread to everyone the knowledge of ADA in particular and cryptocurrency in general. The team has done a good job at making the readers feel your resolve and interest in their plan. However, they could do better at paragraphing and properly organizing what they are trying to express in each of the categories so that the proposal will not feel too scattered and disconnected. This will be a very important trait as it will gain more attention from the readers. Also, they should add some more words on how you would address the difficulty they are facing when doing the project because the category is still a little lacking in information.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For the budget part, the proposal has given clear and concrete information on how much money will be spent on which aspect. The team\u2019s distribution of the budget is on point and I think that the numbers for these are just right. They have also done a great job on including partnerships. On the other hand, I would like a more detailed road map for a better grasp of the progress of their project. And for the details of the key team members, I would ask whether they can move the second paragraph into the roadmap category as I think that it will fit in there more and if they can give me a general number of employees working on the project, or at least more information on the key members contributing to the moderation of the project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability basically meets the initial planning, and the ambition is obviously apparent. That being said, I still expect some more information on the scope of the project given by them to make it easier for the readers to keep track of how far you have done. Also, I want to know if the project is a continuation of a previously funded project or a completely new one so that I will have a better consideration of how their project works.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1775", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Our NFTs have IRL value and we have developed a way for businesses, and patrons to seek education through our craft cocktail recipe NFTs.", "experience": "Mr. Vannaluck Hongthong Beverage Director of Row 34 restaurant group in New England Area.\n\nThe NFTSpeakEazy\u2019s founder and CEO Yuki IRL name is Shem Baiei ABOC NCLE.
