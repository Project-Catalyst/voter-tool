The Lido Nation group is already known for previously launched and funded proposals on Catalyst. I coincidentally already evaluated a proposal of theirs, in which they translated a library of content into Sawis (an important African language). I don't know the project they audit various translation services through machine learning. However, the idea here is to expand this translation service to Spanish as well, so that the Spanish-speaking community can better audit their projects. Machine translation would be proofread by people who speak the language natively, which would greatly improve the quality of translations. According to the proponents, machine translations into Spanish are only 60% accurate, meaning proofreading by someone is sorely needed. Proponents also state where the translated content would be made available: \u201cboth in the catalyst open API (link attached) and in the lidonation catalyst proposal search tool\u201d. In other words, we know what would need to be done, at first. Then, how it would be done, and third, where would the Cardano community have access to such information. Therefore, I think it is a self-value proposition and that it precisely meets the objectives of this challenge. Here, we are looking to make the auditability process faster, more practical and possible. We know that the number of proposals being funded increases exponentially with each funding round, making it unfeasible for IOG coordinators to keep track of all of them well. We also know that, more and more, the Cardano ecosystem is moving towards self-governance, which means that the members of our community will become more and more self-sufficient in relation to IOG. And for that to happen, all parts of governance need to be well protected, and auditability is one of those essential parts. It is necessary that we have a lot of control and constant monitoring of what has been approved and funded by Catalyst. And it is also necessary that we break the language barrier, as we know that this is the biggest impediment to the real democratization of our blockchain. Therefore, I think that the proposal, in addition to fitting well with the present challenge, would also be beneficial for the multi-language challenge, present in the previous funding round. I have complete confidence in the impact of this project, both because it is being prepared by a team that has already demonstrated its competence in service and because the idea is very well explained (knowing what would happen, how and where the produced content would be made available ). Therefore, a maximum score in this aspect is well deserved. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The bidders set milestones that must be followed, and in this way the process would be guided. The way they suggest we evaluate the script is not bad, however, it is superficial. Instead of dividing the temporality into 3 and 5 months, it would be better if they had defined exactly what would happen in each month of the total process. The activities are explained in a very basic way, for example in 3 months what would need to be done is \u201cthe translation management system is scaled up to work with a larger group of people + Has a good translation flow and is translating from 10 to 12 articles per week\u201d. Let's analyze it better from here: how would this expansion of the pre-existing system happen? How would they select Spanish speakers to work here? If they want to produce 10 to 12 translated articles per week, how will they select the content that will be produced? Anyway, I think that the way the script is presented, we have a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would happen, without the appropriate degree of specificity. Moving on to the next topic of analysis, the budget, a total of (approximately) 20 thousand dollars is requested; I found an expensive value for the nature of the proposal. The explanation of how it would be used is average, with some topics being more understandable than others. We know that each translation would cost 45 dollars, but we don't know how long it would take the translator to do it. I think it would be fairer if the value was calculated from the hours of work and not from the translations themselves, because some can be longer, requiring more dedication, while others can be shorter, being done quickly. Some parts are a bit generic, for example $3500 would go towards project administration. Who would do this, and how would they do it? What would the administrator's work routine be? Again, how many hours of work would he devote to this project each week? I think that information should have been provided more specifically, so that our understanding of how the funding would be used was more solid. Finally, analyzing the team involved, as I mentioned in the impact, there is a lot of trust in them, mainly because they are people who have successfully delivered other projects before. The explanations about Darlington and Stephanie are relatively short, more details could have been included about each of them, other experiences they had in addition to the proposals previously funded by Catalyst and so on. Their portfolios or linkedin profiles could be provided so that we know exactly what they have done so far in their professional lives. So I think the feasibility of the project is average and can be better explored at all key points - script, team and budget. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The ways in which the proponents inform that the auditability of the process would be done are quite superficial, as they only say about how many translations would need to be done and where they would be made available. I think it would be appropriate for them to suggest more meticulous ways to follow the development of this project. First, it would be necessary for us to follow the entire development, and not just the final results. We need some way to verify what has been partially obtained. And that way would be keeping in constant contact with both the IOG project coordinators and the Cardano community. Since the project lasts 5 months, the ideal would be that at the end of each month we would have updates on how the process was being built. How would the work of the translators, the reviewers, the project manager be doing... would everyone be carrying out their individual duties correctly and responsibly? In fact, would 10 to 12 translations be delivered weekly? Were there problems that needed to be mitigated, and if so, how were they overcome? All this should be constantly informed to the members of our community, the proponents already have a platform (the Lido Nation website); it is enough that monthly reports with all the information I commented were posted there, they could notify about these updates through the more traditional communication channels of our community (such as our discord servers, certainly some of them are focused on auditing the proposals of the present fund). Speaking of the final results, we know that the goal is for 266 proposals to be translated and that the biggest goal is that \u201cthe Spanish community is able to obtain the native understanding of the funded proposal and can participate in the audit and presentation of funded proposals\u201d. But how will this be ascertained? Through which qualitative data can we perceive this achievement, and how would this be reflected in the Cardano ecosystem as a whole? Some ways that I imagined would be: a survey could be carried out directly with the Spanish community, so that it could report on how the auditability process of those proposals that have already been financed has been for them, if these translations have played an important role in a better understanding of the contents; also how they are getting involved with other parts of Cardano, as for example they became more active through the greater delegation of Ada, greater use and investment in Dapps and etc... Anyway, it would be important that more direct formals were drawn about how to perceive the advances generated from here. I think that, unfortunately, this is the part that left the most to be desired in the proposal, needing to be revised. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 731, "q0": "While not directly conducting any auditing itself, this proposal seeks to start laying the multilingual foundation needed to start expanding the Catalyst ecosystem laterally to the millions of helping hands sidelined by continuing language barriers.  By translating all of the funded proposals from Fund7 (266 in total) from english to spanish, they seek to unlock the potential of the spanish-speaking Cardano community to rise to meet the growing challenge faced by Catalyst in auditing proposals and disbursing the treasury funds.  This kind of multilingual support is needed across all areas of Catalyst, so it is nice to see dedicated teams that show initiative towards that goal.  On that note, this \"beta test\" of a machine learning translation with human oversight, while only being run in Spanish, if successful this same team is ready to run the same protocols for japanese and chinese.  And with all the translations going into the Catalyst API on Github, access will be truly opensource and openend.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is already engaged in much of the translation work, having been funded multiple times for multiple language translations, so they have established relationships to translators, with whom they are arranging \"bulk rates\" to stretch the funds further.  With the machine learning algorithm doing the bulk of the work (and improving as they go, I assume) the process will continue to improve in scalability.  The cost per translation ($45 +$12) is quite reasonable, but it does add up, with over half of the budget for this service and the rest for project management and rollout to the Catalyst API.  If the proposal has a weakspot, it is in establishing the overall value vs. the budget within the challenge.  But as far as a plan to use that budget, the proposal is very straightforward, with an initial onboarding phase for more team members to their existing translation tools, and then a grind to get all the proposals processed and posted within 5 months.  The additional \"QA the QA\" check is a handy task to add, and should give even more certainty (they are shooting for 100% correct on these translations, after all)", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The major milestones are to get a team in place with the protocol in hand, and then to start churning out translations.  The tricky part will be the early reporting if it takes longer than a month to onboard the team, as progress is needed to release the funding.  But with the team already having been in collaboration, I expect that this will go smoothly.

If Catalyst and Cardano are truly going to become the global force we all want them to be, we'll have to be able to meet people where they are. Spanish seems like a good place to start.

The fact that the proposer has won the funding for machine translated proposal in fund 7 and right now plan to have the human QA for those machine translated proposal raises a doubt on whether the machine translated is an effective solution to apply for auditing process as it seems that the proposer has doubled the amount of work to reach the objective of having efficient, distributed and transparent auditing process of funded proposals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has provided the reference link of team profile.
