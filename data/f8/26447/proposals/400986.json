With my understanding of the proposal, the proposer tries to create a Bayes model as a spam filter. If implemented successfully this would be a valuable tool to the vCA. However, the proposal does not provide much crucial information that made me doubt the execution of the proposal. The proposal does not provide any potential risks that can hinder their proposed solution.

It can get much better if the budget is broken down into detailed information. For example, 20K$ remuneration for the developer, 5K$ for rent cloud service to train the naive Bayes model, etc. The proposal does not give any personal information like background or experience for the members, or even the full name of the proposer.
