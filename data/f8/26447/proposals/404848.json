Although it does not address current abuses of the system such as individual proposers submitting dozens of proposals and hoping \"to get lucky\" or astronomical hourly rates hidden deep inside wordy proposals, to just name two, it would in the long run create a culture based on track record. Adding granularity and scoring milestones and partial targets are possible ways to expand on a Closing report, but as a starting point I fully agree with the proposers that this is impactful and important. Given the diversity and broad scope of Project Catalyst, including an equally broad range of measures, from smart contracts created and certified to social media metrics, shows that the proposers understand the complexities they are dealing with and this is a well-crafted proposal to help the brief of the challenge making progress.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A broad alliance of the individual proposers, some of whom are veterans of the Catalyst process and impact entrepreneurship, together with Cardano for Climate and Sustainable ADA, creates in my view a powerful group of stakeholders to make this proposal a success. The websites already created look professional and existing social media traction of the project's partners are supporting the claim that this can be made into a success.\nThe project has an ambitious timeline but would have benefited from breaking it down - although there are phases all 50 proposals to be reviewed initially are lumped together. This is mitigated by the use of Gitbook, which may help in communicating progress and getting feedback necessary for successful completion and closing reporting on enough proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is supported by KPIs and a timeline, and auditing of progress and success will be possible in my opinion as the target to assess 50 projects is clear to understand and carry out. More information on selection criteria would have been good, highlighting how the team would deal with reluctant cooperation or false information provided. Given that this proposal sits in the Improve Auditability challenge, paying more attention to its own auditability and splitting the 50 closing reports / videos / reviews into sub-projects with check-ins after, for example, 10 trial videos, would have been beneficial for the credibility.

Indeed, it would be nice if KPIs included closer attention to efforts to systematize this approach in the Catalyst system.

Extensive resources are being thrown at the initial phases of the projects (drafting proposals, comments from the community, assessments, veteran assessments, voting).

The proposer states (no way for me to verify that only 50 of the 1000+ projects funded through project Catalyst have properly closed out their project. Terrible news if this is indeed the case. \n\nNow, the solution proposed is to allow a maximum of 50 current non-closed projects to fill out our form and inquiry to have their project closing report done for them by the team behind this proposal. So it would function in a way as a test subsidy for previous funded projects and help them to wrap up the project. \n\nIt is a laudable and practical proposal to a major pain point, however I\u00b4d like to add a few worries. Firstly, it might introduce moral hazard amongst future proposers knowing that even if they don\u2019t deliver on project closing, somebody might be there to bail them out. Secondly, this proposal would increase costs borne by the community for already funded proposals and perhaps throw money into an already money sink. Not a bright future I might say.\n\nBut again I do not see simple solutions to this problem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team behind the project comprises three persons, with experience in several areas: a research focused member, a recent economics delegate and a social entrepreneur. Quite a balanced mix of skills to carry out such an experiment. \n\nBudget wise they would spend the 15k USD on only the first 50 projects that join in, meaning roughly 300 USD/project. Is it a lot? Is it just peanuts? I am not sure. \n\nThe project would take around 4 months to roll out. An initial stage would focus on on-boarding teams that haven\u2019t closed their projects properly and building presentation templates. Second stage would allow current non-closed projects to fill out a form and ask to have their project closing report done for them. On a personal note I find this stage extremely challenging to be able to close a report for under 300 USD/project. Phase three would encompass macro reporting and documenting the entire process. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Being a project focused on closing other projects I can imagine that they will save 300 USD for their own closing. :)\n\nJokes aside, they promise an open-source project and one can only expect that transparency towards the community will be not only good, but perhaps a solid practice for the future and a very good window into the messy work of closing down projects and ensuring sufficient transparency from their side.

Closing project is usually a neglected part in project management, even though it is so imporant. It allows to completely audit process, check lessons learned, update documents and free up resources.

I apreciate having a marketing strategy to share this already considered here.\nThe main issue I see with this proposal is that it is not clear what will be this proposer responsability and what will responsability of the team closing the project. I understood templates will be provided, but who will fill them in? who would edit the video? It is a bit confusing here.

As the proposers mentioned, only 50 or so of the 1000+ projects have been closed out, so it is incredibly difficult in the current landscape for the community to audit the success of proposals. As a member of the community, I can verify that I have not actually seen a closed out proposal, which indicates that this is a big problem that does need to be solved. By providing a simplified template for proposers, this project will help streamline the closing out process for many proposers whose time is very important. The team behind this project will then take information provided by the funded proposers and create a summary report slidedeck/video that will be sent to IOHK where it can then be sent out to the community. I see this proposal addressing the issues stated in the challenge setting because it will lead to more proposals getting audited.

Combined, the proposers have all the necessary experience to make this project a success. For example, they have experience with blockchain technology and education (just to name a few of their experiences). There are also partnerships with SustainableADA and Cardano4Climate, which gives me confidence that they are in touch with the right groups to make this proposal happen. The proposers also listed out a very thorough roadmap that includes multiple phases. In the first phase, they will create the templates and get all the background preparation completed (2 weeks-month). In the second phase, they will get teams to submit their information on the form to get a report summary made of their proposal (2-3 weeks). Lastly, the proposers will spend about 2 months working on putting the summaries together and getting them published on a gitbook.
