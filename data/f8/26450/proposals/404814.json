The problem statement definition is clearly related to the goals of the challenge and the unique focus of the proposal team which is helping to onboard new impact driven businesses onto the Cardano ecosystem through Project Catalyst.  The proposal is looking to create a space where new businesses that want to join the Cardano community can come to and get the resources they need to onboard with Project Catalyst quickly and efficiently.  The focus appears to be on collaboration, getting teams to work together versus having a lot of individual proposal submissions.  In this way they are targeting the Innovation process metric KPI of growth in the number of 4-5 star proposals. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team appears to have the right experience and backgrounds to pull this off.  The proposal does a good job of describing the relevant experience and accomplishments of each team member and has links to their linked-in profiles for more information.  The proposal indicates that the team has been collaborating together on various projects and community activities for the past 6 months, so they already have a cohesive team dynamic which increases confidence in the ability to be successful.  The plan is separated out into 3 distinct phases.  The first phase is 4 weeks in length and the goal is to promote the current Catalyst and Cardano community activities around impact.  The second phase is 12 weeks in length and during this phase they will start weekly meetings and host a large community workshop  The third phase is 3 weeks in length with a focus on data collection and a review of progress and results.  The budget is very simple and clearly shows how the funds will be distributed.  The budgeted amounts look to be very reasonable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal defines how transparency will be facilitated  by using a Gitbook.  They have made a commitment to making their findings open source so that others will be able to duplicate the process.  They have defined the measurements they will use to track their progress, what they are missing though are clearly defined KPIs (goals and timelines to reach them).  So for example they list growth in the number of 4-5 star proposals.  A clear KPI would be something like 15% growth in the number of 4-5 star proposals from Fund 7 that are related to impact driven businesses.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1375", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3533, "q0": "This project would be very beneficial for companies, the Cardano community, and, of course, the world. \nI really like the focus on generating impact through blockchain by utilizing an existing structure. This could increase the quality of the proposals and their feasibility. \nIn my opinion, the proposal fits the challenge by potentially increasing the number of 4-5 stars proposals and reduicing the number of unready proposals. However, I don't see how it would increase the number of voters, CAs and general active members to the community, as it would mostly focus on bringing businesses. \nIt is also not clear to me how this collaboration space would be. Would it only be an open-source document?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap seems reasonable and detailed. I wonder if there could be a couple of businesses involved in the earlier stages, instead of waiting for phase 2. Bringing in businesses to develop the project could promote many interesting insights from a different perspetive.\nThe budget is also reasonable, though I would like some more details on how the content creation budget would be spent.\nThe team seems very capable and the team members' backgrounds are very aligned with this proposal. It is also very positive that they already work together in other projects, which shows maturity to implement this one.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am not completely sure how all of the KPIs mentioned are aligned with the proposals. I think there could be more KPIs specific to this project, for example, the number of collaboration, the number of companies pariticipating in the project, etc.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1659", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7695, "q0": "It seems this proposal seeks to create a Cardano community that is specific only to business. Complete with content that the proposers team view as suitable towards successfully attracting and onboarding business minded community. This proposal does both directly and in-directly address the Challenge key metrics. It directly addresses more towards awareness of Project Catalyst and the attendance side of things, while long-term/in-directly, when this platform rolls on down the road, it is most likely to produce quality proposals from the business community they seek to nurture.\n\nThough when it comes to business applications, Cardano I believe has not reached an infliction point where it is commercially viable. All the existing infrastructure currently supports limited activities or solutions, such as; NFT's and a number DeFi's. Their traceability solutions or their digital identity solutions are not fully operational. Then there is the issue of congestion, though hopefully this will be resolved in this years Q3 with the launch of Hydra.\n\nYes, it does take time to groom a community into a larger and highly functioning community but in the case of businesses, they are businesses. They do not have the luxury to loiter and wait for all the Cardano solutions to be up and running. What will happen is just that of the situation with their traceability solution. It is currently dead in the water. This will have a negative impact towards the perception of Cardano.\n\nThen there is the issue of the number of Haskell developers. The laundry list until Cardano is commercially viable is still too long. What Cardano needs now, is education, education and education. We need an army of developers that want to build on Cardano. What mainly attracts these developers, is the promise of 1.000.000 TPS. Once this is achieved, then everything will have a snowball effect. With that said, it is not yet the time for this proposers proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team assembled though, are a dream team. Given the right budget and the proper action plan they will deliver on their intent. This is simply due to their reputation and what they have achieved in the community. From being very active in Project Catalyst with all their available roles to being a respected contributor and engager in the larger Cardano community and of course some are a funded proposers. But take note, only if they have the proper budget and action plan which at this moment is not fully thought out. With the reasoning provided in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe roadmap is quite detailed. There is a general timeline accompanied with action plans and sub-action plans. Though in general it is very heavy in having weekly meet-ups and discussions and perhaps brainstorm sessions. There is no mentioning of some form of educational materials/workshops where business people can study on how to integrate blockchain into their current operations. Again I believe the nature of business people in general are individuals who are on borrowed time. Having concise and clear structure is something I believe more attractive for business people. Something down the line that Entreprenerdy has done, with their Catalyst Boost program in conjunction with Project Catalyst.\n\nThe KPI's also seems an after thought. It seems they only copy-pasted the key metrics of this Challenge. Even if we disregard that, the proposals KPI are also vague. There are no numerical targets they want to achieve. Having numerical targets acts as mental guidelines and even auditing tool, where one can track if one's effort is going as planned.\n\nThe use of the budget, is also too generalist. It renders the ability to gauge the effectiveness of the use of the budget challenging. All in all, it is very much disjointed between the roadmap, timeline and budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It's great they are planning to use GitHub as a standard for reporting to IOG and the community but since this is a Meet-Up format, which I assume is something similar to Town Halls or even Cardano4Climate, then having a video database as a auditing report tool would be favorable. Their end goal is also vague, everyone in the community seeks to achieve the key metrics of the Challenge but that does not depict what success looks like. Rather than just copy pasting the key metrics, one could say, \"Success for us is a thriving Business on Cardano Community, where we seek to grow our Meet-Ups participants 25% every Fund. Through the discussion with various communities, we will then have created a bridge (developer and business canvas wise) that eases new business member to build on Cardano\".
