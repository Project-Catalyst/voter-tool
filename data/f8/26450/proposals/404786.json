It particularly addresses the challenge-setting's goal of increasing *meaningful* participation - it will invite the current community to map the different roles that exist in Catalyst, thereby creating accessible information for new people; this will enable new people to understand the potential pathways in, and choose the one(s) that are meaningful for them.  It might also address the issue identified in the challenge setting of discovering what additional roles are needed, because this is much easier to see when the existing roles are mapped out. I also like the fact that it is community-led, and devised through workshops - this kind of group research process is likely to have a positive effect on the ecosystem by bringing people together, and giving newer people a chance to meet and work with old hands - this shows an understanding that onboarding is not just a one-off event, but a process.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal looks very feasible. The budget is well costed and sufficiently broken down; the time-plan is simple but clear (one session per week) and it's positive that some of the Miro board will already be in place in advance. The proposer clearly has the knowledge and experience of the ecosystem, and most importantly, the facilitation and engagement skills, needed to deliver the work well. The proposer also is honest about risks, and has a good approach to making any potential delays into a positive for the project overall.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project is auditable - clear and assessible metrics are identified, and I like the fact that they are a mix of quantitative (sessions delivered, attendance) and qualitative (sessions available on Youtube, and collating feeback from participants).

The idea here is to essentially do a Catalyst role-mapping working group, with Tevo maintaining the resources and convening the people (in this case, the people will be representatives of the 9 roles he has identified within the ecosystem...and I wonder if he shouldn't bump it to 11 with the addition of \"Auditors\" and \"Governance\", or if those fit under CC Admin?).  In a massive impact network like Catalyst, an onboarding map is less about the \"where\" than it is about the \"who\", the nodes that link together to create the network.  One way of approaching that map is considering it in terms of the vessel, or container that describes the nodes, in this case, the \"roles\" they can take on.  The benefit of this approach to the map, is that with Voltaire coming soon, taking self-governance seriously is imperative for this community, and that means, among other things, defining and clarifying \"roles\", their \"processes\" and other elements of governance.  If I have any concerns about Tevo's project, it is that Miro isn't up to the task:  the fact that people can have multiple roles means that the map will be fine for the width and breadth of the connections, but it will lack the depth required to show \"multi-roleness\".  I'm sure Tevo will find a way around that though...", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To do this project you need 1) mad miro skills and 2) plenty of time to collaborate to capture all the information.  I know Tevo hs the first skill pegged:  my research shows that exactly 87.6% of all Miro boards created in Project Catalyst were created by Tevo, plus another 4.3% that he mentored the creator of.  The collaboration part should also be no problem, as Tevo maintains many connections throughout the community and is creating more all the time.  But the time issue...  If he says he can do it, I'll take his word for it.  He indicates 9 workshops at a rate of 1 per week, with 3 weeks scattered throughout to capture and reiterate the data, and you are looking at a 3 month timeline to deliver the map.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "With a meeting per week, there should be at least 3 in each month to report, so staying on track should be easy to monitor.  He plans to upload all sessions to the swarm channel which is also easy to to track.  What I am most interested in is how he intends to measure the challenge setting impact.  This project almost needs a follow-up of some sort for the final report in order to show how useful it is either to new members or to existing members.  And of course, as governance marches on, it will be interesting to see how useful it is in that instance as well.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4751, "q0": "This project is fascinating to me. The overall goal is to research, gather, and visually organize data on the actual process of onboarding in Catalyst with the hypothesis that doing so will increase leadership applications. This sounds really valuable to the community overall, and it lines up well with the Challenge goals. There is an apparent lack of clear information available in an accessible format to help new Cardano Catalyst members. As a recent member myself, I can attest to this, I have seen nothing available like the proposed Miro board. \n\nThe specific Challenge goals that would be met by this project are: \n- How might we increase awareness of Project Catalyst as the most active open innovation platform?\n- How might we increase more meaningful participation from challenge teams, proposers, advisors, mentors and voters? What kind of additional roles are needed?\n\nThis proposal aims to put together a team of people who would participate in meetings to identify and research gaps in the process, and prepare a useful interactive Miro board that would inform the community and aid in onboarding new members. Participation in the meetings would be rewarded by part of the funding  for this project. This would help to recruit and bring in more people to this process. Overall, this project would add value to the Cardano Catalyst community by helping to identify the existing process better, and potentially lead to the creation of new roles. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project leader, Tevo does appear to have experience with the inner works of Catalyst, and is familiar and capable of organizing groups as he has experience working with Swarm, or at least that is how it appears on YouTube. His plan is straightforward and clear. The work involves holding meetings to work on developing a miro board of the various roles and their interaction with the catalyst process. This work seems doable within the time frame and in the 9 planned meetings.\n\nThe project budget is simple, but fair. It provides for an equitable reimbursement for the various labors required, and it also provides rewards for participants in the meeting process. This alone has merit for achieving the Challenge goals as it is a way to onboard newer people into a deeper layer of Catalyst leadership and management. \n\nAn additional reason this project looks likely to succeed is that it is already in process. The Miro board template exists already and is linked on the proposal in Ideascale and able to interacted with currently. There is already research going into this project. I fully believe that this project is likely to happen with or without funding, but the funding will enable this project to be completed quicker and with more community involvement.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project is a straightforward effort to visually illustrate the Catalyst process through a publicly available Miro Board, and the project leader will be transparently broadcasting the meeting videos. Therefore the progress of the proposal will be able to be monitored both through the meeting videos and through the actual deliverable.

On the one hand, it makes sense, as a workshop is a tool to generate a result, to lead somewhere. But on the other hand, it makes our evaluation difficult, not knowing what is actually intended to solve\n\nSo I see that the solution loses strength when trying to resolve the issues listed in the challenge.\n\nAnother improvement that can be made by the author is the detailing of the mentioned hypothesis. Why will conducting the workshops increase applications for leadership positions? Will there be a selection to reach participants who aspire to this type of role? What kind of dynamics are future leaders lacking and what dynamics will be developed?\n\nA final question to be answered is how this project will impact future ecosystem participants.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The author mentioned having the necessary knowledge and experience in facilitating workshops, but he could still include some references about this experience, in addition to Linkedin and Youtube, which have little content in this sense.\n\nRegarding the plan for implementation, the author only listed content topics that will be part of the workshop. It would be interesting to see a more complete breakdown of the plan. How will the class be formed to attend the workshop? How will the methodology be set? What deliverables will be after each workshop? These are sample questions that can help detail the plan.\n\nRegarding the budget, the working hours for project management were presented. In addition, the cost allocated to the workshop mentions the remuneration of some participants. From a budget point of view, it would be interesting to understand the logic behind this amount and how this remuneration will be defined.\n\nFinally, no risks to the success of the project were pointed out.

He seeks to create a platform that specifically discusses this, with the intent, if all roles are clear then more leaders will come forward. Although I share his sentiment, and I will use strong words here, the Catalyst Circle function and process needs to be reviewed. That's where the similarity between myself and the proposer ends. For what is being proposed can easily be done through discussions in After Town Halls, in coordination meetings in the Catalyst School forums. Or even having text discussions in the various Discord channel. One can even evoke a audio channel in Discord to address this issue.\n\nAt the current state, I think CA and vCA are clear components with their own functions and interconnections. Voters and proposers are the most straightforward of all roles in Project Catalyst. Challenge team does has its function but it does overlap to an extent. All of this is actually represented in the Catalyst Circle. What makes all these roles not functioning properly is more due to each and every Fund there are more and more roles and platforms to discuss roles. Although I agree everything is disjointed, making more platforms will not be effective. Rather than platforms, more discussions is needed. Hard and honest discussions.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Experience and skill wise, the proposer will definitely deliver on the technical format of the solution but based on the action plan, it differs little with all that has been developed within the community (e.g. discussion groups and their Discord channel).

To an extent it mirrors the work done by QA-DAO, where it differs is the report/conclusions can be seen directly during the meeting. Although it would be great, it is not crucial. Tools are only to assist in discussions but what determines a discussion to be impactful and relevant, are the number of people behind it. If the proposer where to come forward with database and not a hypothesis then most likely their plan will be successful. But since it is more of a hypothesis, it is most likely to be ineffective.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As with various similar platforms, YouTube will be their auditing tools of choice though other metrics should be considered.
