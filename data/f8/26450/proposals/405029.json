Existing services that is provided in the Fund 7 such as media channels, info sharing and meetups are still being continued by this team. All are under the umbrella of Cardano4Climate, an impact group that have started great discussions on how Cardano can effect climate change. They already conducted various workshops with credible speakers from this field and are based worldwide, bringing a wealth of knowledge. All of these efforts can be seen through their well documented YouTube. All though viewership and engagement might not seem high, please take note they are very much in their baby steps as a community. They have started small and are slowly but surely gaining traction.\n\nThis proposal though has an emphasis on how to create an onboarding system that is more refined and based on surveys. From these surveys, they can adjust their onboarding methods, further increasing their onboarding numbers. Their choice to focus on the onboarding refinement process although indirectly answers the Challenge's key metrics, their existing services of providing a platform where like minded individuals can converge definitely answers the Challenge's key metrics. The rate of onboarding these like minded individuals though has not been provided but one can come to a conclusion by observing their various engagement platforms such as Discord and Telegram and see that they are indeed as mentioned growing steadily.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This team although did not provide LinkedIn  links I see this as not an issue for almost each and every one of these individuals is widely known in the Cardano community. But what should the team take account is there might be a number of new CA's who might not know them yet. It is best practice to always coincide (if possible, some might want to stay anonymous) the proper write-up of a proposal. It would be such a shame if this proposal and team would receive negative impacts from newly engaged CA's.\n\nBesides that, the metrics that they already delivered from the previous Fund 7 proposal, where they achieve an onboarding total of 200+ members, various workshops and various involvement in other funded proposals gives total confidence that their refining onboarding efforts is definitely an additional task that they can take on and deliver. Especially if one does truly know the extent of experience that some of the member possess which crosses multiple international companies and NGO's, conducting surveys as they proposed is second nature.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Great example of providing full transparency. Almost every single widely known platform to build and record engagement (e.g. Twitter, Discord, Telegram, YouTube) being used, couple that with the progress report documentation in GitHub and a website, there should be no issue at all in viewing each metric they have provided.

This problem is directly related to the needs of the challenge. The impact of this project is conscious and clearly described in many forms, both in terms of the actions already undertaken by the Cardano4climat community, but also in their active participation and supported by many links to the construction of the ecosystem and their services constant and diverse. It is clear that this proposal is capable of addressing future challenges in the sense that it is part of a research and aim to build a model approach for onboarding newcomers. The KPIs are consistent with those of the challenges with in particular a minimum of 10 members ongoing follow up.

The \u201creferences\u201d part is a plus, explaining the experience and processes of the group, as well as its previous successes. The budget is well detailed and seems realistic, although it seems very reasonable for the number of people involved in the development of this project as well as its scope, which shows all the same the enthusiastic character of this proposal, supported by a feeling overall high spirits of the team. \nThe plan is clear, realistic and consistent with the approach and evolution over time.

A solution to this problem would crucially have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem as well as the Project Catalyst project itself. The proposer gives a great overview of the problem and its solution as they have it in mind. Of course, the problem stated is within the challenge, as well as the KPIs indicated on the proposal. I believe that the project can scale up to address future challenges as the built in framework will also apply to other projects in the future outside Project Catalyst.

First of all, the skills that will be necessary for the proposal have been pointed out first thing first with all the references for these skills and experience. The team members that are going to be a part of this project have been named one by one by the proposer, together with their role on this project and their relevant experience that could seem useful. The budget, also, has been identified clearly and been broken down in pieces for 3 months. It seems quite reasonable considering the number of team members taking part in this. The plan that has been provided is in full detail with all the KPIs and deliverables and gives a clear overview to what exactly is going to happen and who is going to take part in this apart from the mentioned above team members. I'm being skeptical about the amount of time theoretically given to complete this project. Have you considered how much time tacking a risk that \"came true\", is going to take? However, the proposer gives a great view of the risks of the project and how they will mitigate them, something very important to know for someone wanting to invest time and maybe money on this project. All in all, i find their overview of how this proposal is going to be implemented successfully very explaining and on point.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has set a three month time as a time horizon for achievement of this proposal. Even though the KPIs have been mentioned above, i do not see a reference to quantify them in the auditability section but only in the impact section. The success of this proposal if up to its auditability and clarity, so i believe that it would be useful to bring all the metrics and KPIs in the auditability section. I noticed that you provided all the necessary links for a voter/user to track the progress of the proposal as well as to maybe take part of this, for sure in the survey part of the project, but also in the weekly meetups and all the surveys that are going to take place monthly.  All in all, the information that has been given is more than enough and i think is undoubtedly sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal.
