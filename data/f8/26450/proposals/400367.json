By focusing on academics and students, who are assumed to be skilled, or at least able to learn the necessary skills, it addresses the challenge aim of increasing the \"availability of quality challenge teams, proposers, advisors, mentors and voters\". My only minor doubt is whether the proposed meetings really will engage people meaningfully, as the challenge setting hopes; or whether for most of them it will just be an interesting meeting that they attend and then take no further action.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are some elements of feasibility here that are unclear. Of course it is feasible for the proposer to attend academic conferences and organise meetings in her own academic field; but proposal  feasibility is more than this - it's also about whether the proposal's aim of onboarding attendees into Catalyst is likely to be achieved. This is somewhat difficult to assess, particularly without more information on what will be presented. Much of the effectiveness of this kind of engagement depends on the presenter's skills as a presenter, and we know nothing about this from the proposal - the proposer's LinkedIn doesn't particularly mention presenting or persuading skills or experience; and I'd also like to see some information about how the presentations will target the audience's specific interests. The timeplan has not identified how many conferences will be attended or how many meetings will be scheduled, over what time-period - I would like to at least see an idea of how long this proposal will run for. I would also like to see an estimate of what kinds of numbers might attend (in my field, it's not uncommon for side meetings at conferences, and meetings at universities, to be poorly attended - this might not be the case in physics and engineering, but it's not specified so I don't know); and/or a target of how many people might be reached and how many the proposer hopes to onboard. However, the budget is clear and well explained, and it's great that the proposer has considered, and budgeted for, creating materials that people can take away, and followup work with anyone who decides they want to know more. So on balance, given that the proposer is aiming to \"evangelise\" in her own milieu, and presumably knows how best to do that, I'm going to say that despite some reservations, the project is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is very good, with several clear and measurable metrics, including one that actually addresses the ultimate aim of the proposal (numbers of new proposers, voters and CAs).

As a physicist, I would assume her area of interest in blockchain is the scientific analogy:  scientific information in its essence is a large, dynamic body of information and data that is collaboratively created, altered, used and shared, which lends itself perfectly to the blockchain technology. But more broadly blockchain dovetails with the reality and logic of modern science, (especially the guarantee of trust in a trustless environment) -- it is international, decentralized-there is no governing body that decides everything -and it develops thanks to networks of trust within the academic community (peer review system and invisible colleges).  I would liked to have seen more specificity about the vector of description, whether it would be just a general understanding of crypto and Cardano, or if she desires to present more specific use cases like DLT for data trust, or DAOs for peer review governance.  Academia isn't known for rapid-fire ideation and development, but a Cardano use case developing out of a college or university has the potential to be a real draw.  Where this proposal shines most, in accordance with the challenge setting, is that academia runs on outside funding, so the ability to onboard research and projects to Catalyst, for a cohort that is already familiar with grant-writing, could have a multiplying effect.  However, there is reason for caution:  academics are already working on their own projects, as a general rule, and usually it is an outside intermediary that is able to bridge individual scientists to solutions to problems they face.  The target, then, is less likely to be academics as opposed to closely related fields in business (or students) who are able to listen to the academics and develop the solutions for the academics to adopt.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is hard to parse the budget when so few actual details of the project have been outlined.  Outside of presenting Catalyst as an opportunity for funding, there aren't any descriptions of the content expected from the presentations, and we have know way of gauging the proposer's knowledge or experience with Cardano.  The timeline doesn't suggest how many presentations might fit under this proposal, but rather suggests 2 possible venues and ideas for other types of venues that could be approached.  I know for conferences there can be highly competitive standards for speaking, including strict peer review, so there is significant risk that any conferences listed, unless evidence is provided to the contrary, will not be feasible.  However, some of the suggested venues seemed more like formal and informal meetings, where anyone can speak, sometimes after paying a fee.  The likelihood of being able to recruit Catalyst proposers, on this budget, from the academic cohort would be improved by 1) specifying the number, times and qualities of the meetings to be presented at, and 2) develop a more specific approach, with use cases to present to different disciplines, along with who the participants could approach to collaborate on Catalyst funding and development of blockchain tech for their sector.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "All of the KPIs suggested by the proposer are excellent except for one thing:  none of the numbers matter if we don't know how many were being targeted in the first place.  The number of conferences/meetings should be stipulated in the proposal so that progress towards the goal can be measured, otherwise funding locks up.  Similarly, it is a good idea to make an educated guess about (or better, establish a solid reasoning for) the number of participants expected to be approached, and expected to be onboarded.  These numbers help the voters to estimate the impact of their votes.  The KPIs are well identified, but more work needs to be done to pin them down and define their range.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1211, "q0": "The proposer wants to present Catalyst in scientific and academic meetings and events to professors, researchers and students in academia who need to hear about Catalyst. \nThe impact is to grow the number of high quality projects.
