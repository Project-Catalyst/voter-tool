First I should note that as presented here, the proposal would not have a major impact on onbaording Catalyst members.  The proposer suggests onboarding DAO users (let us leave aside for a moment the idea that Catalyst is a massive DAO...) which is a minimal subset within the participants of Catalyst, and especially among onboarding members.  However, beneath the terminology, there is significant potential for a quick-quiz format that gates access to specific resources in Catalyst, creating a validated learning path into certain roles.  For example, right now we click a box to officially become CAs, at which point we have access to the assessment protocol in Ideascale.  But what if access to that protocol involved passing through a \"proof of life\" quiz to get access to the CA guidelines, which included a \"proof of having read the guidelines\" quiz that granted access to the protocols?  Of course, there would need to be some logisitical adjustments, particularly in our interaction with Ideascale (though if access passed through the community CA tool, and the tool was incentivized with data and process perks, that could be mitigated).  This is just one example, but you could imagine similar \"proof of learning\" access to many resources in Catalyst, from discord channels to vCA roles to community docs.  With the right partnerships, this project could have real impact on our Catalyst learning networks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I hinted at it above, but the key to this project is the partnerships it forms with Catalyst.  The technology is built and in use.  I tested a couple of the DAO use cases on the proposers website and I can honestly say that I am now ten times smarter about a couple of DAOs that I don't particularly care about, lol.  But the tests made it clear just how flexible the protocol is and what can be done with it in Catalyst.  The trick is in getting members of Catalyst who are knowledgable about productive \"learning paths\" to and through different roles to bring that knowledge to the platform that DoDAO represents.  They clearly have a command of the technology platform, and the use cases show many underrated aspects, such as gating access to private discord channels or document repositories.  Unfortunately, the proposal includes a roadmap and timeline (and a budget related to these) that doesn't effectively address the possible Catalyst use cases, and instead is couched in the needs and language of expecting the Catalyst community to approach the project as a number of DAOs.  If you will allow me to translate, though:  the timeline and budget effectively dedicates about a fifth of the budget to working with community members to define use cases and protocols for around 6 unique onboarding tracks (worth noting there is a discrepancy here where they adjusted the budget based on feedback from the community, but not all instances of the original numbers in the proposal were caught).  Once clarified, those use cases will be treated with the creation of the education protocols that will be quizzed (along with whatever resource is being locked behind them, which could include badges or integration with the reputation system) and then the creation of a video that summarizes the work alongside a rollout of the \"guide\" which is the testing protocol itself.  Most of the budget is set to go to this resource creation/protocol rollout.  The videos, IMO, are not key deliverables, but they are a tiny fraction of the budget, so I see no issue with their inclusion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Everything for DoDAO is available in their GitHub, and I anticipate that the Catalyst toolmakers will be busy with that repo.  They also have their Notions board up for all to see and have stated that they intend to make everything they create fully the property of the community.  Because working with commnity members will be a critical first step for the project, I expect that they will have ample communication and collaboration channels open.  There is no reason to think the project shouldn't be able to stay up to date and on track.  They haven't indicated it explicitly, but it looks like we can expect the different \"DAOs\" to be in simultaneous development, so progress reporting should be no problem and blocks in one area should be made up for by progress in other areas.  This proposal is lacking a time horizon for completion of the work.  My feel for it is that they could be completing around 2 projects a month, with about 2 months for fully capturing the scope of the work and developing the partnerships, so estimate this at 6-8 months.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 7317, "q0": "I believe that this proposal partially meets the objectives of the challenge. It is a platform that, as I understand it, brings together several DAOs and each of them has a tab, on which those who click will see basic information such as the product being created, team values, areas that need new members, information about rewards, etc. These guides would also guide the way of people very accurately and able to track their digital wallets. About this, I do not know is such an interesting idea. Imagine that a person using this platform wants to know the DAOs there but without the commitment to get involved, without the desire to provide any personal data. Would the obligation to involve digital wallets not be a barrier for new participants? Anyway, I think the project meets part of what we asked for in the challenge, because it would be an incentive for those who already know Cardano and know what DAOs are and want to engage in one of them, but I don't think it's an accessible space for brand new members. In this way, the proposal aligns with the objective of increasing the engagement of current members of the Cardano community, but it would not be a gateway for new members, because I think that they would hardly find this site and if they did, they would probably not understand it. it, right? In any case, as it is an idea that can benefit the Cardano ecosystem, we must pay attention to it and conclude, through the analysis of all parties, whether it is viable for funding. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is no actual script here. We know that the plan is to create 18 DAOs, and what would be done for the development of each. This part is done with a good level of detail, we were able to understand clearly what would need to be done individually. The issue here is that this information is not organized in a timeline, that is, we do not know, for example: in which month of 2022 this project would start to be put into practice, if financed; how long it would take to fully create each DAO; how long each task needed to create them would take individually. If this was communicated along with the details of the process, we would have a good roadmap, as we would understand what was going to happen and also when. About budget division, 48k of funding is requested; the explanation of this money is made a little superficially, in my opinion, because we know that each DAO would cost on average 2000 USD (actually they give a price range, which is a little worrying, because what happens if a DAO comes out more expensive? Will you lack money for another one?). The understanding of the price of each DAO is satisfactory, what worries me is the additional 12k, it is a very high amount and it is not so clear what it would be used for. According to the proponent, this reservation would be \u201cto create educational content related to topics like legal, tokenomics, etc. of DAOs\u201d. But this information is passed in a little abstract way, I believe that if we had more details about it, the trust would be greater. How much would go to the legal part? What are tokenomics? If that money doesn't need to be used, where does it go? And finally, regarding the team, I think that unfortunately this part of the proposal leaves something to be desired. We know the names and roles of those involved in the project, but the information is superficial. A really detailed curriculum on any of them is not included, so we could see examples of their previous work in practice; we don't know how these people relate to the Cardano ecosystem, it is not said that none of them have experience with our blockchain technologies, and in my view it is essential to have at least one professional who is well-understood about everything that says about Cardano . So, unfortunately, that part of the proposal needs, in my view, a good review. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The project's auditability is good, but could improve in some aspects. I think it's very positive that they use Notion, an organization application that can be used for shared online work, and leave it to anyone who wants to consult everything that is recorded there. They also have a github repository where the community would be able to monitor the more technical parts of the project. The only thing that I think was lacking was a better defined script so that we could have more clarity than verifying if it was being done in the right way, at the right time and by the right people. If that were included, I would say that the tracking process would be perfect. Now going to the results, I think it is possible to analyze the success of the project, as the proponent says, by the development and unfolding of the 18 DAOS. As it is a fragmented project, one could say, two things would be interesting: both that the proponent maintains constant and periodic contact with the representative of each DAO, so that, for example, every month, we have individualized feedback from them, the more towards the end of the project, as the DAOs were advancing in their own projects, the results would be shared with the Cardano community itself. It would also be important that community members use the site, to check its ergonomics, that the guides created are really clear and are as promised. With that, I think it is possible to audit this proposal quite adequately. I will give it 4 stars because I think the proponent presents what is necessary for a satisfactory follow-up, but with a few more activities it could improve its quality. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 444, "q0": "The proposal is essentially about creating interactive guides to help with onboarding people into DAOs that are connected with or built on Cardano. But this challenge setting is about onboarding into Catalyst specifically, and into Catalyst roles such as CA, proposer or mentor; so the proposal doesn't address the challenge at all. The proposer asserts that by using their platform and being onboarded into a DAO, this will increase \"active commmunity members\"; but this seems unlikely, as there are not necessarily any connections between Cardano-based DAOs and Catalyst itself. Further, the approach of their platform, with (for example) tracked completion, gatekeeping until someone has correctly completed a task, and onboarding people only for a specific role, is antithetical to the overall approach of Catalyst, which prefers to allow people to jump in and make mistakes, and to be part of a community where they can try any role - so if anything, onboarding via this method would make it more difficult for someone to then onboard into Catalyst, if that was the intention.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Feasibility of the proposal is immediately questionable since so much of the project depends on good content-writing. The risk assessment mentions the need to onboard more content writers, and will mitigate this by getting funding to pay them; but securing good content writers is not just about being able to pay. I would like more information about how they'll be selected to ensure they are good; I'd like to see some project resources allocated to recruitment, and/or a quality control process in place. Additonally, the costings and numbers seem very vague - the budget gives a wide cost range for each item, then suggests a total cost of $2,500-$3,000 per DAO, but then immediately says they will do it for $2,000; the project plan talks about recruiting \"at least 5-10\" new content writers: 5 to 10 is quite a wide range, and with \"at least\" it's even vaguer - I feel I'd like to know more clearly how many.  It's also confusing that the project timeline mentions creating content for 18 DAOs, but then the budget only mentions 6 DAOs. The outline of the team is similarly vague - it's described as only \"some\" of the team - who else is there? - and includes no links to any of their previous work. Overall, due to the vagueness in many areas and the lack of focus on quality content, I feel that the project is unlikely to be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "It's great that the project is tracking its progress in an open-source and transparent way via GitHub; but tracking is not audit just in itself. The proposer identifies an audit metric of having 18 guides completed, for 18 DAOs - this is auditable and verifiable, but limited; it does not tell us much. An additional qualitative metric is suggested, that the 18 DAOs feel happy with the quality of the work. It's good that some qualitative information is being suggested; but there is nothing in the project plan on how, or if, that information might be collected and recorded, which makes it not auditable. Also, since the actual aim of the project is meant to be onboarding, I'd like to see the proposer measure how many people are onboarded e.g. over a period of time, and to consider ways to assess how far that might be attributable to the use of the Guide.

While in this Challenge, the key metrics are to onboard CA's, vCA's, weekly sign ups to IdeaScale, Town Hall attendance etc. Perhaps if the proposer was to suggest onboarding Catalyst Swarm DAO, Playermint DAO, WADA DAO that would be definitely align with this Challenge. The thing is, that would require those entities to have already communicate with this proposer and no such communication is mentioned. The proposer only mentions they would like to create 6 (six) DAO's. They are basically asking funds to develop DAO's but in the current proposal's state, no Cardano related community DAO's. Though as mentioned I assume this more to not understanding the complexity of Project Catalyst, therefore I would suggest the proposer to dive deep into the Cardano community.

This proposers solution is more down the line of hybrid between Harmony ONE's landing board with their separate voting app. Project Catalyst needs these kinds of automation, IdeaScale, although have shown improvements, they are much behind Avalanche's DAO Hub/AVA Hub. In terms of the amount of workload Project Catalyst is going through, the amount of communal fork originating from Project Catalyst is growing exponentially. At it's current situation, there are already many inputs from new community members that feel it is confusing to be involved in Project Catalyst. Hopefully with this short intro, the proposer can further develop their protocol, method on approaching the Cardano community and how to submit a proposal. Regarding submitting a proposal, as mentioned previously, it would also be best to contact Catalyst School.\n\nWith that said though, the proposer's current offered solution and how they would deploy their solution since is a bit confusing. A large amount of their budget will go into educational materials to use the DAO, but again education on whose DAO? It seems the proposer expects everyone to use their DAO? So what happens when no one uses their DAO? How will the proposer justify the return of intent to the community?
