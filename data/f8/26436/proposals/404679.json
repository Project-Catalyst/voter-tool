In theory, the Checkpoint platform would aim (according to the proponents) to allow users to access their digital assets, which includes NFTs (I don't know what else would be included, it would be interesting to clarify this) in wallets integrated with content of different blockchains. Users would be able to view and share their assets as long as the blockchain in question is supported by the shared digital wallets. The idea is to work with cross-chains, allowing an exchange of experience between Cardano, his names, and the other members of other cryptographic communities. This is very much in line with the specific objectives of the challenge, such as they are mentioned in the scope of explanation present in ideascale; in my view, several required topics would be covered, such as: the number of technical implementations capable of connecting Cardano with other blockchains; ideas from other chains implemented by Catalysy and project and Dapps from other chains implemented in Cardano. This can be seen from the moment that the core of this idea is to maintain an explicitly direct bridge with other blockchains. However, this is very theoretical, the proponents do not explicitly explain how this apparently very complex technology could actually be built. Due to the lack of direct explanations of how the project would be developed, I really can't be completely sure that the intentions (which are great) will be achieved. As much as the roadmap should be presented only in the topic below, on feasibility, it is always necessary for proponents to explain very clearly how the idea would leave the theoretical field for practice, that is, which parts would constitute the whole; which phases would need to be developed for the final product to be delivered; which professionals would be working here; metrics called \u201cdeliverables\u201d, which can tell us what needs to be done, when, how and by whom; so that we then have a solid view of the project creation. In other words, even though the idea is fully aligned with what we are looking for specifically here, I don't feel safe to give a good rating for the impact of the proposal. If the proponents had attached the explanations that I cited, this would certainly be different, because in addition to understanding what would have to be done, we would know how it would happen and with that we would have more confidence as to the impacts that the project would generate for the Cardano ecosystem. So, I think it is necessary for the proponents to reformulate the presentation of the idea, specifying better the commented issues. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The development process of this project is very superficially informed. We know what activities would be done during the year 2022, however, we don't know important things like 1) how long each of them would take 2) in which months of the year each would be happening 3) who would do each thing 4) how they would do it. It would be essential for proponents to detail each of these activities in good detail, the way they are presented, we only have a notion of what would be done, not a solid understanding of how this would be possible. The same thing I said about impact, it is not enough to inform what the objective is, and without how it will be achieved through small tasks that will be completed in a progressive way. A certain part of the proposal arrives where the proponents explain how the sharing of the NFTs would be (in \u201cInitially, Checkpoint will offer commercial NFT cards. These cards will be released as albums, consisting of 20 cards per album, each with a unique design, etc etc. ...). I found this explanation great and super necessary for us to understand more clearly what would happen in the day-to-day usability of the platform. However, this still does not clarify how its construction process would have to be done in detail. In other words, this part of the proposal is inadequate, requiring better detailing. Moving on now to the budget analysis: this part is also very superficial. We know that the total funding is split into 3 parts and how much would go towards each (Smart Contract Creation - $25,000 + Marketing - $5,000 + Contingency - $2,000 USD). However, there is no detail on each of these parts. For example, in smart contract, which professionals would work here? For how many months? For how many days a week, totaling how many hours? What would the hourly rate be? What is the justification for the 25 thousand dollars? The marketing part should also be better explained, we don't know which marketing strategy will be adopted, so we don't know if the asking value is fair or abusive. Will there be a social media campaign? More traditional media? How will members of different cryptographic communities become aware of this project? And about the last expense: what is a contingency fee? Why does it cost 2 thousand dollars? I can't clearly understand how the money would be used, too much detail is talking. Finally, analyzing the team involved in the project, this part is much better. We know the names and a very rich curriculum of each team member, so we understand a little about their careers and what areas they work in. Two things worry me, however: the fact that no one attaches linkedin profiles or provides some r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by which we can verify everything they say and also no one seems to be an expert in Cardano; How can we ensure that they are technically prepared to handle our blockchain technologies? In general, the feasibility is low, especially the first two topics should be much better explained. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is no way to monitor the process. Proponents already explain auditability by turning to the end results, that is, how the application could be considered properly constructed and successful. This would be understood by the number of people using cross digital wallets, amount of tokens traded, rewards received for mitigated content; and also, when the application is self-sustaining, that is, when the marketing costs were all supported by the generated revenue. In fact, these are good ways to understand if what was created got where it was expected to go, but there are many things that are pending here. Let's start with the first part that should be supervised: the process. How could project development be measured? What measurable metrics would be adopted? What quantitative and qualitative data would need to be constantly monitored? How could we ascertain whether the work routines of professionals were being followed and respected? It is essential that the script, first, be better detailed. With that, we would be able to have good material to serve as a basis for monitoring. In the second instance, the proponents should update at least monthly the IOG coordinators and the members of the Cardano community on the partial results, the small advances. It would be necessary for some contact to be established, whether via discord, telegram, gitbug, video calls and etc. Really, the platform is the least. The most important thing is to ensure that all content that needs to be monitored is actually monitored and that this is done at the correct frequency. Turning now to the success scenario, the proponents focus only on the direct results of their application, not thinking about verifiable ways to see how this all affected Cardano. Has the objective of this challenge, that a good exchange between our blockchain and the others be made, been achieved? How can we see better engagement of our community members from this project? Did the number of Ada and CNFTs in circulation grow from this idea? How to measure, prove it? I think that, unfortunately, auditability leaves a lot to be desired, several necessary things would not be analyzed according to what is being informed to us, requiring a reformulation of this part of the proposal. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 6, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10247, "q0": "The space of NFTs has been growing rapidly in the past few months and proposing key ideas to make this space more useful and exciting for the end users, is always nice to see.

With that statement, i mean that the interoperability can be applied to also other assets except from NFTs. I can clearly get what the whole idea is about, so i totally agree with how the proposer decided to describe it, and that it is among the challenge setting of the cross-chain.

Referrals on LinkedIn were not provided, so experience can not be 100% verified from that perspective, but that is to facilitate the voting process and assessment. The plan is described clearly but there is no timetable, it is devided in activities but there is no time horizon. The budget is there and has been broken down but I believe there should be a bit more information considering the items for example in the smart contract creation, i think you should mention the number and type of developers and how many hours are going to be needed and then refer to the budget of the activity and name the activity as \"development\". Great job when it comes to referring to the risks that might emerge when tacking such a proposal. However, be a little more specific to the kind of the resources needed for this purpose. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The fact that there is no clear roadmap and a time horizon makes me think twice of the success of this proposal.  The fact that the one KPI described is not accompanied by a number, for example how many people engaging with the product IPs will be needed to think of this proposal as a success, adds up to that questioning of mine. Keep in mind that the key metrics and how you measure them, is a key for the auditability of the proposal. What is more, there is no way to track the progress of the proposal apart from visiting the github account, as i can imagine, something that is not very useful.
