This is an important target group for the development of cardano due to the high potential and early age of the people of that group. \nThe proposer suggests working on that issue by providing daily zoom calls and assistance in proposal development. This has already been funded in funds 4,6 and 7 and now it is suggested for fund 8. The proposer states that they have reached 3400 students on zoom, but does not provide evidence for that. The total funding for the past 3 times this proposal was funded is $19800.\n The proposer states that they will be applying for additional funding in the next funds, (despite that the F7 funding should have been the last) until they gather enough students that make proposals, that the referral fees could fund the project.\nI strongly agree there is no other challenge that will host this proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer explains in an free language what is the routine of the team, calls to university, zoom meeting, slides, presentation. However the proposer does not provide neither links to the slides nor a recording of the meetings.\nThe proposer explains that this funding request is for 3 months salaries of the team. \nThe budget is broken down, and that is why we see that except salaries there are expenses for hardware, a laptop for $1800.\nThe proposer presents the team and the tasks are delegated, however there is only one link to the proposer\u2019s CV.\n\nI neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer does not provide any milestones, timeline, or any reasonable benchmark to be audited by. The proposer states that there will be a separate wallet for the funding to enable tracing of payments. How is this relevant at all?!\nThe proposer states that they have a target of 50 students by presentation, but since the proposer does not provide the recordings of these meetings, the auditor cannot know that. \nI strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1417", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5003, "q0": "This project successfully addresses a topic that is not covered in any other category.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since this is a proposal for a continuation of a project that has already been funded, multiple times, it is clear that it has already been successful.

This is not something that is done easily, but they clearly state how they have and will continue to do so.

This is a commendable effort, showing that they are serious about this proposal.\nHe also collaborates with many technical experts, some of them university professors, to improve the quality of the discussions, and to make it easier for students to engage.\nYou should be more specific about what you're going to share. Don't just stop at discussions. If it is accompanied by promoting blockchain formal training at universities and taking cardano as a blockchain model for future students, then your proposal is very valuable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In this section you need to present ways you can show your work progress and results through your work plan and specific target numbers.\nFor example your youtube channel will have how many videos/discussions/how many attendees are uploaded.\nWhich universities will you partner with to support the promotion of student clubs to learn blockchain research here..\nThose are realistic goals, and it takes a self-reported reporting tool to demonstrate to the community your integrity, hard work, transparency, and dedication.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_648", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8694, "q0": "The focus of this proposal is about reaching out to University and college students, teaching them about Cardano and the existing opportunities in Cardano through daily zoom sessions.

Proposal objective is to reach out to as many students and graduates as possible to raise awareness of Cardano and its opportunities for both developers, professionals, and business owners. \nTalking about addressing the challenge, this proposal in my opinion could have rather fit the New Member Onboarding Challenge.
