There is no reference in the proposal to Cardano, or any apps building on Cardano. The proposal could benefit the ecology of the planet, but it is dubious how it would benefit Cardano directly. The proposer does not answer how the proposal addresses the Challenge objectives and I also fail to see how it does.

The proposer does not provide a linkedin profile, or a academic references, but after searching for his name it leads to an academic page at a university in Mexico. The budget is set at 93k and is split by categories on which it will be spent, the biggest one is 30k for compensation for a Biological Technician and Graphics designed for the comic book. No timeline is given. At a relatively high budget, there is good credibility that it will be delivered, but what ever is delivered does not have a link back to Cardano.\n\nI would suggest that the proposer elaborates on if and how the comic series can added as possibly NFTs on Cardano and sell the originals as collectibles?!", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal outlines the goals of registering the name and logo for the comic series, create and register characteris for the series, storyboard design, publish 4 issues of the comic series.

To receive a higher rating I would recommend the proposers to describe how the project addresses the specific challenge and explain the value of their proposal to the Cardano ecosystem.

Furthermore, the reader receives no information about the team members that will be involved in the project, which makes it hard to assess whether the project is feasible. For example, the proposers wish to publish a comic every three months and arrange a keynote conference with each issue. Whether this is possible greatly depends on the experience and size of the team that works with the project. To receive a higher rating and strengthen the credibility of the proposal I would recommend the proposers to provide information about the team and further specify their project plan and timeline.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposers provide no explicit metrics or KPIs that allows community members to audit the success of the project. However,  the proposers do state several milestones that should be reached along the way to be able to launch the comic.

Examples of such KPIs could be \u201cby issue 5 we should have X number of readers\u201d.

Additionally, the large budget covers the hiring and purchasing of everything required, therefore it is not clear what exactly the proposer brings to the challenge, and what skills and assets they are providing.

Also, to make a comic, you need, at least, a writer and an illustrator in the team, and it seems that this project still does not have anyone with these characteristics. Or at least someone like that is not stated in the project.\n \nTo fund a comic, I consider it fair to at least recount a plot line or show previous artwork.
