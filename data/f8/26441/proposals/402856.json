If I understand it correctly, this proposal aims to create a web portal that connects Cardano users to charities and NGOs, acting as a bridge or mediator between them. There is (to my knowledge) no Cardano project currently operating that is focusing on binding together Cardano users and NGOs/Charities and users of the ecosystem in this way, even though there are specific charities around. I believe the proposers are correct in assessing that there is some value in having a broad scope, and that it will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem. Or rather, increase the utility within the ecosystem. There is a strong humanitarian drive permeating within this proposal, aligning very well with Cardano\u2019s vision in making the world a better place. On top of this, the proposal addresses a very current issue considering everything that is happening in the world, from global pandemics to military and political conflicts. \n\nI am lacking knowledge of technical expertise, but I believe it would be beneficial if the proposal mentioned how this project will bring value to the Cardano users, apart from a great utility and use case within the ecosystem, and attracting new organizations to using Cardano.\nOverall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There seem to be a pretty level headed understanding of the development of the project, even though the project still is in its \u201didea phase\u201d (as mentioned by the proposer). \nThe team of three people is stated to carry a lot of technical expertise which would be nice to have verified within the proposal in the form of for example LinkedIn-links or links to previous projects/products. The fact that the team has experience of being SPOs adds some credibility and proof of understanding of the Cardano Ecosystem. As the proposer themselves state, developing this proposal into a finished product would require additional team members, mainly with PR-expertise since one of the main challenges (also stated by the proposer) is reaching out to organizations and NGOs, convincing them to use the platform and networking. It would benefit the proposal highly with a detailed budget breakdown with an estimate of allocated funds (for example, 4000 USD allocated to Marketing/PR, split by two people working full time for 8 weeks), preferably with the addition of a timeframe for the development of the project. The budget of 10% of the total challenge fund is substantial (but realistic), considering the potential scope of the proposal. I know that the project at the moment is more idea than product, but including a couple more potential ways to achieve success in the form of a roadmap/plan with milestones would increase the transparency of the project, and by doing so also the quality of the proposal. Due to the lack of concrete information contained in the proposal, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal mentions number of enlisted NGOs as a potential KPI/metric, which is a good start. Having seen numerous proposals as a CA for several funds, a suggestion from me would be to maybe consider tracking how many Cardano users that utilize the platform? In its current form, the proposal is lacking a detailed roadmap with included milestones on a time horizon, which would improve the auditability of the proposal greatly. The proposal does address a very clear and understandable problem as well as provide the reader with an intended solution. However, most information is currently in a very early speculative phase with not much details or plan provided. The idea in itself is great but could be further elaborated, especially with the addition of a detailed plan. It is imperative for funded proposals that the community is able to track the progress of development, along with a means of communication between users and the \u201downers\u201d of the project. Regarding the auditability and clarity of the proposal, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_349", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 488, "q0": "The global NGO market generates approx 285 billion USD annually and especially during times of global or large national crises globally, they become major centers of global attention.

I would advise the team to think about bringing on an advisor or two that has knows the global NGO sector well to help with the missing detail that is needed for this proposal.

Re: Budget and timeline, they \"can't provide much detail at this point\" other than providing their credentials as NGO volunteers, twitter operators (13 followers on the account) and stakepool operators (less than 12k ADA active stake at time of reviewing for Humanity Pool).  My advice for the proposer would be to build a little more confidence in the Catalyst system for your proposal by submitting a more developed proposal that demonstrates at least an ability to advertise and attract attention/traction around an idea.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "While their stated goal to enlist NGOs in this initiative might be more easily measurable than any other delivery metrics, I think they are vastly underestimating the market reach that would be needed to make a platform like this a success.  And don't plan to depend purely on the NGOs for this unless it is a solve-all solution for them you're creating more of a marketplace that requires multi-faceted marketing initiatives with no demonstrated ability to execute those initiatives.  I really like the idea of this proposal, but I think the author's should invest a little more time to develop the KPIs and execution plan to pitch in a later fund if they really want to do it.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1224", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1527, "q0": "This proposal aims to build a platform to connect charities/NGO's with the Cardano community to enable donations in ADA. The proposers have identified a problem that probably many community members can stand behind. Connecting the Cardano ecosystem with credible charities also increases the overall integrity of the Cardano community. It takes us one step closer to being recognized and accepted by the general public. It is an ambitious project with many obstacles to tackle, the proposal is not addressing the scope and complexity so much but more feedback on that will be provided in the feasibility section.\nThe proposer is unsure about the question \"Please describe how your proposed solution will address the challenge?\". Here you should add how your proposal aligns with the challenge setting and its goals (Miscellaneous challenge in this case). On the same note, the proposal is indeed submitted in the right challenge setting. There is no other great fit challenge and this proposal is aligns with the general campaign brief of the Misc. challenge.\nOverall the idea is indeed impactful, it can help the community to help the world if it were to be implemented successfully. In terms of impact this proposal will receive 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers admits that this proposal is more of an idea and a they are dipping their toes into the Catalyst process. It is good to see that they have acknowledged some main challenges obstacles that they have to tackle in order to take this idea to an implemented solution. One of those being connecting and onboarding credible NGOs, a suggestion for this proposal is to start these conversations and return in a later fund to prove the feasibility of the idea by presenting potential NGOs that are interested. \nTo argue for the low score that will be given: The proposal needs a detailed plan and milestones and a budget with relevant posts. Also providing some proof to validate your claims of experience would increase your credibility. Unfortunately the proposal is not feasible in its current state but the proposer is encouraged to return in later funds with a refined proposal. Good luck! :)\nScore given: 1-star.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is a bit lacking as well. The proposer should provide a clear path for the community members to audit the progress of the project. This could for example from a public Github repo or regular updates in a discord channel for example.  The proposers have mentioned an idea of KPI's and should expand upon these in this section. They will receive 1 extra star for having the basic fundamentals down. A last tip is to look at other successful proposals in previous funds with projects a like this one and gain inspiration from what they are doing right.\nFor now, the score will be 2 stars.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_139", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We're aiming to build a digital hub/web portal connecting charities and NGOs and Cardano users worldwide.", "experience": "We're doing voluntary work for a NGO in Germany and are thus familiar with the operating principles + needs of them.
