Over time many projects have had new updates, but on Cardanocube.io is still the same old content.

When opening the Project Management feature, the proponent only needs to integrate the 'Membership and user login' utility (Ex: Magic, Pico, MemberStack\u2026) which are available on Webflow marketplace at the following link: https://university.webflow.com/integrations-type/memberships. With the experience of this project proponent, within 24h, he can open this feature. I find this proposal technically feasible.\nAbout connecting with the project owner: I find this to be the hardest part that the proponent will face, he does it all alone, it will be challenging to connect with the project owner, which requires It takes a lot of time, requires patience, dedication. Objectively, not all project owners are willing to take the time to update projects on Cardanocube.io; not all project owners can connect... the proponent does not have a solution to the problem.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As mentioned above, Cardano Cube is a project directory website built on Webflow, so the feature expansion will be done quickly, but the new features of the website can still run on the existing infrastructure.

Regarding the cost of designing an account management environment: $2,400, this is also an unreasonable proposal. This feature just needs to integrate the extension from Webflow's available resources at a much cheaper price.
