There are 5 outlined problems to be solved and the rewards will be appointed by the community involved, defacto it is a challenge for best solution.\nThe problem is that a lot of soils are polluted with heavy metals. The fact is, that hemp plants absorb heavy metals. I was surprised and skeptical despite the attached paper by the proposer, so I made some research, it is true.(https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/6/907/htm) The solution is to use hemp for extraction of HM from the soil.\nThe proposal is a first step in building an incentivized framework for landowners to grow hemp on contaminated land. \nThe project does not envision a big impact for the Cardano block chain, but if all incentives are made in ADA, there case could be made, that the project drives adoption.\nI strongly agree that there is no better challenge to host this proposal than the miscellaneous challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer present a very hard to find plan for action but, but he makes for it by huge enthusiasm and pure volunteerism for the organization of the proposal and the challenge.

The overlap and the final impact seems very low.

I found it very interesting how he attached the speech of an expert to the proposal, reinforcing the argument that hemp really is significant in this matter of soil improvement. However, I didn't think that the proposal is in line with the challenge for the simple fact that it is not certain if Cardano will benefit from it. The author states that a decentralized network would be created for landowners and future plant growers to organize themselves; some Cardano technologies would be used, and according to the author they would fit in various challenges like open source development, dApps and integrations, business solutions (B2B and B2C), new member Integration and improve and increase auditability. But it is not made explicit which technologies these are. Therefore, the impact seems low to me, due to a lack of understanding.\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "In terms of script, the explanation is very superficial. We know that the project would be divided into 5 phases, but it is not detailed what exactly would happen in each. They are only mentioned, not explained. How would focus regions be decided? Who would decide this and by what criteria? I do not agree that we have a good understanding of the process based on the information given to us. Next to each of these 5 phases, it is also told how much it would cost. The author says that a kind of competition would be made, in which developers would propose solutions for each of the phases, and the winners would be paid in the amount of one thousand dollars. I think it's a little tricky to establish this, as different professionals might cover different values, but it can be a good idea. The budget division here is really quite different from most proposals. Finally, analyzing the team, it is just the author. He is a person involved with the community, but does not exemplify previous work well. It's also worrying that he doesn't have a team in place; with this, the necessary trust is not passed, which would be installed if we had a multidisciplinary team with presented curricula.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The measurement of progress would be based on 3 indicators. I think they are sufficient and adequate for us to monitor the progress of activities, but I would like the proponent to make it clearer how such information would reach the members of the Cardano community. Would he organize them himself, compose reports and forward them through the telegram, discord, etc groups? I think that if this point were clarified, I would say that everything is ok with the auditability of the progress. Regarding the final results, it is difficult to define the overall success since the proposal corresponds only to the initial phase of this idea, from what I understand. But in general, it is defined that when the litepaper was made with the proposed solutions and when the Cardano community gets involved with the cause, success would be considered achieved. So, it's a simple, but somehow efficient way to measure whether the project worked. It just needed more specificity.
