Your project awakens many major global problems that go beyond a single field. Here you raise capital to produce natural grass straws to replace the plastic straws that we are using every day. You exploit and plant natural grass to make straws, it's a great idea that not everywhere can grow this grass.\nThe project has a large positive impact on the environment and resonates with the vision Cardano is aiming for. The proposed solutions are very reasonable, create and hire local resources to carry out production. That both creates jobs for local workers to have more income while keeping the main raw material area for a long time.\nThe proponent also makes straws in terms of length and packing according to the quantity. I found that 18-20cm for tall cups and 13-15cm for lower cups, it's very reasonable and makes the most of the production materials. In particular, each replacement plastic straw is a less harmful environment for plastic waste and marine animals.\nI'm so excited about your project, keep it up!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Great for this proposal, I rarely see proposals that speak to their business model. In this project, you have come up with a perfect business model: from investing in creating raw materials to the production process to exporting and even reinvesting. A model of continuous production reinvestment for growth is a very good thing. Here I understand that for every ADA coin invested in the project, a green area will be grown, more jobs will be created and plastic straws will be replaced, what could be more wonderful when ADA creates a chain of such good values. Moreover, you have calculated the breakeven point for the project. It is very feasible in my opinion, 7-8 months, even 9-12 months for the breakeven point is also a successful project. I am a trader, so the breakeven point is very important and you have found this important point, in my opinion, it is the most important KPI for every investment project.\nYou guys have been very detailed in your proposal, the budgets are clearly explained even talking about currency devaluation in production investment which I have not seen any business proposal talk about, plus point for you. The project development team has enough talent and experience, as I see it, has all the roles and responsibilities of the members involved in the project.

Currently, grass straws are priced at $ 95 / 1,000 units of pipes; the reference price is at the Peagreen.global website, this is a high price compared to some other types of environmental protection straws such as rice straws, paper straws. If the proponent does not have a backup plan, the sales target of this proposal will be difficult to achieve the KPI when competing on price with the above two types of environmental protection straws. In my opinion, there should be more technical applications of Cardano such as managing workers, pastures, products by NFT, or users can trace the origin of grass straws on the Cardano blockchain, can refer to case study wine producers use Scantrust.com for traceability and anti-counterfeiting (See evidence: https://www.scantrust.com/case-study-baias-wine-anti-counterfeiting-and- supply-chain-awareness-on-the-Cardano-blockchain/).

I'm afraid that the way this Assessor scores with their sketchy assessment is potentially risky for voters, and it should be filtered out.\n \nWhile we submit in great detail that:\n \n===== Proposed Solution in this project =====\n \n1/ Production:\n \nExploiting natural grass areas along with planting and developing new grass areas as materials for making grass straw: We plan to use 7-8 months-old sedge plants to make straws.\n \nFurthermore, we will rent land for grass cultivation to develop sustainable material areas\n \n2/ Labor:\n \nHire local people to join our project in growing ingredients, harvesting, and producing\n \n3/ Marketing:\n \nBuild sales and marketing channels through product website or Facebook or launch product advertisement is well-known E-commerce sites such as eBay, Amazon\n \n4/ Export\n \nBesides the domestic market which aims to serve individuals, restaurants, and beverages companies, we also plan to\n \npromote exports to other countries such as the US, Europe, Japan, Korea where plastic straws will completely be forbidden in 2022.\n \n5/ Reinvestment:\n \nProfits from commercial activities will be further invested in: increasing the cultivation area, increasing the straws production volume and export orders, hiring more farmers which contributes to boosting the area economy.\n \n6/ Payment method:\n \nWe will now accept payments in cash and ADA crypto. ADA users will receive a 20% discount at the time of purchase compared to paying with fiat currency. In the future, we will only accept ADA money for the purchase of grass straws on our online store.\n \n7/ Project website: www.peagreen.global\n \n8/ Meaning of the project:\n \nDriving the acceptance of ADA in real-life activities\nCreate more jobs to boost the local economy\nReduce the use of plastic straws which leads to the reduction of plastic waste dumped into the natural environment in general and in particular ocean environments for aquatic creatures.\nCreate a green environment by the constant increase of tree planting area to help reduce CO2 emission.\nOne more contribution of the project is using cryptocurrencies to create sustainability for the global future, which drives more acceptance of cryptocurrencies including Cardano in society.\n \nWe have a business model that calculates break-even points, defined raw materials and labor resources, and\nWe already have our sales channels\nFB community: https://www.facebook.com/naturalgrassstraws\nAmazon-shop: https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B084MCMJR5/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?_encoding=UTF8&imageClass=hi-res&keywords=peagreen&phoneCarrier=wifi&phoneType=iPhone&qid=1581334030&rd=1&sr=8-7&view=INRGeKn9&f\nHome /Shop page: https://www.peagreen.global/\n \nSo our project is very feasible. The 3-star Assessor did not carefully analyze and see the straws that we have in a comparison table in the excel file (at this link: https://bit.ly/3JfExh6).\nThe Assessor score is not accurate to what we presented.\nWe deserve a better score for giving this project a lot of economic and action figures.\nThe success of this project is extremely meaningful, it is not simply a commercial business project but it is a project that includes impacts on many objects, waste environment, jobs for people, and Cardano's influence when funding the project.\nThe Assessor lacked the overall view of the proposal, the analysis and logic to score our project. This does not help the project voter with such general conclusions.\n \nThank you so much\n \nWe apply the following break-even calculation formula:\nQ_BE = F/(r-v)\nIn there:\n(F): Total fixed costs 3 month = 40,013$\n(v): Variable costs per unit (Straw)= 0.035$\n(r): Sales price per unit (Straw)= 0.095$\n(Q_BE): Break-Even Point (Units):\n \n            Q_BE = F/(r-v) = 40,013/(0.095-0.035)\n                         = 666,875(Straws)\n \nThis means we need to sell just over 222,292 grass straws in 1 month, to reach the break-even point.\nWith the intention of bringing to the market 100K grass straws/month\nWe will reach return investing in the 7th-8th month for the first 3-months investment of Fund8.\nIf we give ADA payers a 20% discount on weed straws. To create liquidity motivation for ADA coins. Then we need 10-11 months to pay back the first 3 months\u2019 investment.\n \nYou will find more information about the project at this link: https://bit.ly/3JfExh6"}, {"id": 10267, "q0": "I like this project very much, it addresses one of the most pressing issues today: the environment.

You have determined what needs to be done, thereby allocating the budget reasonably (budget for the first 3 months). Also, I would also like to commend you for coming up with a breakeven point in this fund (3 months). Don't stop there, you've provided a breakeven spreadsheet with a longer time horizon (3 years).

If implemented successfully, it will bring a lot of positive impacts on the environment as well as the Cardano ecosystem: create more jobs for local people, which contribute to the growth of the local economy, land and water resources projection from climate change, creating a good mindset for those who want to apply for Cardano funding to develop other eco-friendly products,... .\nAfter watching the video you provided, I am really touched, plastic straws cause great harm to the environment, affecting the lives of marine creatures.
