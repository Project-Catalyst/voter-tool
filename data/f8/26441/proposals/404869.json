For me the solution was not articulated well enough. Is the video being shown before the water is pumping? Or starting couple seconds before? The content is also not further specified, that would be helpful to assess the impact in more detail. How often will the video be updated or is it a youtube playlist? How many villages (people) will have the station in walking distance?\n\n\nFrom my layman perspective it seems the water pumping video box could scale up in many ways (gamify with questionnaire and raffle, create foundation) or how it will tie into the stake pool operation of the proposer in detail. On the pool website it is mentioned that the cleaning stations can only be maintained if enough delegations are pouring in, however how much is enough is not defined. Other scaling options are not properly described directly by the proposer. Might have been because it seemed straightforward to her/him, since the project would prove it can be done in a very rural area. Then the only  scaling factors would be local solar panel, workforce and material prices.\n ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "All relevant skills seem to be available as the budget breakdown clearly shows that this is not the first time designing (and building a water cleaning station). Its well broken down, seems reasonable (parts are budgeted at about 30-50% less than in Western -Europe).  However I'm missing the video installation items on the list and working hours could be further specified,on a positive note,  it seems they have a local contractor (Tinson) at hand. The company (Tinson) is mentioned on the pool's website as well, but no further information or impressions of the demo cleaning station are available at first glance.\n\nA nice to have would be details on how the station become  sustainable once the active carbon has been depleted? They describe very well in the risk paragraph of the impact section that maintenance costs will increase and will be funded with delegations from the stakepool or in case they won't suffice will offer ad space to local businesses.  Listing what is included in the maintenance would be a big help for the assessment.\n\nThe 3 month time frame seems reasonable on account of worldwide supply chain frictions, however the maintenance plan is not mentioned.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "How is success  and progress measured?\nThe 3 month timeframe seems reasonable, tho the progress granularity is quite coarse. The only metric points are the receiving of funds, ordering of equipment and finished installations. it is not mentioned where this tracking is taking place, tho my guess would be the social channels of the AGUA pool.\n\nSince clean water offers many direct and indirect health benefits its difficult to measure those, but some way should be articulated (a quick survey at the local towns doctors or shaman?) \n\nHowever the overall auditability is very difficult, since this is not a software project and gaming this with current video editing technology and swarm labour is not too difficult. \nIt would all come down to the trust in the AGUA stakepool.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_334", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 2, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 852, "q0": "This proposal might be more appropriate in nation building or scaling-up community hubs challenges, but OK it's in Miscellaneous because there's no clear match.

However, the project proposed also contains an education element revolving around Cardano.  And this budget sort of exposes that there is no financial or scheduling plan to actually implement that education initiative.  So while I could not strongly disagree with likelihood of implementation success, I am challenging implementation of the whole plan with a disagreement position due budgeting contradictions with the solutions statement, exposing that the link to Cardano may have been fabricated only for the purpose of accessing funds in this challenge.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "My experience working on a project basis in conflict zones and impoverished communities has given me the experience to clearly state that there will be limited to no ability to audit delivery of clean water to rural areas in Mexico.  Adding in an educational element for a technology that is likely out of reach for this target audience at the current time, and I would confidently reduce my auditability rating to zero.   That being said, I hope the proposer does find an alternative way to deliver this meaningful support, as I believe every human deserves access to clean water and hygiene.

It is a bit unfortunate that the problem statement is written in a weird way, this poses the risk of voters neglecting the proposal too fast. A suggestion is to write it more cohesive and make a clearer connection of how you provide water to people and educate them about Cardano.\nThe proposal aligns with the Miscellaneous Challenge setting since there is no other \"perfect fit category\" to submit this  proposal in. \nThe water systems will be installed in several locations in Mexico and broadcast educational content about Cardano & cryptocurrencies. However, this proposal seeks funding for the watering systems but does not mention anything about the video material that is to be displayed. It would be favorable for the proposal to include information about the video material. Question such as these could be addressed: \nIs the video material produced already? How do you assure that the information in the videos are correct? How do you make the videos interesting and not cheesy, furthering bad rumors about cryptocurrencies? If you don\u2019t have the videos already, what is you plan to produce these? Do you have a separate budget for the video production?\nThere is a challenge setting currently going on in Fund 8 named \"F8: Film + Media (FAM) creatives unite!\", you might be able to collaborate with teams from there to produce the video material. \nAll in all, the proposal aligns with the challenge setting and it is impactful in multiple aspects.

This is a rather vague description and you should include some metrics that relevant, easy to measure and follow up. An example could be to broadcast the educational video X amount of times.
