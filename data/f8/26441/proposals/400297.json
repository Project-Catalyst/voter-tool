This proposal would use up all of the challenge fund, mainly to pay for assets related to do with waste management. Although Cardano is mentioned as a means of tokenising payments, there is no detailed discussion on how this would work e.g. a white paper. Therefore my first impression is that this is an existing proposal that has been adapted and submitted to Cardano, without any real understanding of the Cardano Catalyst ecosystem or funding mechanisms. \nThe sad thing is the underlying proposal for a waste management system appears really well thought out, and so was maybe submitted to a general purpose fund previously. \nIt would make sense to resubmit this in F9 and separate out the funding for non Cardano related assets, then go into detail on the Cardano development specifics related to tokenomics and value exchange and also how it could be re-used by others wanting to run a waste management system. As it stands this proposal is a one off that couldn't scale and doesn't really add value to the Cardano community.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "This assessment is based on me having 30 years experience working in software development across the lifecycle: design, development, test & support for large enterprise and government organisations. Similar to the impact review, I have the impression that the work list to be carried out and the parties involved shows this is from a prior submission elsewhere. Whilst the people mentioned appeared to be skilled in waste management and project delivery, there is no mention of anyone with Cardano related development skills such as Plutus or Haskell coders that would be needed to deliver the proposal using Cardano. The fact this isn't even recognised as a risk - i.e. that they need to recruit developers, and may struggle given that competition to find them is hard, means that its unlikely this proposal would even get off the ground. Whilst there is a budget proposed, it is very high level and doesn't cover any of the tasks related to Cardano. Even the \"build website\" hasn't been broken down into capital and ongoing hosting costs. Suggesting that it's really a initial cost estimate, not a detailed analysis required to obtain funding at this scale. ($500,000). The proposal is clearly lacking any details on technology or architecture so it is impossible to assess whether it is a good approach. The system that is being proposed doesn't appear to be something simple, but instead has multiple actors, multiple waste sites and processors, so some kind of high level design and architecture blueprint with wireframes is needed to assess the approach.\nLastly there is no project schedule of dates or deliverable work packages or time boxed deliverables. Whilst there are some stages mentioned this again indicates this is an idea for something that needs to be developed more to become detailed enough for a funding proposal.  One specific phrase stands out that make me think the proposers need to get a better understanding of blockchain technology before resubmitting \"All actions in the project - financial transactions, points and ratings - all this is clearly recorded in the database and displayed in the public domain and updated automatically.\"\nIt suggests a collaboration partnership with an existing blockchain development team would be a massive help, and then we could re-evaluate a proposal to deliver something using Cardano, where Cardano hasn't been added as an afterthought. I would advise the proposers to look through other app development proposals on Catalyst in detail, and see what is being funded and what isn't to gain a better understanding of how to apply to Catalyst. Many applications of similar scope are delivered for well under $100,000. If we were assessing the ability to deliver a waste management system it would score highly, but it's delivering a waste management using Cardano, where the proposal is falling short. Don't give up, but do take time to become part of the Cardano community attending townhalls and getting to understand what other proposers are doing. In relation to this proposal I would also suggest joining the Cardano4Climate community as it touches on some common themes.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "There are some metrics defined, which are objective and could be measured. However these are related to usage of the waste management system, and misses any of the project delivery metrics. I.e. how would we track if the funds to develop the waste management system are being spent wisely? Catalyst payments are not a lump sum in advance and instead are paid depend on showing progress against plan. With the lack of a plan in the previous section, then its of no surprise there's no metrics to measure progress either. Ideally what the proposers need to do here is work with a partner that specialises in systems development to break down the work into tasks that can be developed using an Agile development approach. This will provide regular updates of the code to a public github library that can then be assessed by the community as completed. The agile approach should ensure that completed application functionality is release periodically prior to the project completion so users can provide beta test feedback.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_1406", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 840, "q0": "This Miscellaneous challenge is open to a wide range of opportunities, including anything that aims to expand the Cardano community/utility.

While I do think the theme is valuable and important, it will transparency element utilizing Cardano is not well developed in the proposal or attached documents.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposals massive budgets are purposed for (in rubles which is very volatile at the moment) a number of expenditures ranging from construction, recycling plants, petrochemical/product production, and more.  What's missing from a proposal or this scale, perhaps most essential to measure the feasibility of implementation, is a detailed financial plan for analysis.  Also, the proposal states that the collaborators (at least 1) is a public figure in Russia.  Others are involved in the petrochemical industry, or with various Russian government agencies.  A fund supporting those entities directly at this time, especially given the recent war with Ukraine and the potential that funding may violate international sanctions, could pose serious threats to Cardano's reputation or position the network as a target of expanded regulatory activity.  Overall, excellent project idea, but perhaps the wrong time, people, location, and scale.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Of all the project materials prepared for this proposal, the auditability section is noticeably the shortest, indicating that the author prepared the least amount of thought towards measuring success and transparency in fund use and impact delivery.

This is a large order.  It seems that the Cardano ecosystem is involved through the EcoSeed coin.

I would like to see this organized into a chart, something visual to show how this coin has value...and more visuals to communicate the goals and objectives of this proposal as a whole.  The budget is unclear and does not seem to add up to the $500,000 requested.  This is the entirety of the challenge allocation \u2013 The team may want to consider breaking this into smaller, more measurable ventures.  It also stops listing monetary amounts as each stage is introduced.  This project has a huge team, but paying these individuals is not addressed in the budget.
