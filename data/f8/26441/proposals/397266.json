Cardano has suffered from negative articles from biased media for a long time and most of the criticism is unfounded, in addition, crypto media outlets have financial interests and in many cases give priority to sponsored articles. Because Cardano is a project without the support of large VCs and centralized companies, such as BSC, Solana and Polkadot, it is important that we financially support projects that seek coverage dedicated to Cardano projects, as we do not have the same culture of support through VCs in Catalyst The solution of creating a media outlet focused on Cardano can help fill this void and leverage the projects developed on Cardano.\n\nThere is already a challenge that could be appropriate for this proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26452/about) however the challenge brief description seems to be dedicated to film and media and it is not clear if there is space for the creation of written articles, because of that I will not deduct points in this regard.\n\nI consider the goal of 300 articles written in a year to be relevant and with a good potential for impact for Cardano and for Catalyst, but I do not consider that there are appropriate metrics for impact assessment. Only 2 metrics were mentioned for the monthly evaluation of success: Unique readership (which I believe to be a relevant metric when associated with the goal of 40k unique readers per month) and number of articles, which, although it can be used as an indicator, is actually a deliverable and not a metric.\n\nMy recommendation is to create more metrics that allow the community to assess the performance and impact of the proposal over time.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Adapulse is a project that has been in development for several months, the team has already written dozens of articles about projects in the Cardano ecosystem and the team, in addition to researching and writing articles, also has members who act as SPOs for several months, so there is an indication of viability.\n\nThe budget was broken into three parts. The first refers to the costs for creating the article and these values \u200b\u200bare reasonable. The second and third parts of the budget refer to social media marketing/promotion/management and there are no details on the budget breakdown of these two parts, which makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of this part of the budget. e.g. A budget of $20k has been set for social media management, but there are no details on which social media will be managed, how long it will take, how many people will fill this role or the hourly rate of whoever will work in that role.\n\nAlthough the proposal is technically simple, there is no structured roadmap/timeline that allows monitoring the development of the project throughout the year. Should we assume that the 300 articles will be written proportionately over time? How will marketing campaigns be organized throughout the year? I believe that the proposal needs a more solid plan, mainly in the marketing part, to indicate greater viability. I consider the goal of 300 articles achievable without major problems, as Adapulse has already been delivering a large number of articles and the goal of 300 articles despite being an increase with great potential does not seem to bring additional challenges beyond time.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is clarity in the description of the problem and how the solution presented will improve the coverage of information/projects in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThere is no roadmap with milestones, which makes it difficult to audit the proposal. The goal of doubling the number of unique monthly readers is a good indicator of performance. The team committed to making the unique readership & number of published articles available at the end of each month, which facilitates performance evaluation, but the small amount of KPIs/metrics makes auditing and evaluation more subjective and less measurable. I consider that the main point to be improved in the proposal is the addition of metrics/KPIs + a roadmap with deliverables.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_43", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 211, "q0": "This proposal is Cardano centric and would not perfectly fit in any other challenge. By providing a fair and balanced media outlet to communicate happenings in the Cardano ecosystem, this proposal will likely add value to the individuals wanting to learn about Cardano and projects building on Cardano.

The proposal communicates a team of 8 capable content creators involved in the Cardano ecosystem. The budget breakdown is reasonable and will help the team release and market content at a greater rate than they are currently capable of doing. The goal of going from 20k to 40k unique readers per month is seemingly achievable should the quality of content remain high and the ecosystem continue to grow.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "By providing a monthly newsletter with the key metrics of articles released and unique readership numbers, the progress of this proposal can be easily audited. Additionally, with the proposal enabling Adapulse to hire a social media manager the community will be more able to engage with and monitor the happenings of the media outlet.\n\nOverall, this proposal will help bolster a media outlet that has been providing value to the ecosystem for some time now and the goals/objectives outlined in the proposal are achievable and auditable.

The website is well-designed and clearly there is a commitment behind it because, for a brand new project, the current level of content production is fairly healthy. It is functionally something more like a Cardano Advocacy Newsletter with announcements, opinions and explainers than a journalism outlet that strives for objectivity, but that's OK. Cardano could use a news hub, as it were.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are requesting $85000, which is 17% of the entire fund. This is a large ask for a marketing-focused proposal and will raise some eyebrows. This is to fund 300 articles that will each take 5 hours to build (a simple, solid article should take more like 8), and advertising and social media campagins. \n\nThe amount of money requested here would be more justifiable if more detail was provided. What will be your social media project? Is there a strategy already in hand for this? And what is your editorial structure?  We need to see some information about how adapulse works. It looks like you have an editor and a bunch of writers. Do they submit articles for editing to Jeff or are they on their own? Are there any projects planned, like big series about important Cardano initiatives or big issues in the crypto space? How does ADA Pulse fit into the rest of the crypto system? \n\nIn other words, the feasibility section suffers from unanswered questions and a lack of detail. I *do* see reason to be hopeful about this proposal, but a lack of detail hobbles it in a way that introduces uncertainty.  If they fail to get funded, I recommend they try again and focus in a little harder; ask for a bit less and provide a clearer picture of what the plan is.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Sharing metrics at the end of the month is a good idea for making progress auditable. It would be nice if they also find ways to tie their marketing and other funded aspects of their proposal to whatever growth they experience.

Although the proposal identifies the gap in information distribution in term of news coverage and media outlets, the proposal has not mentioned the difference between Adapulse and the other creative media outlets that also produce content on Cardano. It is with good intention that the proposal will help to shine the spotlight on the projects with low advertising budget. However, the relationship between featured team and Adapulse should also be disclosed. Until this is achieved, there would be no fair and balanced media outlet that is what this proposition is all about.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The budget breakdown will clearly help with the operation of Adapulse although whether it spreads its impact towards the whole community remains to be seen. The timeline to complete the project has not been mentioned although Adapulse states that it expects to double its unique readers to 40k within 12 months.

Yet it still lacks to provide the  unique readership per month (benchmark figures) so that the community can notice whether the project is on track and succesfully achieve what it is set to perform.
