The reason these communities might be open to adopting such a mechanism for a traditional protocol, is that the Iddir is at its most functional only at a particular size:  any larger and the groups lose cohesion, they fracture and need to be rebuilt as discrete, smaller Iddirs.  Any smaller, and they become untenable and lack resources to fulfill their intended purpose, leaving the smallest communities without access to this familiar support network.  The idea of a DAO (and the need for DIDs to ensure security and validity) to address the low and high sides of this channel makes perfect sense.  On the high side, when Iddirs become too large, governance protocols can be inbuilt to either distribute decisionmaking to prevent fracture, or to govern the process of establishing separate DA Iddirs when necessary (and the DAO would provide a magnitude greater degree of scalability, perhaps enough to eliminate this upper bandwidth problem).  On the low side, even a single Ethiopian living far from home would be able to participate in the DAO and thus be part of a much larger distributed network of individuals forming their own Iddir.  With governance tokens minted on Cardano, transactions handled in ADA (and at root these are essentially financial institutions in the mold of insurance companies), and an Atala based Identity wallet, this institution used by millions could have significant impact if ported to Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team is not the developer, DAO designer or legal experts required for this project, but they do have the expertise in the Iddir concept required to launch and even lead the team that does all of this.  I would like to see them source a good technical project manager, just to be sure the oversight for the development and platform work was there.  As it stands, the budget is designed to cover the cost of initial research and creation of a whitepaper and roadmap (I expect the proposal team will carry this out.  I would have liked to see the technical project manager as a part of the process in this project, as technical feasibility of proposed solutions is an important consideration in launching the project), decent compensation for some legal counsel (the team indicates approaching IOG, but outside of maybe a reference from the Professional Services team, I am not sure this would be productive), and a very healthy dose of funding for the development team, which is good to see.  Even if the team just forks an existing DAO repository, there still is going to be plenty of work to do in integrating the identity wallet (early signs are that they may partner with RootsID, a Catalyst project in parallel development) and in creating a smooth onboarding mechanism.  In fact, this is the risk that the team keeps coming back to, that adoption may be difficult, and this smooth onboarding process may be the key.  As a DID-only process and not a full SSI platform, the target here may be to keep as much of it in the backend as possible, and keep the focus up front on Iddir participation, as opposed to all the complexity and nuance of DID adoption.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Research projects typically deliver a whitepaper and sometimes a presentation, and that is what the team suggests here, alongside github commits and project management metrics, such as hours in meetings, as ways of keeping track of the progress.  I didn't see an explicit declaration of being opensource, but I expect that is what they are planning, in which case the GtHub tracking should be plenty.  A timeline that presented the development work as a series of sprints, or some other clear workflow path, would be handy to see, as it would clarify the development milestones.  Similarly, the early milestones from the reserach phase, which is expected to take 4-6 months, will probably not stretch to cover that that timeline, so there is some risk of early funding blocks unless the research rolls out on closer to a two month timeframe.  The whole project is expected to deliver in 12 months, and that final success metric, the creation of an mvp DID-based Iddir DAO that can onboard users is certainly a straightforward deliverable.  I anticipate early reporting issues, but overall a project that will be able to stay on track once it gets going.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 8, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10505, "q0": "The problem statement is clear and the solution presented is also clear and well suited to the challenge. The proposal is basically the creation of a community based insurance fund which has the advantage of already being present and known in the local community but would be improved through the use of new technology. This is a high value use case for the community and success in this type of endeavor would create large amounts of adoption for DIDs and for Cardano particularly in the developing world where insurance systems are not adequate. This proposal is a particularly well suited use case for this challenge since it is not only a DAO, it also has a fundamental requirement for an identity system, and targets \"self-governance of emergent communities\" which which are all goals of the challenge. The development of software to implement this challenge and in particular the development of a whitepaper are KPIs which are listed and would create future benefit to other related projects and improve the return on investment for the community. Therefore I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The main proposer is a long time community member who lists relevant experience in organization and could use his contacts in the community to gather the right expertise. There is a claim made that an expert on iddir has been identified but no name or link has been posted. This is actually not overly surprising and given the nature of iddir I do not feel that the expectation of a formal resume here would be realistic and given the level of information given on the subject I also do not feel this is an area of concern in terms of feasibility. There is also a claim that discussions have been had with identity and DAO tool developers but no specifics mentioned and no way to verify included. There is a budget included which has separate costs associated with individual items. There also are timeframes included for completion of each item. The items seem realistic in terms of timeframes and most of the funding items but I have a concern about funding the DAO creation. I am not a technical expert in blockchain technology and my expertise are more in line with governance. From my viewpoint the concept and overall ability to deliver the governance portion of this through a DAO is within the abilities of this team. I am not so convinced about the technical side. This proposal is asking for $12,000 to build a user friendly DAO which incorporates cardano and DIDs. There is mention of using part of the features of freeos which may be possible but freeos runs on a much simpler blockchain (proton chain) without much of the utility and complexity of cardano. I have been a community member since 2017 and have seen the evolution of many projects and this funding seems very low to me but again this is not my field. I also do not see a plan for the potential of not having enough funding to continue the project. It would be good to see the fact that the DAO is eventually aimed to become self funded be a more central piece of the success plan for this project. With all that said the value to the community of simply getting this project started and the fact that a whitepaper is planned and would be a resource for future projects would create enough of a return on investment to justify the funding requested. Therefore I agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a roadmap with individual goals and timeframes associated with each phase of the project. There is also a website which has been created where community members could check progress of the DAO. The website could also be used to post updates and the whitepaper, and although this was not explicitly mentioned in the proposal it would only make sense for the team to do this. The KPIs that are listed are adequate but could be improved with more quantitative targets such as number of users for the DAO, a target number of technical goals accomplished. The what does success look like section is a little vague and could use more concrete goals such as having a DAO with enough users that it becomes self funded. Overall however I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

By implementing DID, DAO framework, legal status of the DAO in the jurisdiction that allows such organization, and forming local, decentralized Iddir chapters in different world regions and in Ethiopia, this proposal is worth exploring.

My guess is that the proposer counts every stage beginning at time zero (t0), and ending at the designated timeframe, thus whole project is set for 12 months to complete for this funding round. \nThe team is not explicitly defined as the project states the need for outreach, and invites assistance from the Cardano community.

By morphing these existing entities into DAOs, the communities would be better able to organize and participate as they scale, a current setback of Iddirs which lead to fractionalization and compartmentalization of the communities. \n\nRather than imposing a top-down structure on these groups, the proposal seeks to maximize the existing networks as decentralized and autonomous organizations. This seems like the exact type of use case to show the supremacy of the DAO, and if successful could likely be extrapolated to other similar community groups across a range of countries. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, overall the experience and plan presented indicate that the proposal will be implemented successfully.

What I would have liked to see is the plan for engaging experts in Iddirs. It is unclear who would be determined an \"expert\" in Iddirs and how they would have these people participate. Would you be running workshops? How many will you be seeking? What criteria will you use to? Given the central role that these experts will play in developing tools and information for users, additional explanation would be useful. \n\nI appreciate that the proposer has identified freeOS.io as a framework to guide the development of a DAO for the DA Iddir. By maximizing existing community resources the proposer will not need to develop their own from scratch which would then need to be validated and verified. \n\nFinally, to get full marks here, the proposer could have done a better job at outlining their credentials. There is no way to validate their claims. While I have seen this individual throughout various Catalyst activities and meetings, it is not sufficient to just state credentials.

How will you determine if the whitepaper is successful? What types of indicators could you measure? As it stands, the only real measure of success is a minimum viable product but it is not clear what form this will take, or how many unique users need to participate to be deemed a success. \n\nNonetheless, this project remains an exciting use case that should receive serious consideration from voters.
