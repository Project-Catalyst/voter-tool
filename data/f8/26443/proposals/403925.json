The framework to be developed will be made available to other groups structuring their DAOs thereby reducing the level of expertise required. This is extremely important as the DAO represents a new way organizing and it is unlikely that all groups who may interested in DAOs would be able to obtain the necessary in-depth understanding. This proposal would allow DAOs to start further down the development line rather than at square one every time. \n\nBy taking a modular approach to their exploration of these issues, the DAO-NET team will look at the major challenges facing all DAOs as standalone issues which then can be combined and organized appropriate. This approach also means that the success of each component is not dependent on the others but instead can be conducted concurrently, allowing results to be applied and tested in an iterative manner.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposers do an excellent job of identifying both the macro objectives and micro tasks that need to be completed to achieve them. The timeline is extremely clear with milestones and deliverables listed throughout the proposal. \n\nThe primary focus of the team will be the structuring of the DAO in line with the necessary regulatory and financial requirements under Wyoming law. The team will benefit from the offer within the challenge brief to work with the existing DAO LLC in Wyoming to better understand the process and challenges to realizing their goals. This support will not only benefit the team in this proposal but can be applied to the other DAOs that use the framework, creating a useful bridge for collaboration of the entire ecosystem. This is important for feasibility as it will reduce the duplication of efforts while creating a community of best practice among DAOs. \n\nThe credentials of the team are well documented and their track record of success in Catalyst implies that they will be successful in this endeavour as well. Based on all the information provided this project is certainly feasible and could reward the entire DAO community moving forward. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The team has clearly written Catalyst proposals before (they have 10 in Fund8) and it shows. The plan is laid out in such a way that the community can follow each step as it happens and can look to the indicators provided to know whether they are meeting their goals. \n\nOver the course of the project, which is set to last six months, the team will be tracking the number of DAOs, the number of members, and the number of verifications. They also commit to making sure that all data is displayed publicly for the community to follow. In addition, the team will use github, and open source tool, to track the number of Pull requests, Total Numbers of commits, and the Total Number of Errors Fixed. This approach of open-source by design should also give voters confidence in the auditability of this proposal as it is easy for any individual to follow up directly on any or all of the indicators mentioned. \n\nThe success criteria are also auditable in their own right, using both yes/no answers for some products, and the indicators above to explain the level to which their objectives were met. The team will also bring in external auditors to check their smart contract code and refine it as needed. All of these items together imply that the team welcomes auditing of their tools and resources, which should be standard across proposals. Great work.

The idea is that an emergent DAO is vulnerable to legacy institutions, and to protect themselves, they should coordinate the strength of many DAOs to provide collective, decentralized legal structures that absorb the damage and go on the offensive as required, utilizing protocols that are universal to the DAOs but localized to the specific regional facts where they operate.  This proposal specifically sets out to create the legal entity that faces the old world, as an algorithmically managed DAO LLC under Wyoming Law (which aligns perfectly with the challenge setting, which is literally asking someone to do this).  As such, it faces legal and regulatory burdens, and we must accept that the result will be emergent.  If I have any concerns about this idea and the overall project, is that the proposals, including this one, don't give me confidence that this team is truly accepting of the uncertainty built into this apoproach.  I get a sense of top down control, sort of a \"centralization of decentralization...But to save it!\" vibe, that makes me cautious here.  Not cautious of the propoer's intent, which I believe is genuine appreciation of the potential of Cardano and its ecosystem, but rather the ultimate adoption of this concept, as I believe the market it targets, DAOs are not conservative enough to value this approach.  However, maybe it onboards a more conservative market that is on the margins?  Again, the uncertainty.  One thing is for sure, the creation of Opensource DAO framework and legal requirements will have value to the community, regardless of the final disposition of this particular project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The specific path to a legal DAO in Wyoming is going to be quite particular:  this proposal is setting out to discover and blaze that trail for a Cardano DAO.  To that effect, I am not looking for specific knowledge of the map ahead of time, I am looking for the ability to read a map, and indicators that the journey is familiar enough to the traveler that the project is undertaken with enough resources, enough time and a good idea of the destination. At 6 months on the timeline, I think this is barely adequate, however I take into account that there is a much larger roadmap in play, and that much of the planning and design has already been underway, and that gives me more confidence.  In terms of the destination, I feel the team has an excellent idea of what the final product looks like (though I would like to see a visual meta-map of what they are describing) and they have done a decent job of portraying both where they are and where they see this going.  In terms of the budget, that is a tough one.  For the deliverable of open source documentation and the creation of an LLC it is a bit steep.  I have formed 3 corporations, of which you could consider an LLC a passthrough subset, and the legal creation of the entity isn't difficult, even for a DAO.  What IS difficult is filling up that entity with the \"stuff\" of doing business with a regulatory/tax facing framework: voting mechanisms, charters, disposition of founders and assets and shares.  It is all of this that takes real time and money.  I am sympathetic to the proposer having already broken this up into multiple proposals over multiple funds, and the idea of yet another split may be unappetizing, but there it is.  I think this has its best shot as two implementations: the creation of the DAO LLC and documentation for that, and then iteration of it into the \"DAO of DAO\" framework envisioned by the whole project.  They can get there on this proposal, but there are risks of delay (if DAO of DAOs is a priority out of the gate) or of funding uncertainty (if DAO of DAO eats up more resources than it has of time and money trying to iterate to a feasible expression of the idea -- I'm looking at the SC implementation along with the Atala voting and governance framework, here).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As a fundamentally Opensource initiative, there is high expectations that its processes will remain transparent.  According to the roadmap as presented (and I have made my case above that it might be upside down) there are a number of critical deliverables to be reported:  Atala integration (DID issuance to member DAOs), documentation of governance protocols for DAO of DAOs, smart contract to execute those protocols, development of a member management portal/dashboard, and registration of the DAO LLC.  Each of those will likely be running in parallel, and each is a big project of its own right, so the team will have plenty of variable and metrics at any given time to report.  The will need tight project management, not just to stay on track but audit that progress.  Each of these project workflows leads to a provable deliverable (from issuance and verification of a DID to a business license for a DAO LLC), so the community will be able to point to specific entities for proof of ROI.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7159, "q0": "The proposal is in perfect accordance with the challenge goal because one of the points of the challenge is to establish a DAO in Wyoming. \n\nThis DAO will then serve as a legal intermediary between DAOs and the state, which can increase the adoption of DAOs in general.
