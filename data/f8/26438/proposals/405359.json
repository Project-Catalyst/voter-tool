From my understanding of it, the proposal aims to create an educational platform (Smart Students DApp). Collaboration with universities and schools but on blockchain and Cardano. If this proposal is to be successful as intended, it would be a huge asset to people in remote areas that are not as privileged as in other countries. If the team manages to start collaborating with some universities, it will also be a real game-changer to the Cardano ecosystem. It will have the potential to bring in hundreds of thousands of users. I would say that the idea of \u200b\u200bavailability and collaboration of the project is one of the strongest features of this proposal, making it very desirable if it will be marketed correctly. After reading through the proposal so many times, Cardano is not just a stepping stone to make it work but a big part of the development. All in all, I strongly agree that the suggestion worked tackle this challenge\nMy slight concern with the proposal, however, is that there is no risk assessment and no contingency plan for what should happen if anything doesn't go to plan.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Lots of useful details are provided in the proposal, we are presented with the core philosophy, rationale, and ideas that form the structure of the project along with details on how the DAPP smart students will operate in different stages of development. The idea of \u200b\u200bconnecting European educational institutions and students and making it available to people outside of Europe is a big undertaking, the proposal should provide more details on how the group is meant to make it work. The proposal includes a budget breakdown and reason for the large amount being requested ($80,000). To further provide clarity with budgets and recommendations in general, I would like to see more details provided in the budget. For example, how many hours per week will go to the design of the platform and how many people are included on the design team? How many developers will be working on their mobile app development, and what is their salary? How many people in total are included in the budget?\nRegarding the team working on the project, there is a bit of uncertainty here. The proposal is only briefly described as \"IT Akademia JSC; Atanas Kostov - CEO; Developer - 5 people\" to increase the possibility and transparency of the proposal, a short presentation with provided links of the core team and their expertise and competencies related to the development of the project is essential. Several LinkedIn profiles for each core member, maybe partnerships with universities, or even multiple documents to show some proof of previous work.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a roadmap with estimated timeframes provided, spanning up to 9 months. I'd like to see the team create a thorough development roadmap and add milestones to provide deeper detail, establishing technical development milestones for the product. This is extended further with a very comprehensive list of key performance indicators (KPIs), although they are very ambitious. 1000 registered students and 50 educational institutes on board within a year are certainly possible if marketing is done well.\nThe successful outcome of the proposal is to introduce an educational blockchain system into schools, colleges, and universities that will make all student educational data integrated into the blockchain ledger.\nThis proposal was presented in fund 7 but was not funded. Since this is a project I think it pays off for the challenge, I hope that this proposal will be funded. However, if this fund still hasn't received funding I hope the team will continue with fund 9 with a full proposal with more details about the team as well as the budget that needs to be broken down. In addition, potential challenges that may be encountered while developing this project should be included.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5246, "q0": "There are some issues that I have in my first impressions of the project. First, this proposal is almost identical to the previous proposal that was denied funding. To me, that doesn't show a lot of ambition to come back with greater thought and improvement. Second, I'm not convinced or impressed with the level of innovation this project brings to the table. From my perspective, this is a remote education platform that also takes place on the blockchain. Which I do think is kinda cool but I don't think it's competitive or innovative enough, which is supposed to be the point of Catalyst's mission to \"generate the highest levels of community innovation. It's also a rather high price tag for something that does not live up to that mission. However, I do think there is potential that is just not revealed in this or the previous proposal. I think the positive impact could be more clearly seen if there was a greater attempt to separate itself from traditional universities. Saving costs is cool, but how much exactly? Showing a direct side-by-side comparison could make a big difference. Is the education higher quality? Who are the instructors and why are they better? What makes these e-learning resources better than other options offered by universities? I do not see enough separation from any online learning course and I'm not convinced that it's worth an $80k investment. I think the target audience is also very narrow to a specific region. I'd need to see some market research on how many people this service could be serving. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal could benefit from converting the roadmap from a paragraph description to a detailed month-by-month roadmap of bullet points on what will be done. This is not a major issue because I think there's a decent amount of information here, it's just not super clean. The real issue comes in when I don't get any real information on the development team. Especially for this asking price, I need to see LinkedIn profiles and detailed descriptions of the names and experiences of each member. Due to this lack of information, I have no way to determine if I think this team is capable of producing this product as stated in the roadmap. I think the budget is VERY close but not quite specific enough. I think the format is spot on, and I appreciate the information that $80k has already been spent on the project. What's missing is specificity. I want to know how much money is being allocated to each category and what the breakdown is of how the money is being spent in each category. Why does it cost $80k? Is this money being spent efficiently? I have no way to tell. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This section doesn't need to be changed too much but there's always room for improvement. I hate it when proposals give only success metrics about a completed product. I'm not looking to fund a completed product, I want the product to make a positive impact on the world with a new innovation. SO, I appreciate the tangible numbers on user goals, institution implementation (which would be ideal if some were lined up to utilize this service - otherwise there's no impact). The network stability and hardware performance is also a huge factor that a lot of proposals leave out. This is a good section.

It seems like a great idea, as it is widely known that computer science students can not migrate in order to get proper education and to advance in the labor market. The description of how the proposal is going to address the challenge is pretty straight forward, mentioning all the potential users that will be a member of those educational services. Because of these two very important points, i think that this idea would add up very positively to the Cardano ecosystem as it is one of our priorities, as a whole, to connect the unconnected and give equal chances to all people across the globe. That is clearly articulated by the proposal itself. This proposal is surely able to scale to address future challenges, constructing new projects outside of the computer science field, or maybe by offering more knowledge and certification to the already enrolled students. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides a detailed roadmap, a timetable that seems rather reasonable, and the key milestones of the project development, giving a whole roadmap for each semester as well as a clear enough budget breakdown. Even though the budget seems quite big, it is understandable that it is about a whole new Dapp project that will be costless for all the future enrolled students. Something that the proposer need to pay attention at, is that they need to point out what skills and experience the project will need and provide some more details when it comes to the team members, except from the name. For example, what kind of developers would they need? Where each one of them is going to become useful? What are the technical aspects that are going to be considered? What language will be applied and why? Also, a couple of links should be added at this point. Despite these minor deficiencies, the necessary resources for the project to be considered implementable are given. Last but not least, the risks that may araise from this project should be tackled at some point. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does indeed provide a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. The KPIs that will measure the progress as well as define the success have been clearly identified and make perfect sense.  Very interesting that the proposer did quantify the KPIs, making it more easy for everyone to understand what the goal of the project is. At this point, i believe that it would be useful to provide a link, for those who are interested, to keep up with the whole idea and maybe give some thoughts for further improvements.
