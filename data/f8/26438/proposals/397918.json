This detailed breakdown will help both the proposer team and the community easily follow and detect any delay that might happen. \nThe budget has been effectively broken down and well-aligned with its delivery plan.

The implication is that Cardano cannot be successful without the support of One Small Town initiative. I believe this proposal would benefit the One Small Town community more so than the Cardano Community. With only 12000 Facebook likes on the proposers organizations page, it's not clear that this organization has a global reach or significantly large community of supporters. The challenge question is \"What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2022?\" and It is unclear how providing $100,000 (for this proposal, of a total $392 000 needed) will provide the most value to cardano users. The proposal includes; \"Phase 2 is to establish the Global Office as a profit centre.\" so it appears this funding will be used to allow the proposing team to create a for profit office to market their non-profit vision. It is claimed in the proposal:  \"As we fully intent to be present again fund 9 and 10 of Catalyst, we can always ask again for more fund later this year. For this proposal, we aiming at 100 000$ to allow us to launch few stake pools, get ready for the ICO of our token, start the development of the tools\u2026\" so it is difficult to see how this money leaving the cardano ecosystem will come back into the cardano ecosystem and create value for ada holders, as the funds appear to be a source of profit for the One Small Town team. The KPI's are unclear, and do not clearly align with the catalyst challenge question. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "One of the promises of the One Small Town initiative, as described in one of the 5 proposals they submitted for fund 7 is \"OST's regenerative economic system's competitive advantage is secured by our NRT : free green energy, clean water production and technology that removes toxic waste of legacy extraction operations.\" I have reviewed their proposal to potential town mayors here: https://www.onesmalltown.org/_files/ugd/81a8a7_4bb8ad4f5989460cba5af436dd225562.pdf\nINSTALLATION OF OUR OWN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY (where possible)\nOne of the cornerstones of our plan.\nUBUNTU Planet has a unique agreements with a group of scientists,\nmanufacturers, and technology partners with highly advanced technology to\ngenerate clean, environmentally friendly, non-toxic and non-polluting electricity \u2013 NOT SOLAR ENERGY.\nIn Addition: This technology will process all sewage, converting it to clean structured and energised water, and clean non-toxic compost that can be use in our agriculture or sold on the open market.\nFurthermore: Our energy technology has the capacity to clean-up rivers, dams and any other polluted areas and convert seawater to clean drinking water. This is particularly important for coastal towns and communities.\nToxic Waste: Our energy technology can also be used to discard and neutralise toxic waste and other hazardous materials from mines and hospitals. This presents a very lucrative income opportunity for the community and potential\ninvestors.\"\n\n\n\n\nAs a CA with a background in sustainable energy, I find this claim extremely suspicious, and highly doubt that this \"free energy\" technology even exists. There is no information about it on their website, and no proof of it successfully operating. It is just a promise and a vision.  \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal does not include a clear timeline or auditable KPI's that can be evaluated by the community. \nThere is no clear link between the proposers goals and the Catalyst challenge question that can be measured and audited. \nThe proposer has submitted several proposals previously such as this one: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384293 that are built around an idea of free energy. \nI believe this One Small Town project is an elaborate scam that is selling a dream built around free energy technology that does not exist. Yes this may be considered a biased review, but after looking into this project I feel the Cardano community needs to be careful not to let these actors extract too much ada out of our ecosystem. We should not be funding OST stakepools that will create a constant selling pressure to fund their marketing campaigns. https://www.reddit.com/r/badarchaeology/comments/3gx8yy/hack_reviews_michael_tellinger/", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_215", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "To partner with One Small Town is to open Cardano's network to many communities, from more than 140 countries across all continents.", "experience": "Currently in One Small Town Global Office, there are nineteen Ambassadors and approximately twenty professionals contributing their expertise.\n\nList of Ambassadors https://www.onesmalltown.org/contact\n\nThe blockchain initiative team is detailed in the supporting document."}
