Spam and other forms of unsolicited advertising are a drain on both digital resources and human attention spans. Profila won't put a stop to advertising, but it does create a model in which the customer is more than just a helpless target.\n\nThis might be a good use case for SSI, and I'd encourage the proposer to keep a close eye on projects within that category. This could reduce the amount of personal information the dApp has to handle itself. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer's team appears to have the right composition and experience to deliver on the timeline as presented. I notice the proposal mentions the integration of native Cardano wallets as the last deliverable. I ended up having to scroll back up and search for a discussion of the tokenomics of the dApp. Since the Impact statement is so dense, it might be worth drawing more attention and providing more detail on how this aspect of the project will add value to the user's experience. \n\nI'm also curious if the proposer has been in contact with any brands they could partner up with as a test run? This could be important as it needs buy-in from both consumers and brands.\n\nFinally, there are a few issues in the budget portion. 1. The app developer cost is given in hours, when I'm fairly sure the intent days, since that's how all the other items are denominated. 2. Each item is given in USD cost, but the tally is in EUROs, which are then converted into USD. 3. Assuming the line item costs are in EUROs and not USD, the amount adds up to $43,300, unless I'm missing something.
