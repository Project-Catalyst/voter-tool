The author claims that people involved in charitable or environmental causes generally do not have much involvement with the NFT market, or when this public buys various NFTs, there is no way to know exactly what the principles of the artists who produced them are. The idea here is to unite these worlds: from active tokens to people active in charitable movements, as I understand it. I found it very interesting how the author bets on the diversity of content that would be addressed in this market he intends to create: \u201ccreators from a wide range of aesthetic areas can create content. These include art, music, poetry, spoken word, dance and many other areas.\u201d The author also separates the future market into blocks, which would group each of these categories. I believe this would be a very inviting gateway for artists and creatives, and let's be honest with you that as much as our community aims to be democratic and multifaceted, there's still more room here for tech people. In this way, I believe that this proposal can add a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem, diversifying its audience, increasing the number of users on our blockchain (which would achieve the objectives of this challenge and also of the other challenge specifically focused on this), it would increase the number of NFTs minted in Cardanos and etc, that is, would benefit our ecosystem in many ways and achieve the general and specific objectives of the challenge. I would like to make an observation: the author claims that this NFT market would also give space to rural artists and artisans, that is, people who are not familiar with the Cardano ecosystem. How would this contact be established, how would this audience know and understand the technologies relevant to our blockchain? Apart from that doubt, I think the project has a lot of potential and could have a high impact for Cardano. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general, the author of the proposal provides us with the basic information to be evaluated in this regard: roadmap, team and budget. However, other information is also included, such as more explanations about the application, how security would be, how it would be used for each type of user and etc. well because they were included in that part of the proposal. Perhaps it would be more interesting to put them into impact, because through them we learn more about the project and how it can impact the Cardano ecosystem. Apart from that observation, let's evaluate each of the three parts of feasibility. Script: I found it superficial. We know what will happen in months 1, 2 and 3, but the information given is not as in-depth, there is not as much detail. For example, it would be positive for each of these phases to be explained more extensively and completely, for the smaller activities necessary for each of the phases to be accomplished to be situated in time - for example, week 1: tasks x, y and z. Next, the author talks about the functional, security and performance requirements. I would like to understand in which months each of these requirements would be developed, for example, the information is a little loose. Plus point for the team when it comes to focusing on marketing. This is an essential part of the success of any and all Catalyst projects, but even more so for those looking to attract a new kind of audience, different from the \u201cbubble\u201d we are used to dealing with. It is very positive that this marketing plan is so well detailed in the proposal. It would be interesting to know how the partnerships would be made - in which phase, for example (I believe it would be in the third, in parallel with the marketing plan, but it would be important to be sure). About the budget: as with the team presentation, I think there could be more details. For example: 3 month Administration and Client Service 5000 USD. Why would that part cost that much? It would be positive if there was a deeper explanation, so that lay people, CAs and voters who are not so familiar with the activity of creating and deploying the marketplace in NFT would understand the need for this cost. And finally, the team is presented in a satisfactory way. We know who they are, what their functions are and a certain history that each of them has, along with links that can prove the information said, except for the case of D M Saman Chandana. It is important that these links exist, they make us have more confidence in the information passed. In short: everything you need is here, but lacking in detail. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The data presented in this part of the proposal are quantitative, that is: number of customers on the platform, number of NFTs per charitable cause, number of NFTs per month, etc. This is good for us to measure success, and although the author of the proposal also includes some information about what the scenario of this success would be, I didn't think it was enough to solidly visualize this scenario. I would like a more detailed construction of what success would look like, in addition to numbers and the fact that the NFT market was successfully created by diversifying the categories of active tokens. When reading the possible challenges, I think they can be summed up in two parts: the pandemic getting worse (again) making the work of artisans difficult, and the variation in the price of Ada + slowness in converting it to local currency. I agree with the part of the pandemic, yes, if it gets worse, it will make it difficult for almost all our projects to progress, but as the author himself says, a way out is so a good number of artists and people involved, in case if some have problems like this bias the work does not \u201cstand still\u201d, roughly speaking. But in terms of Ada's volatility, it's basically the way the cryptographic world works, so I believe it's a characteristic that permeates all projects and can't be considered a particular problem here, you know? The issue of converting Ada to local currency does not seem to me at all a problem, this process is not slow, it is done through brokers (such as Binance, cited by the author) in a matter of minutes. So I didn't really understand why this was considered a problem. About monitoring the development of the project, this cannot be done so effectively since the phases were not so detailed. In summary, I think that auditability is present here, but it could be better explored, so that the Cardano community would have an easier time following the progress of the project, especially with regard to the process, in relation to what we know for track the results. Regarding the definition of success, I think this part is very detailed, it is possible for us to understand well the ideal scenario after the proposal is financed. That is, I found the feasibility good, needing just a few more things to improve. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 7, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8563, "q0": "My first suggestion to the proposers would be that they should reevaluate their stance and view of the achievements in the space that have come before them.\n\nThis CA has been involved in the Cardano NFT space since it was only a plan, and from that context I have identified elements that make this proposal very problematic in it\u2019s current form.\n\nStatements such as: \u201cCurrent NFT collections are of low standard, and have no social or charitable value\u201d are not only overly generic, misinformed and false but also paint a picture of the person/persons behind the proposal as being extremely judgemental, close-minded and unwilling to learn and cooperate in the current environment. For example if the author of the proposal is actually interested in social and environmental causes he should be aware that there have been great progress and efforts in that area made by a very large number of different people and entities involved in the Cardano NFT space. But of course as always, it\u2019s much easier to be judgemental and through empty criticism than to actually make the effort to inform yourself.\n\nThis is even more problematic since the proposers claim to care deeply about altruistic issues, such as those with social and environmental impacts . Shouldn\u2019t being empathetic and non-judgemental be at the core of wanting to solve social or environmental issue?\n\nFor reference I would like to add another very problematic phrase from the proposal that seem to suggest that no art has yet been released as NFTs:  \u201cAlso NFTs are primarily based on artwork, and a whole wide world of creativity is available which have not yet been brought into NFT space or marketplaces.\u201d (presumably only the authors of the proposal have the capability to distinguish and classify something as being art) This is the exact same kind of level of intolerance and misinformation displayed by the people who spend their time shouting from the rooftops that \u201call NFTs are a scam\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion I view the impact of this project if funded as extremely low, perhaps even negative to the NFT space overall. The chances that a marketplace created by a team with such views and a demonstrated opposition to the NFT landscape, which clearly lacks the desire to understand & learn from the space would be a positive addition are almost nonexistent.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The code and design for the marketplace may be verifiably produced, but ultimately I see very little chance of this resulting in an actually used marketplace as described in the proposal, due to the clear lack of knowledge of the space, judgemental attitude, and unwillingness to learn and cooperate of the team that would be responsible for implementing the project.\n\nAs described in the relevant experience field, the author has experience and is  \u201cinvolved in social service projects\u201d. Also as presented in the team overview section, the experience and expertise of most of the team seem to be in a completely non-technical or artistic field, which I see as indispensable requirements for creating a successful NFT marketplace. As such funding, I assess that funding this proposal is a very high-risk proposition for the Cardano treasury.\n\nFurthermore, the proposal is filled with a very high-level view of things, but no actual clear implementation plan is presented.\n\nIn addition, the budget requested for the proposal is extremely low and is very unlikely to be sufficient for the successful implementation of the project. For reference, the current going rate for a Haskell and Plutus smart contract developer in the Philippines, an otherwise very competitive workforce marketplace, is $50/hour. This further exemplifies the lack of knowledge and expertise of the proposer about the topic.\n\nA small chance does exist, and I hope, that the authors of the proposal overcome their prejudices and will become willing to work with and understand the current NFT landscape, both technically and culturally. \n\nAs a side note, I would like to mention that the feasibility section of the proposal contains a large part of what seems to be copy/pasted text from an article, post, or book on \u201cblockchain self-help\u201d and seems to have very little to do with the proposal itself.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The budget is not sufficiently broken down, and only a gross figure is given for the overall implementation needs. I would have liked to see a more detailed approach per role and hourly rate.\n\nThe KPIs and metrics that are given are very generic and would make detailed auditing of the progress a far more difficult task than it needs to be.\n\nFor some reason, the author of the proposal has felt the need to copy/paste the risks section in the audibility section of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_681", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3783, "q0": "Generally speaking, your answer to every request contains much necessary information for readers to absorb. You manage to point out the target audience in the NFT marketplace, involving collectives of rural artists, craftspeople, and rural communities. At the same time, you were able to pinpoint the advantages that participants can obtain, including stakeholders, Stake Pool Operator and blockchain community, and providing highly satisfying employment for the artists, which is one of the best app\u2019s outputs - a vital key metric required in this challenge.One more positive thing is that all the hurdles that you predicted connected with your future solutions are very detailed and expected to have a good effect.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From what I read in this section, the roadmap that the proposer has given is acceptable but its timeframe is insufficient. According to the timeline, your team is set to work in three months, which is quite a short period, so I suggest you write more information of the timeline in depth, such as what you will do in the first week of the progress, the second week, and even if you could let investors know what you would do in the last days of the project, it would be much better. Undeniably, I appreciate your plans relevant to marketing, social media, software quality, etc. Other than that, there\u2019s one small problem that I think you should fix here, the layout of the budget breakdown. The layout in this section is quite easy to mistake because there\u2019s two total costs, and the main total fund was mentioned before the development expenditure, and this confused me a little bit. Thus, I recommend you move the total of total cost in the bottom of this section. When it comes to your team members, from my viewpoint, the profile of DImitri Fernando would not contain some unessential backgrounds like \u201che learnt how bringing joy to kids and the less fortunate would bring unspeakable joy to life, he learnt to be cool under immense pressure and not let any crisis affect him\u201d and many more. You know, the fundraisers just care about the notable accomplishments, experiences and skills that those members have gained in the relevant field. Therefore, you should filter out the most relevant and valuable information in his and other\u2019s profiles, if possible.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Very concise!
