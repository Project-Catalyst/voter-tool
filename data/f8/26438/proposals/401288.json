The proposer wants to solve both these issue with a single proposal. The idea is really interesting and targets a unique class of people, the artists and the investors. The proposer wants to create a platform for artists where musicians can meet new people, find instruments, receive scholarships and learn about Cardano. The proposal is trying to do various things instead of just being a music platform this will set is apart from the regular music platform. The proposal do identify the issue and tries to resolve it. This platform may help people to learn about cardano and will help onboard new members into the ADA ecosystem thus adding value to the cardano. the goals do align with the challenge and this music platform can be scaled to meet future challenges therefore the proposal effectively addressed the issue", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very diversified and the mix seems to have the necessary experience and skills to make this proposal a reality.  The proposer has taken in account of all possible risks and challenges that may influence the execution of the proposal and have given a clear understand explanation of possible ways to overcome it. They have considered all the necessary resources that may be needed to carry out the proposal. The clear timeline given each with a milestones to reach seems reasonable to complete the work. it's a good thing that they have provided a clear budget breakdown. I personally felt the funds requested seems a bit expensive other than that everything looks great. By looking at the proposal it can be said that the proposer has done a thorough research and have covered all the aspects which will be needed to make the proposal a reality. By considering all of the above it is safe to say it is very likely the proposal will be executed successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a clear mentioning of the Key performance metric auditors can use to audit and track the development of the proposal. The action plan also has milestones in weeks which simplifies the tracking progress and also helps to know if the proposal is going as per the scheduled or if it is getting delayed. The proposer has provided ample amount of metrics to define the success of the proposal and these metrics have targets to reach in 3 month, 6 month and 12 month period. This will be come in handy to measure the success of the proposal. The given proposal gives a detailed description of the problem and the proposer has also provided complete explanation of solution to address the problem.

The proponent claims that the music industry is one of the strongest today, both in terms of profit and the people involved in it. The idea would then be to bring this target audience that is not necessarily associated with blockchain to our community. This would be done in a number of ways, for example: 1) users would know who owns certain musical instruments in their neighborhood, so they could rent them 2) finding music teachers, teams to form a band, venues for rehearsals and etc. 3) providing scholarships in the field of music 4) among others. The proponent explains that he intends to introduce the technologies of the cryptographic world little by little, through tutorials and also discounts on transactions that are made by the Cardano blockchain. So, from what I understand, the financial transactions (for example, the payment of the rent of some instrument) would be done through smart contracts as the application developed. What worries me is that these transactions would not be done initially on the blockchain, people would have the option to carry out them in a conventional way, and using their fiat currencies. How far can we count on the curiosity of the target audience to choose the cryptographic alternative? The proponent explains in great detail what the phases of development of the project would be (I will comment further on this in the topic below), so we were able to visualize very well which parts would make up the whole, how they would be created and what would be necessary for each of them to be completed successfully. We also know important information such as Dapp's target audience and competition. In the revenue model part, he explains how all the profit that would be generated from the various activities would be managed and what fees would be charged, giving us even more knowledge about Dapp as a whole and all the layers that make it up. Although I find the idea very interesting and I think it could become a very popular Dapp, even with so many explanations it is not clear to what extent Cardano ecosystem technologies will be used. Really, the only part that mentions this directly is in relation to payments, which can be done through smart contracts, but even so, I think we could include other Cardano features, such as Atala Prism DIDs, so that the impact of this project would be more significant for our blockchain. In the section \u201cwe are very open to linking and connecting our platform with other projects in the community to help each other develop\u201d, it gives us even more room to think that in reality this project is not so intertwined with Cardano's solutions; And yes, it has the potential to be. So, unfortunately, I wasn't very sure about the impact that this Dapp will have on our blockchain and I'm not so sure that the goals aimed here are perfectly aligned with those defined for this challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script is very good in the first parts, because we are told which activities will be done and in which weeks. The temporal division is very exact, I usually say that at least we would need to know what would happen each month, but in the case of a division into weeks, our understanding is even better. So I really think this part was going really well until the \u201cNext Months: More In-Depth Business Analysis and Adding Features Based on User Feedback\u201d snippet. I think it would be important for the bidder to have thought through the plan from the time of funding to its final delivery, rather than detailing the first few weeks and leaving the next few months so vaguely explained. How many months would it be? How would this analysis of the business be done, and in what way would it be more in-depth than previous actions? How would user feedback be captured, and how would changes be implemented from there? Therefore, my suggestion is that the proponent could keep the level of detail more homogeneous throughout the entire length of the script. 41 thousand dollars are requested for the development of this project; Regarding the financial explanations, I think everything is very well detailed. For example, we know who would do what, for how long and what the hourly rate for that professional would be, as can be seen in the excerpt \u201c1 Technical Project Manager: $45/hour ($1,500/week x 4 weeks = $6,000)\u201d. This part in my opinion is quite adequate and does not need improvement. Finally, talking about the team of professionals involved in the project, this part is good, but a very important detail concerns me. We know the names, the professional roles, previous experiences and the roles that each professional would play in the project. However, only the bidder attaches his linkedin profile, so we have ways of verifying what is being said to the other team members. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to me that any of the professionals are experts in the Cardano blockchain, I don't feel that they are familiar with the technologies of our ecosystem, even in the case of a developer: Ranger Guan has \u201cMore than 9 years of experience in software development. Specialist in front-end and multiple languages \u200b\u200b(PHP, javascript, TypeScript, Python\u2026)\u201d. We see here that he is unfamiliar with Plutus, for example. Anyway, I think that if someone is really involved with the solutions that Cardano has, it is a little difficult to trust that, for example, smart contracts will be developed properly, that other Cardano technologies can be attached as the project evolves, etc. . So my take on feasibility is that it's good, but some things could be improved; such as the full detailing of the script and further clarification on who would guide the guiding questions regarding Cardano. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent states that updates on the project's advances will be made through various platforms such as twitter, github, telegram and instagram. He says that successes and struggles will be shared, that is, with this I conclude that he will update the community both on the tasks and on the goals that will be achieved. However, I found that in terms of tasks, it's a little vague about how these updates will be done. We know exactly what would happen in the first few weeks, and during the impact the proponent also provided us with a more general explanation of what would be done in each phase, so that we get a sense of the deliverable results. My suggestion is that the entire script is better detailed, as I have already mentioned in the topic above, so that we have a better basis for monitoring, that is, we know better what to base ourselves on when exercising this auditability. Regarding partial achievements, this part is clearer, as the proponent exemplifies some of them (\u201cincrease in registered users, funds raised for scholarships, paid scholarships and student tracking, or influencer ads will be published on these social media\u201d ). Another issue that could be better clarified is the regularity with which these updates would be posted. Monthly, weekly, quarterly? I think that the more often the better, but it would be necessary for the proponent to clarify this question for us. Finally, talking about the success scenario, the proponent describes what is expected to be achieved in 3, 6 and 12 months. We have a lot of information about what the absolute success of the project would then be like. However, what is lacking here are practical ways of verifying such information. How to make them measurable, easily verifiable? It would be important for the proponent to clarify such issues. I also think that the auditability leaves something to be desired since we don't know how to measure the consequences directly for Cardano. How has this Dapp contributed to the expansion of our ecosystem? Will people who choose to transact in ada become active members? The proponent mentions that he has another proposal, which would be an NFT marketplace, I would like this to be explained more, in which case I would better understand how the project would relate to Cardano and have more confidence about the impact, for example. Anyway, the auditability is good, but it could have been clarified 1) how often updates on the process would be made 2) how the consequences for Cardano would be measured 3) how the final results would be exposed to our community. \n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_57", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 509, "q0": "What is being proposed here is a website/platform akin to AirBNB or Craigslist, but for musicians. It doesn't seem that it will be a DApp at all (no indication that it is build on or particularly using the Cardano network at all) and the only way that's it's really \"integrated\" is that they plan to accept ADA as a payment option, with a favorable rate to encourage people to do so. It speaks loosely to the the Challenge area of bringing in more users, but I'm not seeing a deep connection to, or impact on, the gist of this campaign.  I think a better appeal to project catalyst would be if you already had a successful music app thingie, and were able to say, \"With $XYZ funding we can integrate with Cardano as a payment option and bring all this great exposure to our engaged user base! Instead, you are asking us to fund your project that really has nothing to do with Cardano. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In the budget and timeline, I am seeing a two month timeframe to plan, build, and deploy what sounds like a complex, ambitious software project, inclusive of ...everything, I guess. But with no mention of marketing, user on-boarding, tech support, customer support, maybe some kind of target market or plan for some initial group of users. And the project manager is only getting paid for 4 weeks. Among the CVs of the team, there is no mention of the word \"Blockchain\" - honestly the blockchain connection seems like an afterthought to this whole scheme. \nIf you were to put together a successful music app, I'd be very supportive of the feasibility of adding a Cardano payment option! I think you need to look for some seed money from other types of investors for some amount of v1 building, a wireframe, a mockup, a portion of the service that could get set up to get the dream off the ground! At this point it's difficult to have high confidence in the feasibility of the whole huge dream, on a shoestring budget and 8 week timeline.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I checked the Twitter account, Github, and Instagram handles posted. There was no content on any of them, so I'm not sure why these are shared. I didn't go to the trouble of checking telegram as well. I guess it is as they said they *Will* use these platforms if they get funded.  Beyond this, the notion of auditability here seems to be \"when we do stuff, we'll tell you about it!\" Which ok - if they don't build the app at all I guess we'd be able to tell, so I'll grant two stars.

I would love to see the proposal tie in specifically the bulleted list under \"Potential directions\" of the challenge. Would have love to see the solution be tied more deeply to cardano, for example, storing attainment records using atala prism... essentially more Cardano integration beyond payment.
