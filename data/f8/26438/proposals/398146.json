This proposal may be related, but its challenge association cannot be assessed. Also, the proposal appears to be just an idea, or a \"call to action\" as mentioned, and not really a proposal. So even if the idea is good and can be successfully implemented, we cannot know how it will be implemented. The proponent should be more explicit about how the project will bring value to the Cardano ecosystem and how it is sustainable or how it can grow in the future, once funded and after the funding is used . In addition, the challenges and risks that may be encountered during project implementation are described very briefly, what are the risks in Dapp testing and what is your solution.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Since much information is missing, it is impossible to know if the project is viable. The proposal is only briefly explained, without much information so that the community can track the progress of the project. Without a plan and roadmap, it is impossible to match an investment background with the relevant experience required to implement the solution. There is no description of the group, what I know here is that the author will do the work alone, but relevant information about the author such as experience, name, qualifications or any links to Author profiles are not provided. This is also important for the budget of the proposal, although the proposal requires a very modest budget of only $1000, it should be broken down and explained better. Besides the information already mentioned, it would be good to discuss the technical aspect of implementing such a solution based on blockchain, and it would be good to include information about who will develop it. In addition, some challenges such as adoption, access to digital platforms and other related aspects can be discussed.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "As pointed out, the probability of evaluating the proposal is low, as it does not show a roadmap with a development plan, detailed explanation of each step, milestones and delivery of each part, timeline, and several ways for the community to measure the success of the proposal, such as metrics and KPIs. In this case, the KPI could be the number of users of your website. In addition, some deadlines and milestones need to be outlined, and some of the risks involved in implementing the plan should also be discussed. This is a brand new proposal so the proponent probably has no experience in presenting. Because your idea is good but the proposal writing is poor, I suggest you rewrite the proposal according to the Catalyst documentation with more content.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_654", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10200, "q0": "The proposal consists of a decentralized application so it fits the challenge.
