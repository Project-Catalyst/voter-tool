With the goal to bring more businesses the option of real world use case and utility from their onsite NFT sources, Cardano is a solid platform of technology and community for this to solve a major problem facing the ecosystem today. With integrating more businesses that may not understand the potential of blockchain technology or NFTs, this would be an excellent way to introduce them to what Cardano has to offer. The proposal's solution could potentially add a massive amount of new users and value to the ecosystem while maintaining a safe and secure way for businesses and personal creations alike to succeed in a uniformed fashion given a 'One Stop Shop' presented in a user friendly way in order to build quality NFTs that participants can benefit in real world applications. Many NFT marketplaces today do offer trading and royalties for certified projects who register via the blockchain through policy Identifications. This proposer is offering a streamlined experience through massive backend development to ensure a seamless minting process for businesses. Having a payment option that doesn't involve the blockchain initially is a great way for new users to feel more comfortable, using credit card applications to make and receive payments will be similar to Crypto.com and it's NFT marketplace, as well as enable ADA holders the option to buy and sell using their crypto assets. This alone could eventually bring more adoption to the Cardano ecosystem as well as introduce more users to the NFT space as a whole.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The timeline in which the proposer has presented could be a great indicator to what the team is capable of performing. After further review of the team's website linked here https://dev4side.com and LinkedIn reference pages, the talent within such a vast network is promising in order to achieve such a task proposed, much like Cardano itself. The milestones ahead are clearly sited and given weekly appropriate windows to perform all tasks involved. It is not my opinion on how much these milestones should cost, but given the amount of time spent on each one, a detailed breakdown of cost could help in assessing the amounts given to each (in regard to Milestones 2-5 where most of the funding will be allocated towards). This in particular in reference to what a reasonable budget should look like. Additional funding sited through the company's reserves will assist in achieving the 7 month proposal period. In the events that some of these milestones have any set backs, is there any considerable changes to the budget that could occur? It is stated that additional funds may be in need for future marketing, but the proposer states clearly that a quality product that is fully functional to be delivered to the customer is of the utmost importance. This in turn is critical within the ever changing ecosystem of Cardano as with the crypto markets, having something that works without fail is crucial in the community as well as building a solid platform for new users to feel safe while either tip toeing into NFTs or diving into without any cause for concern.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposer has fully understood the meaning of Auditability by offering full transparency throughout the project's progress. With use through public access to weekly updates of what's being built on the platform, as well as \"changelogs\" to verify the accomplished milestones are being met on time, it is promised by the proposer each advancement within the timeline will be viewable by PC with assistance from Azure DevOps and Agile Software Development methods. The biggest problems to resolve the solution will depend mostly on backend developments, and these targeted problems shall be well documented and described within the weekly reports so that continued success of the proposal is met on time. Having a fully functioning web application that allows the features proposed, would greatly increase the user base for Cardano, not only in NFT volume but for businesses who are willing to take a leap into new, perhaps often, unknown territory still waiting to be explored. In regards to functionality, based on other NFT sites who offer less options, it may be beneficial to note updates to the web application after fully operational will most definitely be needed if exponential traffic takes place. As available NFT marketplaces have experienced time and time again, the amount of volume from the Cardano community and other crypto based non-fungible token enthusiasts should not be underestimated.

One of the best ways to do this is to attract business customers, as they bring a user base.\n\nThis is exactly what the proposal is trying to solve.

Although the team has not yet programmed in Haskell, they have assigned one of the engineers to do so. It should be absolutely possible for a software company to learn the relevant skills in a short time frame.\n\nThe team details the costs and provides 160000 dollars themselves.

As pointed out in the proposal most companies don\u2019t want to be the so call ginny pig when it comes to implementing new technologies and to an extent because of the cost, uncertainty, and other unknown factors. I feel that is where projects like this help to bridge the gap by creating tools that can effectively address those adoption challenges. Anything that helps to make the transition smoother is good for the ecosystem because we want to quickly move away from an asset that is only used for gambling and one that has real-world utility. \nIt's my opinion that this sort of project is great for the Cardano community and ecosystem and should be supported.

Risk and challenges parts are also well strucutred with good risks mapped and a mitigation plan. the guided step-by-step user experience to instruct users will be much welcomed. It would be also imporant to add direct channels for companies to get in touch with NFT platform PR team and have their questions, doubts and insercurities clarified (as in a bank or other business, where clients get in touch with their account managers). This helps to build trust on the solution which seems to be key in this project.\n\nAnother extra suggestion to the proposal will be include here how they intend to advertise their product to target businesses (and where will they target: any economic sector? any country? maybe for a more effective communication, some target audicence could be limited at first).\nMoreover, a bit more information on business case could also be provided here. I mean, whey they intend to become self-sustainable (and generate profit) and how would the companies be charged by their service (business model)?
