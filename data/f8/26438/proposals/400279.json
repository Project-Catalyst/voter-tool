Artano wants to build an innovative product, which would allow digital artists and creators without the technical skills to create programmable NFTs, a futuristic and not very widespread standard, but with great potential. Empower digital artists to easily create programmable NFTs thanks to Artano means creating a bridge to bring them to Cardano, and with them all their supporters and collectors interested in their product. Artano's collaborations in the world of art and fashion are an example of the potential of this platform in increasing the adoption of Cardano, reflecting the challenge's goals. The funds required are in line with the size of the team and their expertise, which has been amply demonstrated.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully, as the team has already been able to build a quality NFTs marketplace and minting platform focused on digital art. Furthermore, Artano has shown that he has the technical skills to create programmable NFTs and shouldn't work with a whole new concept. The roadmap presented is detailed and realistic, it is also given space to any future additions, demonstrating how Artano is a dynamic and always evolving product. The issues they may have to face are not major obstacles and in the worst case the product would be developed with a slight delay.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The parameters indicated to evaluate the progress and success of their programmable NFTs minting service are detailed and enough to audit the developing phases, although Artano could consider some more parameter to evaluate the success of the programmable NFT minting service, like the number of iNFTs minted with their platform and also could be more accurate in the success criteria, attracting 100 new artist in a few months is different from attracting them in a few years.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_1187", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1654, "q0": "The need for artists to mint their own evolving, programmable NFTs without coding knowledge is the problem they recognize in the Dapps challenge.

They will launch the product after 2 months and keep adding features after the launch, which seems very considerate. They mention briefly in the budget breakdown what will be used for the frontend and backend development. They explained how they are making use of the metadata and oracles to make these NFTs programmable. They could have given more detail in how all the marketplaces, blockchain explorers or NFT viewers will be able to display these qualities.

There are many other KPIs you they could ad to this list to make it easier to track the performance of this tool. Like users trading iNFTs, the amount of iNFT trades. These could also be indicators upon release. The problem they describe is the many artists out there unable to mint because of lacking the skills to mint evolving NFTs.
