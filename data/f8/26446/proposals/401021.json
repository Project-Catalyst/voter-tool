Member countries adhere to them and have some leeway when putting them in practice through laws. In June 2021 the BCBS published a paper titled \u201cPrudential Treatment for Crypto Asset Exposures\u201d \u2013 on how regulators in the member jurisdictions should handle crypto assets from a capital and risk governance standpoint. The proposed treatment is very detrimental to blockchain adoption in general by traditional banks.\n\nThe proposal aims to prepare a response for BCBS and argue for a more balanced approach for blockchain treatment. As is the case with almost every other proposal in this challenge, the direct added value for Cardano from such an undertaking is very difficult to measure or even imagine. However, the added second-order value of multiple such collective actions that put pressure on regulators to propose a more nuanced / flexible treatment of blockchain products (and their impact in the banking capital requirements in this particular case) is definitely worth-while and such actions should be indeed funded and supported by the broad blockchain community. \n\nIt is difficult for me to imagine that we really have a problem at this point in time with blockchain treatment for banking capital requirements and I feel that such problems will definitely be very important when the adoption of blockchain technologies will be orders of magnitude higher than where it is today. In the current environment and given the state of adoption is still low, I tend to believe that lobby resources are better used in other niches of the legislative process and that it will not be easy for the Cardano community to derive significant added value from this project\u2019s deliverables.

The budget does not seem to tie up, since the requested funds are 47.5k USD, while the budget is broken down for a total of 32.5k USD, therefore a slight inconsistency is present in the proposal. The money would go towards legal drafting efforts and undertaking interviews. The budget would also benefit from offering details regarding forecasted hours spent on each task at hand and also an indication of hourly rates charged, none of which are currently present in the proposal.\n\nAs far as planning is concerned, the project would start in May 2022 and take three months to complete. There would be an intermediate mid-2022 milestone, but i was not able to identify concrete items that can be assessed at that stage, since both items are \u201creview\u201d ones with limited potential to be shared to and understood by the Community.

However, the proposal is too expensive with no assurance of success. I don't necessarily have doubts that they can produce the research and documentation that they want to, albeit at a very high price point. I think what's missing is some element of analysis that shows the BCBS would be receptive to the work put into this project. Does the team have established relationships with the BCBS? Has the BCBS shown objective signs of being receptive towards receiving this kind of information? Are they expecting it in a favorable manner?

Some indication of the relationship between these activities and Cardano.

An indication of where the team members stand on the particular issues which may impact on Cardano. \n\nAs far as the linked in profiles reveal, one \"team member\" is a banking professional. None of the others are. There is no indication of the team members experience, attitudes towards, ideas about Cardano, or any other cryptocurrencies. It would have been very helpful if any articles which the team had written were linked. Or some paper, explaining the issues and thoughts driving their personal/professional attitudes towards the issues that are expected to be covered in the BCBS paper they will be reviewing. Also there should be some indication of the connection of the 10-15 persons (interviews with related financial industry subject matter experts (such as specialists on payments, cross-border transactions, banking IT professionals, risk managers, etc) who will be interviewed. And even rough outline of the interview protocols and questions.\n\nFinally a company website is linked. But the site is not active.

If they are all planning to form the company that is referenced, that would be great to have been explained. especially since one of the team has a legal background. That team members should understand the importance of formalising working relationships.\n\nI can take a neutral stance on the feasibility of the team executing its plan and producing the deliverables without more clear definition of the details (interview protocol, relationship between the interviewees and Cardano or cryptocurrencies in general) and the teams position on the subject matter.

The proposers aim to have a dual impact with this well thought-out proposal. Their primary impact would be international in scope, aiming to change the proposed regulations. They explain: \u201cBasel guides the banking regulations that directly affects the laws in more than 28 jurisdictions around the world. Individual governments can add additional legislation beyond this, but making positive changes to the initial regulations make the base regulations around crypto assets less prohibitive on a global basis.\u201d Their secondary impact is to influence local regulation in South Africa.

Conversely, if the team goes rogue and recommends something completely off the wall, it can have an adverse effect on Cardano's reputation. This, however, is very unlikely because the team looks very professional.

The proposal has been developed very well and the issues have been made understandable for \u201cthe lay readers\u201d. It is a bit of a question mark how much time the team actually has to react when the new updated version of the BCBS paper comes out in mid-2022. As such, the timing is of utmost importance here: it\u2019s now or never. This cannot wait until Fund9 or beyond. Having said that, the team aims to build a long-term working relationship with Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) and we can expect to hear more from them in the near future.

Auditing of progress in such a proposal might not be so easy, because the work consists mostly of interviews and writing of recommendations, but the team is committed to share a summaries of identified issues, transcripts of interviews and a review document in the end.

The proposers wish to follow up on the BCBS' paper \u201cPrudential Treatment for Crypto Asset Exposures\u201d that was opened for comments, feedback was received and an an updated paper will be issued in mid-2022. Essentially, the team wants to provide feedback to this new revised document. Excellent in terms of partial alignment with the challenge. However, impact I need to address separately. One thing that seems to be missing from this proposal - but is specified in the challenge is that the challenge aims to fund \"specialists in regulation, lawyers, and politicians\" who can promote the creation of an environment of laws that are more favorable or less harmful to the crypto space, with a focus on PoS and on Cardano's particularities. This proposal unfortunately does not specify what is the team's specific position and knowledge about Proof of Stake and Cardano. Providing feedback to the BCBS regarding the updated paper will be important - however the proposing team has not set out its philosophical positions and key focus areas in terms of supporting blockchain technologies, Proof of Stake and Cardano in order for voters to be able to judge whether the feedback to this new revised document will be beneficial, neutral or possibly detrimental to Cardano specifically. Hence, the idea is excellent, but if this proposal is not adopted by voters in this round I would advise the team to clearly provide information about their understanding of the differences of treatment that they advocate (if any) for Proof of Stake and Proof of Work, the specifics that they envisage are important for Cardano specifically due to its decentralized nature and other issues that they intend to pursue in order to advance the interst of the Cardano community. Namely, the crux of the matter is to ensure that we do not know what general types of \"improvements\" this proposing group favours - even on a conceptual level. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team,which claims to consist of members experienced in banking regulations and who intend to provide feedback to Basel, have provided links to their Linkedin profiles and they seem to have adequate knowledge for their roles - Legal, Comms, and PR Specialist, Director of Business Development and Banking and Regulatory Specialist. . However, I do not see an expert on web 3.0, distributed ledger technology, blockchain systems, proof of stake/proof of work and specifically Cardano. The timetable looks realistic and feasible. I think that the team could have provided a more detailed breakdown of some larger components of the budget - specifically the a. \"Initial Basel proposal and commentary review\" that costs $10,000, the b. review of updated commentary: $10,000 and the c. Preparation of new commentary and publish to community for template:$10,000. Some hourly rates and expected volume of work in hours and days would be beneficial. The other items seem less in need of further breakdown as they are smaller in value. The team could have improved the Feasibility segment by providing examples/samples of previous reports they have completed or reports from other teams on similar subject matters that they find valuable. Namely, we do not know whether the output of this project will be short and brief two-page reports or extensive in-depth 100-page documents. If the project is not financed now, it would be good to resubmit with an example of what kind of result the community can expect - sample/model that they are going for. The team's proposal and plan seems good and feasible - however assessing the feasibility section also requires an important aspect [The proposer has considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation]. There is seemingly a big hole looking from the aspect of the Catalyst and Cardano community specifically and the cryptocurrency world in general. Namely, the team proposes (great idea!) to review all previous published comments relating to the first issuance and prepare the framework for a new response. However, the next step to analyze the updated paper when released in mid-2022 will be done and feedback prepared based on document review and interviews with related financial industry subject matter experts ... then submitted to Basel for review. Where is the consultation with the beneficiary stakeholders? The team does not include consultations with the Cardano Foundation, with IOG and Emurgo specifically and the Catalyst community at large. Why do I mention this in feasibility - because I think that the proposer has not considered an important risk to this proposal. The risk being that the proposed feedback submitted to Basel for review does not reflect the interests of the Cardano community and Proof of Stake systems specifically. The proposed feedback submitted to Basel for review may reflect the positions of the proposing team and financial industry subject matter experts - but there is a large unmitigated risk that the deliverables will not align with the interests of the proposed financier of this proposal (Catalyst/Cardano/Proof of Stake). If this proposal fails to garner enough votes,I would recommend re-submission with a new plan to collect feedback from the Proof of Stake/Cardano ecosystem BEFORE submitting a position paper to BCBS\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability section of the proposal is very solid. The progress milestones have been well identified and are easy to follow. Maybe more information (transparency) could be provided about how the selection process of relevant subject matter experts  is done, but that is just a suggestion in case the proposal is not voted in now and is resubmitted in Fund 9. The publication of the transcripts of identified issues from first round of interviews is great - I alsothink the team would also not make a mistake if they published the entire interviews - not just the parts about identified issues (however this is only advice if this team resubmits in Fund 9). A detailed plan and timeline for delivering the solution is present. The team has not provided information on how they intend to provide their deliverables - via a dedicated website, through presentations, social media channels, other platforms? Overall I agree the proposal is auditable. Although some additional components might be included (if resubmitting) that would provide feedback to the community on whether any change was achieved to the proposed BCBS regulations. One of the Milestones seems to be missing: Submission of the new response to the BCBS. The proposed solution does specify that the intention is to Impact BCBS's proposed regulations directly - so submitting the new response to the BCBS and providing evidence that the BCBS has received it and acknowledged it - could probably be a valuable milestone (I mention this - if this proposal fails to be voted in Fund 8 and is resubmitted).
