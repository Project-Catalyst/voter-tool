Let me state that on the surface - as written the proposal does not address the Challenge Brief, its' metrics or its' goals. I rated it as a two - disagree and not a one - strongly disagree due to a glimmer inside what I percieve may be the intention of the proposal.\nThe request is for the community to fund the translation of a document for a Purpose entity aka Steward Ownership.  There is a convention in Germany later in 2022 to promote what appears to be the American concept of an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan). \n__________________________________________________\nThe proposal does not address the Challenge in its request for translation funding of the document due to its there being no tie in to Legislative activities such as Lobbying, educating, rule change in the Crypto Currency industry. My suggestion to the proposer would be to edit the proposal and state how your translation will address these Challenge Metrics.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Based on a previous translation the translation is highly likely to be done and would address the plan presented which is why i rated it as a five. The budget clarity, timetable, Implementation, etc are fine per the plan. The Risk Management statement may be over the top (Nuclear Holocaust in Europe), though with current events, let me pull back my statement. The Risk Management statement is on point.\n___________________________________________________\nHowever, even though it is an extremely low budget request and as I stated in the first section I see a glimmer, The proposal does not address the Challenge brief.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability is clear and auditable. The KPIs are straightforward. The Proposal though, does not address the Challenge.\n__________________________________________________\nTo the proposer I would state that if you rewrite your document and demonstrate how your translation can or will help with world or European legislative lobby efforts for Crypto Currency it may be rated higher.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_1339", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3452, "q0": "Proposer has given the problem, however, the information is not detailed, the proposer should give more detailed information about the problem so that the voters can clearly see the importance of the solution.
