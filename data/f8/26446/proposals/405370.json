The idea for this proposal aligns with the challenge in Fund 8.\n\nCharles Hoskinson is a Politician, with 6 years of experience in this field, and has held important positions. He currently keeps a list of groups of people who wish to be educated. These objects will help ensure the bright future of cryptocurrency in the future.\n\nThe proponent mentioned the solution he is holding that will solve the problems of the challenge. However, not all problems are resolved immediately. This section will be more clear if the proponent specifically offers what the solution to this challenge is.\n\nThe possible risks are that fans hate the Blockchain platform, which leads them to hate blockchain technology people. And fortunately, recently Executive Orders can protect against scams and protect the rights and safety of users on this platform. From this, the risks are solvable\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The proponent has not given a specific timeline and specific plan. It will be clearer if You include a complete list of participating events and specific periods that You attend in the next few months.\n\nThe required budget for this project is $5000. Based on the content of this proposal I have not seen a breakdown of this specific use of the budget. In addition, some points need to be clarified in detail. It will be more specific if you explain the estimated budget for each item. That helps this category have enough information to evaluate the project... In this proposal, there is no mention of human resources. Identity is also difficult to determine. It will be more convincing if you provide your identity on social networking sites or attachments\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\"At the moment it is difficult to determine the amount of measurement because there is no specific number.

It vaguely identifies some complaints about the state of cryptocurrency and politics but does not state any specific actions to address those concerns. The proposal doesn't even identify what region is being served, which can only be deduced to the United States based on the use because of the mention of PACs. I would like to see a LinkedIn profile, but the proposal doesn't even actually mention his own name (except for the \"listed by\" line).
