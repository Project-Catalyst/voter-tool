The first is to launch a successful constitutional convention to implement term limits for US legislators. The second would be to create publicity around blockchain by ostensibly getting a lot of attention by creating a very big public issue. This proposal is indirectly related to the challenge overall. There is no explicit mention of lobbying politicians for better regulations as part of this proposal but I would assume the intent is to make that clear through marketing material explaining why the term limits are being asked for in the first place. In it's current form I cannot say that this proposal truly matches the challenge adequately. As some suggestions I would like to see some elaboration on how the marketing would combine the need for better cryptocurrency regulations and rules with the need for term limits. If a clear link between the two could be reasonably made in a manner which would be advertisable then a link could be made between the intent of this challenge and the proposal. Additionally if that clear link could be made one could also make the case that the value of the attempt alone would be worth the cost due to the attention it would the bring. Without seeing this link however and the message could just as easily bring negative attention and hurt other lobbying efforts. In terms of sustainability this proposal has a distinct advantage of wanting to become self funded over time which would create long term value to the community. This also comes with a potential of this self funding to come up short when done in practice and this should be evaluated as a risk. More information is needed overall for this proposal therefore I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal team consists solely of the proposer at this time. There is some experience listed in both politics and marketing which are relevant to the stated goals of the proposal. There are no links provided however to verify this information. The proposal itself has two stated aims. The first is to launch a successful constitutional convention. The rationale for why this could work in this case is good including the advantages of a DAO etc., but does not include much in terms of lobbying individual states. Politicians in the united states I would argue do not have a track record of passing legislation because it is publicly popular. I am not a US citizen but I do have experience in similar systems and I would argue that they generally pass legislation who have persistent and organized lobbying groups. Although I applaud the audacious nature of this goal I find success here unlikely. The second aim is slightly more likely to succeed which is to create public attention by asking for a constitutional convention in the first place. Realistically even passing this type of resolution in a single state would likely result in enough media attention to justify the entire cost of this proposal. For that to matter however the intended message needs to be clear. As already discussed in the impact section this is not yet the case but could be expanded upon for future proposals. As far as the timeframes listed for the current actionable items they are realistic. There could be more clarity around the types of marketing that would be employed since in covers most of the requested costs. Some attention should also be payed to the potential risks that this type of effort could have. For example poor marketing could paint Cardano in an unfavorable light around issues such as ageism particularly with this type of issue. This is again why it is so important that the marketing message be flushed out and be beneficial to the community. I neither agree nor disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of this project rests in confirmation of the creation of a DAO and marketing materials. Both of these could be easily confirmed but there should be a statement of how these things could be confirmed by the community once complete. Simply stating that these metrics would be available for viewing on the planned website would be sufficient for this. Ideally a preliminary website would be running to show the community serious intent. There should be timeframes around the creation of the marketing material put in place. There should also be specific KPIs listed such as X number of educational videos or X number of advertisements etc.. Although the metrics here are relatively simple I would like to see more of them and more specifics, therefore I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_935", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1304, "q0": "This proposal does not address any of the objectives in the Challenge brief, so my assessment is a no - it does not meet the objectives stated in the brief.

This is a very clear overview of the current problem, problems with previously proposed solutions, data that demonstrates overwhelming support in favor of this, and how this solution uniquely and effectively takes action. This is a well-argued action plan for how to approach this issue. However, there are some concerns. First, the requested amount is on the much higher end of catalyst proposals. I have some concerns about approving $60k of Cardano funds for a strictly US-based domestic issue that mainly benefits Americans. At best, this initiative is a proposal that might model how blockchain technology can produce a major change in the world with some bonus points for the fact that it was facilitated on Cardano. At worst, it was an incredibly creative idea that didn't pan out in the end. As much as I REALLY want this initiative to be successful (as a US resident), I don't think that it is worth $60k of Cardano funding. High-risk, low-reward.

For $60k, I would really need to see that there is an established developer team that is ready to make this happen before I could have enough confidence to give my full approval.
