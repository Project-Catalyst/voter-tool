I can only recommend that voters read the whole proposal and follow the links to get the best sense of this, and in the meantime, I will try to point out some of the more interesting aspects that relate to SSI.  The first is the idea of \"static\" vs \"dynamic\" SSI.  We already have an interesting conversation ongoing, under the general heading of \"privacy\" where the user controls the data that faces verifiers in the SSI protocol (verifiers being the entities that need to use your SSI as proof of something, for example a bartender that looks at your ID is the \"verifier\" of that ID).  This idea of static vs dynamic adds a whole new twist, as they are suggesting a biometric basis for how your digital self turns to face whatever verifiers it encounters.  If that sounds like self- or machine-learning to you, that is what it sounds like to me, too.  That brings up another point of interest, the ability of an SSI to learn to be \"you\"... I wouldn't expect anything less than full blown AI from SingularityNET, but this is so tangible of an idea as laid out in this proposal that it gives me a shiver.  A biometric based digital identity, using a secure, privacy protecting link to the blockchain, communicating with end to end encryption so only the selected peers can \"listen\"...and it learns as you learn, changes as you change.  Just in terms of a modest rollout in a simplified metaverse would be a major accomplishment, imagine an SSI that leveled up as you learned...the proposers anticipate this with their interests around teambuilding and matchmaking services.  Amazing project.  Oh and in case you were wondering about the Cardano impact:  AtalaPRISM, check.  cNFTs: check.  $AGIX AI native token on Cardano, check.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team that is presenting this proposal is both deeply engaged in this work but also deeply connected to the wider AI ecosystem that they will be building in and the Cardano ecosystem that they will be building on.  I can't say enough about the surfeit of talent and experience that has converged around this project, which is very strongly concentrated in the AI/cognitive field (shoutout to the HSBC refugee).  There is not an obvious developer squad in the mix, but with the backing of SingularityNET and Architex it is expected that they have that covered  The budget is chunky, but clear enough, and spread over six months as opposed to the 12 months envisioned to see the project to its final destination.  The 6 months covered does amount to the lion's share of the actual rollout, but we can still expect to see this team again in fund 10, probably (sooner with any luck).  The approach outlined here is extremely detailed and doesn't spare the explanations needed to understand a lot of the \"why\" behind certain things like the bio-sensing refinement and expectations.  The risk is, of course, Skynet.  But that is nothing a healthy dose of hubris won't solve.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provides clear deliverables on expected time ranges.  A lot of the deliverables will be documentation, and proof of certain protocols that need to be developed.  It wouldn't surprise me if these come in groups, as there is some parallel development.  If sprint burndown is used for some of these protocols, that could be a useful way to track some of them, as a percent complete, and easy to update the progress reports.  As the team is previously funded, I anticipate they are well prepared for the reporting requirements.  As a huge active community, I don't think we will have any trouble staying in touch with this team (and you can't throw a rock without hitting someone related to this project over at singularityNET).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_1193", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6122, "q0": " This is amazing and love the pursuit. Completely understand proposed implementation and representation of digital identifiers. What I'm struggling to understand is the how this proposal effectively address the first half of this challenge--self-sovereign. Perhaps this is described in the litepaper. I was unable to open it without doxing myself; the google drive linked asked me to request access. With that being said, with what information there is in the proposal and based on my research of VERSES sdk, Pathforms NEURALPRINTing Precision Consciousness building will reuire the collection of personal/private biodata. Would love to see the proposal address the self-sovereign nature of personal biodata. I'm assuming analysis will not be done on the edge, on the user data but rather on centralize services, or a mix of centralized and decentralized singularity AI marketplace services. I would prefer not to speculated and have this all laid out in the proposal. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As this project is R&D heavy, I am confident that the research will both be completed and prove useful one way or another. Would love to see more details about the proposed biosensing equipment. Is is being built anew, as an ASIC specifically for Pathform? Are we adopting an existing IOT hardware/software framework? I have full confidence in the team's ability to execute and complete the research side of things; I have a lot more questions about the feasibility of delivering a consumer ready MVP with the timeline and budget detailed.

The comments would have been more usefull in the refinement stage where discussion could have been had on the specific hardware providers needs, and not in the assesment stage.\nThe assesor also did not focus on the overall proposal, what it will provide and if all the points required by the Catalyst framework have been covered. We are of the opinion that the relevant data for this proposal is present and that assessment gave low grades on wrong reasoing/grounds.\nTherefore, we would like to have this assesment removed."}, {"id": 9739, "q0": "The proposal looks to create an authentication approach that uses a users unique cognitive profile as well as dynamic neural and biometric signatures. The work for this proposal is an extension on top of existing projects such as PATHFORM (http://pathform.io/pathform) and Architex (https://www.myarchitex.com/). The proposal team identify some of the risks and lack of security with existing biometric and password based authentication methods and highlight that NEURALPRINT offers a more secure alternative. Other interesting applications were how they mention this type of tool could determine when people are inebriated or in certain moods which could be useful when the authentication is used in certain contexts like driving a car. If executed effectively this form of authentication could solve more problems than just authentication which offers a glimpse towards the potential high impact of this proposal. The proposal team importantly recognises and addresses the concerns with privacy in this proposal due to the sensitivity of the information that would be collected. Other risks around hiring and adoption are also covered with remedies. The proposal overall has a chance to create something very impactful if executed right that would improve the use cases available for identity in the Cardano ecosystem and potentially offer new ways to authenticate and solve existing social and technical problems.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is very well documented including the core team, extended team, advisors for different projects and founding board. All of the members have their LinkedIn profiles attached for review which gives strong evidence towards the background of the team and their credentials being highly relevant for the execution of this proposal. Another area that increases confidence is the backing and support the team has with members from SingularityNET which is an important addition when considering the complexity of this proposal and the execution effort that will be involved. A video explainer is provided that covers Pathform which is one of the foundational projects that NEURALPRINT was extended from. The team outline a detailed roadmap against 3, 6, 9 and 12 month time frames. The budget is breakdown on an item bases with monthly costs attached to create the final value. Based on the thorough amount of information provided, strong support from industry experts and sources provided it looks clear that this is a strong confidence that this proposal should be executed as intended.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team outline the core parts that are needed to complete the development of this proposal and finish by stating the code will be made available on the following Github repository - https://github.com/GabrielAxel/neuralprint-public. This will make it easy to audit the code that is created and steps are given on how the project will progress. Part of the success outcomes of the proposal are linked to the integration of some of the existing projects Pathform and Architex which tie the projects well together. The only area for improvement would have been trying to understand what some of the initial use cases would be for this project and what types of metrics the team would be looking out for. With this information we can better determine whether this authentication approach can start to receive adoption in ways that made sense as use cases. It could have also been useful to base any metric targets like these on other authentication systems to get comparative metrics on what a good or bad outcome might look like in terms of adoption. Overall the project has high clarity and most of the important metrics identified that they will present to showcase the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_758", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A neural fingerprint & digital twin: Contextual mapping of dynamic brain signatures, paired with decentralized neural keys and credentialing", "experience": "2 neuro PhD's, startup founders.
