They made 14 proposals like this one so that people can actually vote on the language they want. This review is the same for all 14 proposals. In each proposal the requested amount varies depending on the language.\r\nMy only concern about this kind of service is that it makes an application dependent on the API provider, which goes against decentralization. Now this kind of service allows one to quickly start a project and add decentralization later (at a cost) so this lowers the barrier of entry for new developers to do stuff right away.\r\nThis concern is not addressed in the project, probably because there is a conflict of interest on their part (making their customer dependent on their service is more sustainable long term) their services are currently free for the first 100,000 requests.
