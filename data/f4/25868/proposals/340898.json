Popularity religion & politics brings both aspects of the coin to the table in the media world.  More clarity in defining what needs changing should be considered as well as why a decentralized social media platform but the platform proposed  fund \"selected\" content creator, bring the question if thwt is centralising a network for a specific gaol oriented approach . If the goal is to open the ground for freedom of speech this needs to be more clearly communicated in the proposal as the vision and how it will achieve the benefits/shortfalls of what ensues that platform. I agree to the point that the world is starting to become more complex and convoluted with \"cancel culture\" sentimente but more clarity as to what the project intends to develop needs to be addressed as funds in the Cardano network are used to align certain level of transparency that can reveal benefits to the community and  its long term vision. How it can onboard applications that align somewhat to the pressing goals of the network and bring the community of people to the ecosystem which this proposal enriches.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a great idea but it doesn't belong in this challenge category.

This could be a stumbling block for many people. Ownership should be determined by who is willing to purchase a tokenized asset representing ownership of ideas presented by Artists. The artist could choose how many tokens to mint and how many they are willing to part with. Goldstone Eterprises could choose to purchase them if they like. The tokens should be freely traded after minting. The value of the token would be determined by the success of the project.\r\n\r\nGodstone Enterpirses could hold 25% of the of the GSN coin automatically, without any cause for concern. I think ownership of GSN equalng stake in the platform and voting power is a great idea. It could also be used as some sort of fuel for exchanging tokenized assets and content viewing.
