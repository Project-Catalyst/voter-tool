Security, privacy and traceability is a key protective layer for protecting assets and identity soon to be required in the Cardano ecosystem. It is paramount that a authenticator is also deployed in the network and protective layers where Dapps can ask the user for permission and as a gatekeeper of assets in the blockchain.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Having a good sdk that works with Cardano is a very good foundation for the development of new appliations for Cardano.

The proposal would benefit from providing a greater level of detail about the current situation and about what success will look like. The amount of information provided in the fields \"Problem statement: \" and \"Describe your solution to the problem\" is small and sparse, which makes it less easy to say that the proposal \"effectively\" addresses the challenge. A funding proposal for USD29000 would require more information than what has been provided, in my view. So, the proposer should think of fleshing out such proposals in the future.

I would have preferred if the proposer had provided specific examples in the \"Relevant experience\" field, instead of the generally worded: \"Tens of successfully implemented blockchain projects, pilots for the Dutch government, winner in Odyssey hackathon, huge tech expertise.\" It is difficult to chase up such information to verify it for every proposer and as such this means that the experience as presented is not as well presented as it could have been. The implementation plan, budget and timetable seem transparent enough, although I am not an expert to assess whether they are realistic.

Adding Cardano to the supported \"backends\" would be a great advantage for new projects.

Great starting point that can be built open as new standards for all Defi/Dapps built in the Cardano network. I would advice on exploring the extra mile of multi layered approach in which a central hub similar to metamask is created and all Defi/Dapp launched in Cardano requires validation to transact, secure and trace identity and assets across the Cardano ecosystem. This can in place also allow them to also interact with each other through this platform. It is the start of a beautiful project.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "In general, this proposal could have benefited from providing more information on its feasibility and how it addresses all the aspects of the Challenge Brief in much more depth to make it easier for CAs to approve it and to review it.
