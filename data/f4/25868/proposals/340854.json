The online wallet provides the most straightforward experience for new users interacting with DApps and Cardano chain. The problem formulated in the first section is a personal problem rather than a Cardano developer's ecosystem. Interpreting the proposal's intent rather than the exact wording of the problem statement, I conclude that the proposal fit the challenge well. Still, it does not directly address how the project will benefit other developers and the ecosystem, and points are taken off for that reason", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think the proposal still needs more work. The project is ambitious but I don't see how it would help my experience interacting with my ADA. Also there seems to be a lack of documentation that goes beyond the website.

", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal \"Problem statement\" and \"solution\" are basically just saying \"i need more money to finish this\", but i understand the proposal is to renew the existing Medusa wallet.

Aside from the small dev team working specifically on this project, I don't see how this proposal meets the challenge of really adding anything to the dev ecosystem at large.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "Anyone who has been long enough in the ecosystem understands the importance of wallet options. However, I am a bit surprised that the authors don't go into detail when discussing some business applications that could be extended built with help of new medusa engines. Many things could be obvious to a seasoned developer - but if you are presenting to voters at large - it helps to tie the narrative a bit better for the challenge you are addressing. Such as Dev Ecosystem here. So that it isn't specific to support dev of medusa wallet solely. There is some hint at section below via deliverables - like pay pal button etc - I think those concepts could have been expanded upon more to add that colour. But I am fan of the project and hopefully it can spring up with new functionalities as envisioned. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team behind the proposal have a proven record of excellent work in the Cardano ecosystem, at least since the ITN.

It's also not open-source which makes it difficult to asses. The proposer sounds experienced, but the plan is not very well written, probably due to language barrier and there's no budget breakdown.

The past references from medusa project tell a convincing story that community can leverage. However, there are few things are a bit missing to amp up the proposal on executables. Namely - there is only one grand budget figure but it doesn't break down meaningfully to understand which module development requires what resources. It would have been great to add some figures or a better explanation for how long this support will be possible or if it were per tasks delivered. That would make the case more compelling and budgetary requirements more transparent. Good points though for commitment and that everyone is ready to do their part once funded. That's a plus. On a negative side - would have been nice to learn more specifically about of whom is team made up. You know, matching faces to names, etc.  ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "A proposal doing an excellent job explaining the current status of the project but lacks a clear timeline. It is unclear which of the listed features will be implemented with requested funds and in which timeframe.

It has very detailed milestones which is a good thing. But what I miss is a bit of better timeline - to understand for the roadmap.
