I would have liked to learn more about benefits of supporting pooltool for testnet to the greater community. I can assume what these can be but some effort within the proposal itself would have been nice. E.g. we see great need to support tools for SPOs who run testnet operation when testing elements for main net. By enabling these tools - we are able to help test features on Cardano and make them that much better\" or something like that - not that Samuel has asked and that's why we are here...makes sense, right? Bottom line - it would have been greater if authors started with explaining why testnet is important and pool tools participation vital in it. That would have set the tone a bit better.

This feels a bit more like throwing a dart at the target seeing where it lands? I really don't get why it all rests on Samuel who has no part in pooltool on whether this thing runs or not. That is awkward  presentation. It seems not respectful of the process much. On the other hand, I have no doubt that pooltool team is very competent to run this - very smart group - but this proposal just reads incomplete in light of expectations. So I am willing to offer benefit of doubt. The thing is - this might just get funded given how low of amount it is being requested anyway? So let's see - good luck and keep up the work.

Or would it be how happy Samuel is on scale 1-10? :))) Jokes aside - what are the wider implication of this proposal that we can measure long term? Are there any challenges/risks associated with it? None of these have been given any consideration in this proposal. Perhaps it is by design, but given on criteria we try to hold each proposal accountable to - it seems deficient. Few more bullets points, sentences would have done the trick, I believe.
