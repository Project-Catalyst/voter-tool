Wher would it be situated upon completion? what extra resources could be deployed by this proposal to enrich the process ? and perhaps a tutorial showcasing this solution as an asset to a developers hub could be explored. More information is required in regards of the deliverables and to asses if the funds can cover a more resourceful application of this proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal does not justify why easing the process of setting up a local testnet would significantly improve the current development experience (often based on the public testnet), productivity, and adoption.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "I am afraid this submission doesn't go into any detail that would help anchor its impact level. I think we can guess what the actual usecase be - but we need to be able to understand thinking about how authors plan to go about it. And how it aligns with cardano mission and what benefits to cardano community we can expect. Needs a bit more work - there is just a concept/idea at the moment. Not a proposal that we can execute upon. Potentially a good one - but needs more work and thoughts to be considered seriously.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The solution seems to work.

The tool prototype in bash that is mentioned has no explanation on how it works. Roadmap/milestones would be appreciated.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The working experience as a developer and a working prototype sounds like promising deliverables. A detailed plan and thought out analysis of where, what and hkw is presented to the community in a manner that is not a hidden gem from the developers who would have access to the tool in their search for one. This could already exist but is not so readily accessible as a tool withba quick access in the network.

It needs all the basic elements ended such as establishing experience, providing some references, professional profiles, understanding who would actually build this proposal in real life.

There are no milestones, sensible roadmap, anything that would resemble executable proposal just yet. How does author thing about success?
