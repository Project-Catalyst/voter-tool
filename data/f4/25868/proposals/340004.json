I would have liked more to understand in greater detail this proposal as it reads more of a concept stage at the moment - a wish that we all want to happen.

There are probably many details clear to the author but are not yet communicated efficiently within this proposal. Namely - I wish some professional profile/references to prior work were added to the presentation so that we can establish identity and validity of experience claims. Another big issue I have is - I don't understand the validity of requested budget figure. It states only one sum and it doesn't go into detail what it would be used for and how. Some budget breakdown would have been really useful. Also - it isn't clear to me if this is a project for one person or a team put together and how the existing platforms are going to play a role with. There is a mention of needing to investigate - but I feel some prep-work should have been done to establish which direction is best to go with?

There is a basic plan included but would have loved to learn a bit more nuanced step by step approach. How long would it take for each step to complete, resources required in better detail. I suggest pairing up with someone and to take it a step further on planning stage. I would also recommend getting in touch with e.g. CF - as intended by author - and getting some sense of their work being done already. Adatainment does great work and could be very helpful with that regards. Also - overview of existing landscape would be useful with regards to work done (or not done) by IOG. Understanding that would help position your proposal in a firm direction. I would then also be keen to understand how author thinks about success metrics for this proposal, as well. When do we know that this effort was worth a while. Lesser complaints? Traffic increase?
