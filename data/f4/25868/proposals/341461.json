Currently .NET ecosystem (from Microsoft) enjoys one of the biggest developers pool for building applications on all platforms web/mobile/desktop and with introduction of .NET core .NET is no more limited to windows based systems. Therefore, bringing such a huge eco system to build on/with cardano is crucial to realize bringing ocean (4:55 mark in the Island, The Ocean and the Pond video from Charles Hoskinson) to Cardano.\r\n2. The SDK will simplify the integration process of .NET developers (by reducing the boilerplate code and allowing them to focus more on business logic) to Cardano ecosystem.\r\n3.  The SDK will be open source so as more .Net Developers start using it, the contributors will grow over time giving cardano higher exposure to developers from mainstream languages.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a perfect fit for the current challenge as this would simplify the life of the developers and allow them to develop in their language of choice. They made 14 proposals like this one so that people can actually vote on the language they want. This review is the same for all 14 proposals. In each proposal the requested amount varies depending on the language.\r\nMy only concern about this kind of service is that it makes an application dependent on the API provider, which goes against decentralization. Now this kind of service allows one to quickly start a project and add decentralization later (at a cost) so this lowers the barrier of entry for new developers to do stuff right away.\r\nThis concern is not addressed in the project, probably because there is a conflict of interest on their part (making their customer dependent on their service is more sustainable long term) their services are currently free for the first 100,000 requests. A list of their APIs can be found at docs.blockfrost.io (link not provided in the description).\r\nWe would have also liked to have more detail on the kind of service they already provide and their future plans...", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "the central part already exists.
