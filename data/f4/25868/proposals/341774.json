Connect with those other initiatives (e.g. https://hpmeducation.com/), work together, synergize and make the magic happen.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is a good proposal and challenge presented. The solution needs more clarity as to what type of programming language and can it be applicable to the ones used in the industry. Are we referring to Marlowe, Plutus or Haskell? is it a peer to peer lesson or learning through video tutorials with assessment for progress? is it a module based learning with tokenized incentive after fulffilling a level of competency? and more clarity as to the end result for the Cardano community will it lead to developments in the network, projects based in Cardano ecosystem or Dapps/Defi launched from Cardano?", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Although it is normal and customary to teach with tutorial videos, this proposal is not suitable to achieve the objective of this challenge. There is a lack of concrete content and there is also no plan how this content should be created. In principle, the project proposes to finance the applicant for self-experience with other ignorant people.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Although the project's goals are laudable and would enhance understanding and adoption of Cardano, the proposal only partially focuses on growing and enhancing the developer ecosystem. For this challenge the proposal could focus more on the (future) developer community and a specific and graded sequence of learning goals.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Wow. We are the same: genuine yet little bit lost people trying to do the right thing. You have your long term vision but, honestly, I think it would be better use of your time if you would first join another team and, once you have seen how Project Catalyst works, try again to realize your vision via this or other means.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "There seams to be experience in the tasks involved in the solution. More clarity as to the end goal for the community at large which are ultimately where the fundings are allocated to ensure a sense of return for the investment.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no plan and no essential content. For example, the methodology is supposed to be based on intrinsic motivation, but that completely contradicts the proposal to reward students with dollars. The own introduction with a video is unfortunately a very bad example of motivating and content-conveying work.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has the required experience and outlines an achievable plan for achieve the goals, though those may be to ambitious for the requested budget.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "It seems that most of the time would go to one-on-one mentoring. I know what you're going through and what you're aiming for. Therefore, it almost hurts to say this but investing 6,000 USD to mentor 4 people is not money well spent.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal is great and I believe a Fund 3 finnalist is working on similar tasks perhaps reach out to the individual and collaboration towards those mean can expand the results towards beneficial outcomes for all the community to gain access to that resource.
