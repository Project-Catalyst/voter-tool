Proposal reads more like a concept than actual action ready proposal. I would have loved to learn how authors are thinking about budget beyond just one grand figure of 100,000 USD. This could be right amount, but also may not. We have no way to address that as there are no indications in the proposal how it breaks down. Company seems to have been in the space for a quite a some time - hence I would assume producing an executable proposal shouldn't be a big issue. Perhaps it was just forgotten from the earlier stages? Unsure. This may be also due to the fact that there really isn't a sensible plan in place which would essentially make it easier to assign resources to each stage. I would suggest to edit that and bring it forward next time.

A lot of this detail would have improved the proposal greatly beyond conceptual stage in which it seems to be in now.
