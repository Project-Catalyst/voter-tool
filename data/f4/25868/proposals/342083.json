I see a couple of issues though:\r\n\r\n1) If Cardano is successful and if you know your Plutus / Haskell you won't need a marketplace to be employed. Everyone wants your services.\r\n\r\n2) Building a marketplace takes a bit more than a simple website.\r\n\r\n3) Limiting the marketplace to only Cardano developers might make this a marginal initiative. Could we include RUST and work with Parity / Web3 to make it happen, for instance?\r\n\r\nBenchmark with an earlier idea (that actually pivoted to first figure out and build SSID Professional profile needed for such marketplaces):\r\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Serv-Network-Professional-Profiles/333243-48088\r\n\r\nhttps://servnetwork.org/whitepaper", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I don't see why a special marketplace for Cardano-Developer would improve the experience for skilled developer and people that search for them.

With the success of Gitcoin, it's only natural that Cardano has a hub where developers can create a portfolio for themselves and showcase their talents directly to companies/organisations with tough problems that blockchain can solve.\r\n\r\nGiving companies a place to essentially hire/contract someone to solve their problem at cost to them creates a positive feedback loop as a company that utilises Cardano and becomes successful is a clear win resulting in increased usage for Cardano.
