It seems the proposal tries to solve the majority of the problems that DApp development poses today, yet there is a lack of a concrete (partial) solution proposition.\r\nCommunity benefit:\r\nIf the vision of the proposal is achieved mainly projects migrating from ETH would significantly profit from an easy way into Cardano.\r\nAbility to scale and address challenges:\r\nContracting of MuKn and IOG is pointed out, which would allow for scalability. However, it is not clear if the contract of MuKn and IOG is an intention or if there's already agreements of cooperation with these organizations. It is not clear if the team can rely on these contractors or of they are at risk to lift the project on their own.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "This challenge is well expressed and the technical expertise is vast.
