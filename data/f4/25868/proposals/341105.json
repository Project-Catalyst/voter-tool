We all know how grassroots curation of developer talent is very crucial for cardano ecosystem. We are new and need to be building roots that will have lasting effect.

There is great presentation about individual team members which helps establish validity of presenters. I also can see the budget semantics broken down into more understandable pieces. Maybe a bit more detail on contributing parts would have been really good. Overall, it is clear, being funded from 2nd round - the team is already committed and ready to continue work already initiated. Also knowing they regularly provide reporting - that gives good confidence in their experience so far. Please, keep it up. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "A well documented proposal.

From a detailed reading, it feels there are too many things in pipeline so may be would be nice to have prioritization showed up in proposal as well. e.g. make short term vs long term split or make it pictorial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, proposal is very feasible to achieve its goals that are addressed in their solution statement.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "It is very detailed including all the elements such as clear description of what they are trying to and solution attached - and what definition of success looks like. Metrics are included - perhaps a bit modest but I hope they will outgrow these initial targets quickly. I would have loved to learn more about any challenges they see ahead or risks associated with how this proposal plans to be carried out. Having been funded in Fund 2 - I think some of things are likely coming to light. Shedding more information about would have been useful. But overall - very strong proposition and neatly laid out. I would only suggest to proofread the attached document with actual proposal. For example, metrics in the attached document have 'coming soon' even though they seem to be included in ideascale interface already. So making sure information is organised well between various presentation forms.
