One of the key elements how to grow Cardano ecosystem at scale is ensuring low barriers to entry and proper documentation. I have witnessed myself many times pi users on various forums. Often, not getting a whole lot targeted answers as most operators do not run these smaller set up. Thus - I definitely see the alignment with the greater goals of Cardano of inclusivity and enablement. Mind you - it needs to be navigated in mind with growing tech requirements. I think that is one of the major challenges for pi operators to keep up with it. Great effort on starting this. One thing that is missing for me - understanding the size of the group. Adding some estimates about how big of this group is would go a long way establishing how impactful the whole process will be. Regardless, I am a fan.

As a raspberry pi user myself I will definitely be using this as a resource. The budget makes sense but I would actually be fine if they increased it because as other users have mentioned, new pi stake pools will need a considerable about of ada to even produce a block.

It would be useful to understand total size of the pi membership so we could put some targets to achieve over time. There are metrics listed but don't have actual targets attached to them - like numerical. E.g. growing twice the size of the current community, getting XYZ visits on community portal, etc. Adding these would help understand community by how much authors wish to grow this sub ecosystem with pi, etc. I would also have loved to learn more about challenges/risks as seen from vantage point of authors - we know that pi are very light and efficient nodes. How do these compare with growing cardano blockchain and resources needed? Some pointers in that regard would have been useful for proposal as well. Namely to address - longevity of these set-ups.
