This proposal is for entrepreneurs and should be resubmitted in a next funding round in a more fitting challenge.\r\nMoreover the proposers make no case as why their proposal fits the challenge which is misleading and detrimental to other projects.

(developer profiles, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc... would be helpful to assess the technical abilities of the team). From their documents it seems that all the technicalities will be dealt with much later.
