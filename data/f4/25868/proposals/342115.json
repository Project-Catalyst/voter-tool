The plan presented is very vague, which makes it difficult to assess the impact of the proposal on the challenge. The problem statement and the solution are reasonable, but the proposal doesn't address the risks that the Covid-19 pandemic may have in the project, many locations in the world are with movement restrictions and even in places where there are no movement restrictions some people prefer to isolate themselves or do home office.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal aims to be a support group.\r\nThis has been filed in the wrong challenge.

What will the training and support for developers look like? How many devs can be trained? Which programming languages will be taught? These are examples of questions that should be clear.\r\n\r\nThe proposal mentions a team of 14 developers and researchers. Who will actively participate in the proposal? What are their professional experiences and skills? There is mention of development experience in the Ethereum and Tezos blockchains, but nothing was mentioned about Cardano.
