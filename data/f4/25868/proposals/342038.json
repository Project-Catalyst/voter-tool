(The software engineering principle KISS, keep it simple and stupid should not be forgotten)\r\n2. Cardano documentation is quite good but also extensive which might be quite overwhelming and boring for new people. The proposer focusses on utilizing digital marketing strategies and keeping this information aggregated with simplicity so that new devs stick to the education platform and spend more time there learning about Cardano. As they feel more confident about the ecosystem, they can certainly go deeper via other sources, such as gimbalabs, official docs, white papers etc.\r\n3.
