There is a need for a more user-friendly website on Plutus, add interesting use cases, including small community project samples from various fields, community Q/A. This is a well-noticed gap and a more independent offering from a community member with IT experience, as the proposer indicates he has, would be welcome. It could attract new developers and help soften the learning curve to absorbing and utilizing Plutus. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal does address the challenge of improving the developer ecosystem, but it doesn't differentiate itself from existing instructional materials, websites, and discord channels. The idea to segment use cases is novel and worth pursuing.

For the funding requested I would like to see a detailed breakdown of tasks, KPIs and a time line for each, as well as a more detailed breakdown of where the funding will be used.

If the experience is there, it should be fleshed out more in order to strengthen the chances of this proposal. Another problem is that the plan is a bit to general, still seems like a concept, less like an implementation plan.\r\n\r\nThe budget breakdown is more like an early draft of what is required:\r\n\" Costs\r\nNeed to pay for:\r\nDesigner\r\nOngoing monthly costs for GCP (Cloud provider)\r\nMy time and other professionals that may be involved in this along the way\"\r\n\r\nWhile the lump sum of USD 65000, may be realistic, or may not be. It is not clear from the proposal. If it does not pass in this round it may be good to resubmit it as a more, well-defined and structured proposal in the next funding round. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team has some of the core experience needed to successfully implement the proposal, but the proposal does not detail the UX (user experience) or web-development expertise that would be essential for success. The latter is particularly important because best practices in UX and teaching would be required for a compelling and effective development journey. The proposal discusses many goals qualitatively, but does not present specific KPIs, a staged roadmap (since this is a one-year project), or well-defined deliverables.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "This proposal is extremely lacking and extremely redundant.

", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal, I think, would have been better had the proposer had time to provide sufficient information on implementation and an operational plan. As it stands now, it is difficult to assess how feasible it is as some aspects seem to be still under consideration and some not. For example, the proposer states: \"Ideally need to have a segmentation for real-use cases, for example \"Social\", \"Sports\", \"Financial industry\", \"Science\", \"Health\" etc\"  Not sure if the \"ideally\" means that the proposer theoretically aspires to this goal, or may do it or may not... Some aspects are also in the very general stage (\" The design of the website of course has to be super mint\" ), which needs to be better presented and specified. Everyone's understanding of what is \"super mint\" might differ. The budget needs to be more detailed. The lack of specific information on the technical requirements and skillsets for team members is also a sign of lack of an operational plan.
