However, form in which this proposal is presented misses many marks for me. While there are numerous attempts to highlight existing work - I miss somewhat more structured way and communication of intent of this proposal at large. Again - great idea - but it seems to get lost in many details and it doesn't have a clear direction of what it really wishes to do with Catalyst community. It focuses too much on who and where but not when/how instead. Excerpts from videos by Charles and other sources are great - but I need to understand author's role more precisely. Would have really liked to watch/listen to a video from author instead where they would explain and tie it all together in a cohesive fashion. There really needs to be more elements added to this proposal to make it investable as is.

I dont have the technical skills so i can only add that i'd like to have an idea of either budget or roadmap (like how much time to do you think it'll take to complete it) just to put things in perspective.

Let's start backwards. There is a budget figure of 200,000 USD requested. Which is half the fund of this challenge. Given that amount - I would expect appropriate level of depth when addressing how this budget is going to be spent. We can't really get any sense. I tried to open every attachment and read through all segments - but just couldn't locate it. Only based on this alone - I would be very cautious about proceeding with funding. Second - I am unable to establish validity of claims/experience. I am not entirely convinced for a need to attach sample email communication with IOHK nor referencing so heavily their name in the process. It seems more of a marketing move than one with substance. That's really strange form to me. It also says in experience that author has asked Ben G. from Singularity - but again - what does it have to do with proposal. It is nice sideshow - but we need to focus on content of this proposal. It reads very poorly. It reads like a concept more than executable proposal. It needs more editing so that it can be assessed properly given its direction. Perhaps reworking it and submitting it at the later stages will work.

I would really also love to understand how does author think about this proposal in terms of success - what do such metrics look like, if there are any KPIs they are thinking about. None of which I was able to find in the proposal. Also - any specific challenges/risks that are tied to the proposal itself? What concerns the author when going to implement this solution? Would have been also very helpful addition to the data presented.  I really don't know how we can keep track of the progress with this proposal given the information provided.
