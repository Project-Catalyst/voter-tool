Providing an easy access to many programming languages is very important and it would make the adoption of Cardano much easier for a lot of people.

They made 14 proposals like this one so that people can actually vote on the language they want. This review is the same for all 14 proposals. In each proposal the requested amount varies depending on the language.\r\nMy only concern about this kind of service is that it makes an application dependent on the API provider, which goes against decentralization. Now this kind of service allows one to quickly start a project and add decentralization later (at a cost) so this lowers the barrier of entry for new developers to do stuff right away.\r\nThis concern is not addressed in the project, probably because there is a conflict of interest on their part (making their customer dependent on their service is more sustainable long term) their services are currently free for the first 100,000 requests. A list of their APIs can be found at docs.blockfrost.io (link not provided in the description).\r\nWe would have also liked to have more detail on the kind of service they already provide and their future plans...", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "There are already sdks for blockfrost and there are implementations for many diffent programming langues planned.

This is a very sound approach as if they had made a single proposal to implement all the 14 languages for $110,000 the risk would have been too high.\r\nThis no risk approach also provides insurance that the project is viable long term.\r\nThey also say on their website that they plan to release their backends as an open source project \"\"in the near future\"\" which ensures that this project will do more than mitigate the risks they take.\r\n(This review is the same for their 14 proposals).", "rating": 5}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "We want to build an open-source SDK (Software Development Kit - a set of tools, libraries and documentation) for Swift developers.", "experience": "We are the creators of Blockfrost.io, creating services and tools lowering barriers to entry for developers."}
