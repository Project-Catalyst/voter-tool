", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Not sure how can this assist the community's mission other than marketing the vision of Cardano. Perhaps more clarity on explaining the solution can strengthen the challenge. Governance is definitely one of the hardest projects to achieve in Cardano and any model that can bring inspiration should be onboarded and welcomed. Reading a book defining the key proposal topics is not a way to bring confidence in the proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I mean, it's a different than usual proposal, that's for sure :D But, if there is a system of governance and information sharing that works and we can learn from it, then it definitely addresses the challenge.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer seems to be a superfan.
