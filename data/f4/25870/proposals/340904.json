However, you need to be careful not to create a centralized team/platform deciding what is good and bad.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal is touching an important bit very difficult dilemma: We want the community to decide and vote, but need to reduce complexity for coping with the rapidly growing number of proposals. Here comes 'the filter', but who and how are we controlling this filter ? This needs to be a rather formalistic and simple algorithm, otherwise we are back to 'someone controlling it somehow'. Spreading results over many media does not really make a lot of sense to me. At the end, scope and methodology are not 100% clear to me. I nevertheless support this proposal, it is touching a super-important issue.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal aims at filtering below average proposals from Project Catalyst in an open and transparent way. This definitely helps in effectiveness and reduces the noise voters are exposed to. On the other hand, it adds a bit of centralization because a single entity will do the filtering.

The budget breakdown doesn't detail the allocation of resources, the proposal didn't describe details about the qualification and expertise of the team members. The timeline doesn't include deadlines, which is essential because the proposal must be synchronized with the Funds to be relevant. The absence of this information indicates that the team is not completely aware of the importance of the metrics in the guidelines. I recommend paying attention to this, because if the proposal is approved, they will need to understand this as much as the community advisors so that the filtering of proposals is fair.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "proposal provides sufficient information about the feasibility of the proposal but would have loved if deliverable were mentioned with the timeline.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "It provides ways to audit and monitor the process to gauge its success by the metrics provided.", "rating": 5}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Empower decision making by filtering proposals with a transparent set of principles, and broadcast the results in a consumer friendly manner", "experience": "SPOs, Fortune 500 Marketing specialist, Software- & DevOps Engineers, Communication & PR expert\nLanguages: EN CN SE DK NO DE RU CZ EE"}
