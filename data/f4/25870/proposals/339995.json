Not sure how this could be applied to the community and how to authenticate that individuals have the authority to control others based on merits. This seams borderline social credit model type of application in my opinion. Perhaps present a case that this could be deployed for the betterment of a system or the structure of a system to better highlight the potential application of this solution.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal is trying to solve the issue of decentralizing power with developing smaller hierarchies.
