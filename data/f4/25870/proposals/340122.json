New users don't have a really concise guide to doing well on Project Catalyst\n", "no_assessments": 15, "rating": 2.8, "assessments": [{"question": 1, "note": "I like the idea and also the provided example that has entertaining aspects, which make it more accessible. Regarding the effectivness of the proposal, I don't see a simple document as a good solution for the problem that is stated. The existing structure with people that can be contacted in chat-rooms and guids that are already available will solve the challenge, in my optione, in in better way.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Although this might fit a little better in 'Value Onboarding', this proposal will also strengthen 'Distributed Decision Making' by empowering community members to get engaged.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal aims at creating guides for new people to quickly familiarize themselves with Project Catalyst so they can become more effective quickly. If more people understand things deeply, they will make their own decisions thus decentralising decision making.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is not clear how the proposal will improve the decision-making process. Informing the community about Catalyst through guides would be important, but I think that the proposal lacks focus on the challenge theme and a tangible plan to improve the situation.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "I don't think the challenge is directly addressed, but helping smoeone be able to navigate and not be intimindated once they do try to get involved is important. If we drive adoption and can keep people around, it will help distribute decision making.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is experience available, but a comprehensive guide should collect the experience of many people. I have no doubt, that the proposer can document his experience in a document. Success includes for me also that the desired benefit will be achieved and this is the point where I have doubts.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The relevant experience needed for this is simply having experience with catalyst, and the proposer has that.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "Plan is to create guides as documents, one simple guide was already created and attached in the proposal. Proposer invites people to help him, the barrier of entry is low. It would be nice to have a plan of set of documents that will be created.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no plan outlined. The proposer is a member of the Catalyst community and used his experience to create a sample guide, but there is no further details about his qualifications.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Does not provide relevant experience  in training or creating guide books.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal is quite simple to implement. Writing a guide. As I already stated, I don't think it will be an effective way to solve the issue at hand, but I completely understand what his plan is.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposer will make guides for catalyst, but doesn't show how they will measure impact or how it will be shared with the community.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "It is a simple proposal, proposer already made one document, people are invited to participate and basically anyone who has experience with Project Catalyst can participate. There is no clear goal on how many documents will be created and in which time frame, which can be an issue with auditing.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no clarity on how the proposal will address the challenge, i believe the ideas presented are more aligned with the Catalyst Value Onboarding challenge. There is no plan, there are no metrics to be based on the successful evaluation of the proposal.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Does not provide any measurables to gauge success.
