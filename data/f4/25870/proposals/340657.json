It addresses a few concerns - Balancing voting power between large ADA holders and small ADA holders.\r\n\r\nThe proprosal doesn't address the identity authentication challenge that comes alongside this ambitious goal. No method to prevent large stakeholders from bypassing the potential redistribution of voting power, overcoming the purpose of the proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal directly tackles the problem of voting influence which, in turn, is the deciding factor for money distribution from the Cardano treasury.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal addresses a crucial factor in the decision-making process.

The proposal will rely on a community backed and endorsed method of aggregation and labelling of data, but there is no clear method on how this would be achieved in a decentralized way. Although the proposers state that a literature review will be completed and available to public, how could the community trust that it was done without bad intentions if they don't have the technical literacy to interpret it? If a limited, highly contextualized group determines the aggregation and labelling methods of data that's put into the AI, they are the ones with centralized power.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "A team of two people with strong background in academia and experience with developing complex systems and simulations.
