But as to where it should give recommendations I disagree because the idea of Cardano is decentralization, I believe in that and I don't think we should look for big shortcuts when it comes to hard work. Being efficient yes but to use one central point of AI (to chew the food for us) takes a lot out of the process of going from idea to proposal to being reviewed and accepted for voting that is required from the community/humans. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I can see this helping separate ideas that require more information for proper assessments or as an assisted step to improve the quality of proposals at the early stage. This proposal could help streamline the process and provide feedback to the proposer in real time. There are certain proposal that could work with other proposal create a more robust strategy and to be mixed into one team that can deliver more quality and performance to both. The proposal addresses the challenge posed.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "An AI can provide unbiased feedback. However, it does lack the 'human touch'. So, while this might help us tremendously, I envision an ideal situation where there would be a symbiosis between the human insight element and the AI. In other words: both are needed to maximise efficiency. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal is addressing a very important topic: How to reduce complexity when working through all the current (and future) Catalyst proposals. Would be good, if there can be a cooperation found with e.g. the 'Great Filter' proposal under this campaign. This definitely looks to me like a move into the right direction.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal aims to create an AI algorithm that would evaluate proposals as a helping tool for voters.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem and solution presented are reasonable, but as the challenge is focused on solutions in the short term, we need to stick to the deliverables for Fund4 and these deliverables are subjective and incomprehensible, I recommend that the description be more objective so that we can understand if the proposal will have relevance in the challenge.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "train AI to critique proposals and give recommendations,\r\n1) AI personal consultant medical data\r\n2) AI personal trainer diet\r\n3) AI track of basis daily financial record\r\n4) AI voice recorded and translate to any native\r\n      language.\r\n5) AI detection virus or bug to auto fix\r\n6) AI protect encryption wallet address ,Public\r\n    address.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "An interesting idea, pert for as an academic case study, not for here. The focus should be on engaging the community to review and discuss proposals, not build an AI to replace them", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "I was not particularly satisfied with the proposers answer to the question about his experience in this field. I also felt that it would have been prudent to reach out to some people (which ones can be fairly easy to search) within IOG and Singularity in order to begin a dialogue along these lines, learn, and therefore provide the community with a little more of a feel for what would be needed in terms of time as well as the likelihood of any potential collaboration with IOG and/or Singularity personnel.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "\r\nAs to a feasible plan, all I have to say is that,  what is given as information on the step by step process is left a little bit in the air.

Would it be an implementation of an already existing AI system or would one be built?\r\nThe cost might exceed 10000 USD for a project this size, which is ok as the ROI would be great as well. Consider a recalculation asking for more.\r\n\r\nA proper risk assessment is missing in the proposal. What if the AI assesses a funding round erroronous?
