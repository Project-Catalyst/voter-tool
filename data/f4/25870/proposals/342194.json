Gains wouldn't be realized until funding of ~$200k is realized which isn't available in the current fund.\r\n\r\nWith full deployment, the proposal promises many things that will increase community participation with proposal funding and confidence in the vote by putting it all on the blockchain with reputation linked to addresses.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal wants to add support for Cardano to the existing Commonwealth UI.
