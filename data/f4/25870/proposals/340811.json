The proposal would receive better ratings if it could show how these rapid, focused swarm decisions could be embraced by the community at large.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Proposal aims at creating a brand vision for Project Catalyst through swarm sessions as a test goal for future swarm sessions.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "A worthwhile yet large proposal.

Unfortunately the execution and adoption portions needed for this to be used at scale are not covered here.
