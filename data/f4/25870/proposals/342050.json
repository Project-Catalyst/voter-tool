Although, it seems that a new website with this sole purpose is too much. It could go inside another one, for example, there is already the Master Landing Page initiative going on. Both ideas could be placed in the same website, in different sections. Also, this could be integrated with the accountability of each proposal, but it would need more investment.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Yes, featuring previously funded projects and supporting them to reach new heights is definitely going to be helpful. However, rather than building a yet another website, you should utilize your strengths and bring your value addition to other like-minded projects such as https://adapulse.io/ (although I like your URL better. If it was up to me I would keep that as the main site and point AdaPulse to CatalystWinners.com instead).\r\n\r\nSame way you could offer to aggregate news to: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Project-Catalyst-Landing-Page/341718-48088\r\n\r\n(Mind you, CardaNews doesn't seem to work on Brave Browser for some reason.)", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I had the same problem myself.

There is a need to have a platform that provides info on winning projects, tracking of ongoing projects, documentation, generals FAQs, Advisor support and training. A wider discussion and involvement of wider society inputs to create a much more usable system would be great.\r\n\r\nHaving a site to address related society issues can make system difficult to manage and refer to.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the project should also consider to have APIs to connect with existing system to fetch the information and results using automation.\r\n\r\nHaving said that even if the given idea is deployed it would be beneficial to the community as it is currently difficult to get all this information specially for advisors who haven't worked in past fundings. This initiative can be a testing grounds for future robust and wider system.\r\n\r\nFew other things that worries me are :\r\n* Will this platform require funding during every funding cycle or is there a way to make this system self-sustaining?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, automation and larger community involvement would be required to make such systems more sustainable and useful.\r\n\r\nI would like to see plan for growth and involvement of wider community to build much more useful system.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal, while promising and important for the future of Catalyst, doesn't address the challenge.
