By visualizing the wall of text that ideascale currently is, you've engaged an entirely new group of individuals and increase the robustness of decision making. The proposal also has potential to bring in new contributors to the catalyst.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think that this is a valuable contribution to the Challenge and can have an immediate effect in the following two rounds.

", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the challenge in a relevant way. The level of complexity of Catalyst is an obstacle for people to be able to make decisions, since knowledge-based decisions in many cases involve reading a lot of information, having infographics would allow the community decision-making process to take a different and lesser time consuming approach.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The information provided by community clearly defines the roles and info required for CA's and other required details are mentioned well in the video sessions, infographics can just be an addition  to existing but can't be inplace of something to save time", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "simplicity of this proposal makes it really attractive and effective for the challenge.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "Both team members of the proposal show relevant experience in the area of art and design.
