The mockup and plan show how deep this idea is already developed. The budgeting is very clear and understandable. I am a little worried that the budget is set to low. The proposer states that she(?) has rudimentary coding experience and therefore she(?) relies on other developers. Talking here about a successfully implementation, the fact of low development experience in combination with the low budget, I have little doubts that there will be a successful implementation within this funding period. If this proposal does not get funded, I advise to work more on this part and maybe have already found a development team with a clear budgeting. Then I am sure, there will be successful funding in the next round!", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The idea is really good, however at this point and doing academic research on a close topic (semantic web), analysing language and the intricacies of our semantic is far from achieved. It is already quite hard to identify a litteral meaning in \"computer-thinking\". So far that's as far as computer science goes :(. The problem is that in a debate we use figures of speech, metaphorical meaning, irony and so on.... Computers, are as of today, incapable of recognizing such word play.  To my knowledges if you want to implement such a mechanism, you should dwelve on GPT-3 algorithm (it's to my best of understing the further we've come so far - or another Web Giant algorithm, i.e. Amazon or Google are your safest bets or IBM).
