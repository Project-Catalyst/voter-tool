This could also make the internal process smoother and to highlight what is important. The challenge is to make this one the only landing page: at some point decisions need to be taken as a community, not to scatter the info in too many places. Is there a way to pull in content from other sources (e.g. http://adapulse.io/) or could you find ways to collaborate / merge some of this early stage development work?", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal solves the challenge by enabling people who want to dive into Catalyst by showing where to find the information about Catalyst.\r\nThe bounty system allows this to be a project from the community for the community.\r\nThe use of github issue and pull request capabilities gives this rock solid chances to scale.\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This project directly tackles the challenge of encouraging more meaningful participation by gathering disparate resources under a distribution layer which is curated by the community.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the challenge directly and objectively.

There should also include a Q&A for the most frequently asked questions found in the community then access for Advisors could have all the town hall videos uploaded as they happen throughout each term.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Never could this proposal's impact could have been more obvious than now. As  a first-time CA, I can attest to the scattered bits of critical info in so many multiple channels; telegram, discord, IdeaScale, email, twitter, etc. Don;t get me wrong, I've somehow managed to get to the info either by reading comms, guided by admins/my peers or by sheer brilliance (insert fluke). Such a Landing page with pooled relevant information could only add value to Project Catalyst making it more efficient and productive. This proposal solution is of tremendous value to everyone involved and even the odd user who may have missed submitting a proposal or failed to meet voting requirements. A one-stop shop will speed up every aspect of the process.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "Yes, no questions asked. The team seems dedicated and skillful. The plan is well thought out.

That they have also been involved with catalyst ias community members provides relevant experience.Self-interest is a great motivator as CH said once, and I'm sure the team have clearly seen where their participation can improve greatly. The proposal has itemised each step of the dev path and have clearly indicated the distribution of the requested funds. The fact the dev will also be available and viewable in GitHub with welcome participation and comments would only further improve the vision. I like that the target release is for Fund 5.
