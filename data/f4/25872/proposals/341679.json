", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal presented addresses the challenge, but there are not enough details about how the project will propose value onboarding. The Catalyst project has numerous aspects and complexity, when it comes to value onboarding it is necessary to think about the different parties involved (voters, proposer and community advisors) and how the onboard will be carried out efficiently. I recommend that the planning be more detailed and that the proposers participate in the discussions in the Catalyst group on Discord, as discussions on value onboarding are already taking place there.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal focuses on lowering the friction of the on-boarding process for catalyst community members.

The key aspect of this challenge is VALUE, that is, providing not only a channel to attract large numbers of users, but on how to do the onboard, how to direct them to various types of information related to Catalyst.
