While this may spike interest and drive competition among members, this can create further divide by giving high leverage to early adopters thus driving away newcomers. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the significant need to tangibly recognize Catalyst proposers regardless of the outcome of the voting and to encourage ongoing participation that strengths the Catalyst community as a movement. It appears to solely focus upon proposers, rather than the whole Catalyst community, but that limitation could be remedied by a minor modification of the approach.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "There are multiple proposals in this challenge that address pertty much the same issue. But to be fair, a proposer is asking for external funding for a project. So if the community decides not to fund it, the proposer shouldn't be asking for compensation.\r\nI agree that there should be an incentive to encourgae proposers to sit out the process, but it shouldn't be monetary. It should be in the form of proper advice so that the proposer can adjust for a following fund, as it is now.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am asking myself why you went for the Canadian medals. By doing this, you limit yourself to one country and Cardano is a global foundation. I also don't think it is a good idea to buy off rejected proposers to make room for new ones. This would create a negative cycle.

Benchmark existing reputation systems in various online communities and social media. Then, check what are the capabilities in Ideascale (if this is a platform we are going to use from now to eternity). Could e.g. the Kudos points be tokenized easily? How about the existing processes (e.g. submission, commenting, review etc), could these be gamified and incentivized?", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has significant online business and brand building experience but will rely on outside developers and partners for the technical tasks. The proposal includes funding for trademarks, but it is not clear what risk this mitigates since trademarks have limited reach on the global scale of blockchain projects. i.e., Canada's legal authority won't protect the project from copy cats  outside of Canada.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has experience in E-marketing space, but does not specify how their skill set will aid them in completion of this project. They also mention that they were inspired by a similar proposal but do not mention whether they will collaborate or continue on independently. It appears the proposer is full time employed with multiple side projects on the go, meaning they will be distracted by other undertakings while working on this project. Given the amount requested, it is unlikely this proposal will receive voters support.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan may be too ambitious to implement for use in the next two funds, which is a requirement of this challenge, but the proposer appears to have the expertise to implement the idea rapidly, and many of the non-technical aspects have been well defined and presented. The technical aspects of issuing the proposed tokens and creating a redemption mechanism are relatively straightforward. The envisioned decoupling of ADA from fiat is likely not practical in this timeframe, however. The proposal would benefit from more detail regarding merit criteria for the three levels that it envisions. It also does not quantify metrics for likely impact in terms of new participation in Catalyst.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "I do not think that the community would like to invest funds to compensate proposers that they've rejected funding to.

However, there are some critical errors in it:\r\nIn the comments, the author states that he has requested the wrong amount of funding. Which should have been 17000 USD instead of 34000 USD.
