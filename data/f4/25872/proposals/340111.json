There are no barriers to submitting proposals in Catalyst, this means that anyone can create a proposal, encouraging rewards for any proposal that reaches the end is to encourage spam proposals to win the system, it makes no sense.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I believe that this proposal has been submitted in the wrong place, as it is requesting only 1 dollar and to modify the Catalyst remuneration model I think it is important that there is a consensus.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The Idea addresses the challenge, the proposal needs fleshed out.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Incentive for participation in project catalyst is provided through the proposal process already, where a successful proposer is rewarded with the funds requested from the Cardano Treasury.\r\n\r\nBy creating additional incentive we run the risk of lowering the overall quality of the proposals and flooding Project Catalyst advisers with proposals that are potentially only seeking the reward for submitting a proposal, with not much effort in successfully executing on the proposal.\r\n\r\nThis would be potentially very damaging to Community Advisers ability to separate the quality proposals from low quality submissions only looking for compensation.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "As a proposer, you are asking for your project to get funded from an external source, being the Cardano treasury. If your proposal doesn't pass the vote, that just means that you didn't get funded (well for the current round at least).\r\nSo I don't see why this should earn you a reward.\r\n\r\nOn the positive aspect of this proposal, I agree that there should be an incentive to see the phases through.
