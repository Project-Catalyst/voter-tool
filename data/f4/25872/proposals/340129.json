The proposal doesn't clearly demonstrate its approach to carrying out value onboarding.\r\n\r\nThere are some questions that are unanswered:\r\n\r\nWhat is this membership scheme? A group in social media?\r\n\r\nWill this be done remotely or in person? If the idea is to create engagement by social media why limit it to Africa?", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer aims to create a membership scheme in order to promote onboarding of new community members in West African region. It is unclear how this membership structure will work in favor of new members. Education and engagement can be achieved via other means. Striving for membership like structure will create a pyramid like vibe, which would be detrimental to the imagine of WADA and Catalyst.

I believe they have the skills to inform and educate new members about Catalyst, as WADA is already doing this. The presented plan is confusing. I believe it is important to have more clarity in the description of what the membership model is and its relevance in the proposal, moreover it is not clear how the proposers will approach new people for Catalyst , there is a mention of meetups, but as the proposal is about attracting new people I think it is important to describe how this will be done in details.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer is heavily involved in project Catalyst and has multiple proposals submitted.
