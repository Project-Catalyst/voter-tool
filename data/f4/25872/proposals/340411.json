This issue can be tackled by getting to know the team behind a proposal in person. This helps to close the gap between proposer and voters. Interviews with the teams behind a proposal help to build trust within the community and project catalyst.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the challenge directly and objectively. Podcasts are a more digestible model of submitting proposals for many people and allow a different perspective of ideas, through this type of content we can increase the disclosure of Catalyst and proposals for more people.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the proposal also includes the creation of a website and articles so that the scope of the project is larger and has different formats", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer aims to create interview series about people behind Catalyst in order to familiarize community with its developers, entrepreneurs. This will encourage community participation as this will give people information required to chose a project they wish to support. Can also add on AMA at the end of the interview.

He already runs a youtube channel and he already did a few interviews. This shows there's already a bit of experience and the proposer knows what he's doing as well as he's already committed to the project.\r\n\r\nIt could be possible that running these podcasts could take a little bit more time than anticipated as conducting interviews takes a lot of time.\r\n\r\nThe budget seems fair and 25 dollars an hour is an appropriate salary.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The Proposer has already implemented the proposal in a way, through its YouTube channel (Cardano Podcast) is possible to see several interviews regarding Catalyst proposals which indicates great chances of success in the implementation of the proposal.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "It appears the proposer already has started his podcast series with several interviews completed.

I see no real reasons the goals laid out here will not be achieved.

He could have described a little better how he is going to use his time and and for which task he needs how much time. Now it's a little hard to estimate if the 50 hours are enough to do 10 interviews in a month.\r\n\r\nThe same problem goes for the definition of succes. It's quite hard to calculate that.
