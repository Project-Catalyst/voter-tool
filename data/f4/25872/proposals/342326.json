For a fully decentralized governance I do think all of ideas should be exhibited, highly discussed and defined by the proposer, experts, advisor and the community. And funding is done both by the project treasury and those who find value in the project as a form of crowdsourcing. At the end of the day it works in the community best interest that projects developed/launched at Cardano are properly executed and that the results improve the community at large. Value can be possibly created on more specialized challenges in the the top-down level. Where ideas come from a more detailed challenge for each fund cycle that focuses on X goal rather than generalized focus. These focuses on value could be created using this proposal's format.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "it's not clear what's being proposed at all", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal describes setups that might be profiting to find a meaningful outcome. This sounds like an interesting approach in addition to the currently used catalyst process. But there are many things left undescribed. How are the topics of these challenges choosen. Will there be a platform for the implementation of this idea. Because of the many things that are unclear, I have my doubts regarding the effectivness to address the challenge.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer is suggestion to implement findings and mechanics of DARPA's Red Balloon Challenge in order to reorganize and restructure Catalyst community into groups.

But I am approaching this with the open mind of an ignorant voter who might see this proposal in Catalyst who is seeking my vote. To me this proposal is almost existential in its presentation of the challenge and of the solution. I failed to make a connection between the DARPA red balloon and the Catalyst Value Onboarding. Its assignation of 'value' and in the same breadth question its meaning somewhat contradicts the solution before it even begins. I guess I am justifying my score by stating I was lost in absorbing the solution and making the connection to improving Catalyst value. If I am penalised for that, so be it.
