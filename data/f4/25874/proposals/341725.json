One of Cardano's main objectives is to be a protocol used by hundreds of millions of people and this will inevitably require a lot of information in several languages. There is a huge demand for this, including in Catalyst itself, because currently the vast majority of content related to Catalyst is in English and if we want to guarantee fair and considerable participation we need to propose solutions for translation.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "To reach the whole world, multi-lingual approach is a must. However, as mentioned in the comments, what should be translated is the first question to be answered.\r\n\r\nI don't see the \"broadness\" as an issue. After all, this is a Challenge, not a solution.\r\n\r\nOne approach would be to only translate what goes on the landing page: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Project-Catalyst-Landing-Page/341718-48088\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to \"organize globally\" so that the local / regional / continental groups can deal in their own language(s) but the global collaboration still takes place in English, with representatives of the aforementioned groups functioning as \"messengers between languages\".", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "Making sure internationalization is top of mind across a growing is ultimately a requirement if we plan on becoming the de-facto world banking system.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "The challenge aims to accelerate the adoption of Cardano worldwide.
