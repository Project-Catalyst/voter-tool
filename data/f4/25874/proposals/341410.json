If we focus on outlining and drafting systems for emerging country governments and indigenous or similar communities, we can be more successful.

Therefore my No. Please join forces and partner up.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 5, "note": "A detail of the requested funding would help to understand the amount asked better.
