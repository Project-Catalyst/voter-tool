We are currently using the average assessments scores for each challenge as feedback to understand whether the proposals of each challenge are strong or not.\r\n\r\nAs long as we do not have appropriate feedback on the scores for each challenge, I think it is premature to propose a unique challenge by Fund. In addition, a single challenge would limit the funding possibilities for the community too much and I do not see this in a positive way for Cardano's ecosystem. A challenge cannot be too broad or too specific, so restricting a Fund to a single challenge would greatly limit the scope of funding.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that data be obtained to support the proposal.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 4, "note": "Rather than a challenge, you are outlining a solution. \"How might we increase the quality of proposals?\" would be an example of a challenge.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 4, "note": "It appears to me that the idea of focussing on just one challenge is counterproductive to the vision of Cardano.\r\nI do understand that 6 different challenges (as is the case now) can be a bit overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, this is being done to attempt to create order as the number of proposals is expected to rise significantly and to enable a multilateral workflow. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 4, "note": "The idea highlights a good point to make it easier to narrow down the focus to a big challenge for the community that intensifies the focus to an overarching point of interest with each fund. I think Charles has highlighted that the focus on this fund was to deploy new dapps idea and that its why it has more focus this round. you are onto something good with this idea,  the top-down process could be created by community advisors from both community and the veterans of IOG. Perhaps a focus from the VCAs then challenge ideas from CAs and then it boils down to proposers to follow the challenge in their focus for a fund cycle. The other areas could still be open for ideas to previpitate and be polished through community input with a minor reward to contributors to incentivize it, perhaps like 10 adas per contribution.
