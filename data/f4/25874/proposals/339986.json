Even though I fully support the idea, I see that this is estimated for USD 400.000, the entire funding for this campaign. This is very problematic.

There are almost certainly many, many more ways that we the Cardano ecosystem could benefit from additional bridges and interoperability with Ethereum. A huge amount of the expertise in Blockchain is working in the Ethereum ecosystem. So bridges and collaborations between chains would be beneficial to both.\r\n2) Is this addressing a \"green pasture\" opportunity that could improve the well-being across a major region or globally?\r\n\r\nAt this point in time I would also say that there are only a few truly compelling use cases in the Ethereum ecosystem. It is true that it is a new financial system, but to date it is mainly a speculative one for trading money and focusing on short term gains. The real value is in delivering high fidelity systems that translate well across the world and bring in people and resources that are currently ignored, devalued or inaccessible to the current financial system. Right now Ethereum is mainly useful as a new form of trading for fintech bros, macro wonks and gold bugs. So the main benefit would be by attracting developers. Useful, but as in the island, pond and ocean analogy there probably is actually a lot more talent and expertise elsewhere.\r\n\r\n3) How much will the requested funds catalyze this effort and produce a meaningful result over the next few years?\r\n\r\nThe amount of funds requested are the entire community challenge amount. This should be significant enough to really foster interest, buzz and community support around the effort. I personally don't like that the whole fund is being requested, but to stay faithful to my assessment it actually would be a huge statement about how serious Cardano is to bridging to Ethereum.

Very similar to porting IOS games over to Android. With the tools that IOG is providing to help bridge the gap, there is already a foundation to build on and probably a lot of benefit to providing people an easy way to try out the Cardano blockchain for work they have already done in Ethereum.\r\n\r\n2) Circle of competence: is there enough competence and passion in the ecosystem so proposals will have great leadership and synergy between team, partners and/or community?\r\n\r\nThis one is hard to assess. Right now, the blockchain community is very tribal and dominated by maximalism. I think this is changing, but it is very possible that the Ethereum community has a lot of entrenched loyalists so could be hard to establish bridges. That said, there is also a tremendous amount of entrepreneurial energy in blockchain which means people will want to roll with the latest and greatest tech (which Cardano is, right!?). So creating support and focus on inviting those entrepeneurs to bridge to Cardano could have a very large upside.\r\n\r\n3) Accelerators: Are there clear network effects or other advantages that will drive success?\r\n\r\nYes. Ethereum is the largest blockchain, smart contract development ecosystem right now.
