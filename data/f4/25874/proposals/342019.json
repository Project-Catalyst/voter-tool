It brings the idea of decentralisation one step further.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "An interesting concept for sure. I like the idea of these more automated stake pool operators where the decisions are not completely up to them, I think at that point they basically become providers of computing/networking resources. It could simplify the process and provide a lot of benefits to the ecosystem", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "I find the need to change how a stake pool operates a bit ambitious. I'm sure the governance system that was drawn out by the creators of these stake pools understood why these stake pool operators have people's stake in their care. They'd want to maintain their reputation of operating fairly and diligently. This ensures the trustless system continues. Besides, it's too much time to spend on the activities of a stake pool. It should be as mindless and less time consuming as possible.\r\n\r\nI'd advice you look at the idea again and think of how to refine it for the better. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "It is a great idea, It creates governance within governance but I can see the opposite effect that could lead to the detriment of the pool itself. If there is malice it can also become a tool that can hurt the network. Not saying that it would happen but when we talk about humans banding together for whatever reason the possibilities exist. This can also impact on identity issues and the failure of one to affect others. I can see the immense benefits but also the detriments in this idea.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "Interesting proposal, but not aligned with the challenge set for fund 6.\r\nThis is not a critical priority as it does not solve a problem. Instead it proposes an improvement on the current system.\r\nConsider filing this proposal in 'Developer ecosystem' to improve the chances of adoption.\r\nThe concept is realistic for a portion of stake pools, not all. It should be up to them to implement a DAO if it is their wish to do so. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 4, "note": "Good idea, but probably to specific to set as a whole challenge for Fund 6", "rating": 2}, {"question": 4, "note": "This is addressing an important topic. Right now we need to get Cardano as a whole from 'benevolent dictatorship by IOG' (I mean this very friendly and positive) to full decentralization and community control. There are still a lot of challenges on that road. I support this idea, but I would go for this much later. There are also clear advantages of running stake-pools as small private enterprises. This simplifies the otherwise complex topic of how to deal with the pledge and with liabilities in case of any kind of 'incidents'. I suggest to invest the USD 200.000 otherwise right now.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "I think this is a very good proposal for improving upon the intended decentralization of the network. I gave it 4 stars because at the current point in our timeline I would not fully say it is \"critical\", there are some things that are certainly higher priority, but as far as long term goals go this is an excellent proposition to further Cardano's mission and has a number of potential side benefits for SPOs and delegates alike.\r\n\r\nIf demonstratively effective, secure dapp contracts and DEX projects were completed at this time, I would have given this 5 stars.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 5, "note": "The block diagram is really self explaining.

Is there one? more information would be needed on how this will be accomplished and by who.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 5, "note": "I don't think it's possible to implement this project with the current state of adoption.

I also envision a base of support within the community for something like this.\r\n\r\nMore elaboration about the requested funding amount would be welcome. Why does it cost 200000 USD and what is it going to be used on exactly? ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 5, "note": "I think that our possible Governance Symposium or similar activities (see Greg Plendleburry's Proposal during Fund 3 for Fund 5) should primarily focus on getting the basics settled. First of all, we as community need to mature to take over the actual control from IOG. Hand in hand with this, important legal necessities together with the foundation need to be clarified. Stake-pools run as DAO is a very interesting additional option, but for me a clear next step further out in the future. We need to learn crawling before running.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 5, "note": "I think in time systems like the proposal discusses could be well within the capability of the community to implement.

I don't think this would be accomplished at once, however, so I think defining more milestones would be appropriate in this process. I imagine it being a gradual process similar to the approach IOG took to decentralize the system by allowing SPO to mint blocks", "rating": 3}, {"question": 6, "note": "If this project is implemented, it would be easy for us to see how far it has gone by looking at the stake pools that implement this form of governance.
