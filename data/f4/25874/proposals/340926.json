The challenge is important to the community but also the institutions, markets and individuals who are part of this ecosystem.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "It is paramount that security is implemented early in any system for a number of reasons. The earlier it is implemented, the sooner the system is protected.\r\nWith early implementation, it can also be modified and improved earlier along the way, adding value to system robustness.

As a multi-billion dollar worth system, we do need a proper risk assessment and risk management setup - just like any other careful 'traditional economy company' has this in place nowadays. This can cover technical aspects, CyberSecurity, as well as economic and social vulnerabilities. The proposed USD 50.000 look reasonable to me for getting this started. This could emerge to become a dedicated branch of our emerging governance system (just as e.g. marketing could  be handled in a dedicated branch or expert working group).", "rating": 5}, {"question": 5, "note": "I don't see any technical difficulties that compromise the viability of the challenge, but I believe that the nature of the challenge involves more conceptual proposals / research and this restricts the workforce that could contribute to the creation of proposals.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 5, "note": "Some form of this may already be put in place to ensure the safety of the system technologically but perhaps not in a way that it can interact with day to day influences of the world directly or indirectly.

It's very feasible because who doesn't want security for the system?\r\n\r\nThe proposition for an option to take collective affirmative action to fend off a threat fits in Voltaire ideology and could therefore be easily adopted by the community.

This would fit nicely to the carefulness that Cardano has demonstrated so far - an important prerequisite for onboarding large companies, governmental partners and major investors. An important ingredient for earning TRUST.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 6, "note": "I think that the identification of risks would already be an important element in itself, but without a context of time for the identification of these risks, the definition of success becomes unclear.
