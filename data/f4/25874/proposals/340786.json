Currently there are materials to help new enthusiasts build a pool, but I believe there is room for improvement.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "The challenge is an critical importance as pool operators are the backbone of the whole system. Education is deffinitly of great priority as well as to increase diversity of the stakeholders in the project. At the time being the information available is limitied and need clear pathway to establishing such resource. The idea has great purpose and potential.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 4, "note": "Although there are sufficient pools for the moment as is, it is not a bad idea to teach these skills to people for when more are needed to uphold this level of decentralisation. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "they are already much pools running and too much with 0 block produced do the math 41 000 (millions total ada) divided by 63 (the full capacity of a node) that gives a total of 650 nodes\r\n\r\neven if we multiply that by 4 that gives use  2600 nodes we already are not very far from this number , adding more empty nodes is useless IMHO.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 4, "note": "I do not think this warrants the category of challenge, it should be a single proposal that would foster terrific support.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 4, "note": "Yes, there is a need for creating 'How to set up a stakepool' courses. BUT: This is more a proposal (not sure where it fits best) rather than a real Challenge Setting for Fund 6. You could have formulated this more open: How to design and deploy new business/income-opportunities within the Cardano community? Good idea, but again: Try to place it in another campaign or make it more general.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 5, "note": "The proposed challenge is feasible, since Cardano already has hundreds of SPOs who can contribute with proposals for this challenge. There are no significant technical difficulties, only the need to create proposals that seek to educate and inform with knowledge already available.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 5, "note": "The Cardano community is full of operators and developers that could assist in the process and bring on board a diverse number as the network grows.

The requested funds is very reasonable for this proposal. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 5, "note": "Yes, members of this community would exceed expectations, were this a proposal. If it is a challenge, all proposals under it would have the same goal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 5, "note": "The rich capabilities within then Cardano community would definitely provide the capacity to address this - and many more similar ideas.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 6, "note": "The definition of success described is uncertain, I think it could be better described to present the idea of the challenge. The key parameters presented can measure success reasonably, but I think it is important to include a time window to assess the impact of this challenge and more metrics, such as the number of course participants and the number of course participants who have become SPOs.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 6, "note": "I agree with the starting points as to the metrics to assess such goals. The feasability can provide verifiability in the process as the workings of the community backbone can bring a plethora of ideas to build on such solution. Its a good idea, perhaps expand more on the best way of executing learning modules, what type of platforms could be explored and language barriers explored to strenghten the effect of reach as a world focused strength in decentralization. Good luck is a nice one!", "rating": 1}, {"question": 6, "note": "Well defined metrics and challenges. There is a semi-roadmap in place.\r\nThe definition of success should be rephrased.
