By mentioning a 'pyramid structure', users link this terminology to a Ponzi scheme and that is not a good connotation.\r\nA pyramid structure also means that at some point in time, you will run out of new members and that could endanger the entire ecosystem.

I suppose that you want to say: How to bring totally new people to the Cardano ecosystem ? You are already outlining a (rather problematic) solution for this challenge.

No pyramid schemes or ponzi schemes or whatever shady buisness.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 5, "note": "There is not enough information to judge the feasibility of this proposal.

", "rating": 5}, {"question": 5, "note": "pyramid schemes or multilevel marketing are considered illegal. we should be very careful when dealing with this kind of strategies. I understand the benefit of having as much adoption has we can but we should convince the users to adopt and use daily the cardano network based on unique characteristics and benefits that can bring to the users. we must educate and demonstrate through social media platforms and reviews how easy and safe is to use this platform and make a network effect just like bitcoin has. We need tools in cardano network to solve and facilitate real world use cases. I think it will be ok if those tools can have some kind of referral system.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 5, "note": "It has the potential to promote rewards on ways of improving the system in place.
