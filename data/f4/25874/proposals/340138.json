There are some other considerations needed like how this proposal affects their security and the access to these platforms. Mobile phone is clear point but if a phone is stolen, hacked or lost how can that affect the user.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "Micro loans and DeFi are niches aligned with Cardano's mission, but technically I see no sense in limiting the scope of the challenge for Africa. The needs for financial services in Africa are largely due to the large number of unbanked and exploratory lines of credit. DeFi solutions for this type of problem require dapps and undercolateralized loans and to obtain these types of loans, decentralized credit score projects are required. The point is that the solutions to this problem are not geographically restricted, so limiting the scope of the idea to the African continent doesn't make sense. DeFi has no geographical boundaries. What prevents the use of DeFi for unbanked people and people with less purchasing power is the lack of undercolateralized loans and this will only happen with credit scores and preferably with the help of DIDs.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "There is a high demand for microlending solutions on the African continent.\r\nIt would significantly improve users' chances of becoming economically independent.\r\nThe potential impact of this is extremely large for both users and the community, who would be enabled to create these DeFi and microlending solutions.

This is a huge area of opportunity and is a unique focus that would set Cardano apart.\r\n\r\n2) Is this addressing a \"green pasture\" opportunity that could improve the well-being across a major region or globally?\r\n\r\nYES! See previous comment.\r\n\r\n3) How much will the requested funds catalyze this effort and produce a meaningful result over the next few years?\r\n\r\nThe funds requested are modest. It would be a good place to start as a \"seed round\" to see what kind of projects come as a result.

I think this project can be feasible.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 5, "note": "I don't believe in the feasibility of the challenge at the moment, because in order for Cardano to have DeFi dapps that can provide undercolateralized loans, profile assessment / credit scores projects are necessary. In addition, in order to have functional dapps, some basic blocks in DeFi still need to be created, such as oracles. Liqwid itself is a possible solution to this problem, but it is still in development and it should still take a few months for its first version to be ready. So, for this challenge to be feasible, we need Goguen's delivery, money market dapps operating (Liqwid for example), functional oracles and credit score projects. It may be that these projects exist during the implementation of the proposals arising from this challenge, but it is an uncertainty that compromises the viability of the challenge.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 5, "note": "As you have relevant experience and a team already in place, I see no issues with the feasibility that this proposed project would be implemented.

However, a much more difficult legal aspect of the idea has not been mentioned in the proposal. As loans must be repaid, there needs to exist a way of carrying it out within the local legal framework. To put it simply, the repayment obligation must be enforceable. This is well beyond the scope mentioned in the proposal.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 5, "note": "I think that it will be very important to bring the right people together during such a Challenge Setting. Before creating any kind of dApps, I would expect a short-, mid- and long-term Masterplan as goal for this activity. Otherwise we might just jump on creating some kind of applications, which do not meet the complex technical economic, political and social requirements. I think that the involved proponents of this idea are well aware of that, therefore my Yes.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 5, "note": "My framework for this assessment for how suitable this challenge is as follows:\r\n1) Product-market fit: is this a wicked problem that is has a lot of demand, is uniquely suited to Cardano or if done successfully will really set Cardano apart?\r\n\r\nAs stated before there is tremendous synergy between the technology that Cardano provides, the existing mobile banking infrastructure, and the work that IOG is doing in various countries. This is a great area of opportunity that intersects in multiple areas to achieve Cardano's vision to bring more and more\r\n2) Circle of competence: is there enough competence and passion in the ecosystem so proposals will have great leadership and synergy between team, partners and/or community?\r\n\r\nYes, Cardano is already attracting talent, building capacity and collaborating with various communities in Africa. This is at the heart of what Cardano is aiming to achieve and is a great community focus.\r\n\r\n3) Accelerators: Are there clear network effects or other advantages that will drive success?\r\n\r\nThere might be some headwinds as right now the Africa focused initiatives keep getting passed over for more global solutions.

The metric for launching 3 projects in the next 3 fundind rounds seems to be unrealistic, because if the challenge is accepted, it will only enter the second funding round and would have only 6 weeks to be delivered, remembering that there are several obstacles to the implementation of micro lendind in DeFi and these obstacles can delay those proposals.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 6, "note": "I'd like to see an adapted roadmap for this.\r\nOther than that, the proposal was well substantiated and the requested funds is reasonable for a project of this magnitude.

Rather than setting limits (like the 50% user adoption), I would prefer to see metrics that focus more on transformative results (like # of users adopted, # of users that have financial access where they previously did not have access (first loan, first investment, first savings account)\r\n\r\n3) Are the requested treasury funds well matched to support multiple game-changing proposals within the scope of the challenge?\r\n\r\nYes.
