A hub is a form of centralization and generally requires coordinated architecture.\r\n\r\n2) Is this addressing a \"green pasture\" opportunity that could improve the well-being across a major region or globally?\r\n\r\nI think it is important to provide high quality, accessible resources to communicate the work and value of Cardano. However, this challenge seems a little fragmented so it may be difficult to inspire coordinated, synergistic projects.\r\n\r\n3) How much will the requested funds catalyze this effort and produce a meaningful result over the next few years?\r\n\r\nFor the target number of proposals (10), the funds requested seem very low.

I think multi-language could be valuable, but there is already another challenge specifically focused in that area.\r\n\r\n2) Circle of competence: is there enough competence and passion in the ecosystem so proposals will have great leadership and synergy between team, partners and/or community?\r\n\r\nWe have great communicators in the Cardano community.
