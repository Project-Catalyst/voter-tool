Education is key as well as deployment of new Dapps that draw a generation into it and slowly these Dapps expand into mainstream applications that draw mass adoption. Marketing through Dapps developments and education on how to interface with them is an interesting prospect.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "I believe that the promotion of Cardano is something important, because for Cardano to achieve its mission of being a global financial system and onboarding hundreds of millions of people we need to spread the word, but I do not think that the approach of taking advantage of the hype of bull market is aligned with Cardano's mission, in addition the proposer associated the marketing campaign with the launch of Goguen (the Goguen launch forecast predates the implementation of possible proposals resulting from this challenge) and listing on Coinbase (which has already happened on moment I write this assessment). I recommend that the proposal remove the association of the challenge with a bull market, as it is not possible to state that during the implementation of the proposals that may result from this challenge we will still be in a bull market and because associating marketing with speculation / euphoria is not well aligned with the Cardano's mission.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "It is important to spread informative awareness. Especially in this stage in development.\r\n\r\nI only have one improvement suggestion and that is to include the marketing goal in the title. What are we exactly going to market? ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 4, "note": "Well, MARKETING, this is a very general title. Successful marketing of rather complex technological products and services is a complex beast. Spending a lot of money is no guarantee for any success. Yes, marketing, advertising, opinion leaders, celebrities, all this is somehow important. BUT: Key is the underlaying \u201asomething', which needs to be touching real needs, desires and dreams. This is more about simple, self-explaining value propositions, culture, community and purpose. This needs to be authentic and cannot really be 'produced'. Not even with many millions and not with your estimated USD 400.000 (which would consume the entire funding of this campaign). Sorry for lecturing a bit, but I have quite some experience in this field. I agree, this could be a feasible Challenge Setting, but also have my strong doubts that this can easily go in wrong directions.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 4, "note": "I think that having a dedicated category for marketing is a good idea. The timing of this works well for people to start working on how to best tell the story of Cardano's mission once the smart contracts are live.

This is important for growing our unique and authentic reputation. Experience shows, that sustainable reputation needs to be earned in a humble way, marketing/advertising can only be important accompanying factors. There are also other proposals posting similar Challenge Settings. We need to make sure that this leads to joining forces.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 5, "note": "While I am aware that marketing can be very expensive depending on the media outlet, I am not convinced that we currently have the capacity to fully fill up the entire challenge budget, with high quality proposals, to fully make use of all of it. We also do not know how the future will play out with any \"parabolic bull runs\" and when any such would end, so I think references to such are unnecessary in the challenge brief. It's better to focus on how much of Cardano's functionality are live and when, and create marketing material in tandem with the increased usability, rather than feeding into any fear of missing out.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 5, "note": "The community is already providing the best marketing available, passionate, smart, big-hearted people trying to change the world. The minute we start pursuing empty hype and shiny marketing efforts you start to erode trust. Cardano's main purpose is to build and inspire trust. Focusing so much on Marketing is not just a waste of money, it is a massive risk of backfiring and causing negative effects.

I recommend including more efficient metrics.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 6, "note": "The metrics are clearly set.\r\n\r\n'A >10% increase in rate of new wallets created' should be refrased.

This goes way, way beyond the USD 400.000 of funding  you are estimating. I suggest that we first make sure that we have easy to understand value-stories for 'normal folks', before we think about nations-wide advertising campaigns. Charles on Joe Rogan, yes, absolutely. Other than that, measuring ROI of marketing spendings will require more careful work before investing multiple millions. By the way, I haven't seen any GOOGLE ads in 1999/2000.
