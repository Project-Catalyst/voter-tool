This could take a bit longer, but would be a lot more durable and it would greatly increase the impact.

Regarding documents, I think the idea needs to be more detailed, there is no clear and significant difference that shows that celebrities need additional documentation in relation to ordinary users.\r\n\r\nI can understand that a marketing campaign can be effective in this case, but not tools and documentation.
