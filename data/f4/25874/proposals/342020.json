This raises some doubts about the impact of the challenge, as the scenario in so many months is uncertain.\r\n\r\nI believe that Cardano will be a good option to be used as a supply chain structure in distribution networks for medicines, vaccines, but I am not sure about the impact of this in relation to COVID, due to the uncertain time horizon of the duration of this crisis.

The mere mention of Cardano's decentralised nature and the obvious problem of the global pandemic, be it covid or whatever else, is insufficient.
