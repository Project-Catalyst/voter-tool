What information do we have to confirm that the ban was caused by this reason? We know that the cryptocurrency-related \"bans\" that took place in Nigeria were influenced by the government's monetary policy, as this was made public weeks ago. If a government's interest is to ban cryptocurrencies to preserve the country's financial system and prevent capital flight, the approach to reversing the ban is not as simple as demystifying scratches in the image of cryptos due to scams, the challenge would be much greater and would involve political interests.\r\n\r\nI am raising this topic because the proposal's problem statement is subjective and doesn't make it clear what the scenario is in Congo, regardless of the reasons that are causing this crackdown, I think it is important that the idea be taken forward, because the proposal to educate people is the focus.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal adresses the challenge effectively by creating a local office for meet ups in Congo.
