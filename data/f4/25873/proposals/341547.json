Some mechanics are not fully explained, but I guess it would not fit the proposal text, but could be included as attachments. The problem statement could be modified to include \"voluntary\" some how as well. The roadmap includes some March 2021 bullets, which should have been finalized when the voting starts, this could should be edited.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is a fantastic proposal and one that can extend Cardano's long term vision of change in the world. I would definitely would engage on volunteerism if knew how to start and where to go. In society there should be a system in place to educate and empower individuals to promote and work on the changes needed to fill the gap in society. I would only add to this proposal more information as to examples of the projects taken under the management of this team efforts. Homeless work?, food/water? energy focus?  addiction focus? all of the above? what areas as well? multinational or specific region? ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal tries to create a social and technical solution for voluntary groups.

", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "I understand that the whole project will be very challenging and will need a large budget. Although, the required amount is the full value of the challenge, so I believe it will probably not be contemplated for that reason. I also see that the roadmap goes until June 2021.

What development collaborations are in the plan for its deployment? there is a small mention regarding the funds used for NFt and tokenization to that end under the plan but more clarity about that side of connecting the solution to the Cardano network and who would work on that end could brings more confidence to its successful deployment.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is an impressive team with technical, academic and business background.

Even though the idea of rewarding volunteer work with payment is contradicting, some other aspect of this proposal might have merit and just need real-world study in order to understand its position.
