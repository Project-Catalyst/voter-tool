However, the solution proposed: \"\u2026speed up the learning and adoption of Cardano by using existing universities labs, equipments and networks\" is not worked out at all.  The proposal has not changed since its first draft, no real action how to achieve or support this goal is described.

One problem that I see with it - preventing it from effectively addresses the challenge in current form - is that it seems like a general recipe, without a specific implementation plan in a specific community by by using specific existing university labs, equipment and networks.\r\n\r\nThe proposal should include a plan for action in a certain real environment, real physical location or candidate sites that could be approached for implementation. As its stands now, it is more of an idea - than an implementation proposal in my view.\r\n", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea presented addresses the challenge, since the idea would be that universities were the community centers that would allow leveraging the infrastructure and technology-prone students, but there is no solid plan on how to turn the idea into a real program.
