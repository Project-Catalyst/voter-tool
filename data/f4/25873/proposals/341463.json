It should be rather in the category dapps and integration for future funding rounds. Using resources in this domain for the proposal would be not be in line with the challenge.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal doesn't address the challenge, there is no relation of the idea presented with Community Centers.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "In principle is a great idea but the collaboration required, educational, technological and legacy system needed to launched this solution around the world would require 1. That the average person has Cardano wallet and know about the technology and its uses. 2. That the institutions are on board with this idea, 3. That there is promotion and education about this solution 4. The management and technology to measure KM you travel to be recorded to provide reward.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea is good and the stated problem is real. Although, I believe that anyone in a foreign country would currently have to buy their currency, this could be a good step into the cryptocurrency world, specially for the proposed feature of generating token based on KM. Although, tokenomics needs to be better explained. Also, I believe that LCC Challenge is not the best place for this proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal is rather a vague idea without a proper plan. Therefore it is rather unlikely it will be implemented successfully. A lot of questions arise regarding the implementation, such as: Who will be owning the transportation vehicles, are there potential partnerships, etc.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan  presents some relevant aspects of the proposal, but there is no clarification on regulation difficulties with local jurisdictions. In order for a public transport system to adopt cryptocurrencies, this would have to be accepted by local governments. There is the option of creating decentralized solutions such as Arcade City, a Uber competitor and who uses Blockchain to decentralize. There is no description of the experience or qualification of the proposer. I recommend the inclusion of such information.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no experience or planned highlighted to make a proper assessment that it can be successfully implemented.

There are no metrics to promote confidence in the delivery of the solution or what area will the funds will be used.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Roadmap, milestones, KPIs are missing. Proposal needs improvement on this fields because it is not possible to audit as it is.
