However, that is not the main issue that comes up with this proposal.\r\nThe segment \"Describe your solution to the problem\" in this proposal directly states: \"I propose that the Cardano Foundation match funding that LCCs generate/raise/earn. \"\r\nHowever, the campaign brief for F4: Local Community Centers sets out that the Contribution of the Cardano Foundation and team members includes:\r\nBusiness development & marketing expert, Legal expert, Technical integration expert, Communication & community expert\r\nThe proposed solution to the problem: \"I propose that the Cardano Foundation match funding that LCCs generate/raise/earn\" deals with how the Cardano Foundation should invest its funds. This seems to lie outside the scope of the brief.\r\nThe challenge specifies that proposals should address \"How can we mobilize the community to solve local problems using Cardano, through a Local Community Center model supported by the CF?\" This proposal's solution deals more with how the CF should mobilize its funds.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "If the challenge is to encourage local engagement, funds are required either for space, refreshments, material or other event related expenses. If CF were to fund-match, that would encourage growth.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem statement is not really a problem, it could be re-written in a clearer way. I found the proposal idea to be a bit confusing, since it seems to be a suggestion to Cardano Foundation, and it is not clear if it is related to the budget or not. If the idea is to use the required budget to match the raised value in local communities, it is very good, the but text could be rewritten to emphasize that. Also, a lot of the discussion seems not to be directly related to the proposal, but it would be good to be moved to Discord server to work it with others.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Nowhere in this proposal is it made clear where a local community center will be established. All this proposal asks is for matching funds.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer spends little time talking about the LCC they are setting up and most talking about CF's need to match them, strange.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Given the experience and the plan presented by the proposer it does not seem likely to me that this proposal will be implemented successfully. Effectively, the proposer states \"I propose that the Cardano Foundation match funding that LCCs generate/raise/earn\". As the proposer does not seem to be affiliated with the Cardano Foundation, to me it is unclear how this proposal will lead to a result in which the CF will \"match funding that LCCs generate/raise/earn\". It might be a noble idea if realized, but I am not clear on how can voters participating in Project Catalyst vote on funding allocations that are exclusively in the competence of a separate legal entity such as the CF.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal didn't necessarily need to address how individuals or local groups will go about raising their own funds within or without the Cardano community, but some parameters or suggestions would help here. i.e. if my friend gives me $500 via paypal, will CF match that? or does it need to be documented/submitted in certain ways?", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "This proposal is lacking a budget, detailed plan or any semblance of metrics to track implementation.

We have no information from the proposer about the inside budgeting operations of the CF and whether a simple vote on this proposal has any impact on the allocation of CF funds. With this lack of critical information it seems difficult to confirm its feasibility - apart from engaging in a bit of \"wishful thinking\" about the CFs reaction.\r\nAs regards the funding that is requested for this proposal (Requested funds in USD 30000), the proposers states \"Funds will go to the other proposals in this category.\" If funding is being directed to other proposals in this category, to me it is unclear why the proposer is requesting funding from Project Catalyst.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "A very simple premise that really needs no further explanation. If a basic framework can be provided for CF to \"say yes\" then I think it's a great use of treasury funds.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "Roadmap, milestones and KPIs are missing. The proposal as a whole could be rewritten so that the proposal is clearer and part of it could be further discussed in the Discord server. By making the proposal clearer, it would also be it possible to create relevant KPIs and other metrics.
