So the proposal (education about Cardano) is somehow part of this challenge. However, it would be more fitting, if the proposer would have designed his approach around a specific region. I guess the proposer is from LATAM? So why did he not suggest collaborating with specific universities or so in his area? Instead he is very vague and wants to educate around the world. Normally you start with an idea locally and when it is successful you can reach out to other destinations. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea of educating people in universities is good. Although, the approach could be assessed related to ROI. The requested budget is equal to 100% of the challenge budget, and it should be described in more details, as mentioned in the text. The renting idea could be a bit more explained as well. Also, for easier understanding, the text could be shortened. Think that voters will prefer to read something more direct and well structured.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is a bit difficult to assess this proposal because of its wordiness. It seems as a large idea draft that has strands pointing in many directions with some aspects thought out more, others still in deliberation. The proposal does propose to mobilize the community to solve local problems using Cardano, although specific universities in specific locations to be targeted are not identified. This is a weakness as it seems to be too general of a proposal that is not yet implementable. The proposal does not seem as if it is making a final decision whether to classify the \"renting out of multidisciplinary classes in Universities\"  as one of the different LCC categories:\r\n\r\nDevelopers center\r\nDeFi / DAO center\r\nBusiness center (solving a local problem)\r\n\r\nA problem might be that the lack of a dedicated LCC, but opting for \"renting out multidisciplinary classes\"  might not result in a longer term  LCCs, meaning that this renting out model might be ephemeral. Not enough specific detail and milestones and concrete plans for me to confirm if the proposal effectively addresses the challenge, despite the extensive text included in the proposal. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal described addresses the challenge, there is a detailed and complete rationale about the possibilities that the proposal can achieve, however the lack of definition of some aspects such as which university could allow a partnership, the number of students and people involved and the lack of someone with knowledge advanced in Haskell / Plutus leave doubts in the ability to address the challenge within the established roadmap effectively. Having someone with knowledge of Cardano and Cardano's native programming languages can help to put together a more structured program in the proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "As one of the comments mentions this project is a bit outside the scope of the challenge. However you have a nice proposal but you need to refine it and probably splits it in other at least two separate funds. The reason behind it is that you mention onboarding universities (or maybe other educational institutions ?) but as they are institutions they are slow to move. Thus you probably split your proposal into 2. One for the onboarding of the universities and the other one for all of the material/course creation and documentation needed. Moreover, maybe add a bit of formating to your proposal so that it is easier to digest.

The Proposer wanted to solve this by providing an additional graphic description (twice mentioned in the comments), which he has not done. Given these two facts alone, it is hard to imagine that there will be a successful implementation. The proposer claims that he has a lot of experience, but you don't find evidence for it (no links or references are provided). The funding should be used to rent classrooms for teachings. However, I thinks most universities that I know offer rooms for free when you collaborate with their programs/initiatives. In addition, a budget plan should contain more specific details, so that the community can assess if the money is invested well and if it realistic for the given budget to achieve the goals.

It seems to be still in conception and the proposer states:\r\n\r\n\"For the budget of this project, I really need help :). It depends on the university with which the agreement is made, the amount of people that could be covered by the program, and the defined retribution for the R+D Cells, the Guides and all the backend logistic that is needed to accomplish this..\"  These are all aspects that have not been decided upon - but must be already presented as part of a more serious proposal. They are lacking, as is a more detailed presentation of the proposers experience and team. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan described has several details, but it could be better structured due to the large amount of information. I recommend including KPIs and defining the budget. The proposer mentioned difficulty in establishing a budget, but it is one of the main aspects of the proposal, mainly due to the fact that the proposal is requesting all the available budget for the challenge. I recommend that the proposer provide a detailed budget (perhaps the best way is to address universities to obtain cost estimates).\r\n\r\nThe proposal mentions the need for training someone in Cardano's native programming languages to be the \"mentor\", this is a big problem, as learning Haskell / Plutus can take a relatively long time, which can make the proposal's roadmap unfeasible.

What i mean is that as an academic you know, at least partially, how acadmia works. Thus you have a facilitated access to some universities (if you are teaching) otherwise the one you went. However for the scope of this project, one of the first step would be to enlist a network of academics from different universities and countries  because i dont think that a project this size could be done by one human. Also maybe look at your university and try to enlist it.

As I said, there are more (good) ideas than a real executable plan.\r\nThe proposer tells a lot what could be done instead of providing a solid plan which could look like: I collaborate with university xy, I have/create this content (instead of just saying I will teach about this), etc.\r\nThe proposer says in his description that it is very important not only the talk about \"what could be done\" but also to say \"how it could be done\". But he misses exactly the same thing in his proposal. He asked the question (\"How?\") several times, but the answer was mostly about \"what\".\r\nSo I suggest that the proposer should further define a detailed and workable plan for future funding.\r\nThe proposer suggested some metrics, but not a time horizon.

So it can function with 10k o 100k or 1M ; depends on scale. But I've readjusted it, to the 50k of this challenge.\" The author is unclear about the magnitude of the project, how much funding is needed for the project and as such it does not provide me with enough information about its feasibility. Throwing money at projects can always be done, but the proposer needs to have a feasible scale in mind and include it in the proposal itself. Without a proper scale it makes it also difficult to assess whether the entire proposal effectively addresses the challenge questions remain about which direction will the proposer go with this proposal as many different ideas have been presented in the proposal.

However, as stated previously this idea aims at a very broad scope, plus we have no information on the curriculum, you toss ideas but you should state them in a more affirmative/clear way. Finally the roadmap is missing, we have a roadmap for \"if the project is launched\" but not for the launch of the project You could start by adding how long do you think the onboarding of one university you target would take. The budget is fuzzy but this you state clearly. Maybe also try to work out a budget based on some realities. From what i've gathered i think you have in mind \"modest\" universities and the rental system would be not so expensive, however if you aim to rent a room for a whole semester at Harvard or one of the most expensive, maybe your budget is low. All in all we need at least one comparaison point grounded in reality. What i mean is \"for this university which i contacted, they would agree to rent us a room for X\". From there you could work your way up to a sensible budget. Finally, you should take into account COVID restrictions, which you haven't. How is your project going to go if you cant have access to the rooms because of the covid restrictions ?
