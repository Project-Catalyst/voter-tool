You have identified the problem of low adoption and knowledge of block chain in Sweden but have not clearly defined how you will solve this problem and specifically which segment of the community will benefit from the launch of this proposal. Specifically how will connections to universities, governments, media and VC companies be established? It is also unclear as to how the project would scale to meet future challenges. You have not made mention of how you would utilise the Cardano Foundation to assist in the meeting of this challenge.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal described addresses the challenge, different ways of educating the local population about different aspects of Cardano have been described, however the lack of KPIs and tangible metrics makes it difficult to assess what the potential impact of the proposal would be.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Other than converting some of the material to Swedish this is an idea that would take place anywhere in the world.

Your experience as a Systems Architect/Developer for 20+ years is relevant to the proposal and provides a good background to educate from however being a developer does not necessarily translate to being a good educator or publicist. The scope of your proposal might be better supported by a team.
