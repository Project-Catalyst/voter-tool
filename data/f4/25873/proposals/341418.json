What is a bit unclear from your proposal is are you planning to charge the Cardano community members for accommodation when they come and work in the centre? If so, there should be a super low-cost option where the Cardano developers and entrepreneurs could live and work together. Most likely they won't pay even 110 USD a night (even if you could pay that in ADA).", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Great idea and would integrate a major European touristic area.\r\nIt comes to mind that Croatia is part of the 3SI European Economic Treaty (Intermarium) and having a hub near the Adriatic coast could significantly accelerate adoption in one of the most economically developing areas of the union.
