Although the requested funds are relatively small, it still does not seem sufficiently well presented. The proposed solution seems to be based on a donation model [ Give away for a couple of Ada. People come, setup wallet, receive Ada and \"pay\" for product. ]. Narrowly speaking it does provide help to a very small subset in a local community (consumers and sellers of a certain product), but does it automatically translate into \" strengthening the community\", apart from the proposed transactions? It does certainly help to implement the transactions as long as there is funding for the donations, but does it really further adoption after the initial donation is spent? Apart from the donated ADA, I am not convinced that it will result in the creation of a LCC - Business center (solving a local problem) that is sustainable - based on Cardano.

But, at the same time the issue I have with the likelihood of successful implementation is the lack of details about the proposer and the nature of the proposer's links to the local businesses that are being mentioned, as well as their true interest for participating.
