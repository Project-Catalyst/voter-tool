One thing that it does not seem to address is the creation of a community centre where locals can go to contribute or ask questions.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Nice goal and proposal. I believe the problem itself could be explained a bit further so we understand it better. It would be good also to understand where these farmers stand today, if they have access to internet and technology, e.g. smart phones.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "While the problem statement and phase one of the proposal address the challenge of LCCs(Local Community Center), the rest of the proposal does not.  I believe the scope is too wide.  Because of this, the proposal does not give enough detail on how to establish Local Community centers.  It does not reference the challenge KPI (Key Performance Indicators).  It does a good job of highlighting the problem and I feel that Cardano (as a token and through a LCC  could be a solution.  However, this campaign is specifically about creating LCCs.  ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The project fits with the vision of Cardona for enriching real-life solutions and Cardone can bring solutions those farmers need the funding without any middle man. However. the more detailed solutions to the challenge need to be provided in this project including community building and cooperation within a decentralized organization where farmers can support each other and may exchange goods and services through decentralized organisations. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Honorable idea. However i think you should wait for smart contracts and IOG to build the cardano version of KIWA, which would solve the problem.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal is great example of the potential benefits of cutting the middleman. But centralized government has a tight grip at social media platforms and cryptocurrencies to be used by the general population. Unfortunately exports are centrally governed and to be able to launch a solution like proposed bridges between the farmers and the demand needs to be communicated and the institutionalized governing bodies will need to be onboarded to these solutions. Internet access and technology needed to transact are required to take into account in the challenge as it can affect the outcome and deployment of the solution.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal described has great ROI potential, but is not directly aligned with the challenge, the focus is not on the use of Community Center, I recommend that the proposal submission to an appropriate challenge.\r\n\r\nThe problem described in the proposal has a confusing approach. As I could understand the government is opening the market for private initiative, what in theory is positive, but with some minimum subsidies or fixing can be at risk, which brings uncertainty to small producers. Any proposed public blockchain solution will be towards the free market (and private initiative), allowing agricultural production between two parts is to allow the private initiative to manifest through a model without intermediaries. I only find it important to emphasize this point because by proposing the incorporation of agricultural production negotiation into the Cardano blockchain, the implicit ideia is to go in the opposite direction of government subsidies  and this rationale is not clear in the proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem statement is not supported by the actual facts but just two articles, one of which is a news article. The problem statement says that new farm laws passed increase middlemen profits. It would be nice to give a comprehensive points list (based on facts) that support this statement, also in addition since this statement directly challenges the government laws it would be nice to be subjective about it and provide concrete supportive points on how an increase in privatization is bad in context of farm laws, rather than just providing some news article. The another article provided as an attachment  is from 2013 which is over 8 years ago and since then India has moved ahead a lot in terms of digitalization (e.g. a large portion of poor people (low income farmers included) are now banked compared to back in 2013 when any government money released as part of some scheme never reached the beneficiary vs now the money is directly debited to their account) src: https://pmjdy.gov.in/\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the solution to the problem mentions to solve farmer funding problems. It is not clear what fundign problems farmers have ? Does the solution means some kind of DeFi eco system for farmers OR does it mean that farmers can sell their crops via Cardano eco system? Farm acts can be seen here for more details, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Indian_agriculture_acts\r\nThis does not mention anything about funding problems", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "In general, the proposal tries to create a local community with farmers, NGO members and Cardanians to educate and onboard the local community in India. But it is not clear where in India, how many people will be adressed, which NGOs etc.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "It sounds like you have the skills and connections to make this work. It could be helpful to break down the budget so it is more clear where the funds will be put to use.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The idea seems very feasible, although the challenges of including the farmers in the digital currency world must be addressed, such as access to technology (e.g. smart phones). It would be beneficial to comment how the budget would be used, what would be included.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "This proposal does not give enough information about the team members actually on the team now and who will recieve the funds. Nor, does it give specifics on how the funds are to be used.  I want to know exactly who will be on the team and if the team is to be built, I want to know more about the proposer.  The proposal doesn't give the teams / proposers experience.  The plan presented is vague and out of the scope of the campaign.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Further information about the team is needed to convince for striving to accomplish a common goal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "I think you should wait for smart contracts and IOG to build the cardano version of KIWA, which would solve the problem.

I believe that it would be more reasonable to divide the proposal into two parts, First the elaboration of a proof of concept, so that in a second stage of fundind we can have something more tangible to evaluate.\r\n\r\nThe experiences described in the proposal are relevant the proposal described, but it is important that more details are presented, how many people will participate in the project, their professional experiences and qualifications, also recommend the inclusion of link to Github and LinkedIn (if possible).", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "1. The \"relevant experience\" section mentions a team but actual links to those people public profile or atleast the main person (e.g. linkedin profile) is not to be seen.\r\n2. Phase 1: Point 1. This phase explanation is not supported by any prior projects done by the proposer or his/her team e.g. has the team taken any similar endeavor in past that Cardano community can look at and be confident that team indeed has this experience? Point 2. This point depends on the premise of the problem statement that Farmers will suffer from the privatization and middleman profits. IMHO Indian government has a sour relationship with NGOs in recent years and this statement seems to be more inline with going against the government rather than actually addressing the concerns of farmers.\r\nPhase 2 and Phase 3 makes sense only when Phase 1 is clear to the voting community. Overall, the statement and phases should be supported subjectively.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no clear team or individual responsible for the proposal.

It would benefit from more measurable milestones and estimated timelines for each phase. Some questions that could be answered:\r\n1. In Phase 1, what specific communities will you target in the digital campaign. Are there certain demographics or regions that you will reach out to?\r\n\r\n2. In Phase 2, what requirements must be met for the proof of concept to be considered ready for development?\r\n\r\nI think the overall concept is feasible, but it is difficult to asses that without more details.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "Roadmap and milestones are well described. It would be beneficial to include KPIs and the challenges of educating the farmers. Also, detailing the budget would support the proposal auditability.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "While I think the need is great and the proposal does highlight that need, I am not confident that the plan as stated will make an impact in the area.  Only the problem statement and phase one address the challenge of creating LCCs (Local Community Center) in India.  I don't know the experience of the proposer or buy in from existing networks or community stakeholders.  Nor is there a budget detailed or explained.  I am not confident that this proposal would be successful.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Phases are clear further challanges and limitations needs to be outlined when it comes to training the community about Cardone use and blockchain.
