This proposal does not effectively address the challenge as detailed in the campaign brief.  For instance, I am unsure if the proposal is suggesting a Developers center, DeFi / DAO center or a Business Center.  I can infer that a 'Co-working space' will address these areas but it is no specificially stated.  Nor are the specific Key meterics of the campaign mentioned. for instance, will this proposed co-working space apply for a Local Community center license?  I assume that a number of new community members will be onboarded, but the proposal is not specific about many.  It does mention \"developers, entrepreneurs and other community members\".  To sum up, I don't think the proposer read and addressed the challenge statement as evidenced in the proposal", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The concept is a good idea, however not refined at all.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "So so.I mean to have centers in a specific place and not around the glob is a little bit unfair but we have 2 start from somewhere.Also because i think covid will stay for 2-3 years.I find it impossible for a meeting place.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal lacks details(there is no plan) indicating the purpose of this LCC, without understanding the purpose there is no way to assess the impact of the proposal on the challenge.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea is good, but the current situation in the world is not ideal for this proposal.

For instance, it states they are a host of Cardano Podcast, but does not offer a link.  And, they offer a project for the Lisk organization but offer no details.  In my opinion, a proposal of this scope and budget should have much more detail in order to decide if it will be a success.  Even if funded and a community center was run for a year, I am not sure it would address the goals of the campaign (an LCC (Local Community Center) created, number of community members onboarded, and a local business need addressed).  One last thing, in the comments, the proposer has unable to sensibly handle a question about COVID protocol and became defensive in their interaction.

It's unclear if the proposer has a network or a team.  In fact a partnership was proposed in the comment section and no reply was given.
