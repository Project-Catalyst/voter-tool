The idea is simple enough and fit naturally between gamers and the concept of tokens, thus the adoption would be less of a challenge, as gamers already used to the concept of virtual rewards. The only concern I have is the reliance of a Discord channel to execute the plan, although per my previous engagement with the proposer, he mentioned there are a wide community of gamers already using the channel, but risk still exists as any disruption to Discord would impact the application.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal plans to create a token system that rewards Fortnite players with a token created on the Cardano blockchain. The potential catchment area is very large and undoubtedly could bring a large number of users into the cardano ecosystem, increasing adoption and the utility of Cardano. The \"social\" approach of the dapp (based on a Discord bot) could be really helpful to create a viral effect, making it easier to reach new users.\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "An interesting proposal that helps welcome regular gamers to crypto by simply playing the games they know and love. Cryptocurrency is a dangerous investment for many, and this proposal helps address the challenge in a fun way.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a proposal which invents its own challenge and presents a viable solution on paper, whilst at the same time should directly contribute to the adoption, spread and utility of Cardano. The reward mechanism for users spending time in a common pastime and/or hobby is direct connected to the blockchain. The scope of this proposal is potentially tremendous and could involve a large proportion of the gaming population globally. Its focus on one of the most popular games (fortnite) means there is already a user base that the app and its function can directly tap into.\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Gaming dapp will be a really good thing to have early in ecosystem as it will attract more and more young crowd to cardano.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Really interesting concept with a solid amount of project plan detail explaining the app in depth, my question is this a dapp/does this even need smart contracts? it seems like a weaker decentralization use case if all your commands are in discord and you are just minting tokens and not using smart contracts. Also limited user base if its entire scope is built around a single game.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Due to the experience of the team such as a combined 45 years of experience in gaming and 10 years in blockchain as well as past experience working with EMURGO, E3, IGN, and IDG/GamePro, I feel that the team is fully equipped to execute this proposal. Past interaction with the proposer was made to reduce the amount needed in order to break up the proposer into multi phases thus reducing the amount asked into different proposal to increase the chance for success. One risk that might arise is the dependence on the new FortNite's Creative 2.0 release, which would be a new way to integrate to the game.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "It is really clear what the final product is and the mechanism of the Dapp is explained in a clear way. The user experience is already described and the dev group involved for the development has good references. I like the fact that the proposal describes the general picture of the project, including also the next phase: this is a good indicator of a long term vision, which is essential for the success of the project.\r\nI appreciate the details about the economics of the token, that is already planned and defined.\r\nIt would have been useful to have some details about the technical aspects of the project, including the description of the technologies/languages that will be used.\r\nThe funds requested seem adequate for the development of phase 1 but the costs breakdown is not indicated.\r\n", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team consists of young forward-thinking individuals and experienced advisors, partnering with many companies and agencies to help bring the proposal to reality.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team seems to have a good background focussed on the gaming industry. The transparency re: two phases gives confidence that the development approach has been well-thought of. Milestones, timelines, resources and the time it will take to build parts of Phase 1 are all critical information, including metrics by which the success of this Dapp and business model can be measured. The mention that Phase 2 could potentially be funded by revenue from phase 1, and may not be reliant on future Catalyst funding, indicates the project will proceed irrespective of the success of this funding round. That provides a measure of confidence that it is on the right track and needs to be supported by Project Catalyst. Also, the completion of the first parts of phase 1 activities reflects this reviewers assumptions and the quality of this proposal.

They also have clear business model on how users can benefit from the tokenomics of the system.
