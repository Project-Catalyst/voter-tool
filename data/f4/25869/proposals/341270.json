It would probably help to identify some general categories of problems and entrepreneurs who would benefit from tokenization of their problems - in order to make the proposal more viable. Not every business project or idea can benefit from tokenization and the proposal to me seems to be too general to effectively address the challenge. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea of this proposal (tokenization) addresses the challenge (I think it could be very impactful).

It currently asks for 200,000 dollars which is effectively entire fund - but it doesn't have depth that would be required to come along with it.

The situation is rather different with respect to equity finance, where the markets\r\nof EE5 countries compare favourably with those of OECD countries. Despite a\r\ngrowing development of OECD equity markets over the past few decades, the\r\ncapitalisation equity markets of EE5 countries had been growing more rapidly\r\nthan those in OECD countries for several years. Moreover, in the current crisis\r\nthe sharp correction of equity markets in OECD countries stands in contrast to\r\nthe more resilient performance of in the EE5. In South Africa, where the equity\r\nmarket was already well developed, it has now advanced to the point that that\r\nmarket is comparatively larger than in any OECD country.\r\n3 Brazil, China and\r\nIndia have all made significant strides in promoting the development of equity\r\nmarkets and their markets now rank among the largest in the world in absolute\r\nsize.

The historical track record points to this potential. Despite the challenges associated with liquidity, African stock markets have performed remarkably well, both in terms of absolute returns and on a risk-adjusted basis. The risk adjustment is done using the standard Sharpe ratio that scale average return by volatility. As shown in Table 5, the average annual return for these markets over the past 10 years was 25%. With the exceptionA particularly important outgrowth of the extensive financial sector reforms in Africa, including policy measures for the development of capital markets, has been a surge of interest in the establishment of stock exchanges, particularly in Sub-Sahara Africa. Stock exchanges have proliferated over the last two decades. There were only 5 stock exchanges in SSA 20 years ago and 3 in North Africa, but now there are about 20 in operation. There has also been a market capitalization boom in Africa, with the exception of the two oldest markets in South Africa and Egypt which came into existence in 1880s. What is also interesting is that SSA witnessed an establishment of a regional stock exchange domiciled in Abidjan, which currently serves the Francophone countries of West Africa. There are, in fact, similar initiatives underway in Southern and Eastern Africa to consolidate the thinly capitalized markets into regional markets.", "rating": 3}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Create a tokenization ecosystem for financing innovative projects in West Africa.\nhelp technically, structure, and tokezine seed projects.", "experience": "Charles lives and works as Blockchain & AI Expert in France and Switzerland, now he is working to help tech startups in West Africa."}
