It's clear from reading this proposal the author is not even fully aware of how NFT's are minted on Cardano, their is no metadata in the NFT, it's in the minting-tx itself. If the proposer had some technical documentation on GH or other shared environment CA's could make comments noting these things but there is none I could find here or in the attached link. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "Although the proposal doesn't involve the creation of a dapp, it is essential for the dapps / NFTs ecosystem on Cardano. The use of a standard for metadata allows NFT-related dapps that will be created on Cardano in the future to have a communication / metadata standard and that is why the proposal addresses the challenge in a relevant way.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Kudos to this proposal for pausing from the NFT rush and taking a look around to assess what's needed before things get really out of hand. I can see this solution being similar to establishing IEEE standards that jut make everything work. The key going forward is reaching consensus with all the participants and current 'industry' experts most of whom may not necessarily be familiar with blockchain technologies but have 'rushed' in. It would benefit this proposal greatly if it at leasts listed the fields to which NFTs applied besides art and real estate, e.g. legal evidences, will & testaments, a one-off moment, etc. But as it is, its very commendable.\r\n", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I feel activities like finalizing metadata or any NFT related standards should have gone under developer ecosystem challenge and not under Dapp challenge.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Although the proposal seems to fall more into the developer ecosystem area by aiming to provide a comprehensive NFT metadata standard, it does address a valid problem of the ecosystem.\r\nManaging to create a standard that fits most use cases or is adaptable to it would allow to remove friction communication of NFTs.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "It's 1. not clear this author even understands how token minting from metadata works on Cardano 2. not at all clear what if any deliverables from their fund3 proposal have been made to date.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "A reasonable, objective and detailed plan has been described.

The team seemingly possesses the quals to see this forward and on to success, however it fails to elaborate on what that success looks like. What if consensus on the metadata requirements is not reached? The partnering with IOG Professional Services somewhat provides confidence. At the very least, this could end up adopting the Atala Prism approach of collect everything, add what (metadata) you want. It would also be necessary to clarify if the experts with whom they intend to partner, receive a portion of the funding requested, or if their participation is outside of the scope of this proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team has members from all over the cardano ecosystem which makes it highly likely that proposal will be implemented.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan presented doesn't offer any details of measurable milestones or criteria to define if a step is complete and one can move on to the next step.\r\nThe team consists of core members and a cohort of available members, however, it is not clear how committed the cohort would be in case of funding.\r\nCooperation with IOG is mentioned, it is not clear though, if IOG is onboarded or if they would be contacted at the time of getting funded.\r\nThere is a very specific amount of budget requested but no breakdown or rationale provided, to what parts it is intended to be used, furthermore not timeline nor expected working time is provided.
