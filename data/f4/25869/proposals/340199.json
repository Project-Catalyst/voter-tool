It fits within the challenge brief. Where it misses a mark for me is ability to explain why there is a need for decentralised \"udemy\" version. I would challenge the notion hinted at in the description:\r\n\r\n\"Unlike traditional elearning platforms, XceedLearn will build a community of high quality content creators.\"\r\n\r\nI am unsure about that statement as I do believe that existing platforms curate high content quality already. Thus I would 'skip' generic statements like above and focus on governance aspect instead. As that seems to be the core unique selling proposition. But overall - solid idea.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is solid, no doubt. However, one things bothers me: is to developp a new product for an existing company. However, the proposers are right in saying that mitigates the risk, and by leveraging already existing structure we can bring more mass adoption. Something still bothers me but i can't pinpoint what. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is good, good background as well as roadmap. The 1st step of the roadmap is going to be finished before the voting starts, and the budget seems to be focusing on that (#1?), this could be clarified. Some discussion about why using a decentralized platform would be better than centralized one. Also, I believe the focus could be more related to the content creator and mentors as in the platform itself. Some other e-learning platforms were proposed, but not focused on Africa from what have seen, but some synergy could be discussed.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "Having hard time understanding the budgetary requirements. The proposal only states one grand figure of 10,000 USD but it doesn't go into much detail beyond stating it is allocated towards first step in their roadmap. It would be helpful to understand why this is the right amount. Beyond that - knowing that this only is allocated for #1 point, understanding what the budgetary requirements down the line are be very useful. Hence, that is a big unknown from the presentation itself. That in itself is strange notion as I see one of the co-proposers as experienced veterans in the catalyst process. Lastly, I would have loved to understand the experience from within dApp developments. Would WADA help with that? Or does existing company have experience with that? Unsure about that. Would be great to bring that clarity aboard. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The funds are just for the n\u00b01 stop on the roadmap. This also bothers me, if you could include at least sample courses from n\u00b03 or any otherpoint on the roadmap, i'd give you more stars.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Based on the teams experience and proved work, the proposal seems to be very feasible. Roadmap is good, but budget seems to be directed only for the first point, it could be better explained. This point makes it a bit difficult to evaluate if the budget is reasonable.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "I appreciate the inclusion of risk management in the proposal. However, it omits a bit how the platform plans to take on the existing centralised platforms. And if that challenge is something proposal owners are thinking about. Then, roadmap has 4 items on it. However, only first two have indication of timeline on it. There also are KPI metrics - which is great. One of them mentions leveraging information from existing database of customers. Which is great in an essence. Has a study/survey been done how existing customers are looking at this prospect? Is the reliability of growth tied to the existing platform? If so - what growth patterns has been seen to date?  What outside streams of growth are going to be considered? Lastly, one of the core metrics also discusses tracking number of hours consumed - but there's no actual target mentioned there in the end. Would be useful to include that as well.\r\n", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "You clearly state the problem. But then you give us your solution without more contextualisation. As an academic, the lack of context is the weak point in your proposal. The rest of it clearly written and well defined. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "Roadmap, milestones and KPIs are well described. The proposed dates seem to be a bit challenging, but depending on the size of the team they could be achievable. Budget could be explained in more details to improve the proposal's auditability.", "rating": 4}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Bring Governance, Decentralization and Incentives to e-Learning (A decentralized Udemy)", "experience": "XceedNetwork has pioneered Human Capital management technology and e-learning platforms in Africa for over 15 years"}
