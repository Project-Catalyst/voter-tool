The mere mention of an API connecting M-Pesa and Cardano seems inefficient for such a proposal that has a tremendous upside to countries and a lot of people if the challenge is met. I would like to see more details provided. At this stage, I am leaning more towards a lower score but have rated it in the middle in the hope that further details can be provided to improve my assessment and confidence.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem statement doesn't present a problem, but rather a statement that M-PESA is the most successful mobile-phone financial service in the developing world, but no information has been provided to support this statement.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough information to understand how the proposal will address the challenge. It is only suggesting an integration of the ADA with the M-PESA through an API, but this is extremely vague.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "Not too bad of an idea to meet the challenge, but he other aspects of the proposal are minimal and inadequate", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Concept is great - bringing interoperability/integration that can help bridge gap and eliminate friction points are always useful.

There isn't any professional link, website that would help us navigate that, maybe linked in profile, past work, etc. It would help determine credibility a great deal. Proposal also is lacking some basic understanding of budgetary requirements beyond stating one grand figure. There isn't any break down of items, nor how these amounts help us achieve the desired target.

It does not clearly define the available resources that will be devoted to the project, how they will be used and the stages of the development. There is mention of 'existing ties to M-Pesa's use' but does not elaborate on these ties. Is it with the developers M-Pesa or is it ties with users of M-Pesa?
