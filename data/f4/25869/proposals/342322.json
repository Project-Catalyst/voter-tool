The proposer seems to have laid out a well-thought of effective solution which covers all aspects of and the complexities and the actors involved in the execution of a last will & testament. The proposal also lays out the establishment of such a will-as-an-NFT and the processes whenever amendments are required. The proposer seems to have a good grasp of crypto technologies and protocols. There is a benefit not just to Cardano's ecosystem but to the global community, provided cryptographically embedded wills are recognised legally.

Exactly our objective, There are several proposals that attempt to deal with inheritance in a secretive way, None that simply place a will on the blockchain and execute via smart contract. The proposer recognises thee are many things to discover about this solution, but has covered as many bases as possible at this stage. Excellent approach", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The challenge was clearly defined, and I believe you demonstrated both the technical and business subject matter expertise to address the challenge.\r\n\r\nTo complete your proposal, it would be useful to know the metrics related to this challenge. You described in detail how Bequeath would work and the supporting framework around it through multiple tokens, but to me it just seemed like as an as-is replacement for the current living will system, so I don't think you answered the \"So what?\" question. In other words, what advantages would Bequeath offer over current living will systems? For example, given the inherent tamper-proof characteristic of blockchain systems, it would be interesting to know how Bequeath would prevent fraud, and whether current will fraud rates are high enough to justify the value proposition of Bequeath.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Added with few developers that can support this project, the proposer brings the bulk of the experience required in the solution defined.

This is understandable to me and I'm not expecting you to have a team of developers lined up, but I got the impression that you have sufficient project management skills to estimate approximately how many developers you would need and over what period of time. I think you should also be able to estimate how the $40,000 will be spent in terms of the project phases.

It presents how such a problem can be resolved with a dapp elaborating well on the intricacies of real-world scenarios involved in the process of inheritance transfers. However, the lack of a solid plan and the restrictions on the time of the proposer himself as admitted, and the lack of a team who will develop and deploy the solution does not provide great confidence that it is feasible at this stage. An itemisation of the plan and milestone and resourcing and budgeting is required including the presentation of associated token proposals to get a big picture of how much this entire solution will cost. Presenting the associated proposals at the same time should also tease out any dependancies that impacts the overall success of this solution.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "It's a nice and complete proposal.

However, this is a very ambitious proposal in which you're not just building a DApp but, if understood correctly, you're standing up an entire framework for living will management with various DApps and tokens, so I think the risks for this proposal will be magnified several times compared to a regular DApp proposal. We need to know the anticipated risks and how you plan to mitigate them. For example, instead of creating all 5 tokens as part of this initiative, would it be possible to partner with other initiatives or existing projects/services? For identity verification, wouldn't it make more sense to use Atala PRISM instead of building your own custom solution? It seems to me that the Bequeath framework would require a high level of interoperability and integration, and this needs to be addressed a little more in your proposal.", "rating": 3}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Living wills have been around for centuries.
