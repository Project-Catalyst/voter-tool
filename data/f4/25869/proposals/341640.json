In theory, a loan dapp has enormous potential to address the challenge, but a minimum rationale needed to indicate the idea and the value proposition wasn't provided. What mechanism ensures that a borrower accepts a loan and never repays it? Why would anyone lend money without any guarantee that they will be paid back? These are basic concepts that need to be present even before an MVP.\r\n\r\nHow will the identity of users be assessed? Will there be KYC? Undercolateralized loans require some form of trust, it is not possible to use only smart contracts with no identity association, as some credit recovery mechanism needs to exist and blockchain addresses alone guarantee pseudo anonymity.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal does not address the challenge of \"How can application developers drive adoption of Cardano in 2021?\" in the best way. It proposes \"The $40,000 would deliver the ability for users to create a wallet and transfer native assets between users.\", however this capabilities already exist with the Daedalus wallet and Yoroi. It is unclear to me what would the funds be spent on. As another part of the proposal states \"We require the funding to fulfil development of the MVP and demonstrate viability of the project and demonstrate the use case for similar dapps in emerging economies in future. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Great idea and in line with Cardano's vision in reaching small communities and providing them with services that would otherwise be unavailable for them.

Where the community stands to gain and how it aligns with the over goal. I understand the basic premise of financial enablement - through defi. But greater emphasis on how cardano helps elevate this proposal/idea would be useful. In its current form - it seems deficient in information provided/or lack there of. Hopefully more can be added later on so we can invite this proposal back for funding.

Neither in the proposal - nor on the website itself. It would be really useful to understand how are you going to spend this money better. It helps with accountability towards the community and helps you navigate the needs better. Overall - the concept reads more like an idea and it doesn't seem to have all the basic elements that we'd need as community to understand whether we can go forward with investing or not. That lack of sensible plan is a bit crucial. I feel this is a comms break down of sorts. I would suggest to take the elements available and mash them into a pitch deck of sorts where these points can be addressed more effectively. As proposal here has very little details and website isn't great to navigate either. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is not enough information to certify the viability.

It also states that working product should be available in Q1 which is about to end in few days. When clicking on either of links - Apple store or Android - both are broken and land on generic wix error page. Some clarity about timelines would then be really desirable as I am unsure where this proposal here lands exactly then. it states it shoots for MVP - but that means - based on roadmap - that some working prototype is ready? Couldn't figure that out exactly. I would also have loved to learn more about challenges and risks from perspective of authors. I couldn't phantom much of it in the current form.
