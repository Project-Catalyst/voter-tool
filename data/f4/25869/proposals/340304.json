I think it is important that data on the funding process for researchers are presented so that the community can understand the impact of the proposal on the challenge. Does this proposal aim to create a funding model for multiple researchers or for a specific university / region?Is there a potential number of researchers to benefit from the proposal? ? Is there any estimate of these fundings amounts? What percentage of this value is lost in the bureaucracy of universities?", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal does indeed address the problem of inefficiency found in our current system of scientific research. Often funded by universities and government, one of the biggest issues I think it could address would be not only the inefficiency but the corruption involved with this type of funding. A trustless, anti-corruption approach to science would be a move in the right direction and could have profound knock-on effects. It is missing aspects of accountability, how funds would be allocated and how they would mitigate foul-play. There are a lot more avenues to explore to complete the concept. I would be willing to help with this.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "If adopted this would be a large scale credibility to the ecosystem and increase use.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "As an other academic, i agree with your proposal and know how time consumming these things are. However, for me your solution might just be another step into the already established trend that we stray further away from fundamental research into applied and ROI research. If i googled scholared you correctly, you're into stem cells so maybe this is something specific to your field, i don't know.  We should aim at targeting the scientific journals which are way more profiting from research than universities.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Potentially a great idea for adaptions of the existing research funding. However, it seems this proposal hasn't been worked on in greater depth as it is missing a lot of attributes that would make it serious enough at this stage. It narrowly fits the brief of having a problem that needs solution but the depth of the narrative isn't too great. I would have preferred to learn more about the issue beyond scope of the paragraph here. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal effectively addresses the challenge on various levels. First, it provides all of the necessary information to understand what the dapp is meant to do. It identifies an inefficiency and explains how that can be removed. Second, because of the real-world need for such an improvement in research funding, this dapp will be successful, increasing the adoption of Cardano as it spreads to funders connected with universities around the world (subject to language constraints). Third, a comment was made to this proposal regarding expanding the scope of the proposal beyond universities to the pharmaceuticals industry. Not as substantive advice, clearly this idea could be expanded to simply connecting any and all research scientists and funders down the road after the initial dapp is successful. These examples indicate how this quality dapp has the potential to increase the utility of Cardano beyond the initial conception.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is promising but is very vague and lacks many details to the extent that I couldn't figure out the way it would address the challenge.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is a simple plan/rationale, but few details have been described. Despite the low complexity of the proposal, I think it is important that a more detailed and structured plan is presented, I recommend that the proposer follow the Catalyst documentation to prepare the proposal.\r\n\r\nThere are no details on the expertise of the team of proposers, I recommend including more details, such as how many people will actively participate in the project, their experiences, skils and links to Github and / or Linkedin.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has experience in the field of scientific research and so is acutely aware of the issues involved in the current system and what might practically work for scientists.

You should add more info. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "As interesting of an idea this is - unfortunately, there are few missing elements. There is no actual plan or sensible budget included in this proposal that would make it investable. Budget states half the amount of the entire challenge - which makes me think it may have been an error or misunderstood. It still is just in an idea per se. It would also be great if some reference links for the experience be included directly in the proposal itself. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The experience called for to optimize probability of success seems quite well met here. Mr. Ghareeb is a published scientist, presumably an academic/professor as well based upon his knowledge of how universities act as the middlemen to direct research funding. He himself has received research funding and knows where the funding typically originates. While it would not seem necessary, he also has programming experience to boot, which he could have drawn on from others on his team. The key players once the dapp is built will be the funders like the charitable foundations and governments. The sales pitch is: more of your funds go directly to the research instead of being siphoned off wending their way through the university's bureaucratic structure. This proposal will increase the adoption of Cardano as funders see what more can be done with the more efficient delivery of their funds to research scientists. While it may not be necessary, Mr. Ghareeb could add a few more details about his experience like number of years as a scientist, number and/or dollar amount of research funds and the nature or strength of connections to funders.  Furthermore, it would be helpful to provide more information about his team (experience), use of funds and schedule for completion of the dapp.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal doesn't contain any execution plan in detail.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "From the description it is possible to understand the concept of the proposal and the potential in addressing the challenge, but we need to know the potential of using blockchain in this application to understand the impact, so more details would be important.\r\n\r\nIs there an estimate of the number of transactions, tradable volume or number of potential users?", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "At the moment, the proposer has not detailed how such aspects of peer review and governance would be conducted on such a system, how voting would work and how funding would be allocated.

There also is no definition of success or KPIs that would help us further determine how effective the proposal could be down the line.

I hope proposal owner will come back because topic is certainly worth the time.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal provides sufficient information to assess how feasible it is by presenting an experience individual who understands how a system works (research funding) and has operated within that system himself. No doubt there are a lot of great ideas conjured by people who have no experience whatsoever with the subject matter. This is not the case here. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge because it provides a roadmap how Mr. Ghareeb and his team will create a quality dapp that will be implemented successfully in the real world. Research funding for scientists could be substantially shifted from the university mechanism to Cardano, involving thousands or millions of dollars. There is a clear path to success and even potential expansion, increasing the utility of the dapp, which to me means collectively that this dapp will be a winner.  It would be helpful to describe generally how the scientists seeking funding and the funders would interact with the dapp. For example, would scientists be required to clearly state the product of the research? Would funders be permitted to dole out funds based upon milestones? Would scientists be asked to describe the intended research in layman's terms? Would funders be permitted to request a certain type of research for a certain amount of money? This may be going into too much detail but something generally about user experience and the operation of the contractual mechanism would be helpful. A more detailed roadmap and milestones would be helpful. Also, citation of risks and challenges would demonstrate the proposer's understanding of the problem. For example, will funders be able to wade through research proposals? Will scientists not have access to university resources and/or faculty that they would normally have? The definition of success generally seems clear, but providing more specific metrics would be helpful (e.g. number of scientists funded by a certain amount within a certain amount of time).", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no breakdown or clear demonstration to explain how the 100000USD will be used.", "rating": 1}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "A trust-less, smart contract system which allows funders to entrust their funds directly with scientists without University middlemen.", "experience": "I am a published scientist with experience in raising funds for research and a programmer."}
