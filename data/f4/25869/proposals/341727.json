The plan is well organized and sketched out. The project has the potential to grow into something that can work across the world starting from Colombia as a case study. More clarity on how the funds helps create the platform and what type of access and knowledge do the farmers have of the technoly in question. They may not possess internet connectivity,PC/mobile devices or how to work with issuing the payments, managing the tokens and to close contracts upon delivery. More emphasis on these questions and the education side of blockchain technology.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea for the integration of the Cardano blockchain with agricultural markets is good and laudable. What I see in this proposal is an overly ambitious proposal that does not effectively address some important risks. The proposal is very ambitious in scope and as such may not effectively address the challenge at hand - the size of the project may lead to its inviability. The brief mentions questions such as - did we manage to attract users to the platform? Did our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano? The focus of the proposal - tokenize agricultural products of Colombian farmers - is too general to take into account the specific nature of agri-food products (phytosanitary certificates, quality issues, storage, rotting, short shelf life, transport, delivery terms, crop insurance, you name it...)", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "It's an interesting dApp idea which would increase utility & adoption of Cardano if implemented successfully. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Good proposal. It fits the Cardano mission and a dApp to trade commodities seems to be in high demand around the world. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "I think the three brothers and the mother are on the right track with technical expertise, leadership and the passion to help their fellow community members. The platform could be expanded on other countries facing similar social injustices around the world. The plan presented and experience behind it brings confidence to the implementation of the solution.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal is for a nation-wide solution for Colombian farmers that is not limited to a certain pilot region or a certain crop. Even within apple production we have fresh apple varieties and industrial apple varieties with different characteristics and market requirements. The proposal does not address the complexities of trade in agricultural products and has many potential pitfalls if not scoped to a manageable level.  The team is a family with different skill sets, but it does not prove that they are up to a job of this gargantuan size.  ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Lacks many important details to give me confidence this can be implemented successfully.\r\nNon-exhaustive list of examples :\r\n- how would a farmer find out about this dApp/platform? there's a huge education gap here that hasn't been addressed.\r\n- how would the tokenisation of agricultural products really work? How will audit and evaluate that the product exists, the quantity is real, the quality of the product is at a good standard?\r\n- what would the market dynamics actually be? How would you attact buyers and sellers and what are the incentives as well as the check and balance for a healthy market to form? ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team seems solid and competent to tackle this.\r\nThe plan is well built up, but there is one thing that caught my eye:\r\n'a fee can be charged that is a small percentage for purchases made by users of agricultural products'\r\nBy cutting out the middle man, you already gain a significant amount of fund per transaction. Would it really be necessary to translate a supplemented fee cost to the consumer or could it also work without? ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "Expanding on my first note there needs to be more clarity as to the access of technology needed to execute smart contracts and decentraluzed finance and perhaps a stage by stage roadmap delineated to bring more confidence to the table. The project is a beautiful idea and if it can be deployed successfuly is a world changing application you hot on your hands.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "I think that on a concept level, the proposal does address the challenge, however the details are not convincing as the project calls for a wide, blanket solution for all/most (?) agricultural products. There is a lot of nuance in agricultural markets that has not been addressed and may easily undermine the feasibility of this proposal.  ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "As mentioned above I think a lot more thought needs to be put in fleshing out the details, dynamics and incetives to make such an idea really work in practice. Without a serious, systematic and detailed plan I doubt this proposal has a significant chance to get any meaningful usage.
