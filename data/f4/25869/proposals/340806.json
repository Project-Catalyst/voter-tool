Despite addressing dapps in its description, the idea is not to create a dapp, but courses for the development of dapps and this is more in line with the challenge of Developer Ecosystem.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal is not in the right challenge.

We do need easy to understand tutorials to get new comers interested without feeling overwhelmed. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "There is some basic concept outlined but I am afraid there isn't much of an idea developed just yet. I would recommend to try to work on it a bit more and seek feedback from community. It feels like there is more work to be done here prior we can learn about what specifically this problem addresses within Cardano ecosystem and how it can be attained in greater detail. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Starting from the point that the idea is to create courses, the proposer didn't reported experience as a developer or teacher, so his experience is not aligned with the need for the implementation of the proposal. The presented plan is very simple and lacks details, no methodology or information about skills to be developed has been presented.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Most of the proposer's experience is not relevant to the project.

It seems to be just an idea without additional details. Things to add in the future would include proper references to professional experience, sensible plan, also knowing budget requirements.

I like the ideas towards the structure of the material with videos, homework, assignments etc. My concern is mostly with the high amount of requested funds for this. I would say its much too high.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "Being just an idea - there is lack of roadmap or milestones that would make things more interesting and potent. For the future reference, using KPI and appropriate success metrics can help us navigate. Additional colour around challenges and risks is desirable as well.
