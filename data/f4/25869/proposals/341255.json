There is no technical documentation or dev resource capable of building Plutus contracts highlighted.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a global problem and what has been presented in the proposal is a novel solution to combat climate change. The paper has clearly articulated the impacts of solo-driving to the environment and the benefits of ride sharing, in minimising carbon footprints. More importantly, its use of the ada blockchain for carbon credits and linking it to the business model of carbon trading by business entities shows potential growth in the future. The benefits of this solution is global", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal provides a compelling platform that incentivises a healthy social activity that is carpooling through carbon offsetting rewards. If the pandemic continues to level, this proposal has the potential to promote Cardano adoption further, and expand to other environmentally friendly forms of transportations like public transit infrastructure.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "I like the concept very much. It ties very well with the mission of Cardano plus it works very well on utility end in theory. I only wish this proposal took more effort to highlight the environmental benefits vis-a-vis Cardano ethos a bit more. I think there are some benefits to leverage from doing so. However, overall - it fits the challenge brief well all things considered.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "this is a really interesting idea which effectively addresses the challenge.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "Budgetary requirements are not addressed in much detail nor other ideas about how this project plans to execute, specifically in the development of Plutus smart contracts in the next 3 months.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Despite the lack of itemised resources and budget allocations & clear development pathways, I still allocated this proposal a 4-star due to the thought clearly invested in this solution. The fact the team has already partially completed a version of the app lends credibility and confidence that it can be implemented successfully. The team has also considered its progress and deployment against the current global pandemic and presented potential solutions to ensure health and safety for participants. The potential involvement of Uber and Lyft, if successful, can lead to immediate adoption by la arge number of ride-sharing users who by most surveys share a concern for the environment with desires to minimise carbon footprints. This proposal could be further improved with an itemised listing of expenditures against resources, but overall, it is on the right track.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "This team has experience on a variety of ventures, which I therefore believe have the skills and connections required to deliver the proposal via continuous feedback and iterations from many different social views.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "Somewhat uneasy about the presentation about the team. I understand there is a partner back up from WADA - which is fantastic. But the proposal doesn't link externally to additional resources that would help navigate these persons. I checked the website - but it is only solution presentation. I found only terms and conditions page - no about us or people behind as such. Adding some sort of links that would enable us to verify/establish validity of professional claims be very desirable. Maybe a linked in profiles, or some previous project references. However, I appreciate the effort typing out background in the proposal itself. That's a plus - just missing that 'verified' momentum to it a bit. A quick comment about budget - it breaks down somewhat into greater detail - but we don't really know how many developers are going to be paid for? Budget only states this amount is for developers. Experience section states 3 fullstack developers and team section discusses 2 of them. Would be great to clear up team dynamics next time to help clear any additional doubts.

Starting with the token model to the actual dApp development", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "There are obvious metrics Catalyst requires to establish audibility of proposals. This proposal does not satisfy the requirements 100% however, the fact the solution and the processes is well considered, a partial functioning application already exists suggest a reliable measure of feasibility. There is no doubt that the solution can help slow down climate change or at the very least make more people aware of the impacts of travelling decisions that they can act upon it. There is tremendous upside to this solution with Cardano being at its very core. And the involvement of business organisations and the carbon credit market could make this a very liquid & lucrative market.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "The pandemic is obviously the elephant in the room in terms of the risks involved in this proposal. I'm sure the risk is being addressed as carefully as possible, and I'd suggest reviewing how other simillar companies mitigate the situation to come up with a cost-effective and user-friendly experience to reduce the spread of infection.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "I like that team has thought of breaking down the auditability section. There is a simple roadmap and milestones. However, I would have liked to understand timeline a bit more than just stating it would take three months. Plotting some timescale would be really useful. I also like the inclusion of what success looks like - that helps set the narrative properly. With regards to measuring metrics - here I would have liked to learn what target metrics are to be considered as KPIs. But not just in words - but what expectation there is in terms of growth. Some target numbers so that we can benchmark effectively the progress once funded. This helps set the context a lot better.
