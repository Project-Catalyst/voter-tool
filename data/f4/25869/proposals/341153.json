However, I wish authors spent a bit more time addressing how Cardano community would benefit from the launch of this proposal in a greater detail. It seems the utility of use is one of the key elements - but understand how authors look at it more cohesively would have been great. Proposal focuses more on a solution that the initial problem.

It would be great to include professional profiles, like LinkedIn, or other references that would help us get to know them a bit more. There is a reference to stake pool operator but again - absent of additional attributes - it is difficult to validate claims as such. More of an issue I see with the fact that budget states only one grand figure but doesn't go into depth how it would be utilised exactly. Some sensible breakdown and possible plotted against timescale to understand flow of the concept better. There also seems to be an issue that team is not exactly in place? As one of the proposal elements suggests some hires are yet to be desired. Knowing some of these have already leads would have been highly appreciated.

Knowing these would make it easier for community to understand direction and aspirations of the proposal. Further, some elements of discussion on topics of challenges and risks be nice. There isn't much of that in the proposal just yet. I suggest looking into these things and try to re-submit at the later stage.
