However, the whole idea bout building in Cardano would be to ensure that there is less errors when deploying solutions. I don't particular see enough distinction of how this proposal ties into the whole picture. I am not confident that this idea has been developed enough to be able to clearly communicate its benefit from the launch just yet.

Since this proposal seems more of an idea at this stage - it is missing other elements of how would this be executed and by whom exactly. Is it a sole endeavour by the proposal himself - but then it seems like a large task. So having a team consideration in place would have been really potent.

It would be useful to have that as part of the sensible plan. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "This needs a risk assessment.\r\nWhat happens if the dApp is wrong and a breach occurs?
