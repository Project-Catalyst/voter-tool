This is a valid idea and deserves merit, but does not seem to tie in directly and in the best form with the Challenge.  As it is a proposed  series of videos on Youtube with general information on Cardano. it might have been better to submit it to the other Challenge: Catalyst Value Onboarding, where it might have been a better fit.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think its  a marvelous idea, as a Spanish speaker myself I can see the large barrier in Spanish speaking countries of gaining resources and relevant information in their native tongue language needed to onboard central and south Americans into the ecosystem.  This in place would inspire developers and investor in the region to deploy their assets in those countries as well. Perhaps post more about the demographic unaware of blockchain technology, details on what resource the proposer is intending to use and the efforts of promoting, sometimes making the content doesn't equate to viewers.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea of serving community members in different languages is very good.At this last minute they added enough information to justify a strong rating", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Like the concept - but there isn't much beyond that in itself. Proposal reads more like an idea brainstorming of what could be done but not actually how to carry it out specifically. Knowing exactly how it all ties to the mission of cardano and where we can build on that utility - it would be fantastic. That would help understanding the scope of its impact.

The plan and topics are really good but more exploration on how will you achieve traction is hard to measure without a marketing strategy. The solution appear simple enough to be achievable with relatively less complex development but more clarity on content creation, editing skills, perhaps a sample of a topic edited and formatted for presentation could be given as a snippet.
