I understand the idea of marketplace - but there are so many variants in the world - that knowing what this particular marketplace is hoping to facilitate is desirable. Why? Each may have its own needs and nuances to consider. I am unsure if it makes sense to approach marketplace integration/dApp on such a holistic level. I would have liked to learn more which particular problem in that dishonesty paradigm is targeted exactly. That would help narrow down the focus on the target group and build custom solution for such. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "In my opinion, the proposer missed to define clearly the stated problem. What is the real use case? In which situation does the payment history really make sense? P2P? B2C? B2B? There is no statement about this, also no differentiated discussion about this. How does the solution really prevent abuse? In a wider perspective, this idea would fit into this challenge but I don't see, that there is a sensible plan behind the idea.

A marketplace for what? The control mechanisms needed to properly incentivize good behavior and the difficulty of seeding any 2-way marketplace (in this proposal, essentially a 3-way marketplace) make it unlikely to generate enough traction at this stage.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Proposal doesn't go in appropriate depth when discussing the actual budget. There is one grand figure noted but not much detail on why this is the right amount and what different segments of it are for. This would have been a very useful information to learn about. Also - because the scope of the nature is not narrowed down - it is also difficult to understand what it would actually take to bring this solution to life. If this was added - it would make things a lot more clearer than in its current shape. I would suggest to re-work the proposal in more actionable items and resubmit it at later funds. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "As the comment sections shows, the proposer has no sufficient experience in developing and implementing such a big product himself. Many aspects of this idea are not thought through carefully (such as a potential abuse). The given plan is more like a vague idea instead of a step-by-step roadmap. The budget is not described in detail, I think it is too low for developing such a solution. Therefore I cant state the budget as reasonable and for me successful implementation is very doubtful (based on the given information).", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There seems to be too little experience developing blockchain integrations or applications, the proposition also lacks key details around what steps would be taken to develop this.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "What measures or rules will be in place concerning reporting?

This really seems just like an idea/concept of sorts. There is no introduction of success metrics, KPIs, or other useful information such as challenges and risks considered.

I also recommend to add metrics/KPIs to a future proposal to make it assessable. Overall, the provided information is by far not sufficient.

In order to get a funding in the future, I also recommend to be more specific on this aspects.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Not enough information is provided around for example identity management, or the enforcements against illegal sellers.
