There is just an element of one grand figure but it doesn't go into detail how this figure breaks down into individual categories and how we can expect it to be spent more precisely beyond holistic level. It feels very arbitrary as presented at the moment - hence looking to validate the amount requested. I also struggle understanding who would actually build this app. There isn't a sense of whether it is just by one person or if there is a team that could carry the work load. It only states relevant experience as 'jack of all trades' of sorts. Which is great - but we'd need to bolt down who exactly - or what skills be needed to build individual parts of this app. Adding those elements would greatly amplify effect of this proposal.

", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There isn't a clear structure of roadmap nor milestones to hit. There is an attempt to lost what things need to be built over time - but it doesn't give sense of how long each segment is expected to take. There is just one mention of 6 month timeframe. But that is too wide of a margin to put into proposal without greater context. I would also like to see how author thinks about proposal in terms of success - what metrics and values would they think are appropriate when measuring the progress? Lastly - adding elements of understanding with regards to basic challenges/risks to be considered would have been really appreciated. Adding all of these elements would really help this proposal elevate its form.", "rating": 1}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Graflr authenticates the artists.
