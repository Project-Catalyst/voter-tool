A unique angle of looking at the transactional relationship in the influencer marketing segment. I can definitely see this as a potential problem to be solved. I wish though - the proposal owner would go in greater detail outlining examples of these inefficiencies on a real world example with actual data. It is difficult to establish number relevance without some actual 'proof'. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "the idea is sound but lacks polish", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is promising but is very vague and lacks many details to the extent that I couldn't figure out the way it would address the challenge.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "It is not clear what product we should expect from this proposal. It is not indicated what is the object for which the funds are requested(a website, a dapp or just the smart contract). It is also not clear if the result of the proposal will be a prototype or a final product.\r\nThere are no specifications about the languages and the architecture that will be used to develop the project, there is no development roadmap or costs breakdown.\r\nFrom a technical point of view it is not explained how will be developed the \"verification\" phase in a decentralized way.\r\nThe presence and the experience of the team is indicated, but there are no reference (no company website, linkedin profiles or link to previous developed projects developed by the team).\r\nThe funds requested seems to me really low to developed the \"two sided marketplace\" mentioned in the proposal.\r\nThe complete absence of interaction with the comments and questions received through ideascale is not a good presentation of the reliability of the proposers.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "A simple plan has been described, but it lacks more details, some points need to be clarified, as the payment between the two parties will be made by a smart contrac, it is assumed that after the activation of the described conditions, the payment transaction will be submitted and will be irreversible. As the proposal describes that the smart contract will consult information outside the blockchain, this requires an oracle, which increases the complexity, which may bring centralization to the process and make the idea itself counter intuitive, since there will be a need to consult a centralized Instagram API the \"influencer\" could win the system, removing the ad after the payment is completed on the blockchain. This type of consideration needs to be taken into account and explained to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.\r\n\r\nThere are not enough details about the experience of the team of proposers so that the community can attest to their skills and experiences, moreover, as the idea requires a developer with the ability to create smart contracts, I think it is important that this person demonstrates his skills and expertise. I recommend including links to Github and Linkedin.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is very little effort in the proposal itself that would help us establish the validity of experience claims. It would be useful to include professional links like Linked In or some other presentation that would help us get to know the authors better. Presently it is not there. It also isn't clear what the team dynamic/relationship between individuals are. Some better clarity would have been also useful - including their commitments. Lastly, beyond basic outline of the idea itself and barebone structure - there really isn't any sensible plan nor budget to take this idea into action. It is a pity because it definitely could be an interesting use case.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The dev team seems good, but there is no milestone or plan to prove you've done your part if we were to fund you.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no detailed project plan included in this proposal. Only have vague experience for the team members.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no definition of success for this proposal and there is a complete lack of indicators with which the community could evaluate it.\r\nIt is not specified how many users / contracts / transactions could be expected in a specific period of time and neither is defined a numerical objective to be achieved.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is not enough information to indicate the feasibility of the proposal and whether how it will address the challenge in a relevant way. I recommend describing a more detailed plan, including a roadmap, milestones, KPIS, detailing budget allocation, detailing the expertise of the proposers and generally following the Catalyst guidelines for preparing the proposal.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Unfortunately, there is no roadmap not actual milestones provided in any shape beyond basics of how the idea would function. It would also be greatly appreciated if authors spent time defining clear success metrics or KPIs that would enable community tracking their efforts. There also is lack of understanding about potential challenges or risks. No much thought given there. Hopefully, proposal owners will consider coming back with greater effort as it is very potent concept potentially. But not investable at the moment based on this status.
