Thus, potentially, this is a great use case that we can explore and within merits of the challenge. Farming is a very sensitive topic about in any country that is serious about their sustainability and hence security. However, this still seems just like an idea proposal. It does not go in needed depth that one would expect which I explain in the following sections.

However, I don't see a linkage between the proposed idea and a blockchain technology in general. For a future proposal I suggest to add more information why blockchain in general and Cardano in particular is needed for this approach. Therefore, this proposal does not address this challenge (imo).", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "no concrete plan, timeline, output, measure for success etc provided.

There is no introduction of roadmap or milestones that would help navigate how this project could progress. There is one grand figure on budget request - but it does not go into any meaningful detail that would explain why this amount is right and how it may be allocated. Lastly, it would be really useful to include information about team and experiences from some other source - like LinkedIn - previous work - so we can look at. I am missing that at the moment.

Further, there is no indication of what success metrics one might actually consider and what measurable KPIs we'd be looking at. Knowing that author is thinking about this would be very helpful.
