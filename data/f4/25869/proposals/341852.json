However i cannot give you past 3 stars because, first i dont have the technical knowledge required, second i lack  information in your proposal or motivation of why you chose this stablecoin over another. Maybe add a clear part where you motivate your choice of Neutrino for exemple.

Likely challenges of picking up a protocol from another system and deploying on Cardano needs to be checked by the proposer. Example oracles for price and other factors and provide some inputs on how it will be handled.\r\n\r\n2. Why 10% of ADA reserves will be used in governance as neutrino whitepaper doesn't suggest anything of that sort. Also, there is third balancer token that can be used for the purpose. If the user has to bear the 10% charges each time he swaps ADA to stable coin than that would be too much.\r\n\r\nThere is existing project in pipeline that seems much stronger making this proposal obsolete in delivering value to the platform and it's users.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The comments already state, that this proposal ist already realized by AgeUSD in collaboration with Emurgo and Ergo.

Your idea lacks a Roadmap and Milestones (though you are focused on deliverable but no timeline involved). The metrics used to assess the advancement of the project is also thin or nonexistent (for instance are your deliverable your KPI ?) The risks have not been considered. For instance what happens if you loose interest in the project, will the stable coin not run anymore ? Finally, who and how the backing will be done (your personnal ADA funds for the start?, What quantity are talking about? etc...). You need to provide a more detail version the idea if you want to launch the project + (i think but i might be mistaken) that other projects or future updates are taking care of stablecoins running on ADA network.
