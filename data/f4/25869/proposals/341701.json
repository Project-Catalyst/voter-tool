I think that the proposed solution to connect to local authorities to validate and issue patents is hard to realize and these aspects greatly undermine the impact this proposal could have.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The requested budget exceeds the budget limit available, so the proposal will be automatically disqualified from this Fund. It is not clear what information will need to be stored on the blockchain, would it just be the records of intellectual property ownership? Where will the videos be hosted? In addition, I think it is important that the problem is described in more detail so that we understand the context and relevance of using blockchain, because although blockchains allow the registration of IP ownership, the videos themselves can be copied and retransmitted on other websites / platforms. How would that harm the proposal's concept?", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is a great one even needed for future NFT art and assets in the Cardano network to avoid copy right infringement and theft of intellectual propoerty. There is a need for an unthetication system across the board when smart contracts begin to launch in the cardano network. The only issues about this proposal is how is this made? who verifies the authentication? how is an asset cerified across the board and in the world of venues this could be taken from, created ibto an NFT and sold? what if an individual steals some unsuspected individual property authenticate it in the blockchain and then if it acquires notiriety and attention to the actual owner how can this be verified before its launched and claimed as ownership? what systems would need to be created to protect assets and how would a market place responds to these challenges?", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Very basic concept but it doesn't go into any depth with regards how it aligns with goals of cardano ecosystem. Adding that detail would have been greatly appreciated. I appreciate the problem and solution that is trying to address it - but beyond that - there isn't much to this proposal to be seriously considering it for investment. Adding more details on benefits when launching this would help in that regard.

For the dapp challenge is mandatory to give details about the technologies and the architecture and to provide a development roadmap.

I also recommend including planning according to the Catalyst guidelines.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Without more information regading a roadmap and the metrics use to use the funds proposed in the deployment of the solution it is hard to say what is the likeliness of being implemented sucessfully.

It lacks many basic elements that would make it as an executable project. Adding ability to validate the experience by adding some professional references/links would be of great help. There also is no break down of budget as it asks pretty much for all of the challenge fund. yet - we have no understanding how it would be used. That makes me very uneasy in terms of investability. That would be much better if there was some sensible plan attached beyond concept in itself. Could this budget be submitted as an error?", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is a complete lack of metrics and KPI and the definition of success is not indicated.

As it is it stands as a trust/honor system with potential to be predated as a search of all digital media/assets would need to be scanned across the whole world wide web to determine that is not taken from the other side of the world without the knowledge of real owners. Once is made onto an NFT it fall under ownership of a person that may not be the otiginal content creator. If its done through patents alone this project would be feasible but also limited to a specific jurisdiction and patenting body. The proposal does open the conversation onto the fact that more countries patent bodies could be brought after the success of a small case study which in practice would be great if art, video and other intellectual property could be curated before is made into an NFT and that would create integrity and value in the Cardano ecosystem against other competitors were theft is starting to become a decentraluzed crime in the virtual sphere.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no roadmap or milestones that would help us determine with confidence how this project could progress. Nor does it attempt to list any success metrics, KPIs that can help community determine its validity. Adding elements of challenges/risks would also help illuminate the mindset of proposers better.
