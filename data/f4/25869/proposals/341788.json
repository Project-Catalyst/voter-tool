In theory once smart contracts are launched at Cardano that aspect would most likely fall under the managing body of those tokens later on. I fail to see the need of doing so for every token created of which most would not be used and from the other portion will be cutodied by the marketplaces and Defi/Dapp platforms build on Cardano.
