Certainly, a more fair and transparent way of paying out royalties is something that could be useful. However, I would have preferred to have this proposal more colour added in the beginning to properly set the framework. Someone unfamiliar with the concept may have issues - hence adding a vivid example to outline where exactly problem lays and how this proposal can solve it - would be great. This is included in the attachment but not in the brief itself here directly. Nor will that information show in the voting app. Remember - voters are those who decide what gets voted in or not. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Technically, the proposal addresses the challenge of enabling a fairer and more effective monetization model for use in the music industry. It provides an infrastructure to encrypt and verify content as well as utilising smart contracts for customising preferences between artists. I particularly like the use of a governance layer which incentivises validators to be honest in their work. I also like that it encapsulated NFTs.  At the moment artists generally need to be 'signed' to a distribution label to onboard to streaming services like Spotify, the onboarding process is not specifically outlined in this proposal and is something I would like to know more about.. Overall it is of my opinion that this is a well-rounded proposal concept.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "There several pieces missing in this author's proposal.
