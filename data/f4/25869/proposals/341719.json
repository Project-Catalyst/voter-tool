The idea would deffinitly be good for a start up don't get me wrong but if that is the case it will require more fubding and collaborations than the proposal could deliver.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer has a valid idea for addressing some deep-rooted problems in the restaurant industry. However, the idea does not effectively - in the form that it was submitted - address the challenge brief posed in this challenge.

However, it doesn't go into detail of problem itself. Would have loved to showcase more granual understanding of the problem. It is a bit too broad to state $300B transactions volume in the sector - I would have loved to learn more realistically what the benefits to cardano ecosystem be with regards to that. We cannot assume that we can flip an entire marketshare. Being aware of those limitations help set realistic expectations. So - potentially intriguing concept - but needs work in multiple areas to be considered investable at the moment.

I myself have tipped the deliverer with no thought of how that's shared with the people who actually prepared my meal. That said, the proposal seems to be at a nascent stage and have not fully articulated the solution. There's greater focus on what the problem is and the number of people tit could assist yet the meaty parts of the development is lacking, though that may be why the requested funding is stated to be only $108.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Find those collaborators you are looking for.

Missing few elements to take it there - namely how do we determine relevant experience? There are no professional references/links to external sources that could help address some of these concerns. Not understanding team dynamics either. From the post it seems that proposer is still searching for partners. I would assume these haven't been found just yet. Also - there is en error in the budget? It says 108 ada - which likely means this can get funded - but unsure how to work wit this figure as there is no break down of these in actual proposal. Adding these details is cructial.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "This is where the proposal fails as the experience and skillset of the proposer or any team involved is not presented.
