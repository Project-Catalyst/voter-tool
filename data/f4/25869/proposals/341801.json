The proposal effectively addresses in part the challenge posed but perhaps it can be used to expand on more than be used for a particular field and unveil a gret potential that could exiet if everywhere it is used as a payment system for all jobs. A Dapp that manages wages per hour and that the system just collects entry and exits of shifts and rewards the worker at a hourly basis no mater what the job is. The use case for content creator could be a great case use to start from a particular are and then expand to all work environment. If an individual is logged as working then pay should be streamed as per hour of accomplishing their tasks.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea behind the concept definitely has merit based on many examples we see in the real life. Democratization of earnings is definitely one of the key elements that defi can bring about. However, it would have been really useful to understand how authors are thinking about the whole concept in regards to bringing utility to cardano + how it aligns with the bigger mission/goals. Again - like the idea - but there isn't much at the moment that would help us judge just how impactful it could be absent of greater details.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal aims to create a Dapp which removes some middlemen between content creators and consumers, resulting in lower prices for the consumer and higher payments for the creators. the challenge this app faces is within the adoption, how will the creators remain in compliance with a platform's terms of service? there are some large legal hurdles to climb that may hinder adoption.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Experience seems available but there is not a real plan.
