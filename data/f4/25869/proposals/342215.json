The concept of De-Sci seems very attractive and with great potential for those who dont mind to get some return regarding their genomics data just like people gives/sells blood and/or sperm. Genomics and the industry that evolves around it its getting highly noticed, Cathie Woods from ArkInvest fund is an example of a strong supporter and investor in this field", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I agree that the proposal for launching a Cardano-based version of the $DNA token, integrating with other Cardano based, decentralized scientific data sharing platforms relevant to genomic data, and further build-out a parallel Cadano-based version of the full Gene-Chain platform does effectively address the challenge - especially in terms of integrations.
