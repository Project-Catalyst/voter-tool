However, it isn't an easy task and there is a reason why it hasn't been completed successfully on a mass scale. Cardano tech may just help with that. However, this proposal misses few marks for me in other graded departments to understand its feasibility. So let's see. Community would benefit from the launch of this proposal if it were implemented successfully due to the nature of constraints that regular exchanges have. Fees, custody issues, etc. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think the idea is a great start, and if taken into the future would build a stronger community.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The clearly laid out plan that it's only the initial phase is very helpful. If you had added a more \"drafty\" (stating what you'd initially think of the next phases) i'd have given you 5 stars. Specially since i bet you have at least a vague idea, if not an already plan subjected to modifications.\r\n\r\nFinally, fiat to crypto, in my understanding, needs to pass through either an echange, either an institution. The problem is i dont see the IMF or any other global institution giving you a green light that easily. Maybe phase 1 should also research in this field; then again maybe it's my ignorance playing out.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea is very good, the community would benefit from that. Some similar platforms already exist for other cryptocurrencies, and possible partnerships should be assessed.

Some professional presentation on profile of proposal owner would be great. In absence of such - it is challenging to establish the credibility and validity of experience to undertake such a massive project. Would be really useful to understand if this were undertaking of just one person or if there is actual team in place ready to dive into this. Even this early stage - at least having basic concept of it a bit. I also appreciate budget - but absent of where this is headed (at least a ball park) - it makes it very difficult to understand if it is worth attempting int he first place. While it covers basic budget breakdown but it isn't put against a time scale - how and when this would be ready once funded. That is also a miss for me.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Would feel more comfortable seeing collaboration and team building through this point (good work with comments though).

", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Relevant experience seems a good fit for the proposal, but a bit more explanation in the field would improve the proposal.

I haven't been able to locate it. All things considered - I highly appreciate that this is a tiered proposal to come in the stages. Where it falls apart for me entirely is the fact that it has no outline of future stages whatsoever. I understand that there is a lot of unknown when doing initial research - but community needs to understand what phases down the line could look like.  Proposal mentions this as one of their goals for next section but I don't feel that's enough attention. This proposal only outlines phase 1 but not beyond that element.
