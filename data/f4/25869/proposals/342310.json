The Campaign Brief states \"Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I am missing in this entire proposal is the \"Quality\" part. And it is a critical part. Throughout the proposal there is not enough detail to support the conclusion that this proposal will address the challenge in a fashion that will ensure quality. It is not only the idea (ADA Job offer platform) that is being assessed, but how well the proposal in its entirety addresses the challenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is a platform for hiring freelancers, but there is no detail on how the idea will address the challenge.

But there is hardly any pointers to understand how the technology will be used to deploy project. Also clear definition of the solution are missing like who will this platform serve.

However, the proposal does not provide any details by which its effectiveness can be measured. A platform onto which Cardano dev work can be published and from it, resourced , is key to Cardano meeting its goals but the mere mention of the platform is not enough to properly assess this proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem statement could be improved: \"high demand for blockchain-related projects\" is not a problem by itself, but the lack of tech people to work on it might be. A platform lke this could be useful, as some of this discussions occur in other places already and one place like this could facilitate the process.
