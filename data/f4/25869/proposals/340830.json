The problem statement doesn't present a problem, I suggest modifying it.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Unfortunately, this is heavily underdeveloped idea at the moment. Probably hasn't been worked on and used as an insight more than a proposal. It would benefit greatly from more discussion and added colour to understanding clearly how the solution would help towards the problem and relevance to Cardano ecosystem. Adding more depth would make it more sensible. Interesting concept - but that's it at the moment.

There is a simple plan, but without detailed information, which makes it difficult to assess the chances of successful implementation of the proposal.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Given the state of this proposal, there isn't enough information to make it investable presently. For the future reference, it would be desirable to include information regarding relevant experience with links pointing to it, understanding team dynamics, if in, or knowing where/how the requested amount is going to be spent. You cannot just add a figure without any explanations. That isn't a sensible plan presently.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "No roadmap, milestones, KPIs and budget allocation details were presented, therefore, it is not possible to assess the feasibility of the proposal. The proposal has the potential to address the challenge, but requires more detailed planning so that we can assess the relevance / impact of the proposal on the challenge. I recommend that the proposer add more details and follow the Catalyst guidelines for creating proposals.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is an attempt to outline a small roadmap/milestone of sorts but it doesn't give any additional detail to understand how it all ties together. There also isn't any clear definition of success, nor appropriate highlight of KPIs, challenges, or risks. It is just an idea still - needs more work.
