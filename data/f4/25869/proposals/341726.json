We need a clear definition of what activities will need / can be carried out with the help of blockchain to understand the impact of the proposal on the challenge.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal needs more clarification for voters assessments. Explanation on the benefits need to be made on more clearer terms. What type of activities are we speaking of? what needs changing from the current methid? decentralization not necesarily means transparency, for some blockchain technology is not a thing besides the little they know of Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. Although I can see the potential benefits in almost every field out there creating the tools to make blockcahin technology a transparent term in the legacy systems and institution remains decades in the making.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "IF, the proposer would be able to restructure the corporate bond market, that would definitely bring attention, devs and money ton the Cardano Plaftform - but with the information presented here, not at all likely.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "There's not enough information provided that would help us determine how proposal aligns with the goals of the community.

Needs more depth in research.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is a minimal rationale structure, but there are not enough details to fully understand the plan.

What are the legal obstacles to issuing bonds in blockchains? Is there regulatory clarity? These are important aspects and risks that need to be addressed. The proposal has the potential to address the challenge, but in order for us to have a sense of impact and relevance in the challenge, it is important that a more detailed plan is described. I recommend that the proposer update the proposal, inserting the information that I commented on and that he elaborates the new proposal based on the documentation of the Catalyst guidelines", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "More consideration on a road map or some forms of metrics are needed to be communicated for the feasibility of this project outcome.
