Bureaucracy? Slowness in payment providers? Contractors' neglect? Even though blockchain is a tool that allows automating payment, the contractor must be committed to maintaining funds to make payments. The proposal addresses the challenge, but it is important that more details are described, is there an estimate of values, athletes, companies and parties involved?

It definitely can find its footing. Would have loved to have some real life examples of actual struggle more greatly illustrated.
