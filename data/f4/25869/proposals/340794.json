I would have liked to learn more about business side of the things. The solution seems clear but it isn't strong enough highlighting benefits to Cardano at launch. Part of it may be that attached pitch deck is for deployment on Ethereum instead? Unsure if that is an intention or by accident.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "None of the proposal components required for this idea to have a high likelihood of successful implementation are present: no metrics, benchmark, no timeline or implementation KPI's, no detailed plan or Plutus developer resource identified.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team's website and level of knowledge appears to be in order for this proposal", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "This proposal is a miss for me in terms of budgetary requirements. No where does it break down why this specific amount is the right one. Not knowing what the money would be used for is a red flag for me unfortunately. For the future, some sense of bread down in financials would be desirable. Let community know what have you thought of so we can judge more effectively the amounts requested.

It would be nice to have additional data on roadmap and breakdown of cost spending. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "There are very nice roadmap elements and milestones in the attached document. However, I do have to revert back to a fact that it is a generic pitch deck for deployment on ethereum. It states in there that specifically. Knowing how we'd port that into cardano in a greater detail would be grand. I wish more effort was given to the fact that we are trying to address Cardano ecosystem at large. I know references have been made within the proposal text but really surprised that attached documents have had no revisions or mentions for Cardano specific utility use case. Learning more on how they envision success once deployed on Cardano would have been really useful - some sense of success metrics of KPI elements. I haven't found any meaningful references of these unfortunately.", "rating": 2}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Decentralized finance to let users pay for subscription with their interest automatically.
