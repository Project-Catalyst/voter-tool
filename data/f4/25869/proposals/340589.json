The challenge is calling for Quality Dapps and integrations that will increase utility & adoption of Cardano. A marketing platform that connects the right delegator to the right pool, seems to be somewhat outside - or tangential - to this challenge.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Potentially, an interesting concept. We all know how having ability to match SPOs with the right kind of delegator is great. However, there are some major deficiencies in this proposal that don't take it into an investable idea just yet. It doesn't clearly articulate what right delegators and right stake pool mean and how that matching process is envisioned precisely.\r\nIt is dubbed as a marketing platform - but not much detail is added about actual marketing. Would be really useful to understand on a concept level before diving into it any deeper. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think is a marvelous idea! this is deffinitly a beautiful one. Is hard to align with a stake pool operator because the platform existing is not conducive of transparency use other than decentraluzing the network and producing rewards. But if it can be aligned as communicating hubs where they have their own ways of aligning with individual goals and incentives and rewards could have a % aligned towards a common goal that could go through lections with the pool. This would incentivize each pool to stregthen their niche communities into doing their work in decentralizing the network but also working towards loyalty towards a cause specified by the pool operwtor which can be driven by the micro community of every pool. This would in essence create volunteering and charity towards a common goal.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I understand small SPO's need a marketing avenue to better sell their commodity service, however this is the dapp challenge", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "It substitutes money for initial research.

Therefore, I would need funds to hire relevant technical, legal and marketing consultants for research and prototyping.\") and the team is yet to be assembled.  The budget of USD50,000 is a lump sum, but is not broken down into components and the plan is still in the idea/concept phase.  ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "I have serious doubts about ability to deliver on this task absent of experience and team in place as outlined in the proposal brief. What also worries me is absence of professional links that could establish validity. The provide link goes to a website with questionable quality that also doesn't provide any identifiable details of person(s) behind the project. For the future reference, using LinkedIn profile or other references online would be really desirable. While there is a mention of total grand figure in budget department - it really does not go into any further detail of how this budget achieves the vision in this proposal. There is no breakdown that could help us understand this closer. I would suggest to work on these a bit more and try to resubmit the proposal at the later fund rounds. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Quite a great idea but lack the experience needed and perhaps the support to implement the proposal successfully.

As it currently stands, it seems not fully developed and does not address the challenge directly. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "Proposal does not go into enough depth with regard of how it determines it success. There is no clear definition of such vis-a-vis KPIs or other metrics that could help understand its progress. Or lack there of. This is primarily, my guess - due to lack of having actual team in place just yet. Which also brings me to the point about challenges and risks. Unfortunately, these aren't given enough attention either. I would suggest to work on roadmap and milestones more so that community have greater confidence in investing. Maybe at the later funds after mode detail is added would be useful.
