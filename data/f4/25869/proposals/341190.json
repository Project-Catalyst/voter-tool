Knowing that the Real Estate rules are different from country to country, we need a roadmap that can be repeated repeatedly with adaptation for each jurisdiction to scale up. The project team needs to rely on A KYC/AML specialist consultant, attorney and solicitor per country on top of a blockchain specialist, from my point of view.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a very professional proposal that addresses the needs of the community, allows for massive expansion potential and interoperability across the entire platform.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a great idea and there is a lot of room to build more towards specific markets. I like that the proposal is focused on a specific market (real estate, UAE) as it makes the project less of an idea, more of a real-life proposal. The challenge specifies that we need to find proposals that answer the question \"How can application developers drive adoption of Cardano in 2021?\" This proposal although it mentions crypto investors and buyers, does not give me sufficient information to assess that it is 100% fully committed to using Cardano blockchain. The referenced files in the proposal are not open - and I was unable to access them directly.\r\n\r\nThe proposer does mention \"Competition analysis is also done - basically all competitors run on the Ethereum blockchain (with enormous gas fees) and a lot of them are already inactive, giving us a very good advantage to build a product and make it more affordable and easier to use.\", however this is not the same as saying that the proposer is committed to Cardano for transactions and smart contracts. It may be a given, but unless it is directly stated (no references to using Plutus, Cardano Dapps, etc) - I have to keep my mind open to whether the proposer may switch platforms during the project, if not explicitly committed.\r\n\r\nOne commenter asked \"which language platform will be used (Plutus, Marlowe, etc)? \", but the information has not been reported back as far as I could see. Maybe it was, but then it is not prominent in the proposal and this makes me unable to confirm that the proposal \"effectively addresses the challenge\" as regards to Cardano. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem to be solved is avoiding fees and costs in converting crypto assets into fiat to purchase real estate. The community that would benefit is the one which places a substantial amount of their financial wealth in cryptocurrency. The ability to scale would include understanding written/spoken languages and legal treatment of real estate transactions around the world. This is not addressed in the proposal, but is theoretically possible. Just getting this implemented in Dubai (i.e. working platform and actual, legal purchases of real estate) would be a great success. At that point, this proposal would indeed demonstrate the utility and increase the adoption of Cardano because it allows cryptocurrency holders to purchase real estate without using fiat currency. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This project makes real estate investment accessible to anyone interested. I am fascinated with how far this project would go. A few issues on specifics like the technology and contract details but from what I've seen, it has the potential of solving the problems that have been presented. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal, IF implemented would essentially require a sea change adoption of crypto currency in the purchase of real estate - where there is not a problem now, using fiat.  So can not see practical road to implementation in 3-5 years. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal is the beginning of a very good idea.  It does address a problem that needs to be solved but is lacking in specifics.  For example, will the project have its own token?  Will profits be paid in stable coins or ADA etc.  Done correctly there would definitely be a benefit to the community.  Scaling is really not discussed.  I would like to see more details in terms of real numbers and percentages.  ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Given the other alternatives outside the US utilizing erc20/etc for this, It's definitely a good thing to continually get the Cardano name seen in that space.

The proposal gives me the impression of being still in the conception stage and that a fully fleshed out proposal that is ready for implementation is not on offer yet. So, it makes it difficult to confirm that it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer's relevant experience includes his MBA and IT experience. However, he will need real estate, legal and investment experience as well. He may have it and, if so, should add it to his proposal. Each of these areas is a world unto itself, requiring experienced individuals/firms that know how their area of expertise works in Dubai. While I view this as an excellent idea, the importance of this team cannot be overstated which is why I put this at 2 stars. His team's level of experience and commitment should also be provided, if any. Finally, a budget should be presented. For example (not advice), there could be portions for IT, real estate, investment and legal. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Still in its early stages so it's a bit difficult to tell.

I think that the proposal would benefit from a more thorough plan with clear milestones and a greater focus on the technological side -in order to paint a clear picture of what will be progress and what will be the end integration with Cardano.

Please note that the following is not legal advice as I am an attorney: It seems that Dubai legal counsel will need to be retained to review the legal structure and possibly provide an opinion regarding its legality. This alone will most likely cost more than $10,000 given the novelty of the proposal. The definition of success is easily inferred: investors are able to purchase real estate and receive returns on the packages. The problem to me is the current need to convert one's cryptocurrency into fiat which requires payment of fees and costs which is not directly stated. It should be more clearly stated in addition to any other problem(s) this proposal addresses.
