Monetization can be a factor, but since monetization has not been described in detail there is no way to evaluate it.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "A nice idea and it's in a space (cooking) that does not get a lot of attention. The descriptions are lacking though, and success relies too heavily on marketing to those outside Cardano, which is never addressed.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Peculiar concept - worth exploring but the author doesn't provide enough information to learn about utility and use case more specifically with goals of cardano blockchain. There are some assumptions we can make - tx fees and so on - but would have liked to read a more expanded idea than just few sentences. It isn't an investable project just yet absent of many details in other sections.

No reason/advantage that this needs to be on the blockchain.\r\nPlenty of competition makes this difficult for people to pay to upload a recipe, and not incentive to encourage uploading of reciptes.", "rating": 1}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Just take a look at the Universal Cookbook, where recipes from all over the world await", "experience": "I am a professional developper with webdev, Haskell and smart contracts experience who likes to cook"}
