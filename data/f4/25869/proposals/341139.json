This proposal doesn't, however, outline how it would differ from or integrate with existing solutions (such as Orvium, mentioned in the comments). This could be even elevated to a Challenge proposition in one of the future funds: \"How might we help engage the academic community worldwide?\"", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem statement is valid and raises valid doubts about the current academic publication system that is really centralized. The proposal could be a good opportunity to change this paradigm introducing a new type of decentralized academic publication system driving new users (probably with a greater probability of impact as it is aimed at a specific audience that could know the potential of the blockchain more than any other public) to the Cardano ecosystem and increasing its utility.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal could increase adoption widely and could leverage the existing Cardano enthusiasts in the academic community.

In order for the community to be able to determine its investability - more details on overall heading would be desirable. More detail would need to be addressed around the exact benefits from funding of this proposal which isn't currently clear. It does say about effort to target applications that would bring utility and early adoption to Cardano but there isn't much beyond idea stage semantics? I would love for this to be added with more clarity and form. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Really like the concept and believe this proposal would address the challenge effectively. I like the idea of an alternative peer review for alternative scientists.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The idea is quite raw and it doesn't really outline who is the team and why would they be a good match with the proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Unfortunately the proposal is at an idea stage. The core concept of creating a tokenization of papers and reviews is clear but it is not explained what is the specific mechanics. For example the proposal says that the tokenization of a paper could allow to measure the engagement (number of reads, comments, citations etc.) but it not described how this will be realized from a technical point of view.\r\nIn general it is not clear what we should expect as a final product: it would be useful to describe if the MVP is a website, a mobile app, etc.\r\nProviding a development roadmap, costs breakdown and a description of the team involved (specifying some references about the relevant experience) could also improve the quality of the proposal and make easier the evaluation of the feasibility.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The initial proposal is modest but could make for a good step in the right direction.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "Unable to determine relevant experience of the proposer as there are no external links provided that would help establish validity/credibility of claims. Because this reads more of an idea/concept - there aren't other specifics that we'd be looking at this stage in order to consider for investment. There isn't executable plan in place just yet - no an any explanation in detail with regard to the funding and budget requested. Some breakdown would be desirable first.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The author has academic experience but will need a team to help develop the proposal.

How many users/researchers involved?). It would also be useful to provide an estimate of how many transaction could generate the average process of a paper publication.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "Building this test system is perhaps feasible, but the benefits of that alone are modest.

Knowing more precise understanding of success metrics and/or KPIs would have been really useful.

So - good concept - but needs a bit more work to make it more in line with expectations presently. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Really like the concept but needs further refinement to score higher.
