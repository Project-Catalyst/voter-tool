It could democratize content creation if executed properly. Thus it fits into narrative of trying to solve a problem with the right dApp combination. I would have loved more clearly understanding how author things about this proposal in light of aligning it with the goals of the community. I can make some 'mental' shortcuts and come to conclusions but specific remarks that could nicely tie these concepts together could be well received. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I really like the idea and I think exists a real problem about the centralization of the book industry that could be resolved using the blockchain.

I am not sensing much of a business plan how to make this go forward. For example, there is budget listed but it really doesn't go in any depth regarding how this budget may be used or why it is right amount. Understanding how the author thinks about these variables would help shed more light onto it. With regards to experience - I understand proposal owner has great grasp of publishing industry narratives. What I am not getting much understanding myself is - what team assembled or not/resources are at disposal already that can help make this concept a reality. I would assume a team of engineers is required - but proposal doesn't give any sense of it presently that I can see. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The main picture is clear enough but the proposal lack of technical specifications and it is not clear enough what will be the final product (a website? a mobile app? a prototype of the smart contracts and the NFT?). One critical aspect that should be explained in more detail concerns the mechanism to store the \"text content of the book in the blockchain\". At the moment I think this is not possible to store an entire book (the up limit for metadata in transactions is 16KB) and it is not advisable in order to prevent the blockchain to grow too much. Therefore it will be necessary to use an external (perhaps decentralized) mechanism: it would be great to add this information to the proposal.\r\nAnother aspect that it is not really clear to me concerns the \"reading access\". In the proposal is described that \"readers\" that hold BOOK tokens have access to the Library, but if the books are stored in a blockchain aren't they already visible to everyone?\r\nApart from these specificities it would be useful to have a detailed development plan, including a description of the technologies / languages (in particular for smart contracts) that will be used, a development roadmap and costs breakdown.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "It's a good idea, but I don't see any technical solution.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Seem to have thought through the major elements that need to be addressed.

Nor do we get a feel of what metrics does author think when evaluating success - which KPIs would be desirable to track, etc. Once community funds the project - what things can we track that would make it easy to determine validity of our choices. I would also have loved to learn about existing challenges/risks from established publishing systems that may be resistant to these changes. It would add a lot more clarity into the mix. Again - love the idea - concept over all - but it needs to be reworked into an action plan that can be quantifiable. Which it isn't in the present shape and hence it is difficult to score higher in this category. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Unfortunately there is no indication of what the MVP will be and it is hard to understand what the final result will be achieved with the requested funds. This also depends on the absence of KPIs and metrics that can be used to evaluate the progress and the success of the project. It would be really useful to add some specific goals (eg How many books \"printed\" in the platform in a specific period of time? How many readers? How many transactions could generate an average user or an average book?)\r\n", "rating": 1}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "The BookChain Library & BookExchange creates incentives for readers to discover and consume content while compensating rights holders direct", "experience": "Founder & Publisher of Lifestyle Entrepreneurs Press since 2014.
