But it doesn't go in necessary detail that would really highlight the problem issue and how Cardano solves that exactly. We would need to understand how Cardano would benefit from the launch in better light. There are some elements mentioned. Such as the character set up - but due to the nature of closed IP for the most part - is that the reason why there isn't greater detail presented? Unsure about that. It just states that Cardano users would be coming through use of these characters as NFTs . Would have loved to learn more beyond what seems to be a basic concept at the moment.

There is a mention of the team with 8 members. However, I wasn't able to determine their profiles - hence verify credibility of claims. It would be great if these team members or at least some of them had some professional profiles available in the proposal - links to them - so we can look at who the people behind project are. I am also uneasy about absence of greater budget breakdown.

It really just quotes one grand figure atop. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "The NFT component is the biggest risk I can see here.
