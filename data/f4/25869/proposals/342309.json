The proposed solution \"A collab platform for community-driven content production based on content models with built-in token-based governance on content and models\" does not define the \"Local Community\" well enough in my view.\r\nThe campaign brief specifies that:\r\nThe different LCC categories are: (1) Developers center, (2) DeFi / DAO center and (3) Business center (solving a local problem).\r\nThe concept of \"community\" used by the proposer seems to me to be too vague as I am not sure does the proposer view his/her platform as an LCC and which type exactly? \"The goal is to allow the community to participate in the decision making process and content creation.\"\r\nThe proposer does not directly classify his proposal into one of the three, but does specify the following: \" To address this problem, we are proposing a collaborative platform to organize community-driven content production\".\r\nIt leaves me unclear whether by proposing a collaborative platform, this effectively means that none of the three LCC categories has been chosen, or one of them? We are left without a clear answer to what might seem a basic question as it is in the very title of the challenge. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "I must commend this proposal for addressing a crucial challenge for the Blockchain network. However, I think you can start by limiting the amount of languages you want the content creators to work on. Why? I believe that this project is going to concentrate on a certain region. I assume south America.\r\n\r\nPick the top spoken languages in Brazil. Keep it small and target your marketing towards those groups.

", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is very well presented and the sub-structure with Infoblocks is already in place to build upon an existing platform. Education is one of the biggest challenges for this project as the blockchain can mystify individuals that have no way of understanding the technology, the pros/cons and the greatest opportunities that can be unlocked with a little clarity. I like the idea and the solution it presents. Establishing governance is also a very good principle to include and the community has all the tools needed to build on a platform like this. The only thing I would say to the contrary is that an outline for the various stages needed to get there should be good to follow the progress of the project along the way.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal model for content creation is very interesting and has the possibility to be sustainable in the long run. Also, it creates a mechanism through which the equilibrium between content creation and demand will be equilibrated.

UI/UX designer. D. DevOps. e. IT infrastructure. This means that critical persons would be onboarded.\r\nHowever, the weakeness may be the proposer's own relevant experience to run a project of this nature as this experience seems to be elusive.

It relies on a wide range of diversified contributors contributing to the collaborative platform, however it would be good to have some metrics, some quantitive goals for this period that would allow for the measurement of success or failure. The project specifies that for each content (Infoblock), the team will create an infographic distributed as a static image, a base text detailing the content in more depth, a video with simple graphic animations and narration based on the text. But the proposal does not address how many infoblocks will be produced, how many contributors will be onboarded and other metrics - which makes it difficult to assess feasibility of outcome.
