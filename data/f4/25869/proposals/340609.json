I generally like the concept outlined but as proposal author admits themselves - it would probably need a bit more research to properly identify the problem and potential solutions.

", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I like the basic idea of this approach and it could potentially contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. So the idea itself is within the challenge settings. However, the proposal as a whole is still very abstract about the solution. The proposer states himself, that there needs to be more research. So in summary, there is nothing to implement yet. But the challenge is asking exactly for this. I recommend the proposer to work further on this proposal. And then there could be a successful funding.

I am also afraid - that by inputing text into the budget field - this proposal will simply not be included in the voting app. This worries me because it does speak to attention about detail. Maybe it will be corrected by someone in the review process. As budget field has to include ONLY numbers. That's an unfortunate oversight if that's indeed the case. Other than that - it is also difficult to establish relevant experience for the proposer as no links or references are actually included in the presentation.

How many hours will be worked on this? WIth the information given It is difficult to say if the budget is reasonable. There should also be more specific information about what is going to happen after a successful funding. To say there will research is not enought. I recommend to be more detailed on this in future.

You are at a research stage where your team should be working on defining the business requirement specifications before the developers start the technical work.
