However, there are many informations missing. For example a development roadmap. Therefore it seems to be only a vague idea. The challenge is asking for implementation of new Dapps. If this idea is ready to implement is not documented. There has also been a similar project in Fund3. The proposer did not answer the comment about how he further will add value to it. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "Potentially a very interesting use case. There is a clear attempt to make community benefit outlined for multiple segments, including all stakehodlers such as Cardano, companies, consumers. But I wish there was more in depth executables in the rest of the proposal as it currently reads just like an idea/concept. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is a solid idea, this can bring transparency to the process and a sense of direct contribution to the cause an individual chooses to donate. I like the idea of % being accounted in the process as it brings a real solution to the question has it actually been used to what I donated to. Perhaps a link aubthentication to the funds being transfered can attest to that level of transparency. The token could be custodied similar to how logistics manages an inventory and this from the donating end can be somehow reflected through blockchain identifiers.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is nothing in this proposal a CA could use to verify the author's experience", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer is a software development, but it remains to be seen how it would be translated to blockchain development", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "I recommend the proposer to add links to his relevant experience.

This is namely due to the fact that there are no external links/source for appropriate professional references. e.g LinkedIn profile or other likes of such. There also isn't any meaning put behind the budget requested. We don't have means of understanding what exactly would budget be used for - nor why is this the right amount. Hence it doesn't really speak to sensible plan at the moment. It feels more like an idea - i would suggest to work on executable elements and then try to resubmit in the future rounds instead. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The experience noted reflects a level of confidence in a deliverable outcome but more clarity as to how the funds will be used and a detailed stage by stage plan outlined.
