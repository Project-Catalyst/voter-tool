What type of key collaborators are available to make this challenge happen needs to be addressed, what Defi can be used needs to be explored or created if it doesn't exist and a safe way of creating the links between merchants/suppliers and the demand side need to have access to the technology and the knowledge of working with i for this solution to be successful.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The concept needs more work in how it wishes to address this core issue it describes. I understand the need to create extra income so that families can thrive better - understanding how this solution ties with Cardano goal would be useful. We know that Cardano has aspiration for places like Africa. Having authors leverage that semantics in the proposal and making that link more apparent would have been useful. Other than that - it really is just very short concept and doesn't provide enough details to work with. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Ideascale's current Lingua Franca is English.\r\nEven if you wish to launch a dApp in Portuguese, I advise to at least translate the proposal because:\r\nThe majority of voters will not understand what this is about and therefore will not be inclined to vote for your proposal. Same goes for the majority of CA to review you proposal.\r\nIf Project Catalyst would allow proposals to be written in several languages, the result would be a maze of proposals written in languages from around the world and render the entire project completely unworkable. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "the goal of the proposal is to make a dapp for skill sharing in africa. This would bring additional users into cardano however it is not clear why this needs to be on blockchain. This could be improved by adding in a reputation system which relies on cardano.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is no detailed plan for implementing the proposal and there are no indications of people with the skills to implement the proposal, which makes implementation unfeasible. I recommend that the proposer detail the proposal and join other proposers that can assist in the development of the technical part, as there is a need for at least someone with skills in software development and smart contracts.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The experience is limited in both the technology required to get there and the linkages and collaboration needed to deploy the solution. Education could be good for these families once the applications are readily available to be launched in Africa. The plan presented appears limited in the deliverables, more clarity needs to be outlined to drive the solution through stages that create a structure that the funding parties cna follow over time.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Unable to determine relevant experience as there are no links/references provided. Hence we don't know much about authors and their past experiences to validate. Nor is there any understanding why budget of 50k USD was chosen.

More consideration as to how the beneficiaries of this technology can create the linkages required to kick out intermediaries and educate both merchants/suppliers about the operations behind decentralized finance applications and how to work with transactions in the internet and such.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no actual roadmap/milestones that we can look into. This also means we don't know how to measure success as there are no metrics here either. KPIs, challenges, risks. None of things things have been introduced into the mix.
