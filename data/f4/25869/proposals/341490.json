Blockchain can be used for many things, but for some purposes just switching to blockchain does not mean that adoption will follow. I am not convinced from this proposal that it will help application developers drive adoption of Cardano in 2021.

Would have loved to learn more about how this helps align the community goals at large. I like the utility aspect of it from educational/institutional point of view. Adding more colour to this idea would help it be more investable. It reads more like a brainstorming session about a problem that most definitely could use a creative solution. Maybe dApp is a way forward - but establishing that validity would require a bit more research to understand more exactly how it can be used in real life.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "A single proposer, with no detailed plan and a very modest budget seems unlikely that this could proceed to fruition.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The described experience is very vague. There is no real plan presented. The proposer also didn't answer questions in the comments.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Usually, education systems are based on student paying for education and less on teachers remunerating students for doing their work. The proposal does include some novel ideas, but they remain on a conceptual level and there is no specific plan and experience that indicate that  indicate it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.

Authors do not provide any links to professional references or profiles like LinkedIn. It would help clarify the claims better. There also is clear missing element of budget breakdown. We can see one grand figure but it gives us no indication as to what it is going to be used for exactly? Adding these things could help alleviate these basic concerns. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "I like the idea but it does not have anywhere near enough information to assess feasibility. There are overlaps with Prism and other projects and if this were expanded on with sufficient detail it could become a viable project but it is not ready yet.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "Using smart contracts for the proposed solutions sounds like an creative approach, but not very feasible. The needed flexibility is hard to do with smart contracts and the effort to implement them is pretty high.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "I think the proposer would be better suited by including a more specific plan with milestones, KPIs and a better focused gameplan for realization.  It is also unclear how the funds would be used and I am still not convinced that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "I feel that this area is not adequately addressed. The author's experience is not detailed enough to judge his suitability. However, given the small amount of funds requested, I believe that this should be given the chance to at least pilot.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "This proposal reads more like a concept than actual executable. I would suggest adding elements such as roadmap or milestones that can clarify the heading of proposal and determine its goals. To understand these, establishing success metrics is something to be desired. There are none such at the moment. Also - adding elements of challenges/risks (if any) would allows us understand the mind set of proposal owner as well. More depth will help this proposal in the future in case it doesn't get funded this time around.
