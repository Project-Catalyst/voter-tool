Where I am struggling with is that the proposal does not really explain in good detail how it aligns with the goals of the community nor how the utility will be brought around.

It would have helped me greatly if more attention was spent on that point so it would eliminate doubts of how it plans to be implemented on a technical level.

Possible to accomplish this app as an individual but may want to consider hiring additional people and making the project open source but there isn't mention of this.

However, it would have helped to understand how the concept of Nigeria is tied with the proposers. Is one of them from there, living there? Understands the medical environment of the country, etc. I couldn't determine that. Perhaps part of it can be attributed due to no external references/links to professional profiles - like linked in or past work projects. That would really help eliminate these issues very clearly. But that is the lesser of my issues. What raises another question - there is no actual budget breakdown or any financial heading. It states one grand figure but we don't have any sense of why this amount and what we can expect it to achieve once broken down into different buckets.

Best of luck!", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is a nice roadmap graphic in the slide deck. That also brings about some key milestones. I noticed that your last one says you will celebrate after launch. Unfortunately, I couldn't grasp what a success story looks like. Prior celebration - we would need to establish what success metrics to track, which KPIs to consider. Absent of these - I am not sure how we can determine validity of investment just yet. It helps narrow down the focus for you as a proposer but also us as a community. While there is pretty good identification of problem and proposed solution - I would have loved to learn more about challenges/risks that authors are thinking about implementation of the proposed solution. Adding all of these elements would have greatly elevated the proposal. So I think it has some legs - but needs more attention to it.\r\n\r\nFYI - quick feedback on the attached presentation - customer pain points slide needs to be adjusted as it is difficult to separate the text in between - just a formatting issue. So helps to 'proof read' the proposal before submission. Thank you for putting it together - made it easier to navigate the thought process behind this project.
