First of all, if I understood correctly, this is an App where you specifically go and browse ads, is it? What about the 99.9999 % of other ad junk that we face every day in different media? Personally, I wouldn't use the app. Also, apart from using ADA for payments, what does it have to do with Cardano? Can't you build something like this even without blockchain?", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "It is a magnificent idea and something deffinitly needed in today social network circles. The challenge posed and the solution are a major step forward in materializing a proper model that can support both worlds and promotes more transparency to the process. No longer depending on the predatory nature of businesses taking advantage of data without proper consent as to their use. Proud that this solution is one being implemented in the Cardano network and would put a spotlight into the benfits of Cardano in such a huge pervasive aspect of user experience in the internet of things.

If adoption was widespread there would be a great impact on the Cardano ecosystem.  It does address a problem that needs to be solved, the community at large would definitely benefit.  However, without seeing a business plan that addresses how the Dapp will scale.

However, ADA / Cardano is not mentioned even once (not even in the EULA). I get a feeling that you wanted to do this anyway and now you jumped on the opportunity to finance the developer's work via Project Catalyst.

The website for Profila presented is \"broken\" (i.e. is not working on Chrome).

There's also no mention to the BAT/Brave system and how they system is different.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The budget and timeline seem way too low to accomplish what is outlined in this proposal. The proposal also does not take into account the misalignment of incentives between businesses and consumers regarding advertising. (use brave browser as the example). Also I am wary of this project gaining any real traction given the sheer laziness of the average person who doesn't want an extra app or steps just to protect themselves.
