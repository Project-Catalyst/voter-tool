So without addressing those concepts the proposal would not be likely to be implemented, thus not address the challenges.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "I can see the passion and drive in the proposers but the project seams alot bigger than what the team vould handle in a short amount of time. Theres no metrics as for stages of development and how much of the funds get used on each step to create the solution. Another issue is the widespread adoption of ADA is not matured there on a institutionalized level and across the nation to bring in key investors, institutions and even securities. The idea could narrow the approach to a achievable goal in which the platform can grow along the key players needed to get there as the years pass. This would be interesting starting from Africa and perhaps with tiny homes movement bringing along sustainability and growth in that area to start given that is probably in the next years will have a whole system that will embrace Cardano, will have the ADAS, and institutional level will be onboard into adopting this proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "very competitive space littered with failed attempts any successful attempt would need to launch an ICO and have sizable liquidity ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "As mentioned above, the proposal graphic seems to be aimed at Multi-Level marketing approach to adoption, without saying so.

When dealing with property, people and the system is much more complex to applied solutions. More careful consideration on the fact that the whole population doesnt know what ADAs are, what can blockchain do or how to get into that ecosystem. Therefore the approach should be focused on areas where mass adoption will be a reality in the next couple of years.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "it is a complex topic and IMHO it seems a little lite on deeper content to deliver a scope for the 50k USD requested or detailed deliverables ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal talks about using 60% of funds for salaries.
