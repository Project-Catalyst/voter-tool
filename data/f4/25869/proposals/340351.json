However, the key blockchain-related aspects that are relevant to the metrics for this challenge [Did our efforts manage to attract users to the platform? Did our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano?] do not seem sufficiently well thought out.\r\nMost of the focus is on the simulation of existing apps - with the Cardano integration seemingly coming as an afterthought: [\" will allow the app owner to deduct a backend transaction commission (This part needs help from crypto experts)]\r\nI would like to see more focus on what needs do users have that could be solved by this proposal\r\n", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The Dapp proposed it is a system to manage reservations/orders through the Cardano blockchain. In general I like the idea and I can think in some ways could bring new users into Cardano, but at the same time it is not clear which are the specific aspects of the blockchain in general and specifically of the Cardano blockchain that can add value to this general concept. Therefore I think this Dapp, at least at present, it will not have a big impact.\r\nIt would be really useful to focus on this concept and elaborate some mechanisms that can add value to the general idea, exploiting the advantages that decentralized technology offers (Just to say: \"a token for loyal customers of the network that can be traded?\", \"A mechanism to trace the food chain of the ingredients used in dishes?\")\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think this is potentially an interesting concept. However, it reads more like an idea/concept at this stage as opposed to actual proposal. Hence I am unsure about its ability for desirable impact as it is today. I would love to see the proposal owner come back with more in depth analysis looking at what efficiency/use case there is for creating dApp of this choice.

It would be really helpful to voters and assessors to provide a detailed technical plan that describes in-depth the technologies, the architecture and the languages that will be used. Specific attention must be given to those aspects that are linked to the blockchain technology (which at the moment are missing).\r\nIn the proposal are mentioned the team members and their skills but it would be great to have some external references (linkedin profile, previous projects, etc).\r\nAlso a costs breakdown and a development roadmap could be useful to better promote the proposal to voters and assessors.\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "It is challenging to establish validity of experience claims. There is no professional page or similar links attached that would help alleviate those concerns. Next time would be really useful to include. Further, it says team is ready to go but there is no sense of what team looks like at all. Would have been useful to see. There also is just one grand figure about budget but not much sense can be made in how/where is it going to be spent at. Hence, it is very difficult to give this proposal better rating absent of these basics.
