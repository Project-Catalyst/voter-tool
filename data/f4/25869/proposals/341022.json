The proposer should be much more specific about WHY and HOW this approach will really improve liquidity and adaption of ADA/Cardano. I also don't see evidence, if the proposer is really able to execute the solution. Maybe he is, but there is no evidence. The proposal sound more like a vague idea which needs much more planing. The idea itself could be impactful, but as I said, there is much work to do. So a funding in this stage seems to early and the success seems to be very unsure.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Potentially interesting concept - unfortunately it is in a very basic idea format at the moment that hasn't been worked on and hence there isn't enough information that would make it easy to understand utility within Cardano ecosystem or where authors envision this to sit if funded.

I recommend more details about the proposer's skills and professional experience and whether the proposal will be conducted with just one member or a team.

I suggest to add links to references. The budgeting is not defined in detail. So it is hard to assess if the amount is reasonable or not.
