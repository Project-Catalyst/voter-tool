How important would be a dapp? From what has been described a conventional app could solve the problem. In order for us to understand what the impact of dapp on the blockchain is, we need to know what type of transactions can be carried out on the blockchain and what type of data would be stored on the blockchain, so that we can have some sense of how the proposal will address the challenge", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea can be cool, but it lacks an incentive.\r\nThere is no mention of a ROI anywhere, so it would basically be money down the drain unless there is a way to make this profitable added in the proposal.
