However, for the price tag of 50000, and based on what would be delivered initially, it seems a little light on the progress toward decentralized exchange. I'm curious how much of that would be spent on building the website and what are the features provided. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "A DEX is needed on the Cardano platform but this idea pursued by other proposers as well so there is need to demonstrate better understanding of technology, showcase skills needed and more detailed view of the deliverables an also the ability to successfully deliver the same.\r\n\r\nPlan seems good at a very high level and there seems to be enthusiasm to pursue the project but more research and work on proposal is needed.\r\n\r\nEx. A functional model and a flow is missing. Though it is mentioned that model will be taken from Uniswap DEX initially a clear understanding of the technology used in Uniswap should be demonstrated. A governance and economic model of the project needs to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a need to furnish more details and information on technology used  ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Indeed, I think that the proposal does effectively address the challenge of  ensuring that application developers help drive adoption of Cardano in 2021. A DEX is a great proposal and it does effectively address this challenge. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal clearly states a missing piece of the Cardano picture and a clear solution in filling that gap.  To date, there are no operational DEXes within the Cardanosphere hence the solution is critical to Cardano's roadmap and goals. Provisioning of another mechanism by which ADA can grow and its value to increase is beneficial to both the protocol, its users and its token holders. Despite the fact the proposal admits using uniswap as a baseline, the mention of 'a few modifications' hopefully makes the solution more ADA-centric. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "There are a few DEX projects currently. I am a bit concerned that the plan / roadmap laid out here is not comprehensive enough for what amounts to pretty ambitious goals. So while the goal of building a DEX platform similar to Uniswap is certainly relevant to the challenge, the amount of information provided about the project is on the sparse side presently.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a great use case for what can be built on Cardano to bring great utility. DEX is definitely something that is prime for adoption on the network, and it has been chatted about for so long already. Thus it fits the challenge brief of being a problem that needs solving - centralized exchanges have their share of concerns that we are all acutely aware of. What concerns me the lack of development about the whole concept. I would have preferred greater detail explaining the impact on cardano ecosystem. I can probably guess, but proposal itself doesn't give much colour in that sense. Which is a pity.

It will be interesting to know how much experience is the developers in building the exchange as this is a hard problem to solve. Based on my current initial take of the proposer experience, I'm not sure if he has all the tools necessary to build a full decentralized exchange at the moment.

There are no skills or experience demonstrated to work on Cardano platform or similar projects on other platforms.\r\n\r\nThere is need to build a strong team to deliver a project of this kind.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with team experienced in similar projects on Cardano platform would be helpful.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has requested funds in the amount of USD 50000 - without a breakdown of the budget. I think that the proposal's weakness is a lack of documented (in the proposal) experience and the lack of a concrete plan with deliverables, milestones. The proposer offered a Planned Roadmap, which seems insufficient to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal seems to be on the right track to deliver its promise given the proposers background. However the lack of details on the development plan, resources and budget itemisation places its current status at too high a level. Additional information and breakdown is further required in order for the rating to increase at a more confident level. There seems to be a dependency on the Daedalus wallet's development to permit integration with the dex, which would be put of the proposers control. Perhaps a plan B will need to be considered/presented should IOHK deem modifications to Daedalus out-of-scope. There is also a dependency with Goguen's completion, which may also have an impact on this solution. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "I am quite uncertain about the potential for success of this project. While the author seems competent in certain aspects, a DEX is no small undertaking, and as far as I can see only one team member is presented. To me there is a disparity in the amount of detailed information presented on the project plan and the actual ambitions that are laid out and inherent in any DEX project. Forking Daedalus and getting integrated into it in a secure fashion is also no small undertaking. Thus I have to rate the likelihood of this happening at Plutus launch or even pre-Alonzo being rather low / uncertain.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Great concept - but where it falls apart for me entirely is inability to establish credible references. There is no understanding of what team (if at all) is in place and what dependencies are around it. Including a professional profile, LinkedIn or something along those lines would help alleviate some of those concerns. Further. which is likely the biggest issue here - proposal is asking for 60k USD but makes no effort to explain why this is the right amount and what things it will actually drive. It would be great if this was resubmitted at later stages with proper detailing so community can make a sensible decision. It is just an idea at this stage.

This is a very tough problem to solve, and would like to see more action items in the project plan for example:\r\n-A wireframe for the GUI that allows to trade\r\n-The plan for building the matching engine within the exchange.\r\n- How would the exchange manage liquidity.\r\n- The plan to issue tokens for the exchange, similar to BNC, etc.\r\nI understand that this is an initial roadmap, so much haven't been given thought to.

There is also not sufficient information about the proposer, apart from general information. It does address the challenge - as an idea, but the whole package is not evident in the proposal. The devil is in the detail and it is sadly missing. It can be fleshed out and proposed again in the next fund, if not successful.

It also makes a subtle indication that it is very much aware of Goguen's east release date, which the hierarchy of Cardano Foundation & IOHK themselves have not completely made official. To this effect, a question mark is raised on what impacts a Goguen delay will have after the proposal claims a release on the same day  in Mainnet.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "I like the author's proposal but I wish more information had been presented for such an ambitious project. There is only one team member at present, no possible Plutus candidates have been named to implement the contracts that will be used to make this project work, and there is not much more than an idea presented regarding integration into Daedalus, which is in itself a very ambitious undertaking. With more information about these subjects I might feel more confident in this project's viability, but as it stands there is just not enough to convince me.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "This project will require some major work done. A small attempt at some sort of roadmap has been outlined. However, it doesn't really go in depth against timescales on what milestones/when would need to be met. There also is no attention paid to success metrics, KPIs that would help us understand how the authors are looking at their long term view. Lastly, really no mention about what challenges or risks are considered in light of the proposal itself. Thus - great idea - very much needed - but there is nothing in this proposal that would project confidence to invest it at the moment. I encourage the proposal author to resubmit in the next round with greater depth that such big project would deserve.
