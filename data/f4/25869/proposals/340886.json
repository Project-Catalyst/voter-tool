The experience is warranted with the business successful  development capabilities but there is no metrics or plan defining the steps and funds used in making this proposal appealing to the voters who fund these challenges. More clarity could assist toward facilitating their decision of this project over other high contending ideas. What  differences can this proposal bring that other wallets don't provide already, what benefits are there for the adopters, this could be in the form of security of assets and identity or like stipulated in the challenge to be used to authenticate access and mobilizations with smart contracts and Dapps and Defi projects.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "We all know that mobile first is a winning strategy in today's world. Mobile devices dominate the ever growing markets. However, the proposal doesn't go into any actual depth that would explain how it can tie it all together. It really seems very basic and more colour around proposed solution would be desirable. I am afraid - it it's current form it is ins't investable just yet.
