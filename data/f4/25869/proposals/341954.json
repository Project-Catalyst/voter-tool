Perhaps would have been suited better under ecosystem challenge - but I assume it will do here, too. Nonetheless - fan of such work.

", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "Yes the project can work for sure because he has some nice extra applications. It can locate the adoption of the pool operators through the globe. But in my mind he will need a tracker because if I have lets say 10 pools by my self. I can have 10 through my family lets say me my wife my children my mother etc I find this project cool and nice especially if big corporations come to make profit of the pools.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "Having followed the project for some time - it is clear that there is valid experience in delivering this tool online. Would have liked to learn in greater detail about other potential team members that could join in if funding is provided and what they could bring to the table. Adding that colour into presentation would have been very useful. Maybe a joint video with them of sorts, etc. In other realm, however, I must show my reservation a bit towards budget. It would have been very useful to understand how this amount is what it takes to take it to that next level. There is only one grand figure but no explanation of how we can validate various buckets. When watching the longer video - it does speak about budget lightly - but only in terms of getting more work done and other people involved. It would have been very useful to break it down in greater detail so we can see allocation of those funds on different tasks and what resources are needed for each. At the moment - it is a bit confusing and we can't establish that neatly.

Including ID references to understand how staking decision would unfold. That's very neat. I would have probably liked to learn more about at what level does author consider this a good effort. Adding some targets on how many people would utilise the tool itself, etc. At least getting a sense of where this could be. So that we can benchmark the utility better once this is deployed and funded. I would have also liked to see more detail in the roadmap vis-a-vis timelines. Which segments how long would take and hence earlier mentioned resource allocation to get them complete. That would add more substance to it. But in general - fan of the work - just needs a bit more data to make it easier to audit progress or lack thereof once funded.
