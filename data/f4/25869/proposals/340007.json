From execution part of it seems to be a bit lacking as next review sections explain. However, for challenge brief - it is fitting in. What I am missing is understanding how this fits into the narrative of existing marketplaces for general tokens and how this proposal actually fills the void. Making that distinction clear in the mission brief would be fantastic next time.
