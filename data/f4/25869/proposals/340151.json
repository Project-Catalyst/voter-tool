The use of tokens is clearly defined and meaningful. Also, I think that a significant connection of people who will take part in decision-making in everyday life can be expected, given that there is a certain saturation of the current political parties and political system.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Very interesting use case that could potentially make a great effect on governance systems. However, what I miss is how does one get government to 'buy' into this concept. It is a great idea but I would need to understand how and what will proposal owner leverage exactly to ensure that this is something that their local government - in Croatia - is actually willing to consider. It is easier to come up with solution than to persuade stakeholders to use. More on that topic would have made this case a little more compelling. There is some attempt at it during 'budget' breakdown section but it is too generic to be meaningful to understand its impact.

A successful implementation could have a positive impact on a democratic process. If such a system will run upon Cardano, our community will benefit from it. Therefore, this proposal addresses this challenge.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I am not sure whether this system refers to the possibility to elect representatives or to vote for any micro-decisions? It seems taht you would like to go for the latter solution. At the same time you talk about funding for the proposals, an element that adds to the overall picture but does not improve on the clarity of the challenge you are addressing.

A complete dapp.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Creating a fully functional Dapp is very likely according to the plan from the proposed roadmap. However, its implementation in the existing political system is very demanding. The roadmap states that its implementation is expected in the elections in Croatia in 2024. I think that without a good previous presentation, which would aim to raise awareness and bring the Cardano network closer to a wider audience, the likelihood that the existing political establishment will adopt such a change is significantly reduced. Maybe it is good if in the meantime the application would be applied at lower level elections e.g. local elections, and then the success of the idea and its implementation could serve as an example for raising the popularity and raising the ladder of political life throughout the country.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Unfortunately, there are no external links nor sources that would help us establish the relevancy of experience presently. This would have been fixed rather easily with providing a professional profile link (e.g. LinkedIn, or previous work experiences). Nor does the profile proposer say anything either - just a letter F. I would have expected a clear author identity to understand the credibility. it is a pity because idea is potentially very intriguing but absent of this - I would find it very difficult to fund at the moment. Further - proposal does not address budget breakdown in a meaningful way beyond abstract separation - which makes it impossible to justify pricing in a reasonable way beyond some level of trust. Including specific budgetary requirement/budget allocation would be rather important element to include.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Part of what is unclear is the background of the proposers and how their experience can lead to a successful implementation.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "It looks like, that there is an experienced team. But I recommend for a future proposal to add links/references so that the community is able to validate the experience. So a funding will be more likely. I would also like to see a more detailed budget plan, in order to say if it is reasonable or not. The development plan sound reasonable in general. But for me, there are still important questions unanswered: How do you get a country/government using this solution. If they currently do not want to have full transparency, why should they use this solution?\r\nCreate such a solution is one thing, but running it successfully is another thing. The information about this aspects should be more specific.\r\nThe roadmap says that the election in Croatia in 2024 will run on this platform. Is there any linkage between the proposer and this government? This is not documented, so it seems like an idea, but not a sensible plan. If the proposer will be more specific on this aspect, I thing there will be a good chance for a successful funding next time.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "there are some minimal details about the timeframe, but not many details on the technical aspects needed to develop the project.

As for the efficiency of solving the challenges, I think it solves the problem described, but I think that a multi-stage roadmap should be set up, and the main goal would be to vote in all political elections based on blockchain technology and the Cardano platform.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "Proposal touches upon the fact that some version of existing dashboard is available. Yet, no information/screenshots or additional colour is added to understand it better. Would have been great to see this prototype that is mentioned as drafted already - it would make it easier to understand the thought process of the project and visualise some of the abstract elements of this proposal. On the other hand - I appreciate the timeline that goes into years ahead - because it is rather expected that political change is difficult to enact. Introducing solution like this proposal is a way of changing/challenging status quo. If that is the case - I miss some detail on how author thinks about challenges and risks associated with this project. How is project going to tackle the expected headwinds on its implementation? That is the big elephant in the room for sure. I believe, in its current form - it may be somewhat too ambitious to convince a government to utilise such tool. If I read this in the proposal itself - it would make me feel more confident on the thinking behind all of it.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "The success criteria is very clearly defined and feasible given the explicit assumptions already presented.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposer provides a solid roadmap and also some metrics to assess the progress.
