Cardona being a multi -asset platform it is a must to have a native DEX for the tokens on the Cardano platform.\r\n\r\nEffectiveness of the proposal should be based on functionalities and economic model of the proposal. Functionalities of basic DEX are well discussed but the economic model and other important factors required to attract more people to the platform would be needed for assessing the solution better. Also there is a  need to attract people to  invest in liquidity pools unless EAMM has a solution to tackle the liquidity issue which is not very clear at this point in time.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The project appears to be a valid use design for this challenge although I am finding it difficult to give higher rating as it seems to be focusing on the preliminary stages (UI design).

They do appear to have the necessary skills to further develop their understanding. I feel they would benefit greatly from exposure/interaction with the IOG team. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "UI/UX experience is good to test initially but the roadmap of the solution to achieve the end goal along with clear product information is much more important. Assessment based on the end product functionality is something that I will give more wieghtage .\r\n\r\nGood to see that various phases of the project are being mentioned. A brief description of each stage is necessary to have clarity in terms of deliverables which is missing. Also, there is a missing stage for testing. It would great to have testing with the community possibly with the test tokens before going live. This test phase would help the product to be more robust and well-prepared for Go Live.\r\n\r\nDEX isn't a novel idea thus there is reference available in the current crypto environments so it is important to have clear information on the steps involved. Thus more research and information needs to be furnished.\r\n\r\nTeam capabilities seem to be up to the mark considering experience in relevant products and native tools on Cardano though reference to completed projects and more clarity in terms skill would have had better impact. Considering the team lead is involved in multiple projects he might spread thin thus making him less efficient.\r\n\r\nIt is good to see there is research done to bring out the disadvantages of DEXs in other systems. Also it is implicit that DEX on Cardano will not include high gas fees but a clear economic model would suggest better on how the fees on the platform will be  minimised for best end user experience.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal seems to effectively attempt to address the cosmetics of the project before the actual implementation, and leaves the community in a high risk position.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "The Milestones in Phase 1 are extremely vague and not at all fully scoped.

I understand the work is in progress as the section is yet to be updated. The EAMM protocols seems to be the backbone of the solution thus having it available will boost confidence of the advisors. If not a whitepaper a more detailed information or illustrative flow charts or diagrams would help us understand the approach better.\r\n\r\nEAMM will be a good to have with the discussed features in the proposal while the product will still be valid as long as it provides the swap capabilities but there needs to have clear definition of the backend technology used.\r\n\r\nWether the DEX will integrate with the existing wallets on the Cardano platform(Daedalus & Yoroi) or a new wallet will be designed for the purpose. It needs more information to answer such questions.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "50k for the UI/UX is not an effective investment.
