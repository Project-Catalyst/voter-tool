However, the issue that has not been addressed in depth is the \"quality\" aspect of the integration. There is a fleshed out story aspect/blurb of the game, but the technical side is not well presented making it difficult to see the quality aspect.

What I miss that could make it even better to understand is adding elements of how it all ties with the cardano community. I can come to some conclusions but having author lay these out clearly would be very beneficial. How does it all align with goals of the community at large and what can we expect once given funding. Interesting concept - just needs a bit more work to tie it all together.

The cross-platform aspect of the games makes the proposal even more challenging and there is not sufficient information provided. The budget remains a lump sum that is not differentiated and broken down. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "Given the demo provided in the comment section it is clear that the game development itself is well underway. It is likely that the games base functionality will be successfully delivered based on the games current state, however the proposal states that it will require 2 programmer who's level of experience has not been identified  as of yet and therefore cannot speak to the experience of future development team members and their level of experience and ability to deliver on the integration of the Cardano blockchain for payments as well as asset tracking.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Unfortunately, there isn't any sense of the team cohesiveness or knowing who would actually be carrying out the work. There is a mention of it with remarks to budget justification - 2 programmers, graphic designer + marketing - but we don't really know who or where these people come from. Having some external references about the team and getting to know them would be great. Maybe linked in profiles or past professional references? This also ties back with the budget - given the amount requested - it isn't clear how it is going to be allocated beyond few words about hires. There really needs to be greater clarity in terms of how money shall be spent in order for community to make sensible decisions.

Proposal reads more like an idea stage that hasn't bee thought through entirely. It would be great if more in depth walk through of what authors plan to do be offered. It would allow us to look at things like success metrics more meaningfully. Authors state that they are targeting 50,000 users - but that seems more like an arbitrary goal than actual success metric? Would be great to understand why 50k over any other figure. Are there any other sensible KPIs that we could look at and track progress? I am sure there must be some more to consider. There also hasn't been any mention about challenges or risks either. Adding all of the above elements would improve the proposal auditability greatly. I would suggest to add these and re-submit proposal at the later stages once again. Great concept - but needs more work.
