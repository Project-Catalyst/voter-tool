", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "Seems like a very interesting consideration for how the ether could be added onto cardano ecosystem - it most definitely would find a use. However, I would have loved this proposal to talk how this proposal fits within the context of ERC converters as well. It would be a very interesting tandem to consider in the bigger/grander scheme of things. Further, I would have expected to learn more about cons/pros of regular exchange between tokens vs. wrapping it and how it effects the utility, too. However, bringing this solution alone - would definitely be a way how to increase utility. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "tokens now can support a new token as suggested natively. proposal does not address this, nor kvm, which would allow a solution without need for oracles. The proposer seems to lack sufficient Cardano knowledge and expertice.\r\nNo reference to ongoing etherium development effort and smart contracts timeline.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "I would have loved to learn more about the team members. There is one LinkedIn profile only. It seems that is just one of the team members? The proposal owner actually doesn't have any professional links added, or github repos, or anything that would help us establish validity of claims. That's surprising somewhat. Other team members' skills are listed - but again no actual links to verify who is who. Next time, this would be really useful to include. There is a budget break down - but categories seem to be rather broad. It would be useful to narrow it down to understand how the proposal authors are thinking. At this point - it is difficult to understand how well this particular budget aligns with their vision.

Overall I find the idea not explained well enough, and the need and outcome and usage unspecific. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is an attempt to define KPI/success metrics. We aren't able to learn how quickly do they expect to reach the 10k monthly users and total amount of $value traded. Target feels somewhat arbitrary as it is communicated presently. This could have been added for further clarity of what's possible. There also aren't any specifics or broad interpretations with regards what challenges/risks are associated with this proposal. It would be very useful to learn that perspective as well.
