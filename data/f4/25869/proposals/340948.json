Theoretically anyone could create native assets on Cardano and distribute it to anyone as a reward and this could be done through Yoroi or Daedalus, what is the purpose for a specific app? Is there a financial model to add value to the token?", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "Potentially, a very interesting use case. However, for the purpose of proposal submission - it seems to be too short on details how it can and will leverage Cardano. There isn't an obvious connection made by authors. The video and website talk in general about the grand vision but it isn't tied down the deliverable specifics unfortunately. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I found it difficult to locate information in this proposal that directly refers to the development of a DApp on the Cardano blockchain or integrations with the Cardano blockchain. There are references to tokens, decentralization, Apps (not dapps), etc... But the tehnical details that would allow me to judge that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge - are not easily seen or available in the proposal. The proposal focuses on presenting the idea of KarmaPoint - a Personal Reputation System. The idea in itself is interesting, but on its own it does not address the challenge directly as an idea, without details and a plan.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team described + 20y in Mgmt, technology, business, Blockchain, Devs, but there are no details on previous professional experiences / skills.

There is one grand budget but it doesn't really go into any verifiable detail what it would be used on exactly. I would suggest looking into these elements first to create greater confidence for community to consider this proposal in the future.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is a lack of information about the technical skills of the team concerning the possible development of the DApp, Plutus smart contracts and integration with planned apps and the Carano blockchain. The information might exist, but it is not presented in the proposal in a way that it can allow me to assess that it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. There is a lack of a structured budget, while the lump sum of Requested funds in USD 58000 that is requested is not explained. More milestones, deliverables, deadlines for components would be welcome. The plan mentions that the beta App will be launched by April 21, what I would like to see is more information about the DApp and the integrations with the Cardano blockchain.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is not enough information to check the feasibility of the proposal and understand the need to create an app, a token and if there is any financial model for the token.\r\n\r\nThe description presented doesn't indicate how it will address the challenge in an impactful way.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no roadmap, nor milestones listed. There is some timeline listed on the website of the proposal - but it just lists very basic items of when idea was conceived and some bigger picture goals. However, this proposal at its present stage doesn't go into any detail that would help community understand what it's definition of success is, or any KPI metrics considered to make it appropriate the investment amount. Given that this is also a social subject of 'rating' people and their experiences - there are no challenges/risks associated with the proposal either. What if people will not want to be rated by an algorithm, etc. Those are philosophical questions but potentially some barriers/challenges to overcome. I haven't sensed any of that reference just yet. So - to wrap up - great idea - but not executable at the moment in its current shape and form. Please, re-work and let's see you in following rounds.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "I think that the proposal is heavy on the concept and idea, and weak in terms of execution details, specific timetables and information on how well it integrates with this Cardano specific challenge for Dapps and integrations with this specific blockchain (not just general references to blockchain technology in general). References to tokens - do not have to mean that we are talking about Cardano-minted tokens, details need to be specified by the proposer in order to improve the chances of the project being accepted by voters. I would add the necessary details and resubmit in the next round, if it is not accepted for this funding round by the voters.
