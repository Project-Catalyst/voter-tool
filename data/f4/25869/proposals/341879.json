The scope is manageable and the described solution will be a nice application which uses blockchain in a meaningful way.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "First of all, I love many approaches that think outside the box and the proposer here clearly has a novel approach and enthusiasm for proposing a new model to approaching and using NFTs. The campaign brief for ths challenge states \"Novel and viable applications get built of top of Cardano attracting users\". I would agree that he is proposing a novel application, however I am not completely convinced in its viability based on the presented information. More detailed information would be required from the proposer to ensure that the viability of his idea is clearer. As its stands now, it mostly seems like an idea that has been pitched - whether it is viable is unclear without a presented plan and more details.

However, I would have liked to learn more how the solution would present benefit to the cardano community at large. There isn't a specific link made presently that would make it very obvious.

If the team does have the ability to source from the talent and resources such as Developers & Programmers, Project Manager, Large pool of artists and Marketing & Brand Design - it would be best to include more information about that. Also, a budgetary plan and a timetable with deliverables for the plan would help this proposal make much more headway and it would sound more convincing.

There also is an issue with how the relevant experience is presented. We are unable to verify the claims as there are no links that would let us know who proposers are and what their backgrounds are. Simple linked in page or professional work from past be very useful. There is a reference to stake pool operation - when looking up on adapools and following webpage - it doesn't answer questions on identity as there is just no information that would help on that front.
