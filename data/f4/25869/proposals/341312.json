I think it hasn't been worked out in detail just yet. A proper analysis of benefits to Cardano community in a more coherent way with down to earth numbers be very desirable. It is easy to claim millions of users can come to Cardano by following up this route - but we need to understand how exactly to get there. I am missing that element here greatly. Good idea but that's about it at the moment. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Perhaps you could take someone working with Yoroi and meet up with THETA who already collaborates with Samsung.

How can community benchmark something effectively? Also - proposal should look then into what challenges/risks are to be considered.
