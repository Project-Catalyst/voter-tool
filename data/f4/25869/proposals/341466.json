I would have liked more clarity on tying the notion of benefit to the Cardano community at large. I understand the concept of airdrops - but for someone coming in and reading this proposal - it may not be immediately clear when presented in voting app or so. As in - what is hiding behind the fact that 1 ADA needs to be added to each airdrop, etc. So adding that element of how this benefits the end user through better efficiency and costs from the entity that airdrops these would be great addition for clarity. But kudos for the concept at large.\r\n", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "I had to reread this several times to figure out how it works. The detailed plan needs more details and step by step elaboration to correctly understand it.\r\nSo I had to guess and hope I understood it correctly.\r\nI think it is explained best by using an example:\r\n'A' wants to send an amount of 1K ADA to 'B'.\r\n'A' needs to send 1K ADA + a UTXO-cost of 2 ADA in order for 'B' to receive 1K ADA. The service in the proposal would have 'B' send 2 ADA and 'A' send 1K ADA to the server.
