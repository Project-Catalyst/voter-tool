If decisions of individuals are conserved in the blockchain, it is easy to track the process of an distributed decision process. The application might also be attractive to a wide audience. My only doubts are the costs of transactions on the block-chain that might make the whole decision process simly to expensive.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal does not effectively address the challenge with no reference to past projects, technical docs or detailed development roadmap.

", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal provides none of the technical documentation or detailed project plan a dapp requires to be fully reviewed (Technical docs or Whitepaper both non-existent).

It wasn't clear to me what is the connection between this idea and distributed decision making.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal is well structured and this gives me some indication the team has the experience to drive the proposal forward.

However, since the problem you're trying to solve was not elaborated in sufficient detail and had conflicting explanations, it's difficult to determine how success will be measured. Will this be measured through increased adoption of Cardano and increased community involvement, or through improved decision making? I think there's a risk that you might create a great product that one will use. You clearly demonstrated strong technical and project management capabilities, but I recommend elaborating on the business proposition (or value proposition) of the product or service that you're planning to build and why would the community use your products and/or services instead of comparable solutions from other teams.", "rating": 3}], "videos": [], "media": [], "solution": "Creating open-source governance tools and proving documentation\nA permanent mark on Cardano blockchain to share the plans and decisions", "experience": "Created voting dapps w/ Solidity, Hyperledger, and Solana tools.\nTeam Leader, Project Manager, Front-end Developer, 2 Back-end Developers"}
