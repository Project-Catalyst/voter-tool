There is also a lot of text describing NFT's in this proposal which most users already fully comprehend, instead where you would *actually* want A LOT more text there is barely any, specifically the Business Model in bold \"We intend to create a self sustaining DAO that will incubate NFT innovation and collaboration\" how can you say this but not fully describe this how this will be accomplished in a technical document? Points 1 & 3 after this make very little sense without a complete example scenario fully describing them, point 2 is a feature of Cardano transactions not anything you develop, so my point remains you should add a lot of context to this Business Model section, its sorely lacking currently.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal described is essential for different NFTs related Dapps to share a common structure, this would facilitate the process of creating new dapps, reduce costs in the development of distinct frameworks and facilitate the integration between differente dapps, so I believe the proposal addresses the challenge and has everything to make a significant impact for creating Dapps on Cardano blockchain.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Documentation mentions a single \"framework\" to be used for all NFT's.  Nowhere in the challenge is that mentioned as an objective. And risks stifling creative experimentation.

The problem statement and solution refer to a previous funding in fund3, which is not yet voted on.\r\nThe proposal aims ot build part of a NFT-DAO solution, yet it is not exactly clear what about it. It is not made clear what moving from MVP to alpha and beta testing will accomplish. The outline of the proposal is intangible to me.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "A lot of text, but I struggle to find what is this project is really about. I'm a bit lost...how does this project promote standardization? Perhaps I missed something, but isn't the process of minting NFTs standardised? Will this project be a meta-marketplace? In which way the existing NFT projects will be complements and not competitors?", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The roadmap is extremely vague in this proposal, it's never made clear if any of their fund3 deliverables have been completed and I am still searching for any technical documentation, architecture diagrams or other docs describing the technical components of this protocol in depth.
