It addresses the challenges in almost every level. Such as:\r\n\r\n\"Guiding questions\r\nQ. What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?\r\n\r\nA. Geochaching is a direct analogy that has very broad adoption and seriously committed participants.\r\n\r\nQ. What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems?\r\nAgain Geocaching. See https://www.geocaching.com/play\r\n\r\nQ. What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?\r\nA. Using Blockchain for FUN!\r\n\r\nQ. What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?\r\nA. This seems not to require as high technical sophistication as creative. And the proposers seem to have plenty of that.\r\n\r\nQ. Metrics.... All of these metrics would be verifiable.\r\n\r\nUsage of applications developed during the challenge:\r\n* Number/growth of application output\r\n* Number/growth of application transactions\r\n* Total volume of Ada involved in application transactions\r\n* Total/growth of resource usage by applications\r\n* Number/growth of distinct addresses mentioned in application transactions\r\n* If the application uses tokens:\r\n* Number/growth of application tokens\r\n* Number/growth of distinct addresses holding application tokens\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal provides a fun solution that could potentially bring in a lot of new users into the Cardano ecosystem ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is certainly interesting but not at all for a specific dapp to be developed.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "This is a very well thought of and very well written proposal. However I fail to see its direct link to Cardano's mission aside from the obvious marketing and minimal use of the blockchain for the the rewards and prizes. To me, this sounds more of an event with Cardano taking on the role of the sponsor, unless of course there is a direct correlation between the puzzles & tasks to Cardano. It also does not address how the event can be exposed to people who are not at all familiar with Cardano. I can see it being a good way to engage with existing Cardano natives only.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "Great idea and proposal, I can see a lot of people being attracted to the space in order to get involved with this. Being a mix of reward, puzzles and community seems like an appealing approach.

The information provided is very detailed and is to be expected from a team who has completed similar events prior. The fact though that we are still in a pandemic almost negates any physical aspect of the Hunt and the fact only Europe was mentioned somehow gives it a very euro-centric view. Each country has its own way of managing the pandemic and no assumption should be made as to how normal things are, which this Hunt seems to have a reliant on...hence the score.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Team of people, lots of information on who they are, what they have done and what they are looking to accomplish here.

A detailed budget is also presented but the estimates for hiring developers and hosting sounds look a bit low... experienced developers would be required, which would be hard to find at $2000 a month.

", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal provided sufficient information to give this event a measure of success from the clear explanation of the rules & the tools required (it demonstrates previous experience) and are even transparent with the skillset it needs to on-board. The metrics are what you would expect to measure success for this kind of solution, however, as its main challenge is to expand Cardano awareness, simply measuring click rates, film views, number of participants, etc. is not enough unless the metrics can clearly identify people who had been previously unaware of Cardano. As mentioned under Impact, I can see this as an event that would end up mainly engaging existing Cardano-aware users. Perhaps this proposal should be represented to a different future Catalyst Challenge rather than under Dapps.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "Roadmap and milestones are presented and the logicial breakdown of costs along with the team makes it seem to me that this will go ahead without issue.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal seems to be clearly thought.
