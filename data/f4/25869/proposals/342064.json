The proposer specifies that the Dapp would be able to \"2. Transfer money from one account to another using Blockchain technology\" I am not clear does this mean money or ADA token?

Why can't they just use Cardano??", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal describes the intention in design of a money transfer platform using Blockchain technology (also known as \"wallet\").

I believe that is the case and maybe this proposal should be placed in the next fund so that it can be a follow-on from the Updev-Community-et-Cardano-Catalyst/342154-48088 proposal and also possibly they can then answer why this would be better than just using Cardano.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "\r\nThe described plan lacks details that allows to measure the chances of success.
