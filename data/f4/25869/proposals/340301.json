The concept is well laid out on problem level. Community would benefit from the launch as it would be bringing real case utility with great educational and environmental impact. This goes well in line with the ethos of the Cardano chain as well. Also - peer reviewed paper goes in a great detail of the project ideas, too.

It would be even better if it was stretched out more vividly against a milestones. At the moment, I could gauge that the project is headed for a 3 month upgrade. It would be great to understand what comes next and how the project would sustain its momentum after first funding runs out. I also understand that the extra help needed is not secured in place. Which is ok but would have liked to learn if some initial conversations took place with potential candidates and if that team is quick to form. I couldn't understand commitments put in place presently. Hence, I like it - but would need a bit more information to ensure proposal owner is indeed thinking about these things.

There is some sense of it within budget section but it isn't clear enough.  It suggests some deliverables are within 1-2 or 3 months. But it doesn't tie it together just yet. Would have loved to understand how three months for which budget shall be used helps achieve these goals on a timescale. Nor there is a clear understanding of what success looks like in the event of job well done. It would be useful to include information about KPIs or other useful metrics that could help us gauge how this project progressed from today to the future point.
