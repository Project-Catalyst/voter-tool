The question of whether this proposal is submitting a \"Quality Dapp and integration that will increase utility & adoption of Cardano\"  remains open in my mind. I am not convinced by the proposal as it seems a worthy goal, but many issues can be found:\r\n\r\n- if the proposed index, a measure to be used as a baseline of value, is such a valuable idea - why hasn't it been developed yet.\r\n\r\nThis proposal not only looks at the new idea as a concept, but also proposes to integrate it to a blockchain. However, many arguments are laid out that seem to be partly wishful thinking:\r\n\r\n-  The market will have confidence that standardized prices for BHN commodities are accurately established.\r\n- Producers can use the Item Banc Engine's data to determine where the most profitable markets are to export their products, to properly hedge their production and inventories. - - The financial markets will have a better way to value currencies.\r\n\r\nThese are claims with far-reaching consequences for this project, but are based on suppositions and as such I am not sure about the \"Quality integration\" part of the proposal.

BHN should be definitely defined in ways that it can deliver accurate standardization across the market.
