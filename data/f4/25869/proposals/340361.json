But I don't have to like the game if you have evidence that people do play it. I like the fact that you have thought of having a native token and a play mode in ADA as well. This might actually be an interesting way for spreading out native tokens created on Cardano, if people got to play with their own tokens (Community Mode). Also, to really reach the masses, have you thought how to bring it to mobile (Play Store & App Store)?", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "This seems like a great use case for why a platform could migrate to ada and instantly transfer its utility over.

I appreciate adding colour onto history of team members. That is also great. I would have, however, expected to have some direct links to individual professional profiles. Just something for the future reference. Where it does miss for me is with regards to the budget. There is one grand figure only and it doesn't go in depth how the funds are going to spent against timescale. Right now it is just one grand figure but no indication as to where/what exactly individual budget segments are. That's a bit of mis for me unfortunately. Maybe a clearer presentation of funds spent would be desirable.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "Sufficient information is provided to demonstrate that the game has been running on tron for an extended period of time and that the developers clearly have an understanding of how to create the game.

There is some indication of it vis a vis what they have already done in the past via dApp radar. However, it doesn't go into what milestones they wish to get at going forward specifically. It would help understand what KPI/success metrics levels are going to be considered. I would also have loved to learn more about challenges/risks associated with deployment from TRON to Cardano.
