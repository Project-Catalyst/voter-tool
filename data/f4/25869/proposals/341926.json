However, the campaign brief for this challenge calls for \"Quality Dapps and integrations\" and as the Onomy token and platform does not seem to be fully established yet (tokens coming in Q2, according to interview on Youtube with Onomy's Lalo), it is hard to judge the Quality aspect in advance.\r\n\r\nThe problem statement by the proposer states that: \"The cost of no bridges is the inability for ADA to access established DeFi ecosystems.\" However, Onomy does not seem to be an established DeFi ecosystem, rather a DeFi ecosystem that is to be established.

Removing friction points is very desirable. However, I would have loved more information about current status of Onomy network that could highlight the interoperability. Some quick online research has yielded results but having that in proposal directly would have been super. In an effort to add more weight to the proposal.

The relevant experience lists two examples, but provides no details.\r\n\r\nAlso, the proposal would have been better served if it included a more detailed  plan of the planned work to build a bridge to Onomy and Cosmos.

It is listed there some relationship with RINA project - but it doesn't explain in what capacity really, etc. Or which SPOs partnership is formed with. Nor there are any relevant links that could speak to validity of claims. Such as professional webpage, profile, etc. There is only link to Onomy protocol whitepaper. There also is missing budget breakdown beyond one grand figure. Understanding budget would have been very useful in that regard.

On the other hand, the quality part of \"Quality Dapps and integrations\" remains open in my mind and I fell the proposer should have provided more in his proposal to address that aspect of the challenge.

Would love to understand or read more how the success is going to be quantified.
