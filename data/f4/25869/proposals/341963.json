In my view it does directly address the Challenge - as it is formulated: \"How can application developers drive adoption of Cardano in 2021?\"\r\n\r\nThe addition of a voting platform is a good way to marry the benefits of a public blockchain such as Cardano with a clear utility case - leading to the attraction of a larger audience of users", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The voting in Cardano is a success of unimaginable applications. The use of the technology in these regards serves as an example of how it can be achieved, there are ways that it can be rigged with the current system until we have verifiable identities locked tot he process someone could create multiple wallets and accounts to stir decisions with simply dividing the ADAS into 3k worth across these bot wallets. At the moment there might not be a  reason to suspect it can happen but future more complex decision-making could be compromised to arrive to whatever goal desired.  As the system of governance grow some of these concerns will precipitate.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Integrating voting with things like identity solutions eventually will require the use of dapps, which when properly built are open and transparent. These are critical qualities for a voting system and so the proposal does address the challenge.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Great use case. It is one of the early examples of what can come out of the community. Knowing that this has been a pioneer project early on and without funding - would be very keen to see what can be done if extra help is provided from community. So love the concept - I do have some reservations with the rest of the proposal form but in different categories though.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer has relevant experience in running stakepools on the Cardano testnet and main net and has provided examples of existing working \"Proof of Concept\" for Cardano On-chain Voting at https://vote.crypto2099.io (mainnet) and https://testvote.crypto2099.io (testnet). The plan is focused and it seems highly likely that it will be implemented as planned.

The plan laid out here is detailed, clear, and to the point about its goals. Being a supplement rather than a competitor to the larger voting ecosystem being developed furthers the likelihood of success.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "Given the pilot success of this on chain voting during SPOCRA - I have every confidence that the experience needed to work through iterations of this catalyst app are in place and locked. Some reservations with regards to the budget requested. I would love to understand more if it were broken down into smaller buckets so we can better understand how each portion helps elevate the process and efforts within this proposal. That would have been really useful to see. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "In my view the proposal does provide sufficient information for me to assess it as feasible and it does address the challenge.

", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal is really well detailed and the solution for this challenge is very important asset of the Cardano network compared to other existing competitors. If we can get it done here we can get it done out there with opportunities to increase the mass adoption of the technology to more than a cryptocurrency. Perhaps a roadmap of how this process can be integrated in real life and what methods would be employed to create a scenario where it is prototyped would be great to create a stronger case for this solution. Perhaps the voting of a region in Africa once the governments deployed the technology or a company example of a prototyped used to research the requirements, the shortcomings and the process of onboarding needed to be used in the process of getting there.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal clearly describes its goals, illustrates how it intends to be supplemental rather than competitive with other voting solutions e.g. by targeting real world demographics that may be interested in transparent governance. It clearly describes what the funds will be used for and is requesting a modest sum. It takes into account plans for future iterations and has clear intentions of integrating into promising emerging identity solutions that will improve the attractiveness of block chain voting in general.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "Some sense of roadmap is presented with section of what happens when funded - but would have liked to see more of what that looks like on the timescale. We don't have a clear understanding of when these milestones could be reached. There also isn't relevant attempt to quantify success metrics and which KPIs in author's view would be useful to track. These are important for community to track progress/success of the project in itself. Perhaps - number of entities onboarded to the voting mechanism, or number of votes cast, etc. These would be really telling on how desirable such solutions are. I also would have liked to learn more about challenges/risks (if any) that author considers in developing their ideal version of proposal.
