There is no information to explain this need in the proposal. YOROI is an official Cardano wallet and already offers support to the Asian public. In addition, Cardano already has support in several wallets, so why should we spend treasury resources to fund the inclusion of ADA in ImToken wallet? What would be the benefits?\r\n\r\nMore details are needed to understand how this proposal can address the challenge.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This company says they support \"imToken is an easy and secure digital wallet trusted by millions.

Why would a working platform need 200,000USD to list Cardano into its assets? More clarity as to the use of the funds proposed to launch a listing in Imtoken.

However, this proposal is just at the concept/wish stage and lacks a lot of workable elements in the rest of the departments.
