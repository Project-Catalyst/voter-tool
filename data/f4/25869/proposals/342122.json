The problems that I see is, that the main problem is not a technical. There are quality news that rely at least less on ads but they need to get the fund from other sources like subscriptions. Getting people to pay for subscriptions it hard and even if the applcation would find people that are willing to do it, I doubt that the \"producer\" of the article would have enough incentive to provide different news as they already have for their existing newspaper.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think that the proposal has merit and is a good idea, however the weakness might be that it seems still to be a concept in development, not fully thought out.

It has definitely a great use case that could be deployed with help of cardano ecosystem. Would have liked to learn more why Cardano is really the right choice from authors as well.

There are no external links provided that we could look at previous work done, some references or just professional profile of sorts like Linked in. Learning more about people would end up building this solution is a key element that I'm presently missing. Going even further - I am missing break down of budget against deliverables.
