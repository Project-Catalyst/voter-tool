As this teams wants to start a campaign on LinkedIn it addresses the challenge.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The question in the challenge brief is \"How can we encourage entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds?\". I think that the proposed idea to utilize LinkedIN/Social Media to achieve this goal is a good approach. However, there are some problems that I see in the proposal itself, as the proposal does address the challenge - but in my view it doesn't do it effectively enough. Effectively is a key word. What do I mean? I think that the proposal is not focused enough on encouraging entrepreneurs, which is the focus group. The proposer suggests: \"Post this Challenge on LinkedIN/Social Media and ask for comments, invite people to ideascale to create profiles and review proposals.\" Creating profiles and reviewing proposals - is not the immediate goal. Reaching people over social media does not automatically translate into encouraging entrepreneurs, and I see this as a weakness of this specific proposal. It could benefit from much more added detail and a very specific gameplan on how to leverage the advantages of the LinkedIn and other social media platforms to attract companies and entrepreneurs. The proposal is too generic in my view, without a well-thought out plan.

However, I can't find evidence on the given links (LinkedIn, company website). Well, you don't really need much experience to start with online marketing. However, experience helps a lot. To reach a large target group organically on LinkedIn, you need a large network, which the team may have (500+ on LinkedIn). On the other hand, paid ads on LinkedIn are very expensive (approx. 10$ per click!). I am missing a detailed plan on how the budget is going to spend. So, I can't judge if it is reasonable. For only organic traffic (incl. content creation) it seems to be too high (as I work in this industry). For a paid campaign there is no specific plan (including KPIs). In the comment section is also something mentioned about brand building. But I don't find it in the proposal itself. In conclusion, I am not sure of the success of this proposal.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The timeline is detailed, realistic and with clearly market dependencies. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "As regards the experience and the plan, I think this plan lacks sufficient detail for me to be able to asses it as \"highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully\". The proposal seems to be still more in an idea stage, while the difficulty in most proposals is the very detail and precise series of steps that will be implemented. The requested funds are USD 25000, however the proposer also specifies in the proposal and the comments that he will \"be working with two other proposals to create some branding and marketing collateral, so $1000 to infographics,\r\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Infographics-Series-1/340837-48088\r\nand $1000 to swarm sessions\r\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Voltaire-Assistant-Swarm-Sessions/340811-48088\"\r\nThis raises more questions - what happens if these two other proposals also receive funding and why would this proposal be allocating additional funding to two other proposals that are already applying for funding in a separate effort. What if all three proposals are selected by the community for funding, do we have an overfunding situation. These are important issues that involve community funds and need to be thought out well and addressed by the proposer.\r\nI would have liked to see more information about the proposers experience with Linkedin promotional campaigns, metrics, other proof of the proposers suitability to implement this project. This would not be an absolute must, but in the lack of it - a very detailed plan of steps would have helped. Both are lacking.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposer claims to be experienced in marketing and HR, which gives them the right tools in order to undertake this project.
