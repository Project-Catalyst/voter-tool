The challenge brief does specify  targeting \"entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem\" to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds. The student population at large across many geographies might be too large of a group to target \"effectively\"  and that word might be key. And it would help to subtarget the student/entrepreneur niche. I think this proposal would benefit from specific focus on a specific group of students. The proposed \"Worldwide audience\" is probably a weak point of the proposal, as it may be difficult to address such a wide and diverse group with a project of this size.

LinkedIn profile and attached document).\r\nThe presentation of the plan is confusing (most details are in an attached document instead of in the proposal itself). The idea itself is to do social media advertising, send newsletters and do \"activities to engage\" (what does that mean?). In the KPI/Campaign section is also a Zoom/Twitch stream mentioned. A specific plan how to reach this people is very unclear. Yes, there will be videos. But what is the plan to get clicks? How do you reach your audience? Does the proposer already have the email addresses he wants to contact (and why 2000 emails a day and not all at once?). The proposer only provides \"ideas\". But a plan looks different. It should provide more details on \"how\" you implement your ideas instead of saying \"what\" is your idea. Therefore, I have to doubt that there will be a successful implementation.\r\n", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "Despite the need for rigorous analysis of which platform is best, twitch has a good reach for gamers and the proposer can work on this full time ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The proposal might have benefited from more attention had the crucial information been available directly in the Ideascale editor/page.
