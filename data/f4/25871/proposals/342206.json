Sensible regulation and establishing new projects will of course help Cardano to grow. The challenge is about to strengthen Catalyst for the next funding rounds. I am missing the linkage to this setting in the proposal.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The problem he/she wants to solve is a real issue. Regulation is still an uncertainty in our industry. However, this part of the proposal does not directly address the challenge. He/she also wants to initiate projects for Cardano. The described project (Integration, Adaption, Research) could contribute to the community right now and are useful to build upon them in the future.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is not clear on how it would improve outreach to potential proposers. For the select group of identified potential proposers, there isn't clarity on how the proposal would bring them into ideascale, and the entities are not named but spoken of in broad terms.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal presents information in a \"food for thought\" format rather than a cohesive description of a solution with a plan. It does not appear to be aligning with the category challenge and does not seek to provide results for the next two funds. ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "No detailed personal information in the proposal and on the linked website are presented. So, it is hard to judge if the relevant experience is true or not. I understand the budgeting as an initial funding for this long-term approach. So, I think the amount is fair. There are many plans in this proposal, but they sound more like ideas because the proposer missed to proof that his network and experience really exists. Stay anonymous in crowdfunding makes no sense to me. So I suggest for a future proposal, to add verifiable references. Then it would be much easier to judge whether a successful implementation is likely.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "An experienced team with great network is mentioned, but there is no link to \"real\" faces. So, I have to doubt this until there is a proof. He/she has many ideas how to contribute to the Cardano network, but the plan for implementation is too unspecific and for this reason questionable. How the budget will be spent is not described in detail so I can't say if it is appropriate.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team behind this proposal is not identified, and there is no clear plan on how it would be implemented.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 2, "note": "As per the proposal, it appears there is a team of like-minded thinkers with experience in judicial environment. They mention they have already started undertaking certain steps to realize their plan (unclear). They have potential to secure funding with a better written proposal that does a better job communicating their wants and needs to the voters, as well as applying in the right category. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "I have read this proposal several times and also the proposers' answers to comments, but I am still struggling to get the point how this approach will contribute the community right now. Yes, I understand, that the proposer has a long-term approach. But how to get started remains somehow abstract. There is a roadmap, but it left me with even more questions. Where does the proposer get the big fashion brand? There is no evidence of a real connection between proposer and a university (maybe there really is, but it is not documented). Lobbying in EU for digital Euro? The ECB is already official working on this (https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/index.en.html). The proposer stated \"concrete steps (\u2026) for introduction to regulators\" but missed to say what the concrete steps may are. The goal is to get Cardano on the radar, but how does the proposer measure it? Again, I think the basic idea of this proposal is important, but for me the proposer missed it several times to make it really clear and comprehensible. Therefore, auditability is quite hard for me.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 3, "note": "The milestones are mentioned without a time horizon. Only one metric/KPI to measure success (4 AI projects). One last thing: Does the proposer really know much about Cardano? It is likely that he/she does. But especially the comments about integration of existing project of other blockchains to Cardano brought me to this thought. Which one does the proposer really mean, because many/most functions of Cardano are still under development? We all love to see Ethereum tokens converting into Cardano tokens. But if he/she had been more specific on this, it would be way easier to imagine how the community would get it because of his/her commitment. All in all, the proposal should have provided more details for the community regarding plans, risks and experience.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 3, "note": "There is no mention of how the proposal can be measured for successful proposer outreach.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 3, "note": "The proposal does not provide any detailed information on specific timelines or expense breakdown for funds requested.
