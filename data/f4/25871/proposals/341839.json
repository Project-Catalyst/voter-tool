The proposal doesn't demonstrate how the solution will lead to more proposals on ideascale, and it wouldn't deliver value to idea scale within the stated timeline.", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "This doesn't really help bring outside entrepreneurs into the Cardano ecosystem. Also, if one cannot use her local currency to buy ADA directly from e.g. Binance, they can always use services such as https://localbitcoins.com/ to first buy BTC and then whichever other crypto.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer is seeking to increase adoption by allowing more people onboard into Cardano with their fiat.

Yet anyone, anywhere can buy ADA electronically on various exchanges by converting local currencies on such an exchange. A simple smartphone suffices to perform this action.\r\nSo what this proposal concludes is just the creation of another exchange. Which raises the question; Should we really create a new exchange from the ground up when there are multiple initiatives of integrating with existing ones? ", "rating": 1}, {"question": 1, "note": "I think this proposal is very well defined step forward towards establishing connections across those areas of the unbanked and to further develop bridges needed to establish exchanges that help the institutions but also the users on these jurisdictions. Another think to consider is if this hasnt already been scoped by Cardano member at IOG as there are plans in place for that area and also if the need for local exchanges would be required if in the region exchanges, market place and loans are all carried out in the network. If local exchanges are required and havent been explored by African deals in the areas Cardano is working on then this proposal will be of utmost value to the community goals.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "You have a big proposal/idea and it is good that you do a first round catalyst in order to assess the situation clearly. However i cannot judge this idea more for one main reason: there is a lack of definition of the terms. For a project with such a big scope, you should really develop more the idea.  The main problem is see with your idea from the start is the legal one, how are you going to tackle this or in which direction are you considering exploring ?

The main reason behind it is there is no metric to evaluate the whole thing. Moreover, when you state \"knowledgeable people in the Cardano community\" who are you referring to ? How do you plan on reaching out to them. Finally, you are aware of the ammount of work needed but you need to add more granularity to it.

Are they to developp the legal entity or ask an already existing legal entity to review the project ? Or anything else ?
