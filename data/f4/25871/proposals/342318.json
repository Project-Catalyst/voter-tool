And yes, reaching out more young people to understand what Cardano & Project Catalyst would be one of the option to grow the community.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The idea behind this proposal is essentially strong, but feels like it hasn't been fleshed out and streamlined sufficiently - in my view. The name of the challenge under which it was filed is \"F4: Proposer Outreach\" - hence, to me, the main weakness of the proposal can be summed up by the fact that it does not really mention or dwell on the \"proposer\".\r\nThe specific type of proposer who is the direct target of this challenge are \"entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem\". Not only the general German population, or the student population. Yes, of course, proposers are to be found among them, but a more guided focus on Proposer Outreach would have been good, in my view.\r\nPopularizing Cardano is a noble goal, but a bit more focus on attracting enrepreneurs specifically might have improved this proposal further and strengthened its chances. I would not be discouraged if this proposal does not pass (it may!). If it is not selected now, flesh it out with more details and with the \"uncaptured proposer\" in mind.", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "As one of the most advanced economies in the world, being able to spread the Cardano message across Germany would very likely have positive impact to the Cardano ecosystem.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The focus of this proposal is to educate students about Cardano and Catalyst. So it can be seen as within the challenge setting. Explaining the potential of Cardano (here for the german audience) can be an important contribution to the community. ", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposer is aiming to create an online information hub with additional marketing to target German students in order to educate them on Cardano. This will not include anyone outside of German community who arent students. In addition, it appears the project will require more time to gain traction, and will miss on next two funds, therefore 2 stars. ", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "It's a great challenge and the proposed solution appears to be a great start to develop a platform for Germans interested in learning about the project can promote the efforts of the community. Focusing on student is a great way to start as through intellectual initiatives they can find the value in understanding the technologies and could form teams to develop more presentations and ideas to be on the spotlight.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 1, "note": "Whilst the proposal has merit and benefit to the targeted community there is an issue about longevity and the maintenance of the solution past the graduation of any students involved. However, the motivation of the students is a good counter to the lack of experience. Provisioning of information to a language other than English is required for Cardano to achieve its goals of being a global protocol. ", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "With that budget and the target market is student/young people who use website & mobile phone, this proposal could be implemented successfully. It would be great if more German universities or students now about Cardano & Project Catalyst.

However, while the proposal may be implemented successfully -  a website and the hosting of events \"that make Cardanos vision visible for all Germans\" - it is also a question whether building a website can \"make Cardanos vision visible for all Germans\" - among other initiatives. A build it, they will come model my not work the best in terms of Proposer Outreach - it might, but the proposer should make the case for hs idea. Also, education about Catalyst is only one aspect of Proposer Outreach. The company involved has not yet ben founded, the proposer mentions that for some tasks he \"can share no references yet\" - in responses to comments. Some additional metrics or ideas on how to assess whether the proposed plan would work - would have been welcome (Did we get proposals from outside our ecosystem through our initiative - and how to we know?)", "rating": 3}, {"question": 2, "note": "The plan is vaguely described and it's not clear what experience the proposer and his team have regarding Cardano, or even technical experience on the development of websites, videos and effective advertising.

The breakdown of the funds distributed across the stages appear reasonable.
