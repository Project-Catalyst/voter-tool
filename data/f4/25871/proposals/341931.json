", "rating": 3}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal doesn't describe how it will address the challenge in a relevant way, an informational website about Cardano doesn't actively address the participation of entrepreneurs in Catalyst and has a very broad approach and for a diverse audience, the focus of the challenge is on entrepreneurs who can come to Cardano through Catalyst.", "rating": 2}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal seems to address a solution to a missing piece of the puzzle; informing more people about the on-goings of Catalyst. Whilst the focus on informing of Catalyst will be to those outside of the Cardano Community, to inform them of the availability of funding through this mechanism, such a site will also be of tremendous value to Cardano users. None of the people I've herded to invest in the ADA mission are even aware Catalyst (or voting for that matter) existed and they are in the IT industry.

It's a little difficult to assess the proposal given there's no 'dev pathway' required save for the site creation and hosting, which the team claims to have already prepared so in a sense it is really just the content that is needed.
