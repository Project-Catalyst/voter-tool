", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal addresses the challenge in a clear and effective way. The problem described, the unawareness about Project Catalyst funding campaigns by west african entrepreneurs, is addressed in an effective way through the creation of a 2-day virtual event to present Catalyst and illustrate the creation process of a proposal in an operational way.\r\nI think this project can certainly bring new proposals from a specific geographic area into Project Catalyst.\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal directly addresses the aim of this challenge. Since one of Cardano's main priorities is reaching Africa in general, this proposal could be a first step in promoting Catalyst as a gateway to Cardano on which the community can build up in the future. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "The proposal is at the very heart of Cardano's ambitions and the specific target market being West Africa provides this solution with a great focus and a centred community. This makes meeting targets achievable and quantifiable I believe. It's easy to present an 'African' outreach but a lot can be lost in such a wide scope. Targeting the 'diaspora' is also an effective point as this widens the scope of Catalyst awareness globally and could provide an indirect benefit from emigrants & second generations 'giving back' to their old communities. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "This proposal was very well written and the objectives understood. The amount of USD$6000 is reasonable if not a little lower than I would've estimated at a guess. The plan of running this virtual event that you are proposing is solid and I feel an effective way to engage and educate on the Catalyst vehicle and associated pathways to Catalyst.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Lays out the issue, with a clear path for success.

", "rating": 5}, {"question": 1, "note": "Really like what I am reading here. I have noticed already in many proposals support from WADA. This is great to see and hopefully more resources can be directed from catalyst veterans to include more participants in a way that they can also 'compete' for funds with greater chance.

The proposer's team consists of individuals with relevant experience giving this project a high likelihood of success. ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "I like the setting given to the project: the idea to make 2+ introduction webinars during the 30-day marketing campaign is great and can certainly drive subscription to the main event. The 3-tier incentive scheme is really clever and I think it can generate a \"spread the word\" mechanism that will attract more participants.\r\nThe audience is well targeted to specifics profiles of participants which increase the chances of success compared to choosing a general audience.\r\nWADA's experience and participation in the Cardano community are a further confirmation of the goodness of the project.\r\nThe fund requested are adequate and the way in which they will be spent is relevant to the project.\r\n", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "There is a team of three which state that they have relevant experience. Unfortunately, I don't find any evidence for this and a comment related to this is not answered yet (at the time of this review). However, considering their first created content I think there is a good chance that their presented event will happen and that they will do a good job. The budget sounds reasonable for me. And the return on intension seems to realistic.\r\n\r\n", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "The team consists of members from the same West African region with varying skills & experiences that's critical to such an event. I have however given it 4 stars only because it does not provide details of past events held but overall, a good plan is laid out.

Not a hard event to pull of, but wondering if funding is enough and marketing time will be enough to make the biggest impact possible.", "rating": 4}, {"question": 2, "note": "You have realistic goals and thought through proposal. I dont know about the 2 funded proposal as your key metrics but their is definetly an audience there. From what i know of the african market, you should target a mobile app for the material and webinars probably. You might get better onboarding and more users ", "rating": 5}, {"question": 2, "note": "I have good confidence in this team that it can carry out this task. I like the mindset of how the information is presented and various details it thought out about. Few pointed - I would love to have this recorded so that these can be then featured around and reproduced to introduce many more participants even after event ends. But I assume that may be the goal. I would also suggest adding profile links like Linked In to proposer names. Not every may be familiar with your past work or who you are. Adding that doesn't cost anything and it adds more colour to your proposal as who you are as individuals. I would have liked to learn more about past experience in hosting online events. Would have been really helpful, I think.

The team has given detailed KPIs to measure the progress and success of the proposal. The only thing I miss here is that they haven't mentioned possible difficulties and how to deal with them. Hosting an online event is one thing, but attracting many people is often the hardest part. The plan is to do social media marketing. However, it is easier to waste money on these platforms than really create value (as I work in this industry). But in summary, this proposal is well presented.

The fact there are affiliated proposals to this means its a well thought-out ambition and I wish the team luck.", "rating": 5}, {"question": 3, "note": "By breaking down your Key Metrics to measure and also your Target Outcomes I was easily able to understand your success measures and planned goals.

I read that it is for guidance only - but understanding timescale would be neat, too. It mentions that 30 days after funding is secured and marketing materials are ready - so in theory one month is a solid timeline at first, right? That is neat. Also - having ability to improve membership would be fantastic on Catalyst platform. Any thoughts how that could be measured effectively, too? With regards to metrics - it helps to benchmark against actual target rates - there are few targets listed on the bottom but metrics list is rather extensive. So adding few more to have them in mind be really useful. At any rate - I believe there is enough data that could make this a go.
