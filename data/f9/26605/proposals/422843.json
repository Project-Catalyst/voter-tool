Their implementation plan seems credible and feasible, as they will use a pool of already interested and networked sharholders and have some mitigation stategies for the risks and hand. The budget is defined and seems reasonable, I appreciate the proposers not charging too much for this probably cumbersome task. A time-defined roadmap exists and gives this whole thing a look of good planning ahead.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Problem and solution description are logical, clear and straightforward, and the KPIs and success metrics are clear, appropriate and measurable by very definitive statistics.

This proposal is created in synergy with other approved and submitted proposals to Project Catalyst planning surveys, workshops, focus groups, and events on blockchain for business in Africa, Asia, and in Geneva to understand the opportunities for entrepreneurs to adopt blockchain and participate in Project Catalyst. This proposal offers a comprehensive approach for understanding the best frameworks for impact valuation and monetization for impact-driven companies, through blockchain, based on analysis of best practices, combined with insights from the entrepreneurs themselves.

They are Starting by understanding the already existing research and methodologies available for using blockchain technology for impact measurement and monetization, expanding by assessing the needs and gathering the insights of impact entrepreneurs across the globe on impact monetization and combining them with the innovative solutions proposed by experts and investors. To offset this challenge they are planning on distributing this specific survey in combination with another one on the topic of blockchain for business. they have 4 stages in working on this project, the plan is that in each stage it is quite clear what they will do at that stage and there are main outputs at each stage to be continued at the next stage.

The Accelerate2030 team has extensive experience in impact management, having managed complex logframes with partners in development agencies, and a dedicated impact management team.

Impact projects could test hypothesis faster.\n2.

Therefore, this proposal is perfectly aligned with the Challenge as it seeks solutions for impact investing. This proposal will have a tangible impact as it will engage companies from around the world and help establish new values in the corporate world. First, a survey will be conducted among 450 companies from 33 countries around the world. Then, those interested in Cardano-based solutions will be trained in workshops. I think this is a better way to engage companies in the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst. Moreover, the proposer also provides some key metrics that really alight with the challenge KPIs and are suitable with what they describe in the solution content. They also state out the challenge about a common problem that will appear on all survey activity, but they had a plan for that which I believe will work well. \n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented. The team is already active in the world and is familiar with the United Nations Development Program for Sustainable Development Goals. The team details can be viewed on the website. The stated timeframe for implementation of the proposal is realistic to complete the survey and conduct the workshops. The budget requested to execute this proposal is realistic and broken down into identifiable tasks. The team is experienced and therefore knows what resources are needed. The core of the proposal is to conduct surveys paired with workshops. As mentioned by the applicant, they encourage business participation in Cardano initiatives by bringing them together through conducting workshops. This is one of the best ways to bring Impactful businesses to Cardano. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient to review the progress and success of the proposal. Each step of the proposal can be tracked, such as the progress of the survey and its outcome, the participation in the workshops and its outcome, and finally the provision of support to the selected companies. The budget is also tied to each stage of the proposal, which is clearly defined. This makes it easier for the auditor to verify the execution and disbursement of funds. The stage objectives are clearly defined in the proposal and how long it will take to achieve them. As stated in the proposal, the project will be completed between early 2023. This is a reasonable time frame. The success of the proposal can be measured by clear numbers.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3435", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Needs assessment of 450+ entrepreneurs on impact valuation and monetization, desktop research, and focus groups with experts.", "experience": "Impact Hub is a global network of 24,250 people driving change \u2013 made of 100+ communities across 5 continents, with significant presence in Asia.
