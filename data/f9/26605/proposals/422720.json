The team offers the success of Airmiles, which they describe as the \u201cbiggest currency in the world\u201d (a statement that probably is still true, as I was able to find only some articles written in 2010) to stand at the base of their new token economics.\nI find the solution to be very well applicable to incentivising impact-oriented companies and customers, through a method that has already been tried and tested for several years now. It could also prove an incentive for other companies to join the alliance and as such, if the project is successful, to adopt the FLORAS token on the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan and timeline the team has presented are well detailed and easy to follow. The aim is to finish the entire project in 3 months, starting with planning and defining the Floras currency to testing and launching the MVP in the third month. Each month has a series of clearly defined steps, with the second month looking the most active.\nThe budget contains the salaries for 3 months for 3 different jobs: a web developer, a blockchain developer and a project director. While the numbers provided are reasonable, and the timeline estimated as well, what I don\u2019t understand is why there is no amount set aside for the other members of the team, who will clearly be working on this project, as their skills are indispensable: UI/UX spec developer, communication & marketing and graphic designer. While all members have been clearly accounted for, with descriptions of their skills and LinkedIn profiles, some do not appear in the budget breakdown, as such I am asking myself why. Will they be working pro bono? If that is the case, it was important to mention, otherwise, it might seem like an oversight.\nSince the team answered Yes to the question regarding their other Catalyst proposals from this Fund, I must add that they have not provided any details even though it was requested in the proposal submission form. \nFor these reasons, I will rate this section a 3, as I am unsure about the feasibility of the budget and the team\u2019s time commitment in regards to their other possible proposals.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has unfortunately not provided an answer to the project progress measuring. They have pasted the same answer as in the budget field, either by mistake or because of lack of time, I cannot guess. Either way, this is a very important aspect in the auditing of the proposal, as it provides transparency to the entire Cardano community in regard to the advancements made by the funded proposals.\nAnd while the answer for their success vision is a short but reasonable one, I cannot overlook the most important missing part of this section. As such, I will rate it a 2 and hope that the proposers do resubmit this project in a future fund if they do not get voted in this one, but with the missing details provided.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "I am surprised about the PA score on FEASIBILITY and I need to flag it since the assessment is incorrect. The guideline is clear on this, and this is the base of the assessment:\n\"Scoring the feasibility of a proposal means that you are assessing whether a proposal is likely to be successfully implemented or not. It is your task as a PA to assess the proposal's ability to solve the problem that has been identified. There are no firm rules for this; it will all depend on what information the proposer has provided. \nA feasible proposal has considered the following aspects:\nThe proposer provides evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. PROVIDED\nThe proposer knows, in an identifiable manner, the type and number of team members required to implement the proposal. PROVIDED\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. PROVIDED\nThe budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals. PROVIDED\nThe proposal offers a realistic timetable to complete the work. PROVIDED\nThe plan describes all the resources necessary to implement the proposal. PROVIDED\"\nAgain, the PA has seen this information and his focus was different than the guidelines to address the FEASIBILITY section, therefore needs to be removed."}, {"id": 2444, "q0": "We know that the miles market is already proven and is increasingly diversified. However, a good part of the currently existing programs do not present a conservation bias, but only the benefits of earning points that can be used in the traditional consumer market. In this way, a tokenization logic that aims to distribute points to be spent in the sustainable market is an idea consistent with the current conservation trend proposed by Cardano, as well as presenting an innovative character. In addition, we know that there are other proposals aimed at building marketplaces, so this project would be possible to integrate this project with others in the ecosystem. In this way, the project has the potential to have a positive impact on Cardano in the medium and long term, as well as the budget seems to be in line with what it wants to do, as we will develop below.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the broad integration that a loyalty program seeks to form, we realize that it is not an easy-to-implement idea. Therefore, even with a good concept, this proposal would have a difficult viability if the right people were not involved. But here we can see perhaps the most positive point about the feasibility of the project: the professionals involved have extensive experience in this area, in addition to having had contact with major players in the market. In addition, their CVs were made available so that their experiences could be proven. Among the areas of knowledge to which these professionals belong, we note that there are skills not only in development (which is one of the main points of the project) but also in areas fundamental to the success of this proposal, such as marketing and design. As we looked at the budget breakdown, we found capital allocations that made sense, and there didn't seem to be any overspending. However, given that the success of the project is very much related to its acceptance by the public, it seems interesting that we had found a capital allocation specifically aimed at marketing. It would also be nice if images of the possible application interface had been made available, they could be built using some tool like Figma.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the perception of success of the project, we found consistent ideas, and it was nice to see that an expected number of partnerships to be established was defined. However, as the project plans to have a large scope, it seems important that other goals had been defined, so that the final projection of the project could be better understood. It could have been defined, for example, an expected number of active users on the platform, or average volume of monthly transactions. But regarding the defined ways to follow the project's evolution, we found that what will be spent on each activity was defined, but no specific information to understand the progress of these activities. This is a very negative point. But as feasibility information was given about the duration of the sprints that will be carried out and the way in which their progress will be shared, we can highlight this absence a little here. But in any case, it would be nice if more information about the follow-up had been provided.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8280, "q0": "I think this is a very innovative idea, I really enjoyed the concept and I think it fits the challenge The only doubt I have is if people would trade their usual loyalty programs to join a sustainable one, that limits where they can use their points. Unfortunately, sustainability is not people's biggest concern, and I think the project wouldn't develop enough if it is only joined by people who care about their environmental footprints. In that sense, I think this is a risk that should be considered. One possible way to mitigate it is by making it more advantageous than other loyalty programs, but I am not sure this is financially viable.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is detailed enough, and it seems feasible. My only concern is that the project is very focused on the development of the program, and doesn't include marketing and getting users, so it would possibly require additional funding. I think maybe the project could be expanded to include a second phase dedicated to putting the program into action, so there would be some guaranteed impact. The team members seem very equipped and have the relevant background. I would like more information about their experience in Project Catalyst and in the Cardano ecosystem.

The proposal therefore effectively addresses the challenges and has a potential of bringing value to the Cardano blockchain. The proposer and his team have kept this proposal in phases. To begin with the proposal is said to be one phase of the main Project FLORAS and the proposer and his team think  cardashift could be the best support to integrate their currency to CLAP. They said that they are a startup in UC Beckley accelerator SKYDECK. Cardashift according to the proposal has a good connections with Europe and in this case some European companies approach this noble group to create a program that shares the same reward currency \"Floras\" under the same monetary program and so the proposers are of the view that they are having expertise and experience that if tap into will be a game changer to the cardano ecosystem and project catalyst through cardashift if funded.\nAccording to the proposer and his team like Airmiles their Solutions involved two key actions and that is Earn currency and Redeem currency, in the area of the earn currency when you buy something with the Floras you are rewarded for buying an item from their certified shops where the Floras can be used. and in the area of redeem currency you are also able to spend or redeem the currency through certified areas approved by cardashift and Clap. According to the proposal many companies are more open to send funds to impact the projects and their solution will funnel a lot of funding to sustainable project through the system and technology provided and they are of the view that cardano  blockchain can provide transparency to the funds sent and received by the projects given accessibility to all the parts to audits where money flows to if funded.\nThe proposer and his team intimated that, this currency will have the capability to be traced from issuing to redemption. The proposer and his team are therefore satisfied that if funds are given this can be a game-changer for Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer and his team has given an experience road map they plan to use to execute this proposal successfully. The timelines giving is that the proposal will need about three months to finish the project, it is said that the team works with developing Sprints, each of them is defined first and is adjusted on a weekly basis by grooming according to the proposal. They estimated that they will need at least 12 development Sprints or 3 months total to launch a customized fully functioning MVP.\n On the monthly activities that are supposed to be carried out by this group, it is expected that in the first month a number of the activities will be rolled out which include planning and initiation, floras definition of currency system (values exchange) set up and customization, earn and spend floras web set up and also graphic designs, logo, brand and colours definition of the program these are the activities that would be carried out in the first month if funded. \nIn the second month a set of activities or projects are expected to be carried out by the proposer and his team the first one is to set up back and  admin for currency system, web design floras earn and spend options and clap integration with floras currency, finalized graphic design deliverables and also cardano block chain integration to the wallet, native token set up plan and tokenomics definition and also integration with carbon credits providers (parchma and others) then the last but not the least in the second month is the testing of floras exchange to carbon credits (transfer of funds) if funded.\nThese are some of the activities and projects that would be carried out in the first and second months,these kind of projects and programs are supposed be carried out in the last and the third month of the proposal. In the area of budget the proposal requested for a budget that if given the project will be implemented and programs be carried out successfully. They further took their time to break the the budget into identifiable bits to allocate every penny to an activity it is expected to carry out for the sake of transparency and accountability. The proposer and his team also provided the details of the people the team will be working with in the course of the project if funded, their links and names are provided in this very proposal for the sake of traceability and also for confirmation of their existence. On area of risk the proposal is intimating that the biggest risk is not to find enough hours of developers to work on the  technologies since Haskell and Plutus is in high demand but to mitigate this with the experience of the proposer has it that, they are familiar with the community and that they have the resources to mitigate this issues if funded. I do agree that with the expertise of the persons involved in this proposal it stands a chance of bringing dramatic change to cardashift cardano ecosystem and project catalyst if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided by the proposer and his team is very brief but sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.

To be able to do this the project will be seeking the support of Cardashift because of the influence it has in Europe in the area of blockchain. The currency ( Flora) will be spent on sustainable projects allowing companies to claim the carbon credit. The project if implemented will be issued as a reward when customers buy products from the coalition of green companies. Examples of these products will include electronics, food and travel.
