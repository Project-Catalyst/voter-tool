By finding a way to expand the sale of sustainable products while amplifying Cardano's visibility, we can say that the proposal fits the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself. Furthermore, with the success of this proposal, other projects using Cardano's technologies will also be able to have their visibility increased, if products with its brand are commercialized. We therefore see a real possibility for this undertaking to have a positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem. The budget being requested also seems very consistent with what is planned to be accomplished.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "A very positive point that makes us trust the project's feasibility is the full understanding, on the part of the team, of what the purpose of the platform should be. We observe that, at first, very complex plans are not drawn up, while the initial concerns refer to the structuring of the platform and compliance with legal aspects. It is also interesting to see that during the description of all the stages, the concern to follow the values \u200b\u200bthat motivated the creation of the store was always mentioned, which makes us believe in the identity of the brand being built. Furthermore, regarding these steps described in the timeline, we can say that they follow a good logic, evolving gradually and covering different aspects so that the store is well conceived. In particular, it is interesting to see that some of these steps are already being developed, as the concern with marketing was a relevant factor in more than one moment. Regarding the breakdown of the budget, we note that the largest allocation of capital (approximately 63%) is being allocated to the design and development of the store itself, which is quite consistent. In addition, regarding the team responsible for the project, we noticed several highly qualified professionals, whose technical skills go beyond technological knowledge, but also encompass areas of marketing and user experience.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to understand the success of the project, we see that the steps indicated are quite consistent with the ideas developed in the feasibility section. Thus, we found the establishment of a supplier as priorities, and we also noticed that parameters such as the number of users and parts available on the platform were established. As an additional observation, it would also be interesting to establish other additional parameters such as the average volume of transactions taking place on the platform and a survey aimed at projects that ceded sales rights in the online store, to understand if there was a greater engagement around these after the sale of products. . Regarding the perception of success, we found the description of a scenario that fully matches the ideals assumed by the project, establishing an ecosystem that unites sustainable commerce with blockchain technology.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9315, "q0": "I think this is a very cool idea it's not too strange but it is a breakthrough for Cardano to make cardano more useful in practice and to move ADA from crypto to everyday consumption. This is a good project that will definitely enhance Cardano's scaling and scaling. This proposal fits with the problem at hand that there are no online stores that the ADA can use to buy clothing and sustainable goods. I love the idea of using high quality fabrics made from recycled materials because our earth is hurting in need of protection. I fully support your project. This project, if implemented seriously, will bring positive effects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have seen the detailed plan, including progress and milestones in your proposal. I agree with the suggestion and I have some suggestions. In the second quarter, did you guys say what should be done is to communicate with relevant artists to design garments (currently working) but I would suggest that we need to communicate with famous and talented artists. Big influence as well as contact with famous models is also a very good marketing method. Especially young students at design universities, we can also cooperate with those students because the cost to hire them is not too expensive. I don't see how much does a garment design cost? The cost you give is not detailed, so be more detailed, for example, how many hours to design with the corresponding amount. After reading the link about your members, I feel very reputable, everyone is experienced. You guys have provided transparent information, I love this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You build your own brand name, have specific goals, have a clear link. The level of success can be expressed in numbers, by tracking the number of customers returning to buy, the number of stable customers of each month...

It addresses the challenge in the following way. Impact tokens, presenting each item purchased, are issued to buyers. The token implicates the fact that a less sustainable product has possibly been replaced with a more sustainable one. So it tells about the reduction of environmental/social burden. The QR codes create transparency and traceability if a product is resold later. As the proposers have identified, the hard part is to keep verifying the sustainability and measuring the impact of the products in the first place. The challenge question is mostly about this problem and the proposal does not address a clear plan for it yet. One path forward might be to research gradual DAOfication of the process so that a diverse set of people with proper skills are incentivized to participate in the sustainability assessment work. It could create objectivity and long term sustainability to the process when more mechanistic/automated verification or measurement tooling is not available. \n\nAs successfully completed, the implementation of this proposal would provide an attractive marketplace for Cardano (and other) related apparels. All the synergistic plans about bringing more Cardano native projects as well as the artists to the platform fit very well to Tangent\u2019s other infrastructure under development. This marketplace will certainly create demand for impact measuring and verification tools which is somewhat aligned with the challenge as it looks for marketplaces to combine buyers and sellers of impact value. But, in its current form, it doesn't provide many of such measuring and verification tools. I would have rated higher if this proposal had been in the Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap has been divided into quarterly steps and each step includes well-defined tasks. I don't see any critical phases lacking from the list. The budget breakdown is clear and realistic. Team members have extensive technical/business experience and track record from the blockchain industry. They should be well capable of implementing the proposal even though the team is working on other projects which are looking for funding in this funding round. \n\nThey will most likely complete the product line that uses recycled material with verified labor conditions. Setting up an impact token model and infrastructure will not be a problem either.  They have also experience building online stores. The amount of traction the platform will get depends much on the user experience and success of the marketing campaign. The platform is expected to become financially self-sustainable so there is no risk of future funding.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap has been divided into clear milestones on which the progress could be reported if the team wants to do so. The first big step is establishing the apparel line. I am expecting a clear and verifiable report about sustainability standards of the production process right after possible even though the proposal doesn\u2019t mention it.\n\nThe second major step is bringing users to the website. KPIs after launch are the number of projects and especially NFT projects making apparel to promote their work and selling them on the platform. There are not any quantifiable goals given in the proposal. However, due to the open and visible nature of the marketplace, it is quite easy to see how well it is succeeding and growing. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3138", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10135, "q0": "The authors are trying to create an environment that uses ADAPlay and is only engaged in selling items made from sustainable and recycled fabrics, as well as promoting Cardano cards, NFTs, dap and related websites to ecology. This is awesome, to contribute to a school and spread the good news about Cardano, there is a small creation by the team that will sell Cardano and ADA-themed clothing, along with clothing that will display NFT and promote projects built on Cardano, it's great to look forward to. You have come up with an interesting and practical solution to achieve the common goal of community development + and environmental protection.\n\n   The proposal itself has enough categories to help meet the requirements and purposes of this challenge. But should you consider adding the purpose of recycling beyond clothing? I'm a bit confused about this, hope the team can expand to apply to leather or decorative items to bring diversity to the idea market. What is clearly hindering the project is the cooperation of the NFT artists, to help obtain the rights to reproduce their NFTs and sell them is another matter that needs to be investigated. The issues are fully stated by the group of ideas, with examples attached to help our community easily visualize. and wish you soon complete the idea and put it into operation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "However, for the project owner's stated experience, a new team joined the proposal from this round. but i think with a development team dashboard mentioned there will be complete, transparent team social links. then they may be perfectly suited in terms of skills and experience to do the job.\n  And the author provides a 4-quarter trail map that starts operating from Q2 2020 and ends in Q1 of next year. These include timelines to help the community understand. more about what you're doing. this is really helpful for community advisors, I appreciate this team's point. But the part that annoys me is that I haven't seen the work assignments of the team members. if yes, you can provide it on the annual report. make it easier for people to follow.\n   For the amount of money needed to operate the idea, the audit items to be used are clearly identified.

Some of the things I think need to provide additional metrics for the most intuitive measure of community acceptance of an idea.

It is a good idea to create a clothing store with recycled materials and eco-friendly, integrated payment via ADApay; this will meet the requirements of the challenge. Your website not only sells clothing made from \"green\" materials, but it also features the introduction of NFT products, which are tokens for major projects in the Cardano ecosystem (of course you must have consent and permission of those project owners). It is the quickest and most effective method of marketing to users because it prints not only the logos of Cardano but also the logos of the projects with which the website can be contacted as well. In addition, I am excited for the project to be a success so that I can participate in it.\n\nRegarding the risk that you have presented, I believe that it is comprehensive and quite detailed. However, I would also like to comment on another part of the risk, which is: when you decide to print logos, introduce projects, dapps, and projects that are built on Cardano, then there is a part of the risk that there will be some projects that are not done really well, but you print your logo on the clothes, market them, and that is a bad problem. Those projects that allow you to print logos and advertise for them ought, in my view, to be subject to stringent censorship requirements. Nevertheless, I will still award 5 points for this impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project's roadmap extends to the first quarter of 2023; it is quite comprehensive and detailed. Following the first phase that you guys have been working on finishing, the remaining work on the project will be divided into three phases that are each equivalent to one additional quarter. Although funding for the project has not yet been secured, you are still working to put it into action and bring the first phase of the project to a successful conclusion. This demonstrates that the project is one that the group feels strongly about.\n\nGiven the specifics of the payables, it is considered reasonable in terms of the actual costs, which include a call for funding of $15,800 as well as associated costs. Your team currently consists of eight people, and in order to develop the betting platform, you will be adding two more programmers. These are all factors that contribute to the success of the project, and given your capabilities, the project will undoubtedly be successful. well development. You also mentioned that it will be challenging to get back to the next round of funding because you will get the revenue from the website and be able to cover all of the costs of hosting and maintaining the website.

However, in terms of the progress of the project, you have not mentioned measuring and updating the milestones, and neither have we. There will be links provided to the website as well as social networking sites where you will be able to monitor the development of the project. You could also include KPI milestones in order to be able to achieve them after the project has been successful. For example, you could determine how much money will be made from selling clothes after one month, three months, and six months, as well as how much money will be made from advertising for the projects. Projects of a high caliber on your website... In that case, the success of the project will be readily apparent from the fact that many companies and other projects will come here to advertise both their brands and their projects, thereby encouraging the expansion of projects based on Cardano and NFT.
