Their proposed solution for carbon-negative projects to monetize their impact through carbon markets does address the challenge brief. However, the challenge brief focuses on How much financial value can be derived from impact-oriented projects, and this proposal does not clearly articulate how much financial value will be achieved by funding this proposal. I do believe there is a significant opportunity in the Carbon market industry, but the proposal has not directly made connections to this, or forecasted potential revenue streams. It is unclear how this proposal will financially impact Cardashift or Cardano, as the \"impact\" the proposal focuses on is the climate impact of reducing carbon in the atmosphere, and while this is valuable to society at large, it does not clarify \"How much FINANCIAL value can be derived from impact-oriented projects\", which is the focus of this challenge. There is also discussion of how \"this will facilitate the issuance of impactful and qualitative carbon-credits that can help meaningful project developers monetize their impact.\" but this statement is focusing on the monetization of the users/customers of the completed certification system, and not on the flow of money to riverse.io, Cardashift, or Cardano.

The team has outlined who will be completing the work on this proposal, and they have sufficient technical knowledge to deliver this proposal. The proposal includes a plan with a timeline and major milestones at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. They have also broken down the budget to include hourly estimates for each task. The plan, budget, and timeline are reasonable and well defined. The only piece missing is technical explanation of the architecture, language and technologies they will be using to implement this proposal. They have not explained what minting services they will use to issue the Certification NFTs. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal states \"The milestones are defined and are measurable. We will track each milestone to give visibility on the project.\" and I agree the milestones are defined and measurable, but the team has not explained how they will give visibility or transparent reporting to the Catalyst community. The KPI's can be used for auditing, but only if the auditors have access to them. The teams website has specifically stated on the about page their values which includes the statement \"A lack of consistency and clarity has clouded the perception of the market. We believe full transparency is key to ensuring trust and enabling action.\" So while the team is likely committed to transparency, they have failed to explain how they will be reporting this proposals progress to the cardano, catalyst, and cardashift communities.

With that HUGE budget, I think voters will choose to downvote this proposal. If Proposer requested $120k on $200k Challenge's Fund, and then get funded, there's a little chance to be realized. If this the first time Proposer submitting an idea in Project Catalyst, as far as I know, there was a unwritten rule stating that the budget is not allowed to be larger than 10% of the total Challenge's Fund Size.

Verification of this is made by independent parties. The problem is growing complexity and the need for human expert labor when onboarding new kinds of industrial processes. The idea to resolve this includes a prototype of a protocol which enables businesses to reliably report their impact on decarbonization. This proposal\u2019s scope is specifically in the impact on a few specific aspects of decarbonization. There is a well known collection of standards and tools for Life Cycle Assessment of products, processes and services. Based on these established standards Riverse aims to create an updatable database of baseline environmental impact levels so that each business with suitable LCA processes can verify their own impact against these baselines. Because there is already existing standardized infrastructure in action, a successful delivery of the proposed platform has a potential to scale reasonably well. In my opinion, a very important decentralization element to maintain this baseline database is planned to be done by DAOfying the process at a later date. It introduces reliability and continuity over longer term time horizons. \n\nThe proposal also covers the implementation of tokenization of impact framework. \nImpact credentials in a form of NFTs include metadata to prove impact and provide required evidence to issue carbon credit NFTs. Standardizing the process for peer to peer compatible verification, would make the system even more end-to-end decentralized. NFT metadata infrastructure is an evolving field and may open new opportunities in the future. \n\nThe number of proofs of concepts is mentioned in the challenge set-up. This prototype protocol applies directly only to one limited application domain but if it and the planned 10 projects onboarding is executed successfully it provides a good reference point to continue expanding decentralized automation and standardization of environmental impact measurement. Because being able to find working solutions to measure the impact of different industrial projects is the core business model of Riverse, I expect this endeavor of standardizing the process to be highly impactful and matching the Challenge question pretty much perfectly. Especially speed of measuring impact and validating it are strongly impacted. As this is already a business in action, many operational risks are significantly reduced. I see some uncertainties about how well the protocol eventually scales across different projects and how efficiently the existing solution can be modified to capture new projects and processes. As the proposal states, having straightforward and simple enough KPIs to enable auditing of real processes in the companies is the key challenge here. Another uncertainty factor I find is how much value this cost effective solution adds to companies compared to a more costly but deeper manual verification process. \n\n\n\nIf there are blockchain solutions through the whole supply chain all the way to the consumers, it creates a direct path to incentivize consumers directly. The purchase of the end-product is traceable to the verified impact of the production process. Measures and verifications earlier in the production chain makes it easier to measure and verify at the later stage of the chain. How these synergies play out at scale remain to be seen. \n\nThe proposal fits naturally very well to SDG criterias and they are also mentioned as directive guidelines of Riverse\u2019s business approach on their websites. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Riverse has a track record of creating tens of customized impact measurement systems for businesses from a variety of different fields. I expect them to understand well the gaps and challenges of capturing the key metrics of production and processes. The project timeline, 6 months in total, is divided into 5 well-defined phases. The project budget is clearly divided into subcategories. Estimated hourly workload is specified to the items of impact measuring system, impact certification and carbon credit issuance. In addition to company details and extensive references, the LinkedIn profiles of team members are available. I don't have doubts about their technical capabilities to implement the plan.
