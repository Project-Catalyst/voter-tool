The current challenge suggested in this proposal is that there aren't enough tools that monitor the impact that these stake pool operators have on the Cardano ecosystem. Their proposed solution is to create a way that users can access this information and measure the impact that each stake pool has on the Cardano ecosystem. The idea behind this is to promote decentralization and to find stake pools that are providing the most utility to members. I would imagine that this is focusing on single stake pool operators. It may also decrease the amount of saturated pools by allowing these SPOs to reconsider and allow for more Cardano to be allocated to small SPOs.

Prove what you have done. Provide more information about its impact. Integrate this as an asset or merit etc. to the environment around you (trade it, hold it, let it increase your reputation in a domain or in general\u2026). This proposal targets mainly the second step on the three step list above. The project builds a system to connect real projects and businesses to openly available impact criterias (like SDG) so that these projects can provide more information about the impact they have created. Finding effective KPIs that clearly demonstrates the impact and scales across many different types of projects, would certainly be a big help at measuring the impact and bringing it closer to the markets for monetization.

There are possibly synergistic benefits available from that.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project of impact measurement tools has already been going on since Fund 7. That gives some confidence to this endeavor. The roadmap has timelines and it explains well the plan of reaching out to the potential users as well as onboarding and educating them to the platform.

The same applies with the budget breakdown for  the content creation and development work. The total budget is told to be $200k. I see that this is for realizing this larger vision but much more clear information on the plan would be expected. \n\nThe team working on this proposal has verifiably a lot of experience in the subject area. They have collaborated on this mission in the past as well. The technical implementation resources remain a bit foggy in my opinion.  \n\nFocusing on SPOs is a smart idea also from a feasibility perspective. Blockchain infrastructure, which makes impact measurement, valuation and trading operations easier, is already familiar to them. Secondly, many of them are already quite oriented toward impact processes. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The platform is going to be open source which is a great add to transparency. Because the roadmap, especially in technicalities, is not that detailed it is difficult to project the progress against that. Milestones and regular updates would make it easier to follow the work. \n\nFor this specific project the success KPIs are quite natural and simple. That is the number of SPOs onboarded and proofs of concept performed. The amount of financial value derived from these impact projects by SPOs is a more challenging but accurate metric. I would add that, the observed financial market value of some asset is the collective \u201cconsensus or aggregated\u201d price given by the markets at a certain point of time. It is not necessarily the fair value because understanding of these assets is not trivial yet. I find markets to undervalue these things. For this reason I would ask SPOs and other participants to evaluate freely their views on the financial potential created from their engagement on the platform.\n\nThe proposers talk in their whitepaper that only few proposals in their sample set are considering strategies for monitoring and evaluating impact throughout a project\u2019s timeline. This proposal has the potential to lower that threshold and increase the number. Even though the scope of this proposal is to focus on SPOs, the growth in the number of projects which are considering impact measurements would be interesting to see again in the future. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3138", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Creating the Impact Measurements Tool to help define KPIs, measure and report them, with a focus on SDGs impact for SPOs.", "experience": "200+ team of active Cardano community members.
