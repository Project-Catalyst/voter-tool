However, volunteers and environmentalists are not benefiting from what they are doing. So Konma initiated a program called Harithakanthi which is a tree planting activity carried out in various parts of South India. This program will provide an incentive model for different stakeholders and use the carbon credits generated by these trees to create an impactful project that will help stakeholders earn money. By calculating the amount of CO2 that the plants absorb and the amount of O2 produced by the same unit of tons of CO2 absorbed. Then use this amount monthly or annually to mint swappable $KCCP (Konma Carbon Credit Protocol) Tokens where 100 KCCP is equivalent to 1 ton of CO2 absorbed. Companies, SPOs, crypto mining farms, and other environmental stakeholders can purchase these tokens through the DEX and redeem them on their websites. As the redemption takes place, the number of tokens will be burned and the CNFT sent to the wallet of that company/organization, thanking them and proving their entire carbon offset. A clear and easy-to-understand solution was provided as suggested for a clear description of a targeted problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my opinion, the feasibility of the project is average. Regarding the roadmap I think this section needs a lot of improvement, what the proposal provides is a 3-month roadmap that includes the following elements:\nDesign: 1 Sprint\nDevelopment: 2-3 Sprints\nAuditing: 1 Sprint\nMarketing, Content Creation, Video Assets, Graphic Assets: 2 Sprints\nTestNet and MainNet Deployment: run in parallel to the Marketing Phase.\nFor this part of the project to be satisfactory he needs to provide more detailed information, we need to know by whom each job will be done, and how it will be done....that will help us visualize how the process of the project will be done. Regarding the requested budget: we are given a clear explanation of what the money will be used for. We are provided with information about the work to be done with specific hours and hourly rates (240 hours with $ 75 / hour total of $ 18,000) Expenses such as events, and marketing are also mentioned. , and at this cost, I think it can be explained better. Example event cost $3000: what elements does that cost include, how many events will take place...\nAnd finally, about the group, 4 members were mentioned, we know their names, their current field of activity (3 of them are Konma members), and also their Linkedin affiliation profile of each member. It would be better if they explained more about their role in this project. So I think feasibility has a lot of room for improvement in its 3 aspects of analysis.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Project progress can be tracked by observing the following key indicators:\n-Total number of trees planted\n-Number of tons of carbon offset\n-Total without CNFT provided\n-Did not receive contributions to Plantation.\nSuccess for the project is seen as marking the completion of the blockchain solution being developed to document and evaluate:\n-Donate to plant trees\n-Trees to offset carbon emissions\n-The carbon offset is made into fungible tokens\n-Companies buy these fungible tokens to offset their carbon output\n-CNFT is rewarded to those who own shares\nWith this proposal, the proponent provided metrics and KPIs that were easy to measure and test. Proposal KPIs are defined, easily measured, and tracked within the first 3 months of funding.

Planting trees, monitoring, caring for live plants for growth, these suggest a chain-tracking plan, which then calculates the CO2 absorbed by the plants and the amount of O2 produced by the same unit. tons of CO2 are absorbed. This amount will be minted into the $KCCP Token, which will be exchanged on the web.\nThe potential risk is that the interaction between the proposal and the Konma Carbon Credit Protocol (KCCP) based on the Kyoto Protocol, the exchange of carbon credits generated on the exchange must comply with the prescribed by the protocol.\nA great proposal that not only adds value to Cardano but also helps connect the Cardano community with individuals and organizations outside the blockchain who share the same idea of \u200b\u200bprotecting the environment, thanks for the great idea", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the proposed blueprint states: create a mathematical equation that calculates the amount of CO2 absorbed by the tree, the amount of O2 generated in the direction, mint the token and put it on the exchange. But the work items don't link the blueprint, I don't envision timelines for specific work goals.\nWith the initial goal of giving something to the volunteers, but in the proposed budget of $24000 or the calculation of the reward, I did not see an item for about 1200 volunteers.\nWhen I click on the Linkedln of the members of the project team, I can only see the information page of the architect and the CEO, but the aquaculture specialist I cannot access. The information related to my degree is also not updated here.\nIt would be fair if in the detailed budget table there is an allocation of expenses to the volunteers who participate because they deserve it.\nWhat do you guys think about the idea of using carbon emissions to create tokens, generating revenue. I love this idea so much\nThis is the benefit of the reality of planting trees along with the benefits of blockchain in practice, the Cardano ecosystem will lead the way for the development of environmentally friendly projects.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I agree with the proposed project progress metrics, the number of trees planted, the amount of carbon measured is the most accurate measure of the proposed project progress.\nThe use of blockchain in connection with real work to both generate income and track the development of the project shows that blockchain is gradually being linked with reality.\nThe number of crops planted, the amount of carbon minted to generate income are the successes of the project\nI think that if it is proposed to add more accurate statistics on the number of crops that will be planted in this fundraising project, it will be a plus point for the transparency of the project.\nIn the future, the source of costs to maintain the tree planting project will probably not need to be contributed anymore, but will be deducted from the revenue of the token sale.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2464", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11173, "q0": "The problem described in this proposal is closely aligned with the challenge.\nIt's very true that \"We have a responsibility towards the planet we live on.

As a proposer myself, I know how important it is to have the text as easily understandable by anyone, even if more technical terms are indispensable, the proposal should be written as legible and comprehensible as possible. Besides that, I find the plan and timeline to have missing details, that are partially better explained in the budget section. What will the first sprint be designing? The website, the tokenomics model, the token? How will the marketing sprints be implemented, and what is their plan? And most importantly, the development sprints are also not described at all in the plan, but only in the budget section do we get a better grasp of what will be developed. As a PA, I need these details to gauge the feasibility of the proposal and to assess whether the time and tasks are sufficient to implement the project in combination with the required budget.\nSpeaking of budget, since the team does have a blockchain architect amongst them, I am confident that the budget has been properly discussed and is sufficient for the development side. What I can say from my knowledge, is that the amount required per hour looks reasonable and in accordance with the rates I am familiar with in the Cardano ecosystem.\nAnd finally, in regards to the team, they have provided us with details and links to verify their skills and knowledge and from what I was able to gather, I can say that they offer the confidence to successfully implement this project. \nIn conclusion, I will rate this section a 4/5 because of the omissions in the detailed plan.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics provided in the auditability section for tracking the progress of their project look reasonable and are in accordance with their plan: the number of trees planted, the volume of Carbon offset, number of NFTs minted and donations received.
