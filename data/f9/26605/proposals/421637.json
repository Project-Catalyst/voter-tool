The project presented in this proposal seems very solid as the information provided by the team is very complete, it\u2019s evident that a lot of time and thought has been put into it. The solution presented by the team to address the challenge is composed of a platform for users to access impact investment opportunities and native token. Regarding their risk assessment, the team correctly identifies the constrain that exists in the developer hiring market and they have a relative long timeline until Q2 2023, where a lot of things can change until then. Although they were able to identify the main risks, the mitigation plan for them could have used a little more thought.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposals presents a detailed timeline and key milestones to reach until Q2 2023. Since this timeline started in Q1 2022, it would safe to assume the team is already actively working on this project. The team is composed by very capable and mission driven individuals, who are invested in the project. One area of concern, which is related to risk mentioned before with hiring developers, is that the core team is missing a technical person. But since the community Cardano4Climate is supporting them with 200 members, this could be an important pool of resources to bootstrap. The team provides a budget breakdown detailing the platform and the impact measurement tool developments as the two main tasks to accomplish with this funding. It\u2019s my personal opinion that they have assigned a rather low hourly cost to the development of these tools, while at the same time not providing enough information on how the other values were calculated. Such as the team operations and token release having the same budget as something so important as the development of the impact measurement tool.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents a set of KPIs that will be used to measure the project\u2019s progress. Such as number of proof-of-concept trials, time required to validate the impact value, how much financial value is derived from the projects, number of onboarded developers and number of partnerships. Personally I don\u2019t think number of onboarded developers is a good KPI to measure the progress, although a crucial piece for the success of the project the goal of the proposal is not to onboard developers but to develop a platform for positive impact. Other than that, the KPIs makes sense in my opinion it\u2019s only missing a place where this progress can be independently verified like GitHub or their own website where the data will be uploaded.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2465", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3693, "q0": "The team wants to build a platform where people can invest in projects that align with sustainable goals. Along with that, the platform aims to provide reviews of projects listed, certifications and verification of these certifications. All of these are important pieces of infrastructure and processes needed to build a platform well suited to raising more investment for such projects and would drive more adoption of the Cardano blockchain and accelerate the timeline and likelihood that we as one planet, can meet our sustainability goals for ourselves, the planet and future generations. But the token seems extraneous, the benefits of it are not well articulated, the projects seeking investment and investors would likely have a preferred cryptocurrency to use and it is far simpler to use existing coins and tokens for investment if there is no clear benefit to introducing a new token. After all, the benefits need to justify making investors buy the new token and then sending it to the project, only for the project to sell the token to get the cryptocurrency they need, all of which incurs transaction costs and time.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project seems well planned with detailed timelines and budget estimates.

Through the way the problem is stated, we can see that the proposal solves the goal set out in the Challenge. The main stats and goals are suitable for Challenge. The team also identified the problem to be solved which is to develop a platform/token for impact investing, connecting directly with projects. As such, the impact of the proposal is clear, it increases the value of the Cardano ecosystem first of all through the implementation of the Cardano blockchain platform. The most obvious impact is shown in connecting entrepreneurs around the world, in finance, in investment... Even connecting people with projects have confirmed the potential of this proposal. . I think that if done well, the proposal is completely scalable as it already has quite a large potential to continue to grow and solve future challenges. Especially when it is closely related to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the 17 goals are always existing problems and a common problem that needs to be solved by the whole world (a lot of efforts are needed). support of transparent data access, the Token platform is rooted in team-like proposals). I strongly agree with the impact of the proposal, I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent and team have in-depth experience in ADA, Cardano blockchain, PA, vPA, have a clear knowledge of Catalyst, are youth delegates, interdisciplinary education, social sciences, etc... This experience will greatly help the team in implementing Cardano-related proposals. The team has also provided full documents related to the proposal (websites, videos,...). Especially the Linked social networks link, Twitter has the effect of publicizing the identity of team members. I am impressed with this, the detailed list of members not all proposals do. The publicity of identity through social networks has created favorable conditions for the community to look up the identities of members and verify the feasibility of the proposal. I applaud the team for making this clear and very specific. The number of team members is 3 people, I understand these are the key members, the team may also have 200 other members from C4C that are not convenient to identify.\nThe budget is broken down by items and is logical to the goal. Although the team simply lists the budget, it still shows the key milestones, which clearly shows the professionalism of the team. However, as a PA, I still want the team to show the details. More clarity on the budget required for each small job so that the community can look at it with more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. It's perfectly understandable for the team to present the budget as it is to people who already know the team well, but I suppose for everyone from the community (some people are very new - they don't know yet). about the team and this proposal) can understand it easily, we need a more detailed, more understandable presentation. That's my advice on budget. I have an additional question, if it hasn't been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will the team continue to work on this proposal? What other sources of funding does the team have to be able to implement this proposal (including funding that comes from contacting support from other organizations)? I ask this question because I want to demonstrate the clear feasibility of the budget.\nAbout the plan and how to implement has been fully stated and professional. I was most impressed with this in the team's proposal. This is also one of the important factors in clearly defining the feasibility of the proposal. And the team is doing a great job of it.\nRegarding the necessary resources for implementation, I temporarily divided them into two main resources: financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. With the current people, with enthusiasm and good expertise, I believe the proposal will be successfully implemented. However, as the team shared, some members are also working on another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9. I would like to ask if this reduces the quality of work on this proposal. shoot it? In my opinion, the team can demonstrate to the community that even though there are currently members implementing another proposal, the human resources are still sufficient for the successful implementation of this proposal. It is the best way to create more trust in the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal. The fact that the team also cooperates with C4C is considered a pretty sure guarantee for abundant human resources to implement this proposal. I have the confidence and ability to successfully implement the proposal in practice.\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. It is a collection of high-tech learnings: Cardano blockchain, a management programming language that stores information in a decentralized way, Web3 programming, traceability of both blockchain and Web3, etc. .. It is made by people with a lot of experience in the cryptocurrency market, specifically with ADA and the Cardano blockchain - those are the 3 core members of the team today. This is the basis for me to believe that the team will do a good job when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team is also quite clear about the risks that can be encountered when implementing this proposal: Difficult to get developers; The timeline is too long - accompanied by 2 solutions to prevent the two risks mentioned above. I add a third risk which is Ada's slippage - which will affect the budget to implement the proposal. I would like to analyze this risk more closely: We know that the digital currency market is in a downtrend phase, so the price movement in the downward direction of digital currencies takes place from time to time. day. That is also the reason why Ada may depreciate when Catalyst funds are allocated to the team, then the team will face the problem of a lack of budget to implement the proposal. Therefore, my advice is for the team to review and consider the detailed budget related to Ada's slippage to make an appropriate budget request. Even if more funding is needed, the team can come up with a full plan to test.\nJust now are my positive questions, comments, and tips that I would like to contribute to making this proposal more perfect. I hope the team can consider improving this proposal. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap of the proposal is presented in quite a detail by the team with a total duration of more than 12 months (from Q1 2022 to Q2 2023). This is a logical roadmap and milestone for a proposal that takes time to implement and test. The work steps to be performed in each stage are very specific and in a step-by-step sequence - containing all the necessary information. The team did a great job of linking milestones to specific months of the year. As a PA, I have evaluated several proposals and have found that not many teams can do this and this makes it easier for the community to quickly assess the transparency and auditability of the proposal. fast and accurate.\nI am quite pleased to see the appearance of the job performance index (KPI). This proves that the team has carefully and specifically researched to come up with KPI criteria. The KPIs of the job are associated with the proposal and the KPIs are of a macro scale - I am satisfied. We all know the role of KPI in the audit. This makes it more convenient for the community to evaluate and audit the proposal. I consider KPIs to play a certain role in demonstrating the transparency and auditability of the proposal. However, I am still looking for key metrics, the team also knows that key metrics are as important as KPIs. So my advice is to quickly add key metrics to the proposal. That would be great - the proposal would have even greater transparency and auditability.\nI love how the team defines \"what the success of this project looks like\", the team has outlined each definition of success relative to each goal of getting the job done - in great detail. This is the first time I have seen the definition of success laid out so thoroughly, the definition of success is not only tied to specific numbers but also deals with the theory and practical applications. Throughout the proposal, problems and solutions were clearly articulated by the tissue group. We hope that the team will consult with me, taking note of the addition of key metrics.

This impact measurement is a critical aspect of this challenge. A user-friendly and transparent investment platform will encourage users to invest in impact driven businesses as indicated in the proposal and if introduced in the cardano ecosystem, it would be a big win. The proposal is very functional and decentralized considering the fact that it creates a platform where user have access to track impact of projects (projects within the web3.0 as indicated by the proposer) and evaluate their effectiveness.\nComparing the key metrics of the proposal to that of the challenge, there is congruence.

All thesame, the requested amount is reasonable to achieve the set goals considering that a platform would be created and other heavy costs would be incurred. The timetable presented is clear together with a comprehensive plan. The plan is very detailed. The plan itself does not have technical aspects that would demand explanation.\nIt\u2019s wonderful to see that the proposer foresaw some risks that may arise during the implementation of the project and has provided measures to mitigate them. \nWith respect to all that have been stated above, I believe that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadamp has clear milestones and time horizon for executing the project.
