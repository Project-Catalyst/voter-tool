Furthermore, since the project focuses its efforts on increasing the projection of the actions of non-governmental organizations, we realize that its success will be influential in several projects not only in Brazil (where it will initially be implemented), but also in other countries with realities similar. Thus, the possible positive impact in the medium and long term for this proposal is quite evident. And in fact, it would be possible to observe impacts also in the short term, with the success of its implementation in the NGO initially being considered. For all these factors, we can say that the amount being requested for the execution of the project is quite fair, and as we will see below, it is also being well allocated.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "One of the main points that make us believe in the feasibility of the project is its close relationship with reality. Although the ideas demonstrated by the proposal are quite encouraging, we realized that it would not be interesting if all these concepts remained on a very abstract plane. So it is very positive to see that the implementation of the concepts and parameters built will take place in an existing NGO, which enables the rapid adaptation and chances of success of the project. Regarding the professional team behind all this, we find people with an exceptional academic background. We even see that Gustavo Pugliese has a degree from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, which is one of the most prestigious in Brazil. But, in addition, this team also demonstrates a good practical experience, and we found performances exactly in this professional field. Throughout the proposal, we find the description of very cohesive actions in the timeline, which start from the elaboration of strategies for monetization of impact, through their implementation and reaching the analysis of results. A clear understanding of the products that will be generated by the project was also demonstrated. Regarding the distribution of the budget, we found very correct allocations that encompass not only the research, but also various stages of the project. But as the focus of the project really is on finding ways to monetize the impact of NGOs, it makes sense that the largest allocation of capital is going towards this (approximately 60% of the total). The several positive characteristics mentioned here make us believe that this project has great chances of success, also because its central idea seems really innovative, and providing reliable means of validating results should attract many new investors, especially in times when there is a propagation of so many fake news.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to follow the evolution of the project, we found a very detailed explanation of what should be done, as well as the way it will be done. And in this context, we also note the indication of metrics that facilitate this progress, such as the measurement of new investors and the way they got to know the NGOs, which helps to define whether the tangibility of the impact was a preponderant factor in this. Furthermore, the team's description of success is in perfect harmony with the ideals exposed throughout the project, with a description of success scenarios both in the short, medium and long term.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7870, "q0": "The proposal address the dire need of improving the education NGOs.

This proposal has a high impact rating because it meets the goals of the challenge. Specifically, it creates the monetization value for the impact created by an NGO. In doing so it seeks to create a viable investment that also makes a positive impact on solving poverty issues in Brazil. In addition to helping a single NGO, the goal is to take what they learn and develop a process that they can apply to others as well.

Due to the transparency provided by blockchain technology, donors and investors will gain increased confidence in their investment and as a consequence, the funds will more likely be allocated towards organisations that can provide such a level of trust.\nThe organisation the team has chosen as a first prototype is an NGO called Arca, operating in one of Brazil's favelas and who is providing professional training courses to young students and helping them get on a path to employment and a more stable life. The team envisions financing their course for a group of around 30 students and creating a framework implementable by any NGO that will allow them to monetise their efforts in a continuous way.\nGiven the information provided, I find the proposal to have a high impact on the Cardano ecosystem and as such, I will rate it a 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan for the project is formulated over a period of 6 months.

The execution of the educational program will last for the upcoming  2 months and in the last 2, the protocol and tokenomics will be defined and the framework will be presented to other NGOs for possible adoption.\nThis sounds to me like the plan has been well thought out, I see no insufficiencies that might cause disruptions, as such, combined with the well-drafted budget for $21272 divided in detail for each task and with the skilled and dedicated team, I find the proposal to be successfully implemented and in conclusion, I rate this section a 5/5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team will be holding bi-weekly meetings to discuss the results of their metrics: the impact research, the adaptability and quality of the tokenomics model, the number of investors and the revenue generated.

Will their meetings be recorded and published online for the entire community to see? This question would have been important to have answered as it provides an open and transparent reporting to the entire community.\nThe success of the project is well defined, though some clearly defined metrics would have been practical in assessing the successful outcome.\nBut considering the details provided throughout the rest of the proposal text, I find these details to not play such an important role in the auditability of the project and as such, I will rate this section a 5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15214, "q0": "One of the main issues with NGOs around the world is that since most of them are not under legal obligations and public scrutiny like listed corporations, even the reputable ones find it hard to prove themselves in the eyes of donors and investors. By introducing blockchain, NGOs can make their transactions public and open for anyone to check. Other interesting features of blockchain are tokenization of impact and incentivization of participation. As it aims for modeling impact valuation and monetization, this proposal is a perfect match in the challenge. It can produce a replicable model for other NGOs to follow, especially those that offer education programs. The potential impact is immense. As a \u2018side product\u2019 a course on youth employability is organized.

Running NGOs require a lot of fans to be able to execute their activities and an opportunity like this from a proposal of this sort would help NGOs leverage the Cardano Blockchain so that their monetary impact can be measured; it would not just be of benefit to the NGOs but also a big win Cardano ecosystem. The metrics and goals align with the challenge setting.\nWith reference to that which has been stated by the proposal they don't intend to return to later catalyst fund Rounds to secure additional funding because they believe that once they are able to secure funds in this round to execute the project they will be able to monetize their impact that will keep the project running so I believe with this approach the proposal is sustainable\nI am confident that the proposal has a very high future scalability and I believe that if this project is executed it has the potential of engaging many NGOs so that they can monetize their impact and hence be financially to run their activities smoothly.\nI am confident that the proposal makes the required impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the relevant experience of the team described and considering the fact that the team have been around in previous catalyst fans like to Fund 7and Fund 8 and with key considerations to the links and references attachments, expertise and qualifications I believe that the team possesses the required skills to execute the project.

For this reason I will advise the proposer gives specific numbers to each metrics in future proposals so that they can be better appreciated. \nThere is clarity in the problem described and I am confident that the proposed solution is effective to address the problem.
