I am also developing a similar project and according to my observations\nMost proposals for job creation or job sharing via blockchain do not have a solution to the problem of identity or decentralized governance.\nThe proposal of a platform like Socious using ATALA's DID technology is a direct suggestion for many suggestions that can be followed.\nBack to the proposal's solution, the decentralized identity of the Socious platform is built on the \"impact score\" and \"Deeds\" system and the core behind are smart contracts, DIDs and algorithms for computation. \"impact score\". This is clearly a model of a DAO platform in its infancy with a solution built seriously from the ground up. The Cardano community is in dire need of such proposals to form standards for projects with a decentralized governance model.\nIf there is any suggestion for the proposal, indeed at this early stage that is enough. However, when this model goes through the first stage, it needs to change, it will need another point system to develop in parallel with the \"impact score\". With only one \"impact score\" system, the platform will fall into a state of gradual centralization as the work will always fall into the hands of people with high impact score, You can see the reality in the projects. project to build a \"reputation list\" system. This is completely predictable because a good project will always have bad actors want to manipulate it.\nThat is my opinion with the proposal and also aims to help voters better understand the direction of good platforms like Socious.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal implementation team is part of the Socious team, there are 4 members listed in the proposal and the identity and qualifications of the proposer are verifiable. Through checking in the project's website, I also found information about nearly 15 members of the team and they are all experienced in many fields and can completely complete this proposal on schedule.\nThe proposal, if funded, will be implemented in 4 months according to the detailed plan outlined by the proponent. This plan details the milestones and workloads that need to be implemented. The proponent also points out the technologies and techniques that will be applied to the construction of the Socious platform so that the community of people who are less tech-savvy can appreciate it.\nThe proposal's budget allocation is granular for each workload, and it matches the proposal's deployment plan. I can see the careful calculation, seriousness and professionalism of the team implementing this proposal.\nIt can be seen that this is a very feasible proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The way to track project progress is to read the reports that the proposal team will provide in monthly reports with Catalyst or during TownHall meetings. Besides, using Trello Kanban Board as an intermediary to track project progress. The proposal also provides KPIs on numbers to be achieved such as:\n- the number of transactions affecting the impact point recorded to the Cardano blockchain: 6,000 - 12,000\n- number of users receiving BANK tokens: 2,000 - 4,000\nAll information is transparent for the proposed audit process.\nThis project, if successful, will bring a transparent decentralized governance model to the community and help the DID application be more widely known.

The idea of \"impact scoring\" is a simple and elegant solution which will, however, need a great deal of planning. The proposal clearly establishes who will do the work and how it will proceed. This project responds directly to the challenge and will definitely be of benefit to the Cardano system as it connects valuable social projects with those who want to get involved and creates a means of \"renumerating\" those who make substantial contributes in time and involvement. This aligns with the Cardano ethos and could facilitate the momentum for continued involvement by volunteers and some of the  \"94% of young people who want to use their skills for good.\" as mentioned in the proposal.
