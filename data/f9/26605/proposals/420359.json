Love that the ESG impact model is the subject of experimentation here. While the proposal identify several groups that would be impacted by this proposal, it would be a stronger proposal if it spoke specifically to points from the Challenge's \"Key metric\" or 'Definition of success.\"\n\nThe proposal comes just shy of spelling out exactly how it plans to build a solution for valuing or monetizing impact. Many passages and paragraphs reads like aspiration insight statements instead of a proposal for a body of work. \n\nSome questions that isn't clearly answer, whose answer would make the impact of this proposal more apparent:\n* What exactly is the role and mechanics of the NFTs? Are they holding ESG records? Why would a business mint them or their communities acquire them?\n* What is \"a scalable framework?\" Specifications? Documentation? Code? Website? What are the nouns?\n\n* How will the community and businesses be able to use the result of this proposal to value and monetize impact? Do they read a document and implement its content? Do you sign up for something at the website? Do they attend networking meetings? What are the verbs?\n\nThis is a really cool idea, love the aspiration! Would love to see more clear details about how it intends to help Non-Profit Organizations  use NFTs to establish new standards for the accountability and facilitate the new NFT economy.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal has clear monthly deliverables. The team posses most of the core competency to execute on the proposal. They plan to higher a lawyer for the rest.  The budget seems low given the length of the project and that it is a separate body of work to create the framework, then test whether or not the framework works.  The team did state that they research cost so i'm incline to accept their judgement. \n\nWould have given a five star if the proposal provided a more concrete and less whimsical plan to mitigate the risk of \"hostility to anything related to NFTs from the  legal system of the main markets.\" How exactly do you plan to push? Maybe getting a second opinion from an additional lawyer not affiliate with the one helping with the draft to make sure all I's are dotted and T's are crossed?  Any concrete along this line would go a long way.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditing the proposal is straightforward.

The problem statement doesn\u2019t appear clearly like a problem, it looks more like a response to a problem or in simple terms a solution. However, the problem idea can still be seen. If legal frameworks and partnerships can be established for Non-profit NFT projects I think it will help maximize their Environmental, Social and Governance impact. Imapact valuation is a very critical aspect of this challenge and since the proposal is aimed at some impact evaluation of this non-profit NFT project, the proposal addresses the critical points of the challenge and hence the problem aligns with the challenge. Through the Gender Unicorns m, users of Cardano and even other blockchains can evaluate the impact of NFT projects; this is a big win for the Cardano ecosystem. \nComparing the key metrics of the proposal to that of the challenge, they are in alignment. The goals also align with the challenge. The proposal appears to be scalable and functional as there can be the assessment of impact value of these NFT-NPOs.\nThe proposer has indicated that they do not foresee coming back to catalyst for further but will however request for funds to develop the complete smart contract for the NFT which currently being worked on.

There is clarity in the roadmap, the timeline and also the deliverables. The plan itself does not present technical language that will need further explanation; that\u2019s fine. \nIt\u2019s good effort that the proposer has foreseen some risk that may arise during the implementation of the project and has provided measures to mitigate it.\nWith respect to what have been stated above, I believe that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap has milestones to be achieved within each of the 12 months of the project\u2019s execution.

This would especially benefit the gender unicorns NPO.  However, based on the text of the proposal and the text of the challenge in which it is submitted I have a hard time seeing how this would have a positive impact on achieving the goals of the cardashift  challenge.  The goals of this challenge have to do with monetizing impact and developing an ecosystem towards that end. There's mentions of services and methods to issue impact credentials in a decentralized way. Or certification bodies for analyzing and validating data points provided by impact oriented projects. There's on-chain tools or on-chain marketplaces. None of these goals are mentioned in this proposal.

There appear to be two distinct parts of this proposal. Part 1 is getting the gender unicorn set up as in NFT-NPO,  or non-fungible token nonprofit organization. The second part appears to be developing a framework to help others go through this. I understand the concept, but there are so many differences in organizations and locations and legalities  of jurisdictions, that I'm uncertain as to whether or not a framework would be feasible based upon a single NPO.  The team is clearly well experienced and they have a good plan to accomplish what they're setting out to do. But it looks like they are expecting an undue amount of work from the lawyers in terms of developing a framework for others to use. This may be feasible but I'm not sure that it is. Overall I would have liked to see some more specific information regarding how they plan to develop a framework. What does that framework look like, how is that framework going to be developed or marketed. What are the goals of the framework, and how would that help to accomplish the goals of this challenge?  Due to my own uncertainty I am scoring this at a 3.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This team has a clear goal in mind and a clear plan for being transparent.

In principle, this proposal has links to impacts on existing non-profits that are operating in the NFT space AND all non-profits elsewhere, while enabling transparency and fundraising  mechanics that can effectively transform the existing issues with non-profits. This section of the proposal also provides various KPIs through which voters can get a sense of magnitude from this proposal by quantifying its impacts. I think further quantifiability could be brought to this proposal by providing existing data about the nature of the status quo, which would give voters a greater sense of the urgency needed for this type of proposal. The fact that most non-profits fail (about 70% over a 10 year period) and that there is wildly inefficient spending in the industry now shows me that the world NEEDS this proposal and it would be a privilege to see it done on Cardano. It may also help to provide some information on how many NFT nonprofits exist on Cardano now, to give voters an initial sense about the immediate audience/beneficiaries of the services that this project has to offer. I might also like to see some greater consideration of risks (some of which I\u2019ll suggesst further into this proposal). These are all minor suggestions for improvements as this section is very well organized and articulated to demonstrate a well-formulated impact analysis for a slightly lower than average requested funds. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For a very well-equipped core team, a clearly outlined long term plan, and a reasonably efficient spending budget, I rank this section a 4. The plethora of talent that is given in the core team members list might not include LinkedIn profiles for each member but I don\u2019t dock any points for that because their very easily accessible on the provided website links. Where I draw some slight concern is the shortage of legal education and experience (only one team member with a law BA) for a project that\u2019s supposed to be creating standards for legal compliance. However, based on the budget information, it seems like there is some legal work that is outsourced to a practicing law firm. As a central part of this budget and intent of operations, I think the disclosure of information about that legal entity would benefit voters to thoroughly evaluate all related parties. On the budget, spending seems perfectly reasonably allocated mostly towards legal fees but there doesn\u2019t appear to be a lot of money going towards the core team. It\u2019s not often that I criticize a proposal for not requesting enough money, or not paying themselves enough for their work, but this proposal demonstrates a lot of positive impact that voters may want to see sustainable internal operations that retain the large team. It may even be considered a risk to reserve funding away from team member salary and I think this team is worth it. I assume they\u2019d be generating revenue elsewhere in their pursuits but I\u2019d like to see more clearly that this team is going to keep going.

In theory, this proposal might actually have access to all SDG points via the variety of NPOs/NGOs missions and intents. They don\u2019t take credit for this (which is appropriate) but I wanted to point it out to express the massive potential of this proposal. The KPIs that they do evaluate are well quantified and well measured for performance in a way that links to impact potential. I very much appreciate the quantified measure of success that is perfectly reasonable to aim for 5 NFT projects to be onboarded for these services.
