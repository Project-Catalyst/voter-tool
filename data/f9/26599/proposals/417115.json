In theory, the idea fully addresses the problem described in the explanation of the challenge itself: \u201cMost student entrepreneurs are suffering from a lack of resources, especially in funding and in the recruitment of engineers\u201d. The problem is that there is no place that is intended to establish the connection between students/future interns with companies that work using our blockchain technologies. So what is suggested here is to create a specific platform for this, which will act as a \u201cjob hub, we will create a section dedicated to students. This will be a place for people to represent at their local universities, but also on a remote/global level.\u201d I believe the idea is very relevant and directly contributes to facilitating student engagement with opportunities in our community, but important information is missing. How would the site be built, what would the user interface look like? What kind of information would students have to provide to apply for vacancies? Would their identities be tied to Atala Prism? I've already seen some proposals that work to link professional CVs to DIDs, it would be interesting if this were done here too, for example. Would there be some artificial intelligence that would align students to the main vacancies for them, that is, vacancies that make sense according to their profiles, training areas and interests? What was a little abstract, in my view, would be the functioning of the site itself. We know what would be done, but we don't know how, we don't have details about how this site would be designed or how it would work. How would opportunities related to Cardano be distributed, how would the webinar cited by the proponent be held? How would students be introduced to this platform and encouraged to engage with companies that need their expertise, how could we provide instruction for those wishing to specialize in a certain programming language, for example Haskell/Plutus in the case of Cardano , but have no opportunities? Will the site also partner with some courses, for example? In general, I agree that the proposal is well aligned with what the challenge seeks, but it lacks that detailed explanations had been provided about the practical functioning of the idea. If these details had been provided, I believe the impact rating would be maximum, but in this case I will give it 4 stars, because I agree with the potential of the idea but I also think that more general detail is needed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The phases of the project development are informed in a superficial way. Firstly, we do not know how long the project would take to develop in its entirety; we know that phase 2 would take 6-10 weeks to complete, and phase 3 would take 2-4 weeks. What about phase 1 and 4? While they are already underway, it would be important for the proponent to provide us with an estimate of how long they would take to complete. The activities that make up each phase should also be better detailed; in phase 1: how would \u201cthe interest of a wide range of universities and entrepreneurship clubs be gained to assess demand\u201d? How would this project be marketed? How would the target audience be aware of the existence and advantages of such a platform? It would be important that the dissemination plan was explained in an exact way, so that we could be sure that the maximum number of students and companies would be involved with this initiative. In phase 3 it is said that online or local job fairs would be held, if they were local, in which countries (or countries) would they be organized? It is possible to assess that in the budget division, no money is destined for the organization of face-to-face meetings, so it would be necessary to have more security in relation to variables such as rent, etc., necessary for local fairs to be possible. In general, all phases are mentioned in a very short and succinct way, more explanations are necessary so that we have an understanding of what would be done and also how. Regarding the division of the budget, 15,500 dollars are requested for the realization of the project. The amount is divided into 3 parts: the work of the developers, the marketing and mentoring program. All 3 parts should be more detailed too, so we could understand exactly how the money would be used. Most of the money would go towards the developers' work, but what would their work routines look like? How much would you be charged per hour of work? How many hours per week would they dedicate themselves to the project? Regarding marketing, we would need to understand how it would be done, so that we would know how the 3 thousand dollars would be used - would it be done through social networks, would the money be for paid advertising in these media? And in relation to the mentoring program, this would also need to be better explained, it is not clear what this program would be, what the mentors would do. Would they be employees who would be helping students to find the best opportunities, to prepare curricula in more attractive ways for companies, for example? Finally, speaking of the team, although little information has been given about the duo, it is said that they have previous experience working at Cardano, including full-time, which conveys a lot of confidence that they are prepared to successfully develop this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, auditability leaves something to be desired, due to the small amount of information suggested for us to monitor both the process and the final results. Regarding the process, it is said that \u201cwe will be working on an agile mansion for developmental milestones, as well as to keep up with the business needs of our students and mentors\u201d. What would these developmental milestones be? How would the needs of students and mentors be monitored? It would be necessary for the proponent, at first, to better detail the roadmap, so that we would have more content to carry out the monitoring of the phases. If we knew exactly what would have to happen, how and when, we would be able to audit whether activities were being done as planned. It would also be necessary for the proponent to inform the Cardano community of important updates, such as milestones, partial results that would be achieved throughout the development of the project. In theory, we have a lot of things to audit here: website development (both programming and design); the scope of the project (marketing, public engagement - companies and students); degree of hiring, how many students who signed up on the platform would have gotten internships, for example... Talking about final results, again if the proponent provided us with a very small amount of information to be perceived, success would be faced by the realization of online/face-to-face fairs of jobs and with a robust mentoring program. But we would need to know specific information about each of these fairs, for example, how many would be taking place, how many participants (how many students and how many companies), where they would be happening (how many % online, how many % in person - and where, in person)... , in addition to whether the fairs took place, how was the level of use of them - for this, a satisfaction survey could be carried out between students and companies, understanding numerical data such as the percentage of students who were hired in relation to the whole who participated in the event , if the companies found the fairs to be really facilitators and catalysts for hiring to take place, etc. It would be necessary to understand the impact of all this for Cardano, if through these new stages, more projects built on our blockchain would be being carried out; whether metrics like the number of smart contracts/Ada in circulation/CNFTs minted/active community members would be growing and etc. In general, I disagree that the auditability of the project is adequate in the way it was presented.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 10, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 194, "q0": "The proposal wants to create a section dedicated to students on their job center platform, by provide parallel functionality to their job center platform; add the ability to create a profile and connect LinkedIn for students to network with other students that share similar interests; create a mentor system for base level students to understand what is going on in the Cardano ecosystem and what opportunities are potentially available to them. This will attract the interest of just graduated people with innovated minds to the space. \n\nThe proposer aims to have a network of students that now have awareness of the Cardano ecosystem and its capabilities.

The proposed presentation will add value to the Cardano ecosystem by building on the platform of the proposer's work center, the proponent will create a section dedicated to students. This will be going to for a young age, determined to find incredible opportunities in the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal also made in terms of value-added implementation is: the need to assess the level of interest and determine if the organization of an online or local work fair is more appropriate. From a construction point of view, the time to participate in the local work fair will be shorter while the online system is built but this is more dependent on cooperation with the company or the university. The result is an existing network of students aware of the Cardano ecosystem and its functions. I believe that with such an approach, the project will be able to grow further and will tackle future formulations. I rate this project 5 *.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent has provided evidence of the relevant skills and experience required to implement the proposal.

Mr. Erick Avalos - has years of software engineering experience at a publicly-traded company dealing with high-integrity code. he is also the core developer of an NFT project on Cardano. is a team with experience in software engineering from university majors, to traditional corporations and now Cardano development. Having the ability to leverage key partners to host online or local job fairs is a strategic location. The proponent can also provide a budget, but the proposed budget does not match the set budget and has not been clearly outlined. The proponent gave a realistic timetable to complete the work with 4 stages but the proponent has not given a specific time, so we cannot follow up in detail. I would like the proponent to be able to determine the duration of the project and clearly outline how long each phase will take. The proponent has considered the risks involved and has come up with a measure. Specifically:\nKeep a healthy distribution among students with Cardano-related opportunities available.\nOne way to mitigate this is to host webinars or training sessions and networking events that will leave students with something to take away if nothing else works for them.

The solution: I somehow agree to the parallel term ( which is very supportive way to create a good network and spreading the information while many roadmap must be done ), But using Linkedin again as the identity solution to new employment seems a little bit traditional. But the additional feature \"Mentor\" System might find a way to recruit many people to join in and have more activity on Cardano Ecosystem. Yet, this proposal don't explain how it will work that well. The story of how they accomplish their plan is also ambigouty, technically they not present a channel distribution or even leads and account ( yeah we can see how Linkedin provides data on employment issues). The Result: being aware of Cardano ecosystem is the first step of knowing the very existence and utility of Cardano. But the Proposer maybe saw that  \"a network of student\" will be assembled through their job Fair System. The proposed solution that will address the Challenge : only mention about three things : Mentorship, Entrepreneurship opportunity, and differentiation tactic to attract working situation for students. Yes i will agree to the activity which will deliver some students actively on Discord. Right on target and place to educate. The proposer must also have interest on branding content, brand existence of Cardano, decision to join in, and also buying or spending their time for participation and future benefit that the students / graduates get. The last impact(risk that could prevent): if webinar, trainning, and mentor system do not work out, as they already mention this is also a risk, then, they are not confident enought to launch such activity, yet the potential and strength of the market has been notice by the Proposer.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Feasibility phase 1: now i can clearly see that they already do something about the addressed problem and challenge, yet remain no further link to this current condition.phase 2: i still wonder on how the form of student center will works on this project. if it is attach to university motivation and plan, it will be bandwagon term, which we know the value won't be deliver fully understandable.phase 3 will follow up the phase 1 result: how many companies, employers and also on what categories of common interest, and when it will benefit Cardano Ecosystem beside Discord link of Cardano.

I am hoping that this proposal have more links and breakdown on the roadmap and contents.Feasibility 2: Budget breakdown of three main cost, development of 10k is huge for the scope of work on this kind of proposal. i wonder which will cost more, development or partnership type. 2.5 k mentorship program can be maximized if the Mentor participant are really comes from blockchain ecosystem, which i assume that it will make an involvement of more than 5 people.

Creating an integration center for this purpose is undoubtedly a great way to spread the knowledge and use of blockchain, as one of the first professional experiences of students can already be in this area, which will certainly make it easier for their future choices to also belong to this area. of technology. Thus, without a doubt, the idea that motivates this project is very interesting and relevant, as well as fitting correctly into the challenge in question.

However, as mentioned earlier, when we analyze the budget details, we realize that the allocations make sense and it is even interesting to see the team's concern with directing expenses to the project's marketing.

However, we have that the presence of some well-defined parameters would be very useful to better understand the evolution of events. Some of these parameters could be, for example, how many projects are offering vacancies at fairs and how many students are actually getting these opportunities. The perception of success described is in accordance with what was developed in the proposal, in addition, it would be interesting if some goals were exposed to clarify the perception of success or not of the project. Such goals could be an average number of participants in the fairs to be reached or a certain number of partnerships between students and companies.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 0, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2068, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is great, a job fair for students in a growing industry will offer a lot of great opportunities because there are so many college students who struggle all the way to find a job when they graduate.

This proposal is certainly nice and complete, it tackles some really important issues that are key to this challenge. However, it is a pity here that in the challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" the budget limit per proposal is $5,000, this is aimed at helping more students experience the resource support from Catalyst. This proposal requires a budget of $17,500 which is already over budget, so I think your proposal would be a better fit for the \"Developer Ecosystem\" challenge as it also meets the \"attracting developers from outside the community participating in Catalyst\".

The first is about the roadmap, the proposal provides us with 4 stages and what actions will be included in each of them. It is good that 2 out of 4 phases (phase 1 and phase 4) are in progress, it would be nice to propose in more detail what specific activities are included in those phases. For example, \"Phase 1 - (ongoing): Garner is interested in a range of universities, entrepreneurial clubs, and companies to assess needs\" the proposal might present the phase. When does this segment start and will end at what time (expected), and how many universities and business clubs will be interested in assessing demand? How many % have you done at this stage? Although they explain the basic operations to be performed, they do not place us in a specific time and space, nor do we know whether the stages here will be performed in parallel or this action ended and then continue with other actions and who will be in charge of those activities? We don't have many details to fully understand the development of the project.\nNext is the budget, the proposal requires $ 17,500, for this challenge this is not a small number compared to the regulations. However, the explanation I think is quite superficial. \"\"10k developers - (2 February developers).-5k marketing/partnerships - (2 months).-2.5k mentoring program - (correspondingly spread based on participants ). It can be seen that there is no close connection between the roadmap and the budget presented. For example: for a $5,000 marketing/partnership for 2 months, we need to know what the marketing strategy of the proposal is, how many members will do it, and in what period it will take?\nAnd finally, about the team, this is perhaps the best-presented part of the possibility. We know that the person who proposed is the duo Keith Hedges & Erick Avalos, both software engineers and active members of Cardano, and the proponent also provided LinkedIn links to its 2 members so we can verify their qualifications.

The proposal also doesn't provide any KPIs. There are no small goals set, so I can't determine how we will audit this project.
