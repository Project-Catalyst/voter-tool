The challenge setting that it\u2019s submitted in, dedicated to students, actually has a very clear purpose and metrics described. Even so, while I understand that the proposer would very much prefer to spend his time learning about Cardano and contributing to the ecosystem, instead of having to get a \u201cfiat job\u201d, he needs to write a clearly defined proposal of what he will be offering in return for the funding. The term research in this context, since it is not accompanied by any other descriptions seems to me to be a little too vague, and as such, it puts me in the position where I cannot agree that this proposal can have an impact on our blockchain.\nI would advise the proposer to think about what he will be researching DAOs about, even if it\u2019s not exact, there should be a purpose in his research and an expected estimate of results. And while one of the consequences of getting funded is that it might \u201cincrease my quality of life while researching and contributing\u201d, that is a by-product and not the main driving force behind writing a proposal.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As mentioned above, I am unclear about the purpose of the research that is mentioned throughout this proposal. The detailed plan does not offer any concrete details and seems to me to be too superficial, as it does not offer any specific inputs. It only paints a general solution of conducting research on DAOs and publishing the results, but no specifics are given. I would have expected some details in regards to what areas the research will be conducted in, what the purpose is, how long will it take to conduct the research, how long will it take to analyse and publish the results etc.\nWhen it comes to the budget, I found that it also does not offer any kind of details, just a mention of \u201c5000 USD worth of ADA will be directly used to improve my ability to pursue my goals\u201d and it will be used as a stipend to convert to cash or spend on assets - I imagine the proposer means NFTs in this case, especially since one of the DAOs he is referencing is linked to a somewhat controversial NFT project on Cardano, flagged by some members for dishonesty.\nI find slightly worrying the fact that the proposer does not provide any details about himself, and that the majority of his short team description is about the project mentor, Adam Rusch, a well-known Cardano Community member. My evaluation cannot be on the proposal mentor, but on the person who submits the proposal, to see if that person does have the necessary skills and commitment to implement the project. In this case, due to the fact that the proposer has avoided answering the question, I will consider it a red flag, especially tied together with the lack of concrete information about the goals and implementation of the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I cannot see the connection between the research described in the implementation and feasibility section of this proposal and the Twitter spaces that will be used to track the proposal\u2019s progress. While communicating with other individuals can produce good results in a research environment, I cannot agree with the fact that it\u2019s a good way to measure a project\u2019s evolution. Especially since Twitter spaces only remain available to the general public for 14 days or so, and as such, the Cardano Community would not be able to judge the implementation advancement with a method that becomes unavailable after such a short period of time.\nIn the final question about success definition, I found that it seemed to be almost from an entirely different proposal, as there was no mention of DAOs or research whatsoever, even though the goal of this proposal is to research them and publish the findings. \nUnfortunately, due to the reasoning specified above, I cannot agree that this proposal can be successfully audited by the Cardano and Catalyst community.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 6, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3512, "q0": "No career is built without taking the risks involved in the process. With many years of experience in the world outside of Catalyst and considerable time within the Catalyst universe, I can state with full knowledge that compared to the outside world, the opportunities in our ecosystem are abundant.  They are everywhere: mentors, teams, paid management positions (PA, VPA, Challenge Team member) from which you can absorb knowledge and experience from the best as a sponge, bounties chaser, funded proposer, etc.   A sense of collaboration, sharing and helping each other in such massive amounts that it is difficult not to feel this ecosystem as a real home where we try to take care of each other.  I celebrate with the deepest honesty that the proposer is involved in one of the many projects that an active member of Catalyst can be a part of (and can be a part of just by saying \"I want to\", it's that simple here).  However, from there, a path of hard work begins in which the passion and fire of wanting to do something must be fueled with hard work and sacrifice the old fashioned way: taking PA positions, Challenge Team member positions, doing some work through bounties, doing various jobs, etc.  Just like in the outside world, but with the advantage that here inside, in our community, in our ecosystem, you will find the necessary alternatives to follow your own path.  The proposal presented by the proposer does not formulate a solution to a problem, a solution that contributes to the growth or strengthening of the Cardano ecosystem, and in the business of presentation of proposals that is a fundamental parameter. Therefore, there is no positive impact to be generated from this proposal.  Consequently, I must give a low rating of 1 star.  As someone who has traveled the road and still has a long way to go while having to put bread on the table for his family, I send the student my message of encouragement and a piece of reassurance: the system takes care of those who work hard and do not let go of the bone they have chosen to defend.    \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The Feasability section of the proposal is a good record of the proposer's journey journal as a member of Catalyst that corresponds to one of the classic patterns that tends to end in a tangible contribution of the member to the Cardano ecosystem: description of an area of study to explore (DAO), an organization that will support his study (Boss DAO), a mentor (Adam Rusch), possible paths to take during the academic exercise (working groups, collaborative research).  It is a promising path that the proposer is charting for himself and his life project in our community.  I have no doubt that we will hear from him again very soon with a solution to a problem that will allow Catalyst to progress in understanding such a complex and emerging issue.  However, for the time being, the Feasability section of the proposal does not constitute a plan for implementing a proposal connected to a budget that will ultimately result in a solution to a problem.  Therefore, I must give the low rating of 1 star.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "In general, there is no implementation process to be measured, since there is no solution to be implemented, since there is no concrete problem that has been identified.  Therefore, there are no KPIs to measure something productive.  Consequently, since there is no object to be audited, I must give the low rating of 1 star.  However, I wish the student a path full of opportunities, because his path is just beginning, and although it may be difficult to understand, submitting this proposal was one of the best decisions he made: the next one will be a solid competitor.

However, the plan aspect would improve significantly by providing a timeline with a clear time horizon for each of those milestones.
