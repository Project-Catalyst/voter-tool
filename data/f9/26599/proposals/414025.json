The project intends to popularize knowledge about blockchain within the university. The idea of promoting the training of students in the area of Technology, so that they understand the ways of using blockchain technology to implement these projects seems to us to be quite adequate and effective, since from small projects there may be developments to larger ones, which come to provide decent work and remuneration for those who are entering the market, and who wish to develop their own projects, instead of entering the traditional financial market, where they would possibly not have opportunities to progress as in an independent project. Considering that innovative ideas can arise within the reality experienced by the student at the university, and that they can often be implemented by beginner developers, but who need financial support to start a project, the idea is to bring the basic knowledge of how the system works, to facilitate the proposal of projects based on Cardano blockchain. We also understand that due to the growing volume of proposals and proposers, it will be necessary to promote adequate training so that these students have the necessary intellectual resources to propose consistent projects, adequate to the reality of the university student, and that can be developed to solve not so grandiose projects, but that will favor the insertion of the use of the Cardano platform in the execution of these projects, which can be useful in various sectors of society, such as local commerce, exemplified by the proponent.

Therefore, we consider the idea of investing initially, through groups already formed and accustomed to the university's internal communication, in the dissemination of the idea, in order to draw attention to the project. And the fact that the call comes from a team of people already engaged in communication work, and well known at the university, will bring credibility to the communication.

As for the execution, it would be convenient to establish a period between the meetings, so that one can have an idea of the exact duration of their duration. It would also be interesting to establish some kind of evaluation method, such as an ideas workshop for the elaboration of projects, at the end of the training, to better solidify the teachings taught. Regarding the team, the formation of only one member was mentioned, citing that he works with five other people, but without specifying the formation of these others. It is worth remembering that, in addition to the technical knowledge of how to disseminate knowledge in the university environment, it will also be necessary to understand how much the team is trained to train students, in relation to the basic concepts of the blockchain system, and this point was not well specified in the proposal.

The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it.

I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). \n\nTaking into account the above reasoning, I must remove three stars from the final rating.   \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The information provided as the proposal implementation plan (Feasability and Miro board section) is sufficient to understand the scope of the project to be executed.  Based on my real world experience as an educator and entrepreneur, the numbers listed in the budget are in line with the type of project to be implemented.  The information provided on the work team is sufficient to establish their background and strength, in addition to the fact that some names are easily recognizable by their active participation in the community.  However, based on the reasoning provided in the Impact section, they are competing in a category that was not designed for them.  The Challenge guidelines are clearly stated.

Who is going to teach them? How many times are the sessions going to be held? As for context, the proposer is planning to build a community hub at the University of Cambridge, which already has clusters and networks that promote the development of certain technologies. This is an opportunity to foster bright-minded students to collaborate and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem, perhaps by participating through Catalyst. By the end of the project, a community that consists of selected students who are interested in Cardano will be formed.\n\nThat being said, it is still hard to determine what their learning outcome would be. The proposer already mentioned that five events are going to be held. However, the information about what the students would do or learn at those events is still not present in the proposal.

List the topics they would share, pick the speakers, plan the activities, and perhaps incentivize the students to get involved with Cardano or Catalyst.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "With the current plan, it is still hard to determine whether or not the implementation is executable. The budget is broken down into items, but it is tough to understand what those items are going to be used for.

I strongly advise the proposer to elaborate more on the budget item details as if they were explaining them to a random stranger. By doing this, not only could we approve and rationalize the budget request, but they could also stumble across things that might perhaps need additional funding or unexpected problems. For the same reason, I would also advise the proposer to change the use of academic terms (opting for months instead) and turn their implementation items into each span within the timeline, essentially turning them into milestones. It is unfortunate that I can\u2019t give my support for this idea because the proposer does have relevant experience and they have been involved with Catalyst before, but, as presented right now, the proposal is missing a lot of crucial details, although they are definitely revisable.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As of now, I disagree that we could audit the proposal for a number of reasons.

For example, the proposer targets the adoption of early adopters, but how can we measure this exactly? One way to mitigate it might be to target X students to join, Y many events are held, Z many activities, etc. That being said, the proposer does provide a way for us to keep track of what\u2019s happening through their Twitter.
