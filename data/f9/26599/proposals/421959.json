The only words modified are the replacements for the word \u201cEcuador\u201d with \u201cParaguay\u201d and that\u2019s it, the proposers haven\u2019t even considered replacing the capital city of Ecuador, Quito, with the capital of Paraguay, Asunci\u00f3n. While this on its own does not necessarily constitute a problem, only perhaps makes me question the team\u2019s involvement in their projects; the fact that it is clearly required and specified in the proposal submission that the team should describe what other proposals they are working on or have submitted in the current fund, raises a red flag, especially for a proposer who has submitted several proposals, with almost identical content and has answered \u201cNo\u201d at the question if they are working on any other proposal in Fund 9. As such, my reviews will also be for the most part identical, as the proposals themselves also are.\nWhen I started reading the proposal, I actually got excited by the description of its solution, namely \u201cOur teams goal is to continue educating rural students on blockchain technology\u201d in Paraguay. The proposal goes on to describe how it will organise workshops with rural students, onboard them into the project\u2019s discord and help them eventually submit proposals to Project Catalyst. Until I read that the events will be taking place in Quito (here the team probably forgot to replace the capital city of Ecuador with the capital city of Paraguay), which is also the most populated city in the country. So, obviously, my enthusiasm lowered and I started to ask myself why the proposers chose to present the proposal like this, and where the mistake might lie? Do they have additional information showing that the majority of students in Quito (or perhaps Asunci\u00f3n?) come from rural areas and didn\u2019t think to present this important piece of information, or is the project actually not aimed at rural students any longer? \nBecause the proposals are almost identical to one another, and the proposer have chosen not to reveal that they have submitted other projects in this fund, I feel like they are not completely honest and not very involved in their projects. Especially for a proposal that aims at having workshops with students to attract them to Cardano, genuine involvement and enthusiasm are crucial for it to be successful.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For the most part, I find the plan described somewhat sufficient, however, I kept having a question in the back of my mind that kept bugging me, namely: the proposers mention that the workshops will be about \u201cthe advancements in cardano\u201d, yet that is such a general statement, that I cannot consider it to be sufficient. I really would have liked to know more than just that. Will the workshops be more technical in nature, geared towards more technical students or will they be geared towards a more general population of non-technical students that would be taught general facts?\nRegarding the budget, I find it to be sufficiently detailed and the amounts requested for each segment are very reasonable and cover all marketing aspects, venue rentals and needed materials for the workshops.\nThe team has very short sentences describing their title and previous achievements in Project Catalyst as funded proposers. Perhaps some more details regarding their skills and knowledge would have provided not just me, but the entire community with some much needed information, that we could base our decisions on. I appreciate the fact that the educators have already been found and named in the proposal, although a short description of their knowledge would have further helped in the assessment, as I cannot judge if they are the right people for the task, if I don\u2019t know their knowledge in regards to the Cardano blockchain.\nGiven the missing details described above, I find I cannot agree on whether this proposal can be successfully implemented, but I also cannot disagree, therefore, my score will be a neutral 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "At a first glance, I found the auditability section to be adequately written in regards to this proposal, however, as I analysed the information provided, I found myself with some unanswered questions.

A place, that the community can easily access and evaluate the advancement taking place, otherwise, we can only rely on the information provided from a centralised source, namely, the proposers.\nFurther on, when reading the answer to the success question I also found it to be partially incomplete, as there is no clear number given in regards to how many new community members will be onboarded, and the proposal describes it as \u201ca substantial number\u201d, which can be any number whatsoever. \nDue to the elements I have pointed out, I find myself in the same position as not being able to either agree or disagree with the ability to evaluate the project\u2019s progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 9, "ng": 10, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3170, "q0": "This proposal is for a 1-time seminar/workshop to educate ~100 Ecuadorian students about Cardano.

The event proposed by the proposers in the proposal can undoubtedly become a great source of initiatives for our community and a great incentive for students. However, unfortunately this proposal acts outside of the guidelines clearly stated in the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\". I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section).  The proposal presented is a proposal made FOR the students, but not BY the students. It is evident that the proposers are a mature organization, with experience in the field of application of the proposal, and if the Challenge were not specific in the type of proposers qualified to submit proposals in it, they would undoubtedly be the right ones to execute a project of this magnitude. The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious.  Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it.  That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves.\n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.  \n\nAs an educator, I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid.  However, in our particular case, this proposal is not designed by the students that the Challenge is intended to support, which is why it does not align with the spirit that the Challenge seeks to support.\n\n\nThe above arguments are the reason that leads me to deduct three stars from the final rating.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal implementation plan is lacking in details related to the proposal execution process: details about the criteria for student enrollment, about the academic material to be taught at the workshop, about the topics to be covered by the speakers, about the distribution of incentives related to the budget, that kind of information that is completely missing.   The lack of details in the implementation plan makes it difficult to understand the figures related to the budget.  On the other hand, I wonder if one month of preparation is enough to fill the auditorium with 100 people or more (Shirts, Mugs, Pens, Bags and others could be left undelivered if not enough people attend the event).  Therefore, as an evaluator I still have a lot of questions to answer.  That is the reason why I have to remove 2 stars from the final rating.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is no doubt that the related items are appropriate measurement points for measuring overall project performance. However, providing a way in which proposers will proceed to measure them would reduce the overall character they currently have. What kind of identifiers will proposers assign to each workshop attendee once they are in our ecosystem?  How will you track the actions of workshop attendees within the Catalyst ecosystem?   The answer to questions like this is really complex because the suggested KPIs lead to the idea of engaging in a permanent effort to track the trajectory of a potential workshop graduate in several areas, each one equally complex: Staking, minting, submitting proposals, getting their proposals funded, etc.  Therefore, I find the KPIs as currently defined in the proposal very general, consequently, without a tangible measurement structure that can be used to measure true performance.  Unfortunately, this is the reason why I must remove two stars from the final rating.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2462", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4006, "q0": "The proposal aims to create one or several workshops (hosted in Ecuador), and onboard new members (students) to the Cardano ecosystem through education, networking and incentives. It is clearly communicated what problem the proposers want to address, and what they want to do about it. Worth mentioning is that the proposer has two other proposals circulating Fund 9, one of them being in the same challenge as this. (Link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422335 )\nSo there might be some similarities in my assessment of these, since the two proposals of this challenge is identical on the impact section, but more on that later.\n\nThe idea of exposing students and their ideas to blockchain technology through education and networking is in alignment with the challenge. The proposer also shares the intention of incorporating these students as part of the team which will create a natural exposure to working with developers and engineers, but without throwing them right out on the open market immediately. Having these students be part of the Cardano ecosystem from the start as proposers (and provide them with resources), PAs, developers or voters has a chance to bring lots of value in the form of active future participants.  \n\nI would have loved to see a deeper explanation on how the proposers plans to encourage students to create their own proposals, since there is a heavy emphasis on how students can be incorporated rather than educated in this challenge. \nApart from creating a discord server, and the networking that will occur during the workshop, how will the students be involved? Almost all of the budget is allocated to hosting the mega-workshop with 100-150 attended students, but is that workshop dedicated to education, networking or creating a hackathon-like event? Some clarity on this would strengthen the proposal further. Overall, it Is my opinion that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As mentioned under \u2019Impact\u2019, this proposal is a mirror of another proposal with a different geographical focus. This will affect my rationale being mirrored in an equal way across these two proposals. I would suggest that the proposer includes this information in their upcoming proposals. Both for increased transparency but also for the ability for PAs to assess the proposal fairly. (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422335/)\n\nThe team consists of 4 core members (and two additional educators from another team) with varied background, their experience being listed on their official website. Here, I would suggest providing more links to validate the expertise of the team members (such as LinkedIn, social media, Github etc). Most team members does seem to have experience of being proposers from earlier Funds, which speaks well for long term commitment to the ecosystem. After doing some detective work I could only find one proposal that had been approved from Fund 8 (Link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400210 ), but couldn\u2019t find information on how far that has progressed. Including this type of information would in my experience as a recurring PA further increase how confidently I can trust the proposers to see the project from start to finish, but also validate the commitment that they have to the ecosystem. \n\nWe are provided with a budget breakdown, and it looks realistic in regards to what is presented. Including some Cardano swag-products is not a bad idea, since it is basically walking billboards. In my understanding, the whole budget of 5000 will be allocated to focusing on the actual workshop (planned for happening one month after being funded), does that mean nothing of the budget allocation will go to compensate for the teams working hours? Speaking from my experience as a teacher, an educational workshop for 100-150 people would potentially need something more than merchandise, catering and paying for travel and lodging for the guest teachers. For example, I would love to see an example of the curriculum that the workshop will follow. \nWill the educational content be created by the team, someone else or free resources found on the internet? If the focus lie on on-boarding students and encouraging them through educating them, shouldn\u2019t there be more money being geared towards those segments? \n\nI\u2019m glad to see that the proposers have listed two potential risks, and provided sufficient solutions to these. Incentives are always a good way to get people to show up, and discord is a widely used platform by people of all ages. The fact that the team already holds workshops in Paraguay and Ecuador and aims to improve their educational content continuously will benefit them in the long run. \u2028Speaking of risks, I am slightly worried about the workload that the core team might have excluded from the proposal if all of them end up being funded. \u2028Firstly, the mirrored proposal has an identical plan as this one: hosting a workshop with 100-150 participants after one month of being funded, educating them and potentially incorporating them into the team. Who will do the community management, and which of the team members will be responsible for which parts? Furthermore, do they plan on doing this in parallel with working on the previously funded documentary, and potentially a proposal featured in another challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422439 ) at the same time? I would have loved to see some clarifications on how the team aims to tackle these potential risks.  \n\nBased on the points explained above, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Considering this proposal is an exact mirror of another proposal in the same challenge (but with different geographical focus, mentioned and linked under \u2019impact\u2019) my rationale will be reflected in the same way. (Since it contains the same information) \n\nIn order to measure the success of the implementation of this project, it would be of great benefit if the proposer provided further details. In its current form, we are provided with the target of onboarding new members to the ecosystem, and including a target number of how many new members would be amazing. Furthermore, if there had been a clear roadmap with a more detailed timeframe (for example, after this many months after being funded and completing this event, we aim to have onboarded 50 new members as proposers or PAs, or as team members). Furthermore, where will the community be able to follow the development progress? It could be a dedicated social media channel that is open to the public, providing updates from events where the team can answer questions. We have a lot of information on what the proposer aims to do, but would have liked to see more details on how the proposer aims to do it. \n\nWe are provided with some KPIs in the form of discord group-activity, submitted proposals (by on-boarded students?), catalyst activity, etc. But as mentioned before, these KPIs would be of much more value if it was paired with target numbers, timeframes and details of open communication channels. (Ideascale is wonderful in many ways, but is it the best place to communicate with every participant?)\n\nHistorically (speaking from my experience as a recurring PA), transparency is key. It builds confidence for the team and good communications with collaborators and potential members. \n\u2028Overall, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

What are the activities expected to be undertaken to ensure project implementation? What are the timelines for these activities.

This could help confirm the team\u2019s willingness to be transparent with this project.  Finally on the budget, a consider the items provided for budget allocation a bit too overpriced. Yes, this is a great project but the overall amount for the budget should be reconsidered. For instance, the cost of the event venue is more than the average market price.

During this workshop, participants will be introduced to all the cardano advancements and will be onboarded into the ecosystem via ada airdrops, nft minting, wallet creation, project catalyst onboarding, and discord server onboarding to gain access to resources like the weekly LatAm Town Hall.This proposal shows a thorough comprehension of the issue at hand, and the proposed remedy is excellent as well.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2916", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11555, "q0": "The project's main goal is straightforward: to host a workshop in rural Equador to educate on Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and onboarding students into the Cardano Ecosystem. The intended impact aligns well with the challenge, particularly in the context of students in rural areas where access to blockchain education is severely limited. As mentioned by the proposer, the workshop will be targeted locally by utilizing lecturers who speak multiple languages, which will provide an excellent opportunity to bring Cardano and Catalyst to a wider audience. While I find the proposal to be very interesting, I also believe it is overly focused on student onboarding based on external incentives - at least based on what is written in the Budget section, where the following items are mentioned = Cardano Sawg, NFTs, Incentives... Tokens, etc. In my opinion, it would be preferable to go into greater detail about how potential education about these technologies could increase the likelihood of entrepreneurial endeavors and creativity among studens. Furthermore, I see no mention of how the project could connect more senior Catalyst members or Cardano engineers with students who might be interested in future collaboration, which is one of the challenge's main goals.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While I found the workshop\u00a0to be easily organized, I also noticed several issues concerning the project's feasibility. Most importantly, the timeframe only states that the workshop will be held one month after the funds are received. Nothing is said about how the entire workshop will be conceptualized, planned, and refined. Whether there will be a step in which the Catalyst community can provide feedback to help refine the workshop's content. While it is clear that the Team has prior experience with Cardano funding and organizing such events, the proposal lacks at least some description of the roles and responsibilities of the mentioned team members. The profiles of the team members can be found on the provided website. On the worst side there is no specific information about the educations - only their names are mentioned and their profiles are not mentioned in the provided website. While the proposal mentions that the lecturers can translate into multiple languages, there is no further detail on which languages or how they will organize the event so that they can devote their time to students speaking a specific language. Most importantly, I believe the budget is a little ambiguous. While the cost of the venue rental and related costs is well justified, I believe that the cost of advertising \"Swag\" items is unnececery. Instead, it could have been used to produce a survey (paper based or online)\u00a0to evaluate what the community truly needs.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the KPIs mentioned are relevant for assessing the success of onboarding new members of the ecosystem and Catalyst, I suspect that the community has only a limited opportunity to monitor project progress, based on what is written in the proposal. There is no mention of where or how the community will be kept up to date - no social media links, for example. There is only a vague mention about a \"participation in varius discord groups.\" I suspect the linked website will be used, as previous cardano meetups and workshops were mentioned there. Apart from mentioning that the workshop will be held one month after funding, there is no mention of a roadmap, milestones, or particular delivery dates. On the other hand, the website linked in the proposal description indicates that the event will take place eventually, as at least six meetings have been organized by this group in Latin American countries since the beginning of April.

These proposals are very similar in their structure and vision. As a result, the assessments for this set of proposals will also be similar]\n\nThe proposal addresses the problem about the lack of awareness and knowledge of Cardano, specifically targeted at students in Ecuador. The proposed solution is to provide knowledge and information about Cardano via workshops for university students. The topics that will be brought up in this includes Cardano advancements, wallet creation, project catalyst, onboarding students to join a Discord server, etc. The topics chosen are relevant for educating students of the Cardano ecosystem however I think some introductory topics to blockchain and Cardano in general can prove beneficial for students that are still unaware or don\u2019t understand the blockchain technology and its role. I think the idea of doing a workshop can add value to Cardano since it can bring more awareness to Cardano and this can act as a catalyst to draw new talents to join the community that have the potential to further development and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members have past experience implementing projects similar to this in past Fund 7 (e.g. networking events in Ethiopia) showing they have the relevant experience and skills needed to implement this project.\n\nThe roadmap is pretty simple and well laid out since the workshop will only be done once (at least for this round of funding) and the first month after funding will be used to set up the workshop. I\u2019d prefer if there was an explicit schedule going over renting the venue, contacting speakers, and other preparations leading up to the event but overall, the roadmap seems realistic to be completed in time.\n\nThe budget has been broken down quite well going over each resources needed, such as venue rental, catering, fee for speakers, participant incentives, etc. I\u2019d like if there were more explanations regarding the \u201cadvertising materials\u201d {i.e. the medium for marketing, the number of resources (if it\u2019s physical), etc.}.

Further, it seeks to make such students be scouted more easily by engineering professionals through the exposure brought by a successful Catalyst proposal.\n\nThis proposal is designed to work with a range of students, teaching a variety of block chain related skills (such as using wallets, creating NFTs, and using a discord server). Further, it proposes to teach them about the Cardano block chain and its development. Finally, it has the goal of encouraging the students to be active members of Project Catalyst, both as assessors and as proposers, particularly proposals that would benefit their communities.\n\nThis proposal goes beyond the scope of the challenge to reach more than engineering students. Such students certainly would benefit from what the workshop would teach them, particularly the part about making proposals in Catalyst. However, this proposal would align more closely to the challenge\u2019s objectives if it focused more on fostering proposals for entrepreneurial ideas within the field of engineering and with connecting with professionals in that field.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team proposes to hold an educational workshop for students concerning several aspects of block chain technology, on collaborating with their peers and other crypto enthusiasts, and on making proposals in Project Catalyst.\n\nAs the team is already conducting such workshops in Ecuador and Peru, they have the experience, teachers, and organization to effectively teach their students on these subjects. Specifically, their intent to improve their educational content based on lessons learned from these workshops will benefit the workshop in this proposal. Further, they rightly recognize the need to attract as many students as they can by tapping into a network of contacts, creating a community hub on a Discord server, and providing incentives for participation. As such, they are highly likely to implement their proposal successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team proposes several ways to measure the progress and success of this workshop, but they treat it as one in a continuing series, or one that tracks the students long after the workshop is over. Their proposed measures of progress tend to look past the workshop to later successes of their students.  The team provides a clear list of accomplishments they hope their students will achieve (such as submitting Catalyst proposals, staking ADA, Discord participation, and making wallets), and counting those who master these skills and goals will provide a quantitative measure of success. However, it seems that these would be counted at some point after the workshop. \n\nAs this proposal is for one event, it is problematic for auditing purposes to measure success at some unspecified date after its conclusion. If this is not the intent, then the proposal could be improved by providing a measure of success within the time period of the workshop.\n\nIt would help to know the length of the workshop, as a week-long session, for example, would give more time to measure and report student progress than a two-day workshop.\n\nFinally, the team writes that success of the project would be having a substantial number of students active on Project Catalyst or leading their own funded projects.
