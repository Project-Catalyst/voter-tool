As a positive point, I see the fact that the proponent has very defined who would be its target audience (business students from the Grenoble Ecole School of Management). The idea is to teach a BIB program (what is it? acronyms should always be spelled out in full so that all readers understand them) about Cardano and Catalyst, and then generate business ideas that will be shared with engineers already in our community. Some challenges may be the lack of ideas, the difficulty in retaining students' attention, and what is expected as a successful scenario would be precisely to present this blockchain universe to students. Analyzing it in a very practical way, the proposal fits the challenge, since we are looking here for ways to boost the student class about Cardano ecosystem technologies, generating opportunities for them and at the same time qualified labor to work on our projects, thus benefiting our blockchain, boosting its strengthening and expansion to different audiences. This would certainly be achieved here, in case the students of this school absorbed good acquaintances, who would be multiplied in the future (both among them - one person passes the knowledge to another), and in projects that these students would work on, either as interns, or in the future as frontline professionals. Some important details, however, were missing. We don't know exactly what specific topics would be covered. We know it would be a BIB program on Cadarno and Catalyst, but within this larger theme, how would the subjects be introduced? I believe that the teachings would start with initial concepts, such as what is blockchain, cryptocurrencies, etc., and then move on to a more in-depth approach, such as cases of use of this technology in practical life. But it would be important for the proponent to make it very clear and detailed which topics would be covered in which workshops. Finally, I would like to know how the present proponent can draw the attention of these students, arouse their interest in this topic that, despite being well established in some places, is still quite new depending on where we are. It is also not so clear how this bridge between students and engineers would take place: it would probably be online, but we do not know if they would be direct meetings between the parties or would be mediated by the proponent. Anyway, what I think is that, yes, it is a good idea and aligned with the challenge, but that it still leaves something to be desired in relation to the details, which are quite important.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is viable, but this part is not perfect. I really liked the script of the proposal, because it is divided into weeks, and we know what activities would take place in them. We don't know exactly what would happen each week, as the proponent divides them up so they pair up, but I believe that from the way this information is presented, we have a very palpable understanding of what will be done. It is not such a complex proposal at the level of activities, however, the detail that I cited in the topic of impact would greatly enrich our understanding of the process itself. For example, in the first week, the time and place of the presentation would be defined. How would that be chosen? And in relation to the frequency of the workshops, as I already mentioned, how would it be chosen? How would these meetings be publicized? In weeks 3 and 4, how would this kind of consultation take place? The proponent explains that it will help students find ideas, supervise them and correct their mistakes. How will this be done? Will there be face-to-face meetings, once or twice a week? Would they be individual meetings with each student, or something more together? Although the temporal division has the desired degree of specificity, the detailing of the activities would greatly improve our understanding of the process. Regarding the budget, in my view, the division of funding is very clear, we have a full understanding of how the money would be divided and the amounts are fair. We know how much would be charged per hour of work, I believe that all payment would go to the bidder. The only part that I didn't understand very well was the administration, what would be the differential of this task in relation to the others, and why does this need a separate payment? Finally, analyzing the issue of team building, in fact the whole project will be handled by the proponent, from what I understand. Unfortunately, not so much trust is given to him because he doesn't have a very extensive curriculum, we are not sure of the ways in which he has experience and mastery over the Cardano ecosystem. We know he is a student and in the business field, but what makes him qualified to teach this course? I'm not belittling his professional background, but just reflecting on his level of involvement with our blockchain and our community. But trust would be passed if he presented some previous projects and experiences that were related to the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, I believe that yes, the proposal has considerable feasibility, but it still has points to evolve in this aspect.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The monitoring proposed by the proponent is good, but also a little superficial, in my opinion. He proposes some points that can be observed during the phases and processes, such as \u201chow many students participate in the project, number of ideas given, number of proposals that come from students and engineers\u201d and so on. He also comments that he will observe student feedback and deliver a final report. As the project will last 8 weeks, from what is described, in my view it would be interesting for him to give monthly feedback to the community regarding how the stages are developing. In addition to the number of students and ideas involved, it is very important to be sure whether these students would have actually absorbed the past knowledge, and to understand if their proposals align with the current goals of our blockchain. In addition to the ideas launched, if they would have the intention of continuing to deepen their knowledge regarding Cardano, too. Not only are partial results important, but also how the production behind them would be being done. The proponent would be fulfilling the agreed working hours, how could we understand if the meetings were being productive, if the ideas were being organized and reaching the engineers in the most appropriate way, etc? In general, what is provided is enough to understand the scenario in a broad way, but not with the appropriate degree of specificity, most of the indicatives are numerical, for example. Thinking about final results, 100% of the metrics drawn are numerical, which is not ideal, it would be important to qualitatively understand what the results were generated from this project. As I mentioned earlier in this topic: how would students be getting involved with Cardano's technologies, in addition to the ideas presented? Would they, in addition to forming the idea, participate in the projects, along with the engineers? How can we be sure that this course has reflected considerably on your study and professional perspectives, bringing long-term benefits to Cardano? That said, I think the auditability here is a kick-start of what should be monitored, providing us with basic information but it doesn't fully correspond to what should be observed. Ideally, there should be as much detail as possible about the monitoring of each phase, that this is easily accessible to the members of our community, and that direct research/studies with the target audience of the workshops are carried out, so that we can see it in practice. what were the consequences of this initiative. That said, I believe the auditability is good, but not 100% adequate.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 14, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11795, "q0": "I found the International students for Cardano proposal to solve the problem that the Challenge & Scouted for Students challenge's goal is to provide students with a place to engage their ideas with the world and opportunity to connect with engineers. The author's team got to the heart of the problem that students have a lot of business ideas but they lack knowledge about technology and how to develop them. I think this is a common problem nowadays, not only in France, the country of the authors, but also in Vietnam, the percentage of young people and students who know about Cardano and Catalyst to apply it business accounts for a very small proportion.\nI find the unique and outstanding feature of the proposal compared to other projects with the same challenge is that if other projects delve into creating a community, a playground for members who love Cardano to transmit knowledge, exchange information and come up with ideas then the proposal of International students for Cardano focuses on practical implementation combining the collection of external business ideas from those who know and do not know about Cardano to seek to establish cooperation with Cardano engineers. This shows that this proposal has high practical application to solve the problem.\nI completely agree with the solution that the author's team offered, which is to create an intermediary bridge that allows students to connect with engineers so that they can work on their projects to help them in addition to gaining more knowledge about Cardano also increases their ability to innovate and connects them to the engineering community. This model in my opinion is a concern that needs to be promoted by the Cardano community not only in France but should also be replicated.\nI know that in Vietnam, university students have a lot of business ideas, they also set up business clubs in the school to develop them, however, not personally or any club knows the application of Blockchain in practice and most of them still do business in the traditional direction. Therefore, they are in dire need of an intermediary bridge like this proposal to help them easily realize their plan. The success of the proposal also spread to help students know more about Cardano and Catalyst.\nTo score this proposal, I will give a score of 4 on the reasons that the proposal solved the problem of the challenge, differentiated it from other proposals of its kind, developed a blueprint solution, complete and easy to understand.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has given specific and easy to understand timelines by week. The author has also chosen and calculated the appropriate time to start implementing the project because this is the time to announce the funding results of fund 9 and the new school year for students in France will also begin during this time period.\nThe project's budget is broken down into detailed, clear and easy-to-understand items. With a budget of $ 4160, accounting for 83% for a budget limit in the challenge of $ 5000, this is a completely reasonable number. This makes it easy to budget, use and manage budgets.\nI see the author has also mentioned 2 risks that limit the success of the project: that the students don't come up with relevant, interesting ideas and they are not motivated to work with Cardano. The solution offered to solve these two problems is completely reasonable.\nThe author of this project is Benjamin Ben Zvi, although he is a sophomore, he already has a lot of experience with Cardano. I found the author information fully posted, publicly with references on instagram and linkedin completely verifiable. I also got to know Benjamin when evaluating a few other projects at this 9 fund. I believe that the author and the team will be able to carry out this project, so I will give the feasibility of this project a score of 4.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For this project, I find that the community can completely monitor the implementation progress and success when the author has planned and allocated a detailed and clear budget.\nKPIs to evaluate the success of the project is also outlined with 5 specific criteria, these criteria are measurable numbers such as how many students participate in the project, the number of ideas generated given, a number of proposals coming from students and engineers, feedback from students and how many engineers are involved.\nThis is a brand new project, the author wants to check the quality of the ideas being realized so that this proposal will go even further at the following funds, the measured project success indicators will be is at least 50 people for the presentation, at least 30 ideas are put forward, at least 10 are written proposals, at least 3 are funded.\nThe author has a group of advisors who are all experienced members and are currently active in the Cardano community, I see this as an advantage that helps the project if it is funded, it will quickly achieve remarkable successful results expect and I will give this part of the project a score of 4.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1043, "q0": "The plan presented in this proposal is straightforward, easy to understand and implement. The proposer will engage business students at the Grenoble Ecole de Management in France and find those interested to propose new ideas, either at the Gimbalabs Playground or potentially in Catalyst, and see where connections between engineers and students can form and start working on implementing their ideas.\nI find the proposal to be within the parameters of the challenge setting, with a potentially positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, as having new minds with fresh, different perspectives join the community can definitely prove to be an invaluable project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I find the presented plan to be well devised into weeks, with bullet points of actions, clear, concise and easy to follow. For the purpose of the proposal, I find the steps to be in good order, each one leading to the other, nothing seems to be missing and ending in a concrete goal. I especially like how in the first weeks the proposer will be getting his presentation started, then will be getting feedback from his intended audience and only then selects a group with which to continue working towards the final goal of writing proposals (for) the engineers.\nJust like the plan, the budget is concise, but also well structured, the amounts presented seem to be reasonable and the activities match well with the entire plan. The proposer seems to be well suited for the task, as he is a bachelor at the said University and therefore must know all the ins and outs, but also by having experience from his past Catalyst-funded collaborations. \nI consider this section of the proposal to be carefully devised.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer plans to devise a report containing the metrics he has established at the end of the project; he will be monitoring the number of students participating, the number of ideas given, and the feedback received. Considering the objective of the project, if the report is sufficiently detailed and contains data for each week (or any other time period designated by the proposer) it should suffice in the monitoring of the progress. And when it comes to the success of the project, I like that the proposer has chosen some modest numbers to start with, numbers that I would also consider a success and that are actually achievable. Not everything has to start big, and if the proposer is successful in his endeavour, these numbers will continue to grow exponentially.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 1, "ng": 17, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13395, "q0": "Cardano is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, with a blockchain that is a flexible, sustainable, and scalable platform for running smart contracts, which will allow the development of a wide range of decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more. Cardano engineers can make a great contribution to students from French Business Schools, who want to collaborate with Cardano, and the students themselves can be very helpful to this platform with their diverse ideas. The ideas of young, especially active students, provide the basis for a secure future, because at the end of the day the world remains on the youth. The engineers themselves, from the Cardano platform, all their knowledge and experience can pass on to these students, and new ideas from young people come in return. Both sides are in plus, on the one hand, the students get not only financial security but also knowledge, which they can use later, and on the other hand, engineers get new business ideas that they can turn into money. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The French business school students' plan is detailed, designed and well organized financially and timely. Their plan's been arranged for weeks, which they will use wisely. For example, in the first week, they planned to create a presentation for BIB class and set the time and place for the presentation, which would help to inform students later. A plan was devised for the next eight weeks, and in the last week engineers would choose the ideas and the people they want to work with, creating connections between students and engineers. The students also drew up a time plan to align their school commitments with the Catalyst project, so that neither side would be at a loss. Their plan was to spend extra time before and after school and then use it to cooperate with Catalyst. The only problem here is the overload of students with the school and the project, therefore they will not have free time for themselves and their needs. The suggestion for a solution to this problem is the school's collaboration with Cardan, so that they can help their students with this project. The help they can provide is to include the project in the school curriculum, so that the school does not tolerate their inactivity. The school would have a better reputation because of its active students, it is students who, including the school curriculum, have a salary.

According to the proposal, the whole process will take place in 8 weeks, it will be divided into 4 specific phases. In the weeks the proponent has given the target to do in the proposed week, I think this is a positive point of the project, but the task of the week I think is not reasonable as in the 2nd week I would like it to be presented more clearly (e.g. Introducing Cardano and Catalyst to students (2-3 hours). Who will be in charge of this introduction? and how can referrals to students be effective? -Answer the question, set up the questions so that students can be interested in the question?...)

The author's solution is directed towards the requirements of the challenge, is to organize training and mentoring students on Cardano and Catalyst, collect their potential business ideas and share them with Cardano engineers. The purpose of the solution is, to turn potential student ideas into valuable proposals, by connecting with experienced engineers to collaborate, and sourcing funding through Catalyst. Although the scope and space of the solution are limited to the University of Grenoble Ecole de Management (France) - where the author is a student. However, I still appreciate the immediacy, and practicality that the solution is about. It should also be added that the solution is only implemented on a small scale at a university, but Grenoble Ecole de Management, which has about 7,000 international students from more than 130 countries, is one of the most influential business schools in France. The school is also always ranked high in the top universities in the world (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble_School_of_Management#Worldwide_rankings). So what we expect is that if approved and successfully implemented, the spillover effect of this solution will extend beyond the campus of a university. Catalyst projects born of a combination of international students and engineers working with will help replicate this model even beyond the borders of France. Regarding the risks to consider, the author believes that there are not too many challenges that prevent the project from succeeding. However, here, I think, the author needs to pay attention to some risks that may be encountered during the implementation of the proposal. First, the risk is that students aren't interested in Cardano and Catalyst, so they aren't enthusiastic about the coaching classes. Second, the disconnection between students and engineers. The reason, engineers themselves are busy people who don't have much time. On the student side, they may not be motivated enough to pursue ideas. Overall, I appreciate the impact of the solution. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed implementation roadmap given by the authors is complete, clear, and specific. The timeframe for the implementation of the proposal is 8 weeks. The work items are listed in detail according to the progress of each week. The time and effort required to do the work as described by the team were reasonable. However, regarding the project budget, there are some items that I need the author to clarify further. For example, what is the $200 student promotion specifically spent on? If this money is intended to reward minigames or any other incentive activity to create excitement for students to participate, the author needs to explain in more detail. The category \u201chelp students write proposals (if needed)\u201d is estimated at $1,400 accounting for 39% of the total budget, which in my opinion is not very reasonable. Personally, I think that, if students or engineers themselves are too busy, even do not have time to write about their own ideas, it is very difficult for the community to have quality proposals. I believe that the proposal submitted to Catalyst should be the product of the person who came up with the idea to write the content himself. They themselves need to spend enough time on their own product, considering each content in the proposal, instead of having someone else write it for them. This money can therefore be used to award students with excellent and enthusiastic ideas discovered by the author.

Neither you nor the two proposals mentioned your role in those two projects. I am skeptical of your competence and understanding of Cardano. The detailed budget breakdown is a bit problematic. Is 40 USD for 1 hour of work and a PowerPoint presentation too high for a sophomore? The challenge also suggests that, instead of a vague roadmap, they set a budget cap of $5,000. Here are some tips for you. According to the proposed progression, there was only 1 presentation for the BIB class and the introduction of Cardano and Catalyst to the students (2-3 hours). Most of them are people who do not know Cardano. With a 3-hour presentation and question-and-answer session, how do they start the ideation process? You should make full use of the challenging $5000 budget. First, increase the number of presentations. Second, increase the number of hours of presentations on Cardano and Catalyst. From there, I think the cost is enough.                                                                                                                                                                                  On the risk side, the students won't be interested in Cardano, so they won't be motivated to work with Cardano. In the detailed budget analysis, it is mentioned: that a student promotion of 200 USD, but the plan is not specific. After the presentations, there should be games that synthesize the knowledge about Cardano learned during the session. Then, award the first, second, etc. This is a way to motivate students to learn about Cardano in the next session.
