The only words modified are the replacements for the word \u201cEcuador\u201d with \u201cParaguay\u201d and that\u2019s it, the proposers haven\u2019t even considered replacing the capital city of Ecuador, Quito, with the capital of Paraguay, Asunci\u00f3n. While this on its own does not necessarily constitute a problem, only perhaps makes me question the team\u2019s involvement in their projects; the fact that it is clearly required and specified in the proposal submission that the team should describe what other proposals they are working on or have submitted in the current fund, raises a red flag, especially for a proposer who has submitted several proposals, with almost identical content and has answered \u201cNo\u201d at the question if they are working on any other proposal in Fund 9. As such, my reviews will also be for the most part identical, as the proposals themselves also are.\nWhen I started reading the proposal, I actually got excited by the description of its solution, namely \u201cOur teams goal is to continue educating rural students on blockchain technology\u201d in Paraguay. The proposal goes on to describe how it will organise workshops with rural students, onboard them into the project\u2019s discord and help them eventually submit proposals to Project Catalyst. Until I read that the events will be taking place in Quito (here the team probably forgot to replace the capital city of Ecuador with the capital city of Paraguay), which is also the most populated city in the country. So, obviously, my enthusiasm lowered and I started to ask myself why the proposers chose to present the proposal like this, and where the mistake might lie? Do they have additional information showing that the majority of students in Quito (or perhaps Asunci\u00f3n?) come from rural areas and didn\u2019t think to present this important piece of information, or is the project actually not aimed at rural students any longer? \nBecause the proposals are almost identical to one another, and the proposer have chosen not to reveal that they have submitted other proposals in this fund, I feel like they are not completely honest or very involved in their projects, and especially for a proposal that aims at having workshops with students to attract them to Cardano, genuine involvement and enthusiasm are crucial for it to be successful.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For the most part, I find the plan described somewhat sufficient, however, I kept having a question in the back of my mind that kept bugging me, namely: the proposers mention that the workshops will be about \u201cthe advancements in cardano\u201d, yet that is such a general statement, that I cannot consider it to be sufficient. I really would have liked to know more than just that. Will the workshops be more technical in nature, geared towards more technical students or will they be geared towards a more general population of non-technical students that would be taught general facts?\nRegarding the budget, I find it to be sufficiently detailed and the amounts requested for each segment are very reasonable and cover all marketing aspects, venue rentals and needed materials for the workshops.\nThe team has very short sentences describing their title and previous achievements in Project Catalyst as funded proposers. Perhaps some more details regarding their skills and knowledge would have provided not just me, but the entire community with some much needed information, that we could base our decisions on. I appreciate the fact that the educators have already been found and named in the proposal, although a short description of their knowledge would have further helped in the assessment, as I cannot judge if they are the right people for the task, if I don\u2019t know their knowledge in regards to the Cardano blockchain.\nGiven the missing details described above, I find I cannot agree on whether this proposal can be successfully implemented, but I also cannot disagree, therefore, my score will be a neutral 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned in the impact section, the review for this proposal is almost identical with two other ones, as the proposers have 3 almost identical proposals themselves.\nAt a first glance, I found the auditability section to be adequately written in regards to this proposal, however, as I analysed the information provided, I found myself with some unanswered questions. The KPIs the team will be measuring to evaluate the progress are easy to follow, some of them will be on-chain, like staking ADA, minting NFTs, and creating ADA wallets, while others can be verified on IdeaScale, like the number of proposals submitted, comments left on other proposals etc. However, for these to be easily tracked back to this project, there needs to be a database with all these metrics and details, that could easily prove their provenance. A place, that the community can easily access and evaluate the advancement taking place, otherwise, we can only rely on the information provided from a centralised source, namely, the proposers.\nFurther on, when reading the answer to the success question I also found it to be partially incomplete, as there is no clear number given in regards to how many new community members will be onboarded, and the proposal describes it as \u201ca substantial number\u201d, which can be any number whatsoever. \nDue to the elements I have pointed out, I find myself in the same position as not being able to either agree or disagree with the ability to evaluate the project\u2019s progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 8, "ng": 9, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12424, "q0": "[Disclaimer: The DefiDiscussion team have submitted 2 proposals that are related to conducting workshops for university students (1 in Paraguay and 1 in Ecuador). These proposals are very similar in their structure and vision. As a result, the assessments for this set of proposals will also be similar]\n\nThe proposal addresses the problem about the lack of awareness and knowledge of Cardano, specifically targeted at students in Paraguay. The proposed solution is to provide knowledge and information about Cardano via workshops for university students. The topics that will be brought up in this includes Cardano advancements, wallet creation, project catalyst, onboarding students to join a Discord server, etc. The topics chosen are relevant for educating students of the Cardano ecosystem however I think some introductory topics to blockchain and Cardano in general can prove beneficial for students that are still unaware or don\u2019t understand the blockchain technology and its role. I think the idea of doing a workshop can add value to Cardano since it can bring more awareness to Cardano and this can act as a catalyst to draw new talents to join the community that have the potential to further development and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members have past experience implementing projects similar to this in past Fund 7 (e.g. networking events in Ethiopia) showing they have the relevant experience and skills needed to implement this project.\n\nThe roadmap is pretty simple and well laid out since the workshop will only be done once (at least for this round of funding) and the first month after funding will be used to set up the workshop.

They intend to increase the exposure of students in the LATAM region to the cardano ecosystem, and reversibly shine light on their ideas to get resource, funding, and execution. This is in line with the challenge setting, and considering the lack of cardano presence in their local community, it makes sense that the team wants to tap into the potential talent pool there. i can see the audience growing with cardano over the longer term, and will definitely add value to cardano in their unique way.\n\nthe proposal to engage the audience in their local language means that the project impact will likely only be concentraed within the region where majority of the speakers will be at, LATAM. while this is not a project intending to be scalable on a global level, i still think that it is a project worth pursuing for the benefit of the local community. the project also does not lay out a plan for it's future sustainability, except that it will come back in future catalyst rounds for funding, but i think that its still a pass. given the nature of how cardano can add value to all members of the community there that chooses to participate, and the proposer stating that they intend to create self sustaining community hubs, i think the word of mouth that spreads within the community itself will be sufficient to keep the project going in the medium to longer term.\n\nfor a small scale project, i believe that the proposers are already proposing what can be done in their capacity to mitigate risks as best they can. without a huge marketing budget, they were still able to mitigate lack of participants by leveraging on their networks, which is commendable.

Therefore, the ROI is $5000 to reach 100-150 students depending on signups.  assuming they gather 100 students, it is averagely $50 for teaching students about cardano, which does seem pretty high, in my opinion. i'm hoping that the team can get a venue that accomodates 150 students instead, making the cost of teaching a student go down to $33.33. the budget breakdown indicates that more than half will be spent on Venue Rental & Required Materials, which is reasonable. however, i did hope to see more money allocated to advertising materials to get a higher number of signups and turnup rate. it could have either been tapped from the incentives, or cardanon swag to make up for it. \n\nin terms of execution capabilities, i do think the profile of the working group is sufficient to make the project happen. they were winners from previous funding rounds of catalyst and also have external educators, which is good to see.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "the project measures proposed is reasonable and quantifiable.

By the roadmap, the community would be able to determine what activity would take place at what point in time.

In my view, the budegt allocations ougth to align with the roadmap. Per the ultimate goal and the expected deliverables, a clear and detailed roadmap would be required to guide and complement the effort of the team in the execution phase of the the project. Therefore, i think the project needs to be refined to make it more understandable and reflect the timelines for each activity. Apart from that, I think the project has a clear budgetary allocation that falls within the set cap specified for this challenge.

It is clearly communicated what problem the proposers want to address, and what they want to do about it. Worth mentioning is that the proposer has two other proposals circulating Fund 9, one of them being in the same challenge as this. (Link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421959 )\nSo there might be some similarities in my assessment of these, since the two proposals of this challenge is identical on the impact section, but more on that later.\n\nThe idea of exposing students and their ideas to blockchain technology through education and networking is in alignment with the challenge. The proposer also shares the intention of incorporating these students as part of the team which will create a natural exposure to working with developers and engineers, but without throwing them right out on the open market immediately. Having these students be part of the Cardano ecosystem from the start as proposers (and provide them with resources), PAs, developers or voters has a chance to bring lots of value in the form of active future participants.  \n\nI would have loved to see a deeper explanation on how the proposers plans to encourage students to create their own proposals, since there is a heavy emphasis on how students can be incorporated rather than educated in this challenge. \nApart from creating a discord server, and the networking that will occur during the workshop, how will the students be involved? Almost all of the budget is allocated to hosting the mega-workshop with 100-150 attended students, but is that workshop dedicated to education, networking or creating a hackathon-like event?

This will affect my rationale being mirrored in an equal way across these two proposals. I would suggest that the proposer includes this information in their upcoming proposals. Both for increased transparency but also for the ability for PAs to assess the proposal fairly. (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421959)\n\nThe team consists of 4 core members (and two additional educators from another team) with varied background, their experience being listed on their official website. Here, I would suggest providing more links to validate the expertise of the team members (such as LinkedIn, social media, Github etc). Most team members does seem to have experience of being proposers from earlier Funds, which speaks well for long term commitment to the ecosystem. After doing some detective work I could only find one proposal that had been approved from Fund 8 (Link: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400210 ), but couldn\u2019t find information on how far that has progressed. Including this type of information would in my experience as a recurring PA further increase how confidently I can trust the proposers to see the project from start to finish, but also validate the commitment that they have to the ecosystem. \n\nWe are provided with a budget breakdown, and it looks realistic in regards to what is presented. Including some Cardano swag-products is not a bad idea, since it is basically walking billboards. In my understanding, the whole budget of 5000 will be allocated to focusing on the actual workshop (planned for happening one month after being funded), does that mean nothing of the budget allocation will go to compensate for the teams working hours? Speaking from my experience as a teacher, an educational workshop for 100-150 people would potentially need something more than merchandise, catering and paying for travel and lodging for the guest teachers. For example, I would love to see an example of the curriculum that the workshop will follow. \nWill the educational content be created by the team, someone else or free resources found on the internet? If the focus lie on on-boarding students and encouraging them through educating them, shouldn\u2019t there be more money being geared towards those segments? \n\nI\u2019m glad to see that the proposers have listed two potential risks, and provided sufficient solutions to these. Incentives are always a good way to get people to show up, and discord is a widely used platform by people of all ages. The fact that the team already holds workshops in Paraguay and Ecuador and aims to improve their educational content continuously will benefit them in the long run. \u2028Speaking of risks, I am slightly worried about the workload that the core team might have excluded from the proposal if all of them end up being funded. \u2028Firstly, the mirrored proposal has an identical plan as this one: hosting a workshop with 100-150 participants after one month of being funded, educating them and potentially incorporating them into the team. Who will do the community management, and which of the team members will be responsible for which parts? Furthermore, do they plan on doing this in parallel with working on the previously funded documentary, and potentially a proposal featured in another challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422439 ) at the same time? I would have loved to see some clarifications on how the team aims to tackle these potential risks.  \n\nBased on the points explained above, I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Considering this proposal is an exact mirror of another proposal in the same challenge (but with different geographical focus, mentioned and linked under \u2019impact\u2019) my rationale will be reflected in the same way.

In its current form, we are provided with the target of onboarding new members to the ecosystem, and including a target number of how many new members would be amazing. Furthermore, if there had been a clear roadmap with a more detailed timeframe (for example, after this many months after being funded and completing this event, we aim to have onboarded 50 new members as proposers or PAs, or as team members). Furthermore, where will the community be able to follow the development progress? It could be a dedicated social media channel that is open to the public, providing updates from events where the team can answer questions. We have a lot of information on what the proposer aims to do, but would have liked to see more details on how the proposer aims to do it. \n\nWe are provided with some KPIs in the form of discord group-activity, submitted proposals (by on-boarded students?), catalyst activity, etc. But as mentioned before, these KPIs would be of much more value if it was paired with target numbers, timeframes and details of open communication channels. (Ideascale is wonderful in many ways, but is it the best place to communicate with every participant?)\n\nHistorically (speaking from my experience as a recurring PA), transparency is key. It builds confidence for the team and good communications with collaborators and potential members. \n\u2028Overall, I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3511, "q0": "This is a proposal that is a continuation of an arduous educational campaign that the proposers have been carrying out in Latin America and that in past funds has gained the support of the community in the form of funding assignment.  Their work stands out for bringing the Latin American population, especially students, closer to the wealth of opportunities that the Cardano ecosystem represents, through academic methodologies.  To this day they continue to develop their educational project with success, meeting goals and showing the results promised in their previous proposals.  I can make the above statements because, in addition to having made a career in teaching and project management, I know closely the work of the proposers. There is no doubt that education is the best way to disseminate and promote the virtues of a product or service, whatever it may be.  Our case is no stranger to this: the most effective way for people to understand the scope of our technology is through its appropriation.  Therefore, there is no doubt that the work and the present proposal are in line with Cardano's purpose.  However, it is unfortunate for me to remove three stars from their rating since the proposal they are submitting does not correspond to the specifications of the challenge they are participating in.  This challenge, called \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" has clearly stated the type of participants who are eligible to participate in it: college or university students, still studying, who have ventures that are looking for financial support and a space to expose their skills to specialized members of the community.  Quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers\" (section How does success looks like?).  \"Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment\" (section Why is it important?). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students ... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students\" (Challenge Brief section).  Therefore, it is clear that the proposal does not correspond to this Challenge, no matter if its theme is about education.  On the other hand, in my experience, this kind of specifications that apparently ban the free participation of a large number of members and their educational initiatives to give entry only to students and their projects, is not only valid but necessary at a strategic level, and that is what the community in general should understand and protect: this kind of spaces are playgrounds that in our case, allow the incubation of a whole new generation of developers, creatives, innovators, a generation that is a secret weapon when it comes to long term goals such as being around for the next 100 years (C. Hoskinson's statement).  Providing capital, guidance, a space for experimentation and failure, is standard procedure.

Also, a little more detail in the budget description would be desirable: e.g., details on the distribution of incentives, the logic behind the distribution of those incentives, etc.  However, the reason that weighs most heavily to proceed to deduct 2 stars from its final rating is that the proposal is competing in a category that does not correspond to it, therefore, its execution does not correspond to a space in which, according to the guidelines of the Challenge, it should do so.  I have no doubt that in future funds the proposers will find the appropriate category in which they can put their skills at the service of the community. Note: it would have been great to read a little more about the new workshop methodology developed by David Tacury (one of the team members), mentioned in the subsection \"Please provide information on whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.\" of the Auditability section.
