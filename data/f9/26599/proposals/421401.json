When the waves start to break loudly, the younger generations are attracted by the sound and start looking for ways to get involved.  An initial analysis of the proposal allows us to deduce that the leader of the proposal is a young student trying to give a direction to his life.  Fortunately, he plans to share the benefits of his quest with his community, with his country.  \n\nUnlike other evangelization proposals, this proposal fits the guidelines of the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" in terms of the type of proposer profile targeted (working students) and in terms of budget ($5000 max per project).  In terms of purpose, the proposal addresses one of the building blocks of the Cardano ecosystem growth: involving others.  In this case, young students with a lifetime of creation, innovation and production ahead of them.  \n\nIn my opinion, as an educator with experience in formal education (school, university, company) I find the proposal in line with the growth objectives of our ecosystem and in line with the guidelines specified by the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\".  In the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves.    ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In my opinion, the implementation plan and budget described in the proposal fits the purpose of the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\".  There is no denying that connecting the dots across all the things the proposal intends to do cannot be done cleanly, there are several corners to turn and many straight lines to bend, for example on topics such as game-based reward mechanism design, research paper development, among others.  However, the risk of clumsiness in execution is limited to $5000USD.  That is exactly the feature of the Challenge that makes it reasonable from an investment point of view: limited downside, unpredictable upside.  Many new active Cardano and Catalyst users, many new wallets opened, but above all, a lot of new and renewed creative and innovative activity not originated by the regular players.  Strategically, the benefits far outweigh the risks. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The students make a legitimate effort to offer a performance measurement system, an outstanding effort when compared to the limited efforts that many proposals offer in this area (twitter spaces, discord and twitter account growth, etc).  The system designed by them may have gaps (quality of research papers, efficiency of the reward mechanism, etc), however it is a performance measurement system from which it is possible to start to deepen the information that the community may require at some point.  Undoubtedly, it is a system that leads to expose the successes and failures of the proposers, therefore, I find the measurement system provided useful to start a deeper auditability process. It is not a system that covers in detail all the variables that define the status of the project at a point in time, which is why I discount one star from the final rating.

The Vietnamese community is highly entrepreneurial and tapping into the student base while they are most open to opportunities to learn, explore, and adopt new technologies is an excellent way to grow Catalyst and Cardano. The team is all students so I suspect that they will understand how to most effectively reach their peers probably via the latest social media channels in Vietnam. I personally don't know what they are likely beyond TikTok but other chat apps but likely the students who seem to be quite popular or have already established circles of friends that they can put this in front of. They also seem to have secured sponsorship and mentorship from a BIMI SPO that's also in Vietnam and a Vietnamese-funded proposer who can mentor them and guide them to success given they also understand the local culture. Way to go team!!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Plan, budget, and team are clearly stated or outlined. The plan is outlined, perhaps, I wish for more detail there.

One of the team members has been involved since fund 6 and even did a presentation in Idea Fest and is quite active in Catalyst as well after checking his profiles deeper in IdeaScale via the 2min review proposals. Other team members seem to act in supportive roles and they listen to their Telegram. I would prefer if the Google Drive link to the CV would work and the Telegrams were LinkedIn profiles but Telegram shall suffice for the students and the next generations. There is a bit risky because we don't have a full DOX of the proposer. They do seem to be quite active in their last seen status on Telegrams so that's a positive sign. Overall, the budget is reasonable given the $5k limit for this challenge. The students are aiming to \"motivate the community members to contribute and create impact to Vietnamese society, the world.\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I appreciate the intellectual honesty of the student team because they mentioned that \"the project is funded the potential of returning to Catalyst in a later round is high.\" Like a school class they also mention that \u201cmetrics\u201d based on the percentage of expected goal and from that creating a score range for scoring\" with quite clear action items on what needs to be done and if the class gets a passing grade or a failing grade. I am very happy to actually see this to measure the level of success of the proposal and it's delivery. The goals are also achievable and time bound. As a constructive feedback I would suggest to indicate what the content of the research paper etc would be and set a higher standard then 4 because that's the size of the team however I am assuming that teams will be in charge of creating these papers and goals not only individuals.

The solution is to support students to access blockchain/cardano knowledge through telegram channel, knowledge of smart contracts, support students to know Catalyst. The implementation solution will greatly impact the students, the opportunity to improve their knowledge of Cardano and create additional job opportunities for them. At the same time, attracting students to participate in Cardano's projects helps the Cardano ecosystem expand, adding developers to participate in writing projects, quality proposals for the Cardano platform. The proposal is scalable for the future, the number of students participating in VSC20 will increase. We found that the proposal had its clear objectives, but the implementation of the exchange on Telegram did not seem to be enough to convey the content of the solution. The method of transmitting the content of knowledge to students is not really clear. If we hold online talks then the volume of interaction between the participants will be better. The Telegram platform can be the first step to attracting student engagement, submitting documents and videos. However, the exchange of knowledge will be limited. We have an opinion on the implementation of the expansion so the platform works and the appropriate mode of transmission is online lessons. The proposal has identified the risks affecting the implementation of the proposal and has appropriate risk mitigation methods in place. We have an opinion on the possible risks to the proposal, the transmission of knowledge on Telegram has many limitations, the fact that students can participate but there is no re-interaction with the content given, and the reduction of interaction between participants will directly affect the success of the proposal.

We want to see specific timelines for implementing the content of the plan. Does the timeline help us realize if the plan is suitable for implementation? Conducting online meetings is essential but there are no timelines or periodic implementation plans, for example: The author can come up with the implementation of an online meeting once a week with a time of 2 hours. The design of the test is the creativity in testing the ability of members to acquire knowledge. The proposal has identified the members who made the proposal, the authors have experience as PA (evaluating the proposals on Cardano), whose research on the Cardano ecosystem is suitable for sharing information about Cardano. We are seeing a budget table given as detailed, the amount is broken down by the implementations, the wages paid for the work are worth it. However, it is easy to see that the budget is not in line with the plan. Weekly online meetings are spent $75 a week, but the plan doesn't come out, and the debate review is spent $140, but the proposal's plan doesn't raise the issue. It makes sense to offer an additional $500 in risk room in the case of an ADA.

Monitoring the indicators/KPIs of the proposal is unfounded. Kpis are general indicators based on the percentage of an unknown number, which is completely unsuitable for auditing.

The content of this idea meets the criteria set forth by the Scouting challenge.\n\n  The solution you mentioned about VSC2O by creating rewards, to encourage students to participate in research and expand knowledge, and such an approach creates enthusiasm in students and promotes efforts in the younger generations (Vietnamese students).
