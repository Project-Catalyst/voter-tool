This is normally done by hosting weekly Zoom sessions. The proposal specifically target people living in the Chaco region, as well as a region in Buenos Aires region, both challenged by poverty. The problem statement is presented clearly by the proposer: Involve low-income students across Latin America and introduce them to spaces where technological innovation is present (Cardano). \nThe mention of Cardano is only present in the title and (briefly) in the problem statement of the proposal. In order to avoid the proposal being interpreted as something along the lines of: \u201dI want funding for my project, unrelated to Cardano\u201d I would suggest to include more detailed explanations on how the project will incorporate Cardano, Catalyst and blockchain technology. What the proposer wants to achieve is clearly stated, as is the background. Where I would like to have more clarity is the how the proposer aims to achieve it. \n\nThe challenge is mostly about giving student entrepreneurs the opportunity to: 1, get a chance to have their projects and ideas realized through Catalyst, an introduction to entrepreneurship without the use of VCs and 2, enable opportunities to collaborate with engineers (student or experienced). This proposal has a good possibility for enabling students to this, but the plan for it would need to be explained in more detail. How will the proposer introduce Cardano in these sessions, and get them enthusiastic about the possibilities of being incorporated into the Catalyst ecosystem? What benefits are possible for the target group, proposers and Catalyst? If it will take some time to achieve, try to present the long term plan and describe each step on the way to your goal. \u2028\u2028Due to the reasons explained above, I disagree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team consists of one person, with relevant experience of supporting people living in low-income areas (ambassador for OneProsper International). We are provided official links to the current projects but no links to validate the expertise or identity of the proposer. (Or maybe I\u2019m just bad at finding that information). I would suggest to provide some links where the voter can confirm the experience (maybe some documentation or an official link to the OneProsper Int-project) of the proposer. \n\nThe proposal contains a budget breakdown divided in five different segments of development. If I understand the proposal correctly there will be only one team member working on the project (apart from hiring a full stack developer for one month). Does this mean that the listed proposer will be doing everything else (from website graphic design, to teaching, tech setup, etc)? In my experience as a teacher, I know well how the working hours can increase beyond the estimated number, so it would be wise to include an estimation of working hours for each section of the proposal. And if the proposer means to handle web design himself, it would be beneficial if the proposer listed all of the relevant experience needed. In short, the voters need to see what is being done, when, and by whom.\u2028The roadmap contains milestones and is placed on a timeframe of two months, which makes me worry a little bit about the workload that might be present for a team of one person (and one hired), I would loved to either see some explanation on how the team plans to address this potential risk, especially if they are involved in other types of commitments (work, studying, etc). \n\nConclusively, the more information provided about the development process and experience of the people working on it, the more trust in the completion of the project will be built. Due to the lack of detail contained within this proposal (as explained above), I disagree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The key question to answer here is: How will the community be able to follow the progress of the project?

Will there be a social media channel where we get updates from the team? If I have a question about the project, where will I be able to contact the team? \u2028\u2028It is nice to see a roadmap presented with milestones on an estimated timeframe, it will help the people in understanding where the project intends to be at a certain period of time. The KPIs included in order to estimate the measurement of success are relevant to the proposal. Registrations on the website, page views, target group numbers reached and tutoring hours all fit, but it would be highly beneficial to include an estimated number for each of these parameters. At the moment, we don\u2019t know if 1 page view per day is the target number, or 1000. We know the parameters (which is great) but we also need to be provided with details on those parameters. It is similar to what was mentioned in my rationale when speaking about the budget breakdown. If the voter/PA/community would know who would be working on website design (for example) and for how long; it would increase the transparency of the project and thus also increase the potential trust gained in the proposing team. \u2028I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact/alignment:\nThis PA is missing the objective of this challenge.

Third, to be funded and grow as part of the Cardano Community, the project connects students from different parts of the world and without any knowledge of Cardano with the Community, what could in the future raise the number of students connected to and seeking Cardano as an opportunity to expose their ideas and get funded, which is the challenge\u2019s main goal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget breakdown and timeline are simple and direct, but it seems reasonable taking into account that it is intended as an initial setup for a bigger program that, as written in the proposal, will need further funding and structuring to broaden the scope to more schools and provide further technological supply to students.

At last, it raises a interesting obstacle, which is the possibility of the student demand outreach the number of volunteers, but taking into account the noble goal of the project and the enriching experience it provides for both volunteers and students, and the recruitment being conduct in an university campus, it seems to me that the recruitment target audience is very much in line with the expected volunteer profile, thus decreasing the risk of a lack of volunteers", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The main metrics tracked seem in line with the proposal\u2019s goals, which are, more than academic advancement, to establish a community connecting students from vastly different environments and cultures.
