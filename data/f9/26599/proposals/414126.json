The proposal exposed organizing workshops for university students, civil society, the private sector, and municipal bodies in Vienna that teach blockchain fundamentals and support the co-creation of sustainable use cases. This project will unite its three main benefactors (the Cardano ecosystem, Project Catalyst, and the Viennese population), and illustrate the ways people can utilize the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst to overcome sustainability challenges.\nIn the section, the proposer decribe the solution is extremely clear, detailed with four objectives, each objective is a part of the organized workshop and is presented very sufficent and specific by step and step. First, objective of Education & Awareness Raising: providing details on the fundamentals of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem; explaining technologies blockchain supports (Smart contracts, DAOs, NFTs); examples for a range of use cases (DeFi, Supply Chain Sustainability, Governance, Secure Data & Identity Ownership, Energy, Internet of Things applications, AI, etc). Second, objective of Collaboration for Integration & Adoption: providing an open, empowering, interdisciplinary environment for participants; setting up small groups to formulate ideas and co-create use case abilities; sharing and discussing inter-group to allow for feedback and improvement of original ideas. Third, objective of Publishing Material for Outreach: writing a paper published which links workshop ideas to relevant academic literature and provides a more in-depth concept of how they could be operated to promote sustainability efforts; writing a series of 3-4 blog posts for LinkedIn which outline the workshop, its creation, success, and output. Finally, objective of Community Building: The formation of a Cardano Hub Discord Server; introducing participants to Project Catalyst, and the Cardano Ecosystem generally; and supporting the growth of a blockchain network in Vienna that links people from different areas of sustainable development. Thereby, we can see this solution entirely aligns with challenge\u2019s Key metrics and brings the possitive effects to Cardano ecosystem.\nThrough the proposal, the author also shows the main risks when the project is implemented and how to solve these risks. The first risk is ensuring a sound number of participants attend the workshop, and it is solved through active in-person and digital marketing efforts, including: utilizing my university contacts, the formation of the Vienna Blockchain Discord server, flyers and stickers of the city and university campuses, and Facebook Ads. The other risk is balancing the content of the seminar in a way that ensures comprehension without confusion and to solve this, in addition to intensive workshop preparation, a \u2018mock\u2019 workshop will take place with a close group of friends and colleagues, in order to ensure the presentation flows smoothly, and be easily understanded by members of the general public that have little to no prior blockchain knowledge.\n\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The proposal has a workflow Process with a clear timeline but not detailed, the author only gives what he will do, but nothing is explained how he will implement.

However, the proposer should a standby budget for other incurred expenses; though there is only one person in the project, when the workshop happen, the payment for supporters or an organization is also necessary, because he can\u2019t do it all alone. \nAs mentioned above, there is only the author in the project and shown the whole process of studying and working, his skills and experiences, links for reference.

The results of the project base on the criteria: workshop participants will understand strongerly the fundamentals of the blockchain, the Cardano ecosystem, and the various technologies it supports, and most importantly, how they can be used to address sustainability challenges; workshop participants will also produce innovate and novel ideas of how blockchain can be used to address major local and global challenges; and The Vienna Blockchain Community Discord Server, and subsequent Cardano Community Hub will be an active place with the made new connections, the formed collaborations, and the flourished inspiring ideas.\n\"", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4097", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1596, "q0": "I found this idea very well presented, having several positive points and some to be revised. The proposal itself aligns well with the objectives of the challenge, as it intends to promote a series of workshops aimed at university students from the city of Vienna. It is very positive as the author already has a very specific student audience, which are the students of a particular university. I would like to understand better how he intends to draw the attention of these students to the subject. The author claims that he will do this through university contacts, but which ones, and how? The second workshop session would be aimed at a more general audience, people from civil society would be educated (he cites here some target audiences, such as entrepreneurs, but there is also a gap on how they would be coerced into participating in the event). It would also aim to reach municipal bodies (which ones?). Unfortunately, I found this information a little abstract, I think this challenge is totally focused on the student sector and its main goal is to overcome the difficulties of this social portion, that is, the lack of teaching and also of funding so that they can develop their projects . Therefore, I think it would be more interesting if a solid foundation was provided for them here, and not that the target audience for the proposal was broader (in the specific case of this challenge). I understand that the author is aware that the property would be the students, and there is no problem in guiding other social sectors, but I think that the student portion should be the focus and it should be explained a little more in depth how these would be called to participate. of the workshop. It is positive that the subjects and the ways in which the content would be planned are very detailed, that is, the proponent clarifies how the subject would start to be approached - from the most initial concepts, to more specific cases such as, for example, how such technology could be used in practice (use cases). I think it would be interesting, however, if he explained better what the different approaches would be like for the portion of the diverse audience he intends to reach. For example, in the case of municipal bodies, how would they take advantage of the knowledge passed on, for example? The author also cites that Vienna aims to be the blockchain capital, attaching a link about. However, the attached website is not in English and is not so easy to navigate, making it somewhat inaccessible to the general public. I would like to understand what are the ideas that would make Vienna considered the blockchain capital and how this would be implemented, as well as how this project would directly contribute to this. In my view, the proposal is directed towards what we are looking for (funding the student sector and promoting the adoption of blockchain and projects involving this technology), but at the same time it also goes on to other initiatives and adds several aspects, which unfortunately generates , a bit of confusion as to how these workshops would, given the requested budget, achieve the main mission here. In addition, to contribute to the city becoming one of the most capable in the blockchain sector. Finally, speaking of positive points, this is the first time I see a proponent having the idea of \u200b\u200bdoing a test round, so we can say, before the official launch of the workshop, in order to make sure that the knowledge would be passed on in a accessible. Therefore, it is a proposal of high quality and good impact, just needing a little more focus and detailing of the commented aspects.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately this topic is not as suitable as the previous one. Starting the analysis with the roadmap provided, we know what will happen and when, but there is not much detail on each of the activities. The temporal division is also very extensive, in some cases, so that we cannot solidly understand what would happen in each mentioned week. Let me give an example to make it clearer: \u201cWeek 17-24: Write articles and blog posts that incorporate workshop development ideas\u201d. It would be 7 weeks to run the development of articles and posts with ideas for the workshops, but what would happen in week 1 and 2? Who would work on it, and for how many hours a week? Where would this blog be hosted, and how often would these posts be made? Another example, \u201cWeek 0-6: Workshop Development and Marketing\u201d. What small activities would make up this development, how would the marketing take place? It is known that some advertising strategies would be \u201cFacebook Stickers, Posters and Ads\u201d. But where would these stickers and posters be placed, and how often would this content be posted on facebook? And why does it take about 6 weeks to publicize each of the workshops? I believe that the activities could be more detailed and that the temporal notion could be more accurate. Regarding expenses, this part is very detailed, some expenses such as the money dedicated to the development of the workshop seem very fair to me, but others I was not so sure, such as the manufacture of mugs that would cost 100 dollars each. It seems like a rather expensive material, and who would these mugs go to? The proponent sets aside $500 to rent the space and materials needed for each event, but where would the physical space for the workshops be? What materials are these needed? And finally, speaking of the team, I'm a little worried that it's a project developed by only one person, the author of the proposal. He appears to be extremely capable, but it's unclear how close he is to Cardano, specifically. Also, I believe that in an event it is important that diverse professionals work, such as someone from design to assemble facebook publications, make the mentioned arts (mugs, posters and stickers, for example). It would be important for someone to be responsible for the actual production of the events, that is, organizing the space, ensuring that it is in the right conditions, that the participants are well accommodated and with water, for example, that is, organizing the most practical aspects of the event. activity, in addition to the transmission of technical knowledge. Therefore, just from the proponent giving us an idea about each of the aspects analyzed here (script, budget and team), I believe that they all need improvement to become adequate.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe the auditability here is ok. We know what to audit, but not how it would be audited. We also know the author's main objectives with the workshops, but not how this would be perceived, how these impacts could be proven. For example, in relation to what would be considered a success, the author presents several metrics, such as the number of participants in the 2 events, number of ideas in development, views of the articles created by linkedin blogs, and so on. In other words, we know very well what could be analyzed to consider that the project achieved what was expected, but the question remains: who would carry out this study? In my view, it would be appropriate for the author himself or a member of the project to make an analysis of such quantitative metrics and summarize them in monthly reports, for example, which should come to the attention of members of the Cardano ecosystem, either through discussion rooms post Town Hall or by the Hub that he cites having plans to create. We know what the most profound effects, shall we say, are expected after the workshop: that people who participated in the events understand the possibilities and importance of blockchain technology, especially Cardano. But how can we perceive this understanding? What is a demonstrable way to measure that this change was real, that students started to develop projects involving Cardano, whether in the area of \u200b\u200bprogramming, law, accounting, etc? In other words, in short, there is a lack of clearer ways to prove that all effects were achieved as desired. Another important question would be the monitoring of the process, that is: in addition to the final results, how can we monitor the development of the phases? How do you know if each activity planned for each week was done in the right way, delivering the desired partial results? Therefore, as much as the author is concerned with providing us with several KPIs (quantitative and some qualitative), this part of the project could be more measurable and undoubtedly the development process could be better targeted as well, not just the final products.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 17, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11791, "q0": "After reading the overall proposal of Outreach, Education & Collaboration in the Challenge & Scouted for Students challenge, I found this to be a good idea and well met the problems of the proposed challenge. Author James A. Vandenberg is a person who has worked in the field of education and blockchain research for many years, so when I read his proposal, I saw the planning and logical detail in this proposal. The target problem of the proposal has also been selected by the author for a very clear and specific target group, using James's own strengths as knowledge, experience, community relationships, and reputation in this field to come up with ideas and plans for the project.\nWith my personal opinion, after learning about the information on social networks such as the behavior, habits, and knowledge of people in Vienna who know about blockchain and apply it to life. I completely agree with the project author when choosing a method to organize seminars to teach students and people living in Vienna the basics of blockchain and promote the community here to apply blockchain to life. Teaching knowledge so that students, human resources, young workers and people have a broader view of blockchain will fill the current knowledge gap when they only know blockchain as a cryptocurrency and bitcoin. This knowledge gap is hindering the development of the ecosystem, of blockchain in general and cardano in particular, slowing down the progress towards the local goal of making Vienna a \"Blockchain Capital\" in the future distant.\nI find the uniqueness and outstandingness of this proposal different from other projects with the same challenge when the author is ambitious through his project to blow a new wind, inspire students, inspire Gain the knowledge that the Cardano ecosystem can bring to improve quality of life, new social, economic and ecosystem development solutions. Furthermore, through these educational projects, with the establishment of the Cardano center in Vienna, the author hopes to help participants raise awareness, nurture ideas, and generate Project Catalyst proposals Future. I see this as a concern to promote of the Cardano community in this country.\nI see this project as a new project, never filed in previous funds, with what the author has stated, I hope it will be funded at this fund 9.\nFor the above reasons, to grade the project, I will give 4 points and fully believe that James's project will be successful if implemented. This is a highly practical project, which can not only be implemented in Vienna but also can be applied in other countries. I myself live and work in Vietnam, although I have been involved in the crypto market for 2 years, my knowledge of this market and my knowledge of Cardano is still very broad for me. Cardano is a very potential ecosystem that has been growing and has many real-life applications I wish my friends and the people of Vietnam know more about Cardano. So, I see this proposal as perfectly workable in my country as well.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I see that the target audience has been divided by the author to attend 2 seminars in 2 different age, occupation and knowledge strata. This subdividing and zoning of objects helps the workshop to achieve many desirable results compared to the usual way. The project author also made it very clear why the conference participants were divided like that and the Cardano ecosystem, the Catalyst project and the people of Vienna will benefit the most from this project.\nThe content of the seminar is also proposed by the author in a very detailed, clear and systematic way, which helps the workshop participants to know what knowledge they will gain when participating in the program, It also helps PAs like me have a more detailed view of the author's project.\nI see that the project's specific timelines have also been given specific, detailed, clear week by week and clearly state the content to be achieved. Following this roadmap, we will have a map of specific timelines to reflect on the completion of the author's project, which is absolutely necessary.\nThe project's budget has also been broken down by the author for each item. I find it perfectly reasonable to split and allocate this amount. The project's budget at 4.87% of the challenge's total budget is a perfectly appropriate number, which is well within the budget limits for the proposal. From my personal point of view, I think the author should add small minigames revolving around the knowledge imparted to each part of the seminar to increase the excitement for the listeners and stimulate them to absorb good knowledge than. This amount will not be much, the author can apply for additional funding from the budget or balance a small part from the items applying for funding.\nIn order for the project to take place successfully, the author also foresees 2 risks that will be encountered: ensuring a sufficient number of participants in the workshop and balancing the content of the seminar to ensure easy understanding and no confusion mixed. How to overcome the risk is also given many options by the author to solve the problem.\nI find the project's proposer to be someone who has the ability to carry out this project, from James's education, qualifications and experience to how to present the project in a clear and transparent manner. The author has provided LinkedIn links, other links and is publicly identifiable for verification, so I will give 5 points because of the feasibility of the proposal.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I see it, the community can completely monitor the implementation progress and success of the Outreach, Education & Collaboration project. With the detailed implementation schedule to each week, the monitoring can be done continuously and closely. The budget source of the proposal is also reasonably built by the author for each item to help the community track and audit the project easily.\nThe 9 KPIs given to measure are quite comprehensive and complete. In which, there are some important indicators such as: the number of people attending both events, the number of ideas, the positive response rate of the conference participants, views, comments and shares on the LinkedIn blog\u2026.etc. The level of success of the project will be shown in detail by data when measuring on these indicators, so these indicators mentioned by the author are completely reasonable and very necessary.\nIn my personal opinion, this is a completely new and necessary project right now in Vienna. After the project is successful, the results it brings are not small, it will help the conference participants to better understand the blockchain and Cardano ecosystem, solve the big challenges locally and opens a new operating environment where the ideas of Cardano and Blockchain will be concentrated in Vienna in the future. Therefore, I give the transparency of this proposal a score of 4.\nFrom my own knowledge and practical experience, I would like to contribute a little bit of my personal opinion to James' proposal that it is necessary to build at least one other community communication channel besides the proposal. This is very complete and highly realistic. With this second media channel, James can refer to and add to the project the filming, editing the content of the conference and the activities surrounding this project to upload to community channels such as youtube. ... so that the community can easily, have an additional perspective and measure to track the progress of the project.\nIn the long term, the author can build lecture channels to convey knowledge and information about Cardano, about the blockchain market on a regular basis, organize online seminars to attract interested people come to this field to join, help the community of blockchain lovers in Vienna to grow.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1039, "q0": "The proposer is a student at the University of Vienna and is in a good position to analyse what level of knowledge the students and teachers have regarding blockchain and more specific, Cardano, and how to further that knowledge in order to bring innovation in the entire space. I find the arguments made in this proposal to be concise and compelling, especially since Vienna, according to an article linked by the proposer, is one of the few cities in Europe having an open and positive attitude towards blockchain technology and as such, going for a hub, especially a student hub in the city, will lead to an even more positive attitude and willingness to incorporate blockchain within the daily activities. The proposer has devised his workshop plan well, and I especially like his openness and honesty, he intends to start with a small group of friends to refine his first workshop, which will be for students only, and then after having that experience he can again refine it for the broader public.

Overall, the budget is sensible and I find I agree with all amount of hours and dollars requested for each section.\nConsidering his profile description, after reading through all the details provided and checking his Linkedin profile, I believe he is very well suited to be in charge of this project.

Maybe the proposer could create a channel in the discord server - that will be open to anyone in the Cardano Community (but how do we know the link to it?) - the number of attendees to the workshops, the feedback he has received etc. so as to have a potential source of information for future, similar endeavours.

Then all the important information will be produced into a document and finally build a community that promotes everyone to participate in Project Catalyst and the Cardano Ecosystem in particular as well as the development of the blockchain network in the country. Vienna in general.\nThe risks and challenges that may be encountered during the implementation of the project mentioned by the author are ensuring a sufficient number of participants in the workshop and balancing the content of the workshop to ensure ease of use. understand without confusion.

We know how long the project will be and the sequence of activities that will happen in weeks. This is very positive, as it gives us a clear view of the process. Next is the project budget, which is also very well explained, $4870 is required and we know a lot of information on how to divide that amount. Here are 6 activities that require a cost, and all of them are listed and presented with a very reasonable amount. For example, the cost to develop a workshop needs 6 hours / 1 week * 5 weeks = 30 hours. 1 hour = 30$ so total 900$. Thus, the investment needs are very clear, we know exactly what the money will be used for, thus, helping us to have confidence in the necessity of the above investments. And finally, about the members involved in the project, the person behind the project is James A. Vandenberg it seems that the author will do this project on his own. However, in my opinion, this is a fairly simple project, and with your qualifications, I have confidence that you will carry out this project successfully. Besides having a brief description of him as having more than 3 years of experience in the blockchain field, he is currently a current PhD Candidate at the University of Vienna and also a lecturer in Urban Sustainability at the University of Vienna. The Vienna school for proposed Master's classes also provides a Linkedin link and another link where we can verify the information described. Thereby, strengthening my faith in the author.

The author has outlined a solution to popularize blockchain knowledge and showcase the potential of Cardano in Vienna, Austria following a roadmap that includes 4 stages, namely: education \u2013 raising awareness, collaborating for integration and adoption, publishing materials for outreach, and finally community building. Each stage is explained by the author reasonably, in detail and logically. At an early stage, blockchain seminars will be held for university students. Thereafter, it was aimed at establishing the Cardano Center in Vienna to nurture ideas and generate future Project Catalyst proposals. Although this proposal only solves the requirements of the challenge in a specific geographical area in a country, it cannot be denied that the author has a detailed proposal, full of information content. enough and convincing. I appreciate well-prepared proposals like these. The form of organizing seminars for students in the early stages, along with the construction of the Vienna Blockchain Discord server, I think makes sense for Cardano to reach local students. The author chooses the venue for the first seminar aimed at university students at the University of Vienna and Vienna University of Technology. Personally, I think that the author should have more specific explanations for the community to understand, why this choice? How will this outreach work to extend to technology students in Austria? Personally, I also did a small research on 2 universities proposed by the author. The University of Vienna is rated as one of the largest universities in Europe, as well as the oldest university in the German-speaking region, with about 90000 students (https://www.univie.ac. at). While, Vienna University of Technology currently has about 28100 students, ranked #180 by the QS World University Rankings 2022 (https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/ 2022). I also suggest that the author invite some experienced technologists in the blockchain field in Vienna to share knowledge at the conference. This will create an opportunity to connect potential students with blockchain technology engineers right within the framework of the conference. This is the basis for forming quality partnerships, encouraging students with good ideas to find mentors to participate in good blockchain projects. Regarding the risks of the solution, there are 2 risks listed by the author: One is, ensuring the number of participants in the workshop; Second, balance the content of the workshop for easy understanding. Personally, I think there are still some other risks that should be considered. Specifically: the risk that it is difficult to maintain community activities after a series of seminars, because the project team has only one person who is the author. In addition, the downside risk of the cryptocurrency market can reduce the community's attraction towards institutional proposals... Overall I appreciate the impact of the proposal and the content serious, clear, detailed preparation by the author. My rating is 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The route proposed by the author is logical and reasonable. However, the content related to the Vienna Blockchain Discord server I did not see the author put in the roadmap. Please, how will the operation and maintenance of this Discord take place? Regarding the budget, the author has broken down for each cost item. However, some items I suggest the author should add more information. For example, $500 conference brochure cost, not detailed: how much will it include for Facebook ads? How many advertising campaigns will be done? How many people is the goal to reach, and what is the effectiveness of each campaign? Similarly, the cost of stickers and posters has not been clarified, specifically how much quantity is needed * unit price. I also ask the author to clarify the proposed cost of venue rental and required materials $500 per conference event. This cost is estimated for the hall to accommodate how many seats? How many hours does it take? Personally, I found out, the price of a conference room for rent in Vienna for an area of 150 - 200 sq. ft (capacity < 50 people) costs an average of $100/hour. Similarly, the cost of articles on blogs and newspapers, also ask the author to clarify, 56 hours are spent to compile how many articles are published. Regarding the team, the author implements the project as an individual. The author himself is currently a Lecturer, a current PhD Candidate at the University of Vienna, and is also researching the potential of Blockchain. From the links provided by the author, the author's personal profile information, occupation and qualifications can be fully verified.

For example, in the feedback survey, the minimum percentage achieved by conference participants reported that their blockchain knowledge had improved. I also suggest that the author create an interactive forum after the conference (group on Facebook or chat channel on Discord), so that students and engineers with ideas have an environment to share, exchange and discuss.

It describes a scenario that is a common syndrome, a pattern, in the vast majority of the regions of the planet: the unawareness or lack of due recognition of the benefits of blockchain as an industry, in general, and of our ecosystem in particular as a constant generator of innovation regardless of the external conditions of the moment (price, legislation, disinforming news, etc).  The proposer is undeniably someone well suited to do the job: BA in Sustainable Development, MSc in Urban Studies with a Focus on Sustainability, Current PhD Candidate Researching Blockchain's Role in Sustainability Transformations, Urban Sustainability Lecturer at the University of Vienna, 3+ years researching blockchain.  However, a fair evaluation of the proposal requires a parallel with the Challenge in which it is enrolled. The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves. \n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students. \n\nAs an educator and experienced Project Catalyst member, I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid. However, it is clear that it does not correspond to the purpose that the Community decided to support through this Challenge: neither the type of student who created the proposal, nor the objectives of the proposal are in line with the parameters of the Challenge.  I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). \n\nTaking into account the above reasoning, I must remove three stars from the final rating.   \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The Implementation Plan described is not difficult to understand.
