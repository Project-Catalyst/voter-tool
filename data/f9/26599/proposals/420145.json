The Challenge underlines twice that the budget limit is very important to the point of being the exclusive condition. It exceeds it by more than double, which invalidates the entire proposal. Therefore, the proposal does not fit the Challenge. I suggest reviewing the activities of the proposal, taking them online and at most a small face-to-face part that can be resolved within the budget limit. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The experience of the team and the plan are well thought out and developed. They have \nexperience in Fund 8.

This proposal on the other hand, puts students as an afterthought, mentioning that the event is located at a University, and is \"open\" to students. This hardly seems like an effort that is explicitly by or for students. I don't doubt that some exposure to students and networking or educational opportunities for students might result from this, so I'll give it three stars. For more than that, I would need to see students closer to the heart of the project - for this campaign.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It seems that this proposal is really just asking Catalyst to sponsor food and drinks for a conference that was already funded in F8. I rather wish they had included their refreshments budget in that proposal rather than doing it later, in a campaign that is not a good fit. This makes me wonder what else may have been missing in initial planning, or undisclosed, so I have removed one star. Beyond that, I trust that they would indeed buy food and drinks with this money, as described in the budget.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal seems mixed up in many ways. It reads as if it's a stand-alone proposal for a conference, but it's not, its a bid for a refreshments budget. I would have wished to see that clearly explained in the impact statement, and reflected through to the auditability statement. Perhaps something like: We are having a conference, funded in F8, and we want more students to come! One great way to do that is to offer free food and drinks, or maybe have a special student reception with refreshments. Auditability consists of showing X# students registered for the event and showing food receipts. This would at least seem more intellectually honest, and frankly I'd support it!", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2404", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3503, "q0": "As a teacher at formal (college, university) and informal levels, it is evident the degree of specialization and the high academic level that the proposal can offer to students.  There is no doubt that this proposal is in a position to nurture the minds of young people and raise their knowledge about NFTs and Blockchain and activate in them their instinct to connect with others around topics of common interest and under the guidance of experts in the subject areas of study.  The proposal is an academic and working group formation experience in line with Cardano's purpose of providing the general public with the necessary information to interact with our ecosystem (names as important as Mateja Sela, co-founder of Artano, assure that this will be the case).  Undoubtedly, a suitable proposal from every point of view FOR students.  Unfortunately, the problem with this proposal is that it is not one BY students, and therein lies a fundamental difference that makes this proposal fall outside the guidelines specified by the Challenge in which it has been enrolled, the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\", and that is why I must sadly remove three stars from its rating. This challenge has clearly stated the type of participants that can be involved in it: high school or university students, still studying, who have ventures seeking financial support and a space to expose their skills to specialized members of the community. I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information) \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students.... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). Therefore, it is clear that the proposal does not fit this Challenge, regardless of its intention to provide quality education to students.  In my experience, this kind of specifications that apparently ban the free participation of a large number of members and their talented educational initiatives to give entry only to active students and their projects, is not only valid but necessary at a strategic level, and that is what the community in general should understand and protect: these types of spaces are playgrounds that like Cardano, allow us to incubate a whole new generation of developers, creatives, innovators with a mental model that is in direct contact with what is happening in the world (unfortunately, we experienced non-students lack that special condition), a generation that is an integral part of our secret weapon when it comes to long term goals like existing and being around for the next 100 years (statement by C. Hoskinson). Providing capital, guidance, a space for experimentation and failure, is standard procedure.  In short, the message this Challenge conveys is clear: let the students do their own thing, even if it means giving up doing things for them, at least for this time. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The way in which the proposers address the implementation plan, budget and team experience sections is an example of elegance and professionalism.  A clear picture of the event jumps to the reader's mind almost immediately, which could possibly have a positive impact on the efficiency with which project performance measurement procedures are carried out during project execution. Unfortunately, there are two aspects to consider that lead me to lower the final rating by two stars (one star for each aspect): 1) the budget far exceeds the maximum allocation of $5000 usd per project.  2) the proposal is competing in a category that does not correspond to it, therefore, according to the Challenge guidelines, its execution will not take place in a space where it can do so.  I have no doubt that in future funds the proposers will find the appropriate category in which they can put their skills at the service of the community.   ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To be honest, the wealth of information provided in the Feasability section is not consistently employed to generate solid KPIs or metrics that clearly determine what is going to be measured as an outcome at the end of the tunnel.  It is clearly stated in the general submission guidelines that KPIs do not necessarily have to be quantitative formulas that generate a numerical result, they can also be qualitative measures.  However, their qualitative character must allow the extraction of information that can be processed to finally establish a state of project performance.  Unfortunately, as a project evaluator, I do not find a firm column to grasp at the measurement level, which is why I have to deduct 2 stars from the final rating. In short, the KPIs could be further elaborated.

This problem is solved by organizing the OxBAT Foundation, which is an academic cross-chain NFT conference at the University of Oxford that brings together students, scholars and industry experts from diverse fields. solve the above problem. Help your students keep up with you. The risk in this challenge is the allocation of time and resources to this preparation.

To successfully organize an OxBAT conference involves the following steps: initiate exchanges between students, scholars, industry professionals and artists, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary exchanges, also in different chains , a powerful concept that embraces and reflects the diversity of the NFT/cryptocurrency space, with speakers and guests from different blockchains, research fields, and different levels of expertise, Cardano is the representative representation of a sustainable blockchain, investing in future builders and thinkers. All of these steps are relevant to the success of the project. The problem is solved through organizing as it is being held at Oxford University and it will be open to students from here as well as other universities.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Metrics are clearly defined through weekly meetings, they also spend a little time outside talking about work.

The author states their names, what each person has done, they talk about their previous experiences. The team includes :Eva Gentner an art historian exploring the intersection of art, blockchain technology and community, Mateja Sela who connects the worlds of fashion, technology and art with Web3 and NFT, Joshua S. Bamford musician, psychologist and academic nomad, David Hochhauser an anthropologist and digital artist interested in the new frontiers of both fields, Aonia Traxler a passionate Web3 engineer promoting open and inclusive economic models through cryptocurrencies and NFTs, Fabienne Saurer is a cultural anthropologist who studies fan communities, Josiah Thiagarajah is an engineer exploring how blockchain works. The funding for this project is $11.820 less than 20% of the total challenge budget. The author's budget is divided into reasonable expenses: The author divides the budget into 3 main meals: lunch, coffee and tea, and dinner drinks. The payouts are up to the challenge.
