One key area that satisfy me about this project is its focus on addressing the unemployment bit. The real focus here is to project the great works being advanced using blockchain to solve real-world problems that mainstream media would not report on, through interviews, reportage, talk shows and project Digest. This would offer the opportunity to help the team establish and impact students with quality content on blockchain and real-world value delivery. This initiative could be the entry point for young African students into the blockchain ecosystem, especially the catalyst community to help explore the general ecosystem.

Given the profile of the team, a production head, a presenter, programs development and designer are the team formation. The composition of the team depicts clearly the individual roles of each team member in project execution. More importantly, the work experience of the team members is well detailed, with links to their LinkedIn profile confirming their expertise. However, what will be the marketing strategy here and who play such a role. Because a lot of things fight for the attention of students, there ought to be a strategy to attract them to an initiative that seems novel in Africa. Therefore, i suggest that, in the initial stages of the project, the team include a marketing expert for this project. The outlook of the roadmap is great; the proposal clearly states the expectation of the community and what's required of auditors. The framework here is quiet simplified into weeks with specific duration allocation provided for each activity. This gives u a preview of what we should expect within each week to ensure the successful project implementation. The total allocation for the budget  is $4.2K, an amount far below the the limits set for this challenge. It is worth mentioning the systematic and comprehensive budget breakdown for the project, with a feasible structure depicting clearly how the said amount being solicited would be used. However, as suggested here and at the impact assessment section, i expect that if my view on the \u201cmarketing strategy is incorporated into the general framework of the project, it should reflect at the budget section with an allocated amount.

Although you identified the need to attract students to create the necessary interest in blockchain technology, it would be better if you showed me your specific plan for this, especially when students are not yet familiar with it. About blockchain, how will you communicate for this channel to attract students' attention, such as communication in university teams or student competitions. In addition, how Coin Media will have a different way of communicating compared to other channels to create credibility and support from students is also something to think deeply about.

The critical point is that I have not seen you give a plan, and the cost of channel promotion, a good product but not known by many people, will be prohibitive.

The solution proposed by the authors is to establish Coin Media - a Youtube Channel, a web dedicated to providing updated content about blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem to a student audience in Africa. The aim of the solution, the team argues, is to spark student interest in blockchain technology, preparing for the digital future. Personally, I think that the solution for developing information channels and blockchain and Cardano community groups, in general, is not very innovative. A lot of similar ideas have been presented at previous Funds. It is important for the team to come up with really breakthrough and creative ways to make the information channel really attractive, and attract the audience to approach, specifically here are students who love learning technology in Africa. This requires the group to research and analysis of the problems technology students in Africa are facing. For example, what information do they want to be provided with? What are their main concerns about blockchain focused on? How many people have approached Catalyst and become PAs/proposers?.. Personally, I think the team should have a preliminary survey before setting up Coin Media. The survey results will help the team orient the content and target audience more effectively. Regarding the risks encountered, the team considers that \u201cproduction workload is the main risk to the project\u201d. However, as someone who has spent a lot of time researching Cardano development in Africa, I personally think there are a lot of risks preventing success that the team needs to take into account. Specifically: one is, the risk of expensive internet connection costs, and poor connection quality may limit the student audience from accessing the Channel. Africa is known as a region where people have to spend up to 10-20% of their monthly income on internet connection costs. The second is the risk of not attracting the attention of students because many students in the area have financial difficulties when studying. They have to find a way to work to cover their study costs. To overcome this, I suggest the team consider setting up a prize fund to develop the community through minigames on the Channel.

The implementation time is estimated by the team to be 8 weeks. In it, I find it quite confusing when some simple content takes a long time to complete. For example, buying a camera takes 2 weeks (weeks 6-7)? The final milestone of the plan is to complete the establishment of Coin Media in the 8th week. Also, I did not find any information in the roadmap about the plan to reach out and develop the Channel after its establishment. This in my opinion is a major shortcoming, affecting the feasibility of the solution. Personally, I suggest, the team should make a full plan of 3 phases (minimum 3 months) to develop the Channel. In which, the first month is to complete all the preparations and promote the establishment of Coin Media. The second month should be spent developing channel content, community marketing, and receiving feedback for editing and improvement. The 3rd month is to accelerate, grow the number of new people to the Channel, and maintain the number of regular Channel followers. Regarding the implementation budget, the items in my opinion are not really reasonable and clear. I could not find the specific unit price and the number of accompanying explanations.

And hope this project will be funded by Catalyst fund.\nEspecially the communication right in universities and colleges, because students are young generation, know how to seize opportunities and have many educational backgrounds to absorb and contribute to the development of the Cardano community.\nAnd in your suggestion, I only see the promotion on the Youtube channel, I have an additional contribution as to why not set up a Facebook channel such as creating a Fanpage or Group for the community to exchange and interact more easily, because the interaction I find it more intuitive on Facebook than on Youtube, on Youtube, it is more about making content about information, tutorials and passive viewers than interacting on Facebook, although on Youtube there is also a comment function.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You have shown the roadmap to develop your Media channel, but I have an additional suggestion that to develop the Web site, what platform do you plan to develop or program yourself, I still recomment the use of Wordpress because it is easy to use.\nAnd whether the cost of $ 500 to develop a website is whether you have divided it into details because often with a Website, it is necessary to maintain hosting and domain fees.\nSetting up a Website requires costs such as:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Buy domain name, and renew\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Hosting or VPS\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Buy Theme, buy Plugin and Security Plugins if needed\nLearning a little more knowledge about SEO is also good to aim for the Web to have more interaction, then attach the Links of Social channels like Youtube and Facebook in the footer of the Website to have a connection,\nIn the Youtube channel, you should also put the Website link in the description, in the settings of Youtube.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "- Almost all measurement indicators such as the number of Videos, the number of students passing, the number of views, the number of students participating in the interaction are enough to measure the progress of the project.\n- Very well, I also wish that my student days would have been better if I had been exposed to Blockchain earlier, once again I wish you all get the fund and better yet the successful project in reality.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3616", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14899, "q0": "I found that the team presented each topic clearly and easily to distinguish, in the first sentence the team also wrote a very clear and easy to understand summary solution. Proposal also shows the benefits that Establish Coin Media brings to students and in the future, which shows the project's interest in young generations a lot. Next is the detailed plan,the team gives very good evidence, but I have not seen the characteristics of the audience that the team is trying to reach. I think doing the project on the Youtube platform is very good because this is the most popular platform in the world and people spend a lot of time on it,the team also knows how to take advantage of blockchain to develop the project. In terms of strategy and sustainability, I found the team to come up with very good ways and have clear goals. Proposal wants to achieve that result is \"prepare among African youths for a digital future\" and I see the team has set out a way to do that. Every content the team offers, I see a very detailed analysis and introduction, with even the smallest parts but also taken care of. At the end the team also presented the onboard in a convincing and feasible way. The team took the risk that it was \u201cworkload on production\u201d and I found them quite reasonable because if there is too much work that cannot be completed, the project is not completed. project cannot be completed.

There is also a Key Metrics section so that it can be used as a milestone to complete the stages. But I think adding a few more ideas for the more detailed stages would be perfect. For example, \"Legal Registration\", the team should further explain how it will happen, what conditions are needed or not. The other stages should also be presented in a similar way. Each number is clearly presented with specific price figures so it is easy to understand and reasonable. I think the items to be paid by the team were presented well but I think it was lacking for advertising and design. And finally the team gave the total number. The project provided full profile information of 5 members. very detailed tablets. I believe these talented people will help the development of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The content that the team gives to measure is closely following the progress of the project, because it is done on the Youtube platform, I will definitely pay attention to the views and I see the team can present.
