The project is closely aligned with the fund challenge as the proposer is a student that is looking to add value to the Cardano ecosystem through increasing awareness and education among other students. There is clear and concise information provided on the proposals and goals. The proposer has identified that \u2018transportation costs when travelling to-and-from meetings\u2019 may be a future risk that could prevent the project from getting delivered successfully and has addressed how they would mitigate this by having \u2018meetings online\u2019. This shows the proposer's acknowledgment to scale to address future challenges. The proposal does not provide information on a plan for the project\u2019s future sustainability.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer plans to undertake this venture on their own and seems attainable as the project is on a relatively smaller scale and shorter duration to complete. Relevant information on the proposer's knowledge, skills and experience is presented and appears to be competent in implementing the proposal successfully \u2013 Though I would suggest for the proposer to insert any of their online social media profiles (Twitter or Linkedin) to help give a reference on their background and experience. The budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items. There is assurance that the project will have some financial stability as the proposer has thought out the allocation of funds. The proposer has made a typographical error with the information provided on the budget as it is written \u2018requested amount $1500\u2019 whereas I believe they meant \u2018$1600\u2019. Overall, the budget does seem reasonable to achieve set goals. The project aims to continue its venture into educating the 60 targeted students and has provided information on a plan to access additional funding in future project catalyst funding rounds. The information provided on the plan to complete the work appears to be realistic yet presents insufficient information to give clarity on whether the project will be successfully executed. Especially given the knowledge that the proposer will be taking on full responsibility for completing the tasks. It would be beneficial for the proposer to explore breaking up the 2-month duration of the project into weekly phases to give a better understanding of when certain tasks will be completed or when specific goals will be aimed to be achieved. Having a clear roadmap is important to give goals a link to detailed work and a timeframe for achievement, given the project resources and capacity. I would suggest identifying key milestones for tasks \u2013 for example, \u2018schedule 10 meetings by week 2\u2019 or \u2018accomplish 5 signups on Ideascale by 2 months\u2019. This can help maintain a more accurate understanding of how the project is advancing through the initial plan. The plan and budget items state the necessary resources needed to implement the project. Although there is insufficient information describing what they are or how they are going to be used. In regards to the educational materials needed, it is important to describe what type of educational materials will be used to implement the project. Examples of this can be, types of educational print material like textbooks, pamphlets and study guides or audiovisual materials like presentation slides and videos. Given that transportation costs have the largest allocation of requested funds it is important to provide more information to describe this item in the plan. If the proposer will be driving to meetings - hence stating that transportation costs will be for fuel or will the proposer be travelling by bus, therefore, needing bus fare. In addition, providing an estimate of the distance needed to travel would further add transparency to this. Given that transportation costs were mentioned as a future challenge and risk and that pivoting to more online meetings would be used to help mitigate this issue \u2013 it raises some concern that the proposer may have under-budgeted for internet data expenses. It may be beneficial for the proposer to explore a cost-benefit analysis to see which decision to make or which to forego. For example, it may be beneficial to reduce the allocated budget for transportation costs and increase the allocated budget for internet data \u2013 as it could allow greater leeway for more meetings.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal provides a roadmap with unclear milestones and time horizon for achievement \u2013 it isn\u2019t very well designed, which made it difficult to audit the proposal.

The targeted problem and the idea of their proposed solution appear to be well understood. Although insufficient information was shown on how it can be measured against their proposed outcomes \u2013 making it difficult to evaluate success. Even though the proposal provides information on an effective solution, the information provided to address the problem with measurable definitions of success was insufficient.

The goal here is not just to onboard people onto catalyst to take part in various roles like proposer assessors,veteran proposer assessors etc. There is more to that. I personally believe this  proposal would have best fitted in the grow Africa,grow cardano challenge because per the descriptions in the proposal,this peer to peer schooling is likely to take place in Ghana in Africa.

The author claims to be a cardano ambassador and a volunteer helper in wada Ghana programs but he did not provide us with any relevant social media links like his LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter or telegram handle where we can get to see his experience at wada programs or maybe even pictures and images where we can see the author taking part in those programs as a cardano ambassador.\nAgain,there is no clarity in the timeline for delivering this project. We only know the duration of the project will be about 2 months,we do not know what activities will be taking place in each month.\nLastly, the budget is not relatively high,it meets the challenge setting and is totally reasonable in relation to the kind of project the author plans to implement.

Even though the proposer stated a few key performance indicators which I believe are good ways of measuring success of the project,I feel this project cannot be tracked by the community, there are no direct ways of monitoring this project and in essence,one cannot evaluate the progress of this project based on what was presented in the proposal to us.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2890", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7122, "q0": "The proposal has a background that being a Catalyst member, whether be it as the PA or proposer, brings economic leverage for students. After contributing to Fund 8, the proposer discovers that they can help their peers earn financial incentives by becoming a Catalyst proposal assessor. If it goes according to the plan, his peers would not only get early influence with Cardano, but it would also help them get to a better state of economic situation. I believe it matches with the challenge settings, as the proposer targets his peers who are getting into university.

I applaud that the budget requested is very detailed and broken down into items. It could be improved by adding further details for each item. For example, what\u2019s the point of the \"Lunch & T-shirts\" item? What is the quantity of them? Another example would be miscellaneous. What is it actually used for?\n\nThat being said, I have to give kudos to the proposer who specified the amount of time and the implementation items in the proposal. The proposer also considered some challenges that might hinder the plan and the mitigation as well. However, I would also like to see the problem of the peers' not having any familiarity with Cardano or blockchain in general solved.

I appreciate that the proposer set a very high target of 60 peers within such a short timeline. However, because the main approach is to use door-to-door learning, it makes it hard to keep track of and document the entire progress. The metrics the proposer used (the number of peers that signed into Ideascale, etc.) are already correct, but a specific number is needed for it to be used as a factor of the proposal\u2019s success. That being said, I am really inspired to see that the proposer has put this much effort into this proposal.

The proposal also mentions WhatsApp and Twitter conversations as significant activities, but I don't believe they are truly impactful.\nOn another note, the inclusion of a Coinbase referral link in the 'Relevant Links' sections is outright disrespectful to everyone committing their time and effort to assessing proposals in my opinion.\nThe multiple and massive inconsistencies in this proposal make it impossible to take it seriously.\nIn short, I doubt this proposal will truly have an impact on student entrepreneurs situation with regards to Cardano.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The author seems enthusiastic and excited about the proposal, but does a poor job at accurately describing his skills.

For someone asking for $1,600, one cannot simply take their word for it.\nSecondly, the budget seems a bit unrealistic to me. $800 for transportation costs seems outrageous. I sadly don't have experience with Ghana transportation but a simple Google search and calculation threw a result of $224 for 60 round trips (assuming that a ride is needed for each one of the 60 students, which also seems unlikely).\nThirdly, the plan is extremely vague and not detailed at all. It only mentions having individual and group meetings with the targeted students, 'tweeting' and having WhatsApp conversations.

I see a few lapses here. For instance, the  the proposer provides little information on how the project intends to enable students bring up ideas and shape them into a well-define proposal for funding in the catalyst space. On the contrary, the other perspective of this project is that, i envisage that this could be a starting point for introducing the proposer\u2019s peers to the ecosystem and eventually helping them develop their ideas.

The 2 month set aside for the project implementation does not provide a breakdown of the duration for each activity. The proposer fails to tell us whether the activities listed under the roadmap would be carried sequentially, simultaneously or randomly. A clarity on this could help the community appreciate what would be done at what time within the two month period.  For instance, how would the teaching for one month look like? how many times would an online class be organized? when would phone call meetings be organized and how many times? I prefer a more definite approach to the  roadmap because, for each activity, a budget allocation may be provided. Therefore, in my opinion, the roadmap needs to be more streamlined to improve the feasibility of the project. Again, on the budget allocation, i am not so convinced about the amount allocation to a few items, in my view, they\u2019re a bit overpriced and without a clear breakdown. I would cite few examples here. In the first place, providing specific duration for the house to house teaching could have justify the amount allocated for transport. Then, we could know the transport fee for each day\u2019s (and week\u2019s) house to house teaching. Therefore, the proposer hasn\u2019t justified the need for a transport fee. Again, the proposer fails to tell us what educational resource would be needed for the project to justify a budget allocation for it. More importantly, the project failed to take into account the roadmap for the Fund 9 challenge. If that was done, the proposer could have recognized that funding is in September. Therefore, how does the proposer execute the activities budgeted for without the funding for it? Like i  said earlier, i suggest the proposer restructure the whole proposal to reflect these observations.
