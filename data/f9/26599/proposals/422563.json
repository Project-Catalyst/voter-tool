Cardano understands how the scaffolding of innovation works, how this kind of spaces in which experimentation is more important than precision are strategic for the consolidation and expansion of long-term goals.   \n\nUndoubtedly, this proposal understands how to work the essential ingredients of innovation and productive creation in the laboratory of ideas that end up being the advantage of any organization.  Setting the stage for the conduction of efforts that flow like electricity is critical, and the proponents plan to set that kind of stage.  In their platform they plan to provide the necessary tools to enable all kinds of collaborative interactions that allow students to explore how far they can go creatively.

All thanks to the project proponents and Catalyst, of course.\n\nHowever, I must reluctantly remove two stars from the impact rating of this proposal for the following reasons: I find the budget requested by the proposers and their knowledge and experience outside of the guidelines established by the Challenge.  In seeking to be a playground for students, the Challenge has very appropriately placed a limit of $5000 per proposal.  In the same vein of encouraging student entrepreneurship spirit in the framework of Project Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem, the general profile of the proposers of this Challenge should be that of students, while clearly the proposers of this proposal in particular far exceed this basic type of profile.

I am a fan of the good use of resources, including financial ones, however, a reduced budget puts at risk the quality of the product they are trying to deliver.  I have no doubt that the expertise of the proponents would know how to make many of the functionalities of their platform efficient with the requested budget, however, a product with such a valuable purpose as the proposers suggest requires a little more budget to be solid over time.  This is the reason why I must unfortunately remove 1 star from your Feasibility rating.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am afraid that the traceability elements of the project in case it is funded are really weak.

My years of experience in the real economy confirm me these data. The auditability of a project is something to be taken on board with rigor: it is a painful conclusion that is learned over time.

The idea and purpose of the proposal at this stage is very much in line with the challenge. The focus group (student entrepreneurs and engineers) is spot on, especially since the web platform is intended to focus both as a place where students and engineers can connect, but also work on potential projects together. However, there are some question marks that would need to be clarified in regards to the impact of the proposal. \n\nFirstly, Cardano is only mentioned as a means of applying for funding. There is nothing wrong with that in itself (quite the opposite!) but I would have liked to see some clarification on how these project would connect with the Cardano ecosystem as a whole, other than getting exposure when applying from funds through Project Catalyst. Are these upcoming projects intended to use the Cardano blockchain in any way? \n\nSecondly, the funds applied for in the proposal (13 500 USD) is surpassing the set budget limit for this particular challenge, which is 5000 USD. I don\u2019t know if the proposer missed this detail while reading the challenge details (totally understandable if that is the case), but it is a very important aspect to the challenge requirements. It was set intentionally low to allow lot of students getting exposure to Catalyst and Cardano, an introduction that could potentially evolve into further collaborations and larger projects. \n\nLastly, there does seem to be intention of further developing and expanding this (and other) projects through involvement with Catalyst, and I would have loved to see some more thoughts on those future plans from the proposer. \n\u2028Overall, I disagree that this project effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team of 4 people cover good ground with expertise in software development sufficient to build the intended web platform. We are provided with links to twitter, Github and LinkedIn-pages, which helps validating the stated expertise of the team. \nThe same people are also involved in another project in a different challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422578), and it would\u2019ve been of great help to the PAs and voters if there would have been a segment where the proposer mentions the potential risks of developing these projects side by side (if funded, both of them). \n\nThe roadmap containing estimations of time spent on each part of development leaves me with some questions. There is an estimate of days needed on each segment (for example API architecture design: 28 days), but I would have liked to see clarification if all these segments are developed in tandem, or if each segment is developed one at a time. In my experience as a recurring PA, clarity is key when presenting a proposal. The details presented could be the difference if a voter or PA will understand the intentions of the proposers or not. To give an example from the roadmap of this proposal: \nEstimated time of development: 42 days OR 188 days (depending on if the segments of the project is developed in tandem with each other or not). A suggestion could be to present the roadmap in the dates it is planned to be finalized, that leaves less room for interpretation on the reader. \n\nThe budget contains estimations for each part of the development process. There is still the issue of the overextended budget (mentioned under \u2019impact\u2019). What would bring even more clarity to the budget plan is the inclusion of the estimated work hours for one person, and divide that by the budget for that particular segment (providing us with an hourly wage for one person AND an estimate of the work hours of each person in the team). \n\nDue to the points mentioned above, I am unsure if the proposal provides me with enough information to assess the probability of successful implementation.

Github and twitter are two great platforms to track the development progress, especially since it mostly covers both tech-savvy people and those without technical expertise. \u2028\u2028I would have loved to see more measurements of success other than \u2019meeting the development deadline on time\u2019, as stated in the proposal.

Will it be a larger focus on \non-boarding student entrepreneurs or engineers? \nThe intention of not including these metrics could be that the proposal only specifies the completion of the web platform, and not the management of it (which would explain a lot). But this makes it even more important to include in the future plan of the project, what is the team trying to achieve, how are they intending to do it and in what scope? Will the community be invited to test the platform and provide feedback, or will it be contained within the core team? \u2028\u2028In order to confidently assess the auditability of this project, I would have liked to see more explanations and details written, as explained above.

As for the success, the proposal states that it would be seen by seeing more students being able to easily materialize their ideas and projects by easily finding engineers and easily finding the funds necessary for the realization of their projects. However, there are no metrics to measure it. Therefore with what is given it would be harder to assess the success. An easier means to access success would be seeing a constant influx of ideas from students and regular partnership between them and the engineers.

While I think the idea is interesting and aligns well with Cardano's scalability goal, I believe this project should be proposed in another section (Dapps, products) as it was not proposed by students and has very ambitious goals that are beyond the scope of this challenge setting. When considering the idea outside of its current context, it is very appealing because platforms for idea sharing among students and academics, such as researchgate, already exist, but they serve primarily to share and collaborate for academic purposes, ignoring the business context. Furthermore, as proposed, such a platform would provide a space for the Catalyst community and related fundraising opportunities to connect with ideas that would undoubtedly add value to the Cardano Ecosystem, with the potential to have a global impact by connecting students involved in the Catalyst community worldwide. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I believe the project is unlikely to be feasible because its goal is to create an entire platform, which would require a lot of programming and a much higher budget than the 5k USD limit per proposal in this setting, and as the proposal states, the required budget is nearly three times as much. The budget is also ambiguous, with no indication of how the costs were calculated - for instate design and data structure 2k USD - what exactly the cost includes - workload for an engineer, how many hours and at what hourly rate?I see fewer issues in the context of the team. The team members' prior experiences are relevant to the proposed solution, and both github and linkedIn profiles/repositories are available. However, one of the team members (Chadrac-WAKOMYA) has a github repository that is empty and inactive. The proposal also makes no mention of the team members' responsibilities. The schedule of planned activities is also vague, only stating the general action that will be carried out without explaining what methodology will be used in designing/integration, etc. Lastly the budget and milestones section in the proposal is almost identical", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I suspect the project cannot be monitored by the community because the timetable is poorly written and does not mention the specific subtasks required for execution or the methodologies used. Furthermore, the deliverables and KPIs\u00a0are not defined at all, with only a mention that progress will be tracked in relation to various stages and deadlines. This is ambiguous for several reasons, the most important of which is that if the deliveries are not defined at all and the plan consists of tasks in the broadest sense, such as \"Backend integration with frontend\" with days to complete, how can we know if they met the deadline?Furthermore, the team claims that there are no risks associated with carrying out the project, which is difficult to believe with such ambitious goal", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3256", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you very much for the comment.

The authors of this proposal did not recognize any risk at all, and so offer no ways of mitigation.

A possible weakness is the question of how much interest there might be in professionals wanting to find and work with student entrepreneurs. Still, this web platform would provide an excellent way to make those connections for those engineers who are interested.

The challenge clearly states that there's a $ 5,000 budget limit for each proposal, and the team asks for more than the double of the limit amount.
