The idea is great, it is about holding a series of hybrid events, where face-to-face meetings would take place in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, and topics related to the Cardano ecosystem would be addressed, with the aim of bringing new people to the community and increasing engagement in our projects. However, it is not said at any time how the students would be the focus of the events, how the contents covered would be specific so that this audience would benefit and how such contents would be designed to meet their needs. It would be necessary for the proponent to seek to establish a bridge between students/universities and events, for example: how to enter the job market that involves blockchain, how to get internships in companies that work with this technology, how to insert themselves in the teams in the teams of the projects currently developed in the community, or even how to participate in Catalyst (either as proponents or CAs). In addition, it would be necessary for more information to be passed on in relation to the meetings themselves. It would be 1 per month: what subjects are covered in each? Or would they be the same subjects addressed, intended for different audiences? It would be necessary for the proponent to explain in detail which topics would be presented and in what way. Probably, more initial topics such as \u201cwhat is blockchain, what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano\u201d would be addressed either in the first meetings or in the first minutes of all meetings; so that more in-depth subjects could then be worked on, such as blockchain use cases, Cardano\u2019s programming languages, how each professional (or student in each area) could be part of our projects and so on. In general, the idea is suggested in an abstract way. The proponent states that special guests and speakers will be called to bring credibility to the events: it would be important to know which ones; it is said that current affairs that revolve around our currency would be discussed, Ada: which subjects? It is also said that special attractions would be included in the events, to attract public attention and increase the level of engagement: what kind of attractions? Maybe musical attractions, famous people in Brazil? How could we captivate the participation of an audience from a country that, despite advancing in this direction, is still not a place where blockchain is widely known and established? That said, I believe that the core of the proposal is good, but it would be necessary for more detail to be given about the events and the relationship of the meetings with the student public to be clearer, so that the proposal could be more clearly aligned with the challenge, achieving the specific objectives set out here.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The topic gives us basic information on how the project will be put into practice, but several things need improvement. The roadmap does not give us an understanding of what the project development process would look like, which steps and tasks would have to be developed for the desired results to be achieved. In total 12 months, the description of activities is the same for each (\u201cLaunch, dissemination and registration for the meeting; Conducting the hybrid meeting\u201d). However, a lot of information should have been provided, so that we had a proper understanding of the project development. First, it would be necessary to know what each of the professionals mentioned in the team's presentation would be doing, what would be their roles in the project. It would be necessary to understand 1) where the face-to-face meetings would be held, how they would be defined. We know they would be in S\u00e3o Paulo, but this is the biggest city in Brazil. So where, in S\u00e3o Paulo, would they be made? 2) what subjects were covered in each meeting, and how they would be explained, so that the presentations were as accessible as possible 3) who would be the presenters of the meetings, if they would be the members of this team, or people from outside, invited especially for that. And if they are outsiders, how would they be selected? 4) how would the event publicity process be carried out, so that more people would get involved. It is said that they have a site with 1 million hits on average; but I believe that users who access it already know Cardano. How to encourage people who don't even know what blockchain is to participate? 5) it would be important to set up a script for each event, for example: first 2 hours - exposition of contents / half an hour of coffee break / plus 1 hour of lecture / half an hour for questions and answers, at the end. And, above all, it would be necessary to understand if the team would make any specific contact with the students, how this contact would be made, which students would be approached (only from the technology area, or from several areas of knowledge)... a good view of the pre-production of events, how the events themselves would happen and also how post-event feedbacks would be collected. Moving on to the next analysis topic, the total amount of $19,800 is broken down into a few parts, but those would need further explanation as well. Many of these expenses are unclear. Who would be the teacher? And what is the difference between him the presenter of blockchain and cryptocurrency contents? Which journalist would that be, would he have the function of covering the event and publicizing it? How can it be defined that the physical space would cost 100 dollars of monthly rent, if we don't know what spaces these would be? Would social media expenses be used to carry out paid advertising? How would the organizers, the marketing assistant, the video editor work? How many hours a week would they dedicate to the project, and how much would their work hours be priced? Finally, speaking of the project team, a certain trust is transmitted, although from what I understand only Ot\u00e1vio and Maria do Carmo have a direct relationship with Cardano. Some information about each is provided, but I would like a more detailed curriculum in relation to their areas of expertise and the projects they have already developed to be included as well (for example, we are not sure of Maria do Carmo's area of \u200b\u200bexpertise). With this, several points of feasibility need improvement for the topic to become suitable.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Once again, the information provided is very superficial, and is basically numerical, which does not allow the project to be properly monitored. Regarding the progress, it would be important that the script was better worked, so that we had more tangible content for audits. The suggested KPIs are all numerical: number of event registrants; community participants (in this case, the subscribers who would be community participants or subscribers who became community participants?); number of users in groups (which groups? from telegram and discord?); and number of actions taken (what actions?). In addition to leaving some doubts open, such surveys do not cover the pre-production part of the events. How can we verify that all the tasks necessary for the events to come true were done properly? How can we monitor the work of each team member? In my opinion, the ideal would be for the proponent to provide us with a report at the end of each month, raising general questions about the project, from activities in the pre-production of events, as well as about the day of the meeting itself (how was it, if the number expected of people appeared, how was the engagement of this audience\u2026). Speaking of final results, the metrics are similar to those suggested in the auditability of progress, and do not allow us to form a solid understanding of what the consequences of the project would have been for the Cardano ecosystem and also for the Brazilians involved. It would be necessary that 1) we know what the participants of the events would be doing after the meetings; if they actually absorbed the knowledge that was passed on, and how they would be getting involved with our community today - if they would be participating in Catalyst or in Cardano projects 2) If the students, specifically, were benefited from the project, and if so, how , what opportunities arose from here 3) what verifiable data would have emerged to confirm that the project was beneficial for Cardano, contributing to the greater popularization of blockchain in Brazil. All this data should be studied and passed on directly to our community, through, for example, the participation of the proponent in a townhall or a video summarizing the consequences of the project, which could be made available on youtube, for example. The information given only provides us with some necessary knowledge, but not all the understanding that would be necessary for us to carry out an adequate auditability.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 11, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 690, "q0": "Unfortunately, the proposal is not adapted to the Challenge due to the budget.

The more important point here is the issue of accountability. To address that, the proposers has indicated the team\u2019s willingness to make available to the community progress report as they initiate the project, in the form of a monthly news release on Cardano Feed, to measure the progress of our proposal.

My advice to the team is to ask for less money in the next F10 instead of the requested $19,800 and not to ask for funds for 12 months but for 4 months and thus through F10 and F11 a team with a smaller requested amount increases its chances of getting funds. Although a budget breakdown has been made, I would like to see who is doing what within the team and how many working hours the team actually works per month. The proposer presents a work plan for a period of 12 months, which is quite a long time and it is difficult to monitor the work of the team within such a time frame.

The fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge, approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment in which they can bring their projects to Project Catalyst and secure base funding, nothing financially ambitious. Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with a true innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but more importantly, with the possibility to get hands on with the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it. That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves. \n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.\n\nAs an educator and experienced Project Catalyst member,  I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid. However, it is evident that it is not being proposed by the type of students that the Community decided to support through this Challenge and it\u2019s outside of the max budget established per proposal, therefore it does not fit the parameters of the Challenge.  I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information): \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section). \n\nTaking into account the above reasoning, I must remove four stars from the final rating. \n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "It is an iterative project that can provide the service it intends to implement.

However, in spite of some nice features proposal brings, such as telegram and WhatsApp, a good number of meetings and the focus using an accessible (non-technical) language/approach, it could include more information on the content that will be discussed that. Some sort of syllabus or what are the main desired topics could be explained. Other idea is to use a sequence of meetings to explore specific themes that can levarage Brazil's capabilities. For instance, Brazil has a great agricculture segments so maybe 2 or 3 meetings could have this as theme to expose potential applications or on going projects that combines both Cardano and Agrobusiness. This would bring real life use cases and solutions and potentially attract new people. \nIn addition, a more detailed communication/marketing plan could be ellaborated here.
