In fact, in one way or another I have stuck my head in as many educational processes as I could.  Thanks to that, I can clearly understand what is involved in the process of creating and defending an idea, trying to do something good, something positive, with what you have, while enduring the pain as much as you can.  So I understand the young people who are presenting their proposals in this challenge.  \n\nA blockchain whose purpose is to be around for the next 100 years (as is the case of Cardano) should cultivate this kind of outreach events that highlight our attributes as a platform for innovation and productive creativity and that leave aside any speculative type of promotion.  These types of events become working cells where students can begin to explore their possibilities and progressively understand how they as creators can fit into our ecosystem.  If we add to this the fact that this proposal is aimed at a nascent cohort of new entrepreneurs, and in general young people with a productive and creative life ahead of them, it can be concluded that basically this proposal is a hotbed of new Catalyst members with the possibility that their projects will bring new users to the Cardano blockchain.  This type of public already has its ears and mind completely open to new scenarios in which to propose, create, build, collaborate, share. \n \nConsequently, I find this proposal in line with the objectives of the challenge and with building the future of Cardano.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From my experience I can say that the proposal suggests a simple execution scenario, easily controllable for the executor.  The line of development of the project presented by the proponent corresponds to an educational process that tries to acquaint students with the ins and outs of an ecosystem such as Catalyst, all from a practical approach.  The way in which the budget is intended to be invested corresponds to the reality of carrying out this kind of events and projects in general in developing countries like Ghana: the purchase of equipment that seems excessive in a first world country is an insurmountable obstacle in third world countries (just the kind of places where Cardano wishes to act to the best of its ability).  The difficulties in these places are real.  At the same time, I note that with the proponent's attempt to stretch the reduced budget ($5000) to the maximum of its possibilities, including providing the finalists with seed money for their projects ($200 becomes an interesting incentive at an exchange rate level that sparks curiosity about what is possible at Catalyst and Cardano).  On the other hand, a review of the information on his Linkedin page shows a work in education that is not afraid to roll up its sleeves: his resume includes a wealth of work in education and volunteer work in the same area.  The photographic material provided allows us to see Cardano's promotional work already well underway.  Therefore, I find the implementation of this project feasible and in line with the reality and needs of developing countries.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I said in the Feasibility assessment, this type of projects are easily controllable: it is easy to follow the variables involved in their execution.  Evidence of efficient or irresponsible execution is easy to extract.  The ways of measuring project progress outlined in the subsection \"Please describe what you will measure to track your project's progress, and how will you measure these?\" present tangible measurement parameters.  The project vision, described in the subsection \"What does success for this project look like?\" describes a project that will reduce the time it takes for a new member to adapt to the dynamics of Catalyst: graduates of each cohort will arrive in our ecosystem with a clear understanding of where to go and what to do.  Therefore, I find it feasible to measure the results of this project, whatever they may be (positive or negative), in the framework of a process that would function as an introductory school for new members to Project Catalyst.

This proposal does not include a reward, which would demoralize the participants who would not see the purpose of their efforts. This problem does not have a stated solution in the proposal.

The proposal is based specifically on Vienna, on the dissemination of information about the Cardano platform throughout Vienna. Cardano strives to expand awareness of this platform to as many people as possible, and this proposal fully fulfills that. The problem may be that people would not be fully interested in this project. People would not put a lot of effort into completing the tasks, because they would not see the goal, nor the reward of everything that. No man would spend so much energy in something that will not pay off. Just joining the Cardano world should be a reward for those participants, however, what if they don't have enough time to participate in all those workshops?

The main contact is specifically described, which is quite enough for one proposal. However, the information that is not listed in full is the solution to another problem, which is also not listed.

The fact that this is done in Ghana, is a plus, as this is providing opportunities to a place/country with small accessibility towards digital developments. With Cardano's open-source and great community, there is always room for the youth to get involved with the pioneers here in the ecosystem. From this bear market, we have learned that times ahead are more towards how cryptocurrencies have use cases that impact daily lives of ordinary people.

The idea in this proposal is to organize webinars which to me will serve as a platform to educate and onboard 100 students of Manipal Academy Of higher education. This is a brilliant idea since we are dealing with student entrepreneurs, business students are likely to have brilliant business ideas but mostly do not have the motivation and needed resources to implement those ideas to solve societal problems in their various communities. Therefore this project is an avenue for that,a platform where they are trained to write good proposals,educated on cardano and its blockchain and also providing startups for 10 innovative ideas which I find very interesting. With this said,I believe this proposal aligns and serves the purpose and goals of this challenge.  The only weakness of this part of the proposal is that,the proposer did not make it clear to us how these  MBA students will be scouted by engineers in the community,will they be scouted through the ideas they present on ideascale so that these engineers get to collaborate with them? This is not made clear to us in the proposal. Nonetheless, this proposal has an excellent idea. It aligns closely to the challenge and I believe has the likelihood of impacting cardano greatly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I found the timeline for delivering this project rather confusing. The author plans on using 4 days in a month( October) in delivering this project via zoom or google meet. The timeline to me is very short for such a project. The writer also talks of providing startups for 10 innovative catalyst ideas as mentioned in the budget. Does the author hope to do this via the  zoom meetings? Is he not supposed to meet these students physically before providing the start ups for them in order for him to be able to safely track the progress of those businesses? This was not soo understanding to me. The timelines and delivery dates are also not soo convincing to me.\nSecondly, though the budget meets the limit for the challenge setting,it is quite vague to me.is the proposer using $1500 dollars in purchasing just an administrative laptop? This is ambiguous to me. That amount ($1500) allocated to purchase that item(laptop) is quite vague to me and also relatively high. Also $500 dollars as incentives for the host, apparently,the author is the only host here and $500 for one person is way too much in my opinion. Again what I see in this proposal is only one person described which I believe to be the author himself, meaning he is the only one going to handling the project and I believe he has the expertise to handle the project, moreover this is going to be an online project and one person can handle this in my opinion. It is no doubt that the author has some level of experience in the cardano community. He has managed to draw a visual concept of him in our minds, from the picture at the beginning of the proposal to the attached images at the end of the proposal only tells us that the author has hosted several cardano outreach programs and for this reason has some level of experience. The only problem in terms of experience is that,the author did not tell us how capable he is,in handling this project,as in more details for us to be sure this project is likely to scale in his hands, though he stated he has skills in hosting webinars,it would have been more convenient if we got to see some sessions of webinars he hosted.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "For auditability, the author stated numerous ways the project can be tracked by the community. A media blog published at the end of the project, recordings of the webinar trainings, registering and extracting database of participants to be reported to catalyst are correct ways of tracking the success of this project. There are no delivery dates but the metrics of this project are measurable to some extent, except the funding of $200 each for 10 innovative ideas. How does the author intend to track the progress of these startups,of course,he should be able to find out the outcome of the $200 he gave out for those startups and also report back to the community on their progress. That was not made known to us and I will advise the proposer to be able to keep tracks of those startups if possible, physically, to make sure they are making progress if this project is fortunate to be funded.

First, the award for each winning startup idea, which is $200, is not enough for the students to carry out their business idea in real life. If the project could not provide a better award for the winners, the proposer should reduce the number of winners. Moreover, the proposer should consider cutting unnecessary budgets like the Internet or technical gadgets as participants can prepare these by themselves. I believe this can save more than $2000 compared to the original proposed budget, and the project can use this saving to award more to the startup winners.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I need to know a few more things.
