The solution was to organize a contest to award the 3 best innovative ideas in NTIC (New Communication and Information Technology), especially in Cardano Blockchain to honor the innovation of businesses by young people aged 16-26. I believe the idea is good and perfectly suited to the goal of the challenge. If this proposal is successfully implemented, it will allow student entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to the world and provide them with the opportunity to network with engineers and investors. Propose shows a legitimate problem and then provides an idea of \u200b\u200ba valid solution. In addition, the proposal also provides some links related to the startup Uptodate Developers, which is an organization that will lead the competition so that helps us have a better overview of what stands after this project. According to the team's description, this is the 3rd version of the Updev Challenge, after the 1st and 2nd versions were successfully executed. It would be great if they provided some information on the results of the previous 2 versions, which will help us better understand whether the impact of this project on the challenge is positive or not?", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information provided is sufficient to assess the feasibility of the project. First, about the roadmap, we can fully monitor the process and the outcome of the proposal based on what is provided. Since this is the 3rd time the group has organized the contest, I think the organization is quite familiar to them. We were provided with all the details regarding the route perfectly: from the tagline of the contest to the venue of the event, registration is on the website www.updevchallenge.com starting from August 1 to August 30, 2022... general information provided by the project is very detailed, so much so that we can imagine how the event will take place, including the time contest start and end time. Next is the budget, the proposal asks for $7000 I think it is over the budget allowed in this challenge, however since it is the amount required to execute the project and it also It's not a huge number so I think the project deserves funding. The amount is broken down into definable categories, we know exactly what each expense is going to be used for, so the required budget is perfectly reasonable in my opinion.\nFinally, the project team, the team behind this project is very qualified. We are told their name, main function, working process, and links like LinkedIn, through which we can verify the information described. It conveys complete trust in the team because, in addition to the amazing level of detail about who they are, we also know the role each person plays in the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal can be easily measured and checked against progress through what the author provides. As described in the impact section, this proposal will create a contest after which the 3 best ideas are found, so that is the basis for auditing this project. The proponent also ensures that in this First Year the winning projects present Cardano Blockchain integration prototypes based on the resources they have received. We can fully track the progress of the project through the updevchallenge.com platform where the winners will be updated in each release. This is a brand new project not a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst, however, the team has done 2 similar versions of the competition before and got good results ( and their access to this funding source is due to a lack of funding). Therefore, I believe that if this proposal is funded, it will contribute to creating more motivation for them to continue implementing this project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3381, "q0": "An opportunity given to the young Devs in Congo to realize their innovative projects in New Information , communication and technology ideas.

The prizes to be won are a big addition to promote this proposal and facilitates its success.\nWhile the success is guaranteed as the UPDEV is already established and has organized this competition for the past two years, I would have loved to see some outcomes of the previous edition presented in this proposal, but also have a age group of participants be increased, taking from 15 to 30 years old participants.\nAbout the budget, the breakdown covers all the necessary expenses items, but on the Rewards for the 3 runner up, I would suggest to increase to an amount of: $2000 for the first: $1000 for the second, and $800 for the 3rd. These amounts would encourage participants more to be part of the challenge, but also allow then to work on their project while staking a certain amount. Thinking of the vote in catalyst, by giving out at least $800 to the 3rd runner up, they'll be able to vote in catalyst, but also a way to encourage all of them to be part of it on various stages, if they are new.\nI find this proposal feasible based on key elements: proposers skills and experience, presence of UPDEV with all its expertise; easy possibility to get developers in that region of Goma, DR Congo... My rating is of a 5 star", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The audit may be easily done by the community as the progress will be shared to the UPDEV website: https://uptodatedevelopers.com/, while their social media platforms will also be used for update about progress, and revealing of the prototypes created by the 3 winners.\nThis process seems open to entire community, and my rating would be of a 5 star.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2458", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3499, "q0": "Events that associate competition and entrepreneurship have been characterized as an effective way of idea generation: it puts students in the position to create initiatives applicable to real-world use cases.  As someone who has made a career in formal education (college, university, business) exploring ways to encourage creativity and innovation in students, I consider this methodology an essential piece of cultivating their skills and a real connector to what happens in the real world.  The event suggested by the proposers in the proposal can undoubtedly become a great source of initiatives for our community and a great incentive for Congolese students.  Clearly, providing support for channeling the creative efforts of young people into our ecosystem is in line with Cardano's purpose, especially when these young people come from difficult areas of the planet.  However, there are two aspects that make this proposal act outside the guidelines clearly established in the Challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\": 1) the budget is over the maximum budget allowed per proposal ($5000USD) in this Challenge (however, based on the low amount of budget requested and the legitimate purpose of the proposal, I do not find it difficult that the proposal could have participated and been funded in other challenges more in line with its budget and proposers profile).  2) even more important than the previous point, the proposal is a proposal made FOR the students, but not BY the students. It is evident that the proposers are a mature organization, with experience in the field of application of the proposal, and if the Challenge were not specific in the type of proposers qualified to submit proposals in it, they would undoubtedly be the right ones to execute a project of this magnitude. However, the fundamental motivation behind the \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" Challenge approved by the Catalyst community last fund, is to provide college and university students with a space completely separate from the regular Catalyst environment, where they can bring their projects to our ecosystem and get base funding, nothing financially ambitious.  Clumsy projects, with flaws or weaknesses if any, but with an authentic innovative and creative student spirit, insolent and daring, that will lead their authors to find in our community a place to learn and get involved, a playground endowed not only with money, but even more valuable, with the possibility to get hands on the best technology in the industry while having access to the knowledge, experience and sense of collaboration of Catalyst members. A new concept for Catalyst no doubt, but an efficient one: in the student community of the planet lies that needle in the haystack that ends up changing the game we play so tightly with other blockchains and the legacy world, and it is our obligation to build the best of the magnets to find it.  That's just what this Challenge is trying to do: build a suitable habitat for students, designed primarily by the students themselves.\n\nBecause of my affinity with this Challenge (formal experience in education at school, university, company level) and my experience in Project Catalyst (actively participating in 90% of the community positions that exist: CA, VCA, Challenge Team member, funded proposer, involvement in multiple projects in Catalyst) I have been following it closely since it was approved at F8, because it never ceases to amaze me how often the scoreboard seeks to augment itself with topics of undeniable importance (Developer Ecosystem, Cross-Chain Collaboration, The Great Migration (From Ethereum)) to the point of discarding areas that in the real world have proven to be an inexhaustible source of ideas, creativity and results, such as those related to students.  \n\nAs an educator, I understand the intention behind the proposal and consider it completely valid.  However, in our particular case, this proposal is not designed by the students that the Challenge is intended to support, which is why it does not align with the spirit that the Challenge seeks to support: I quote (excerpted from the Challenge information) \"By creating a category of students and increasing exposure for their ideas, they can expect easier funding and to be scouted by engineers\" (section What does success look like?). \"Most student entrepreneurs suffer from a shortage of resources, especially when it comes to funding and hiring engineers\" (Why is this important? section). \"However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not readily perceive small-scale proposals from students. .... Therefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new category exclusively for students\" (Challenge brief section).  It is the above reasoning that leads me to deduct three stars from the final rating.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal would be the third occurrence of an annual event.  Therefore, its execution and the ability of the proposers to carry it out has a record to back them up. That must be why their implementation plan is so succinct, so concrete.  A review of www.updevchallenge.com shows a team of proposers accustomed to delivering results.  The budget follows the same line of the implementation plan: concrete, reflecting a procedure that has already been executed before.  Therefore, I find no problem with the definitions of the implementation plan and budget that have been made.  They are reasonable and supported with results from previous iterations of the same event.  I must remove one star from the final rating because the sum of the budget amounts does not match the total budget requested at the beginning of the proposal.

After the event, at any time the community can approach the proposers and audit their results based on the guidance they have provided in the Auditability section of their proposal.  I find this auditability scenario not only adequate to follow up on the proposal and how much it may have deviated from its initial propositions, I see in the proposers' auditability proposal an easy instrument to maneuver.
