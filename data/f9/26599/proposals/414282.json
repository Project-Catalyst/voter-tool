Thus, we have that the creation of an e-learning platform is in accordance with the objectives of the challenge. Additionally, the budget being requested is within the limit established by the challenge and we were able to see a great positive impact with the eventual success of this proposal, since part of the people involved in its development belong to the university environment, which facilitates the dissemination of the idea among other students.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We were able to observe that the ideas present in the project timeline represent a good set of activities that, in addition, describe several stages for the development of the platform. However, the observation is that perhaps the estimated total time of 3 months to complete the project is not enough, since software development often has delays in the schedule. On the budget breakdown, we realized that capital allocations make sense and it's nice to see a concern from the team to also direct resources to marketing. But a detail that would be important and that is missing is to understand how much each instructor will receive per hour of work, since this is the main focus of the project. This information would even help in planning future expenses. Regarding the team involved in the project, we observed that it fits very well with the scope of the proposal, since the main people involved belong to the academic universe, we noticed that their CVs were also made available so that we could verify their experiences. In addition, there will also be the accompaniment of other more experienced professionals.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to follow the progress of the application, we noticed the presence of concepts that actually help to understand if the plan is being well developed. However, it would be nice if these concepts were represented by parameters that facilitate the understanding of the path being followed. For example, the use of a tool such as JIRA could have been described so that the described goals could be better defined and monitored. Regarding the team's perception of success, it is notable that the scenario described is in line with the ideas developed throughout the proposal. But the observation remains that some criteria could have been defined as an expected number of students using the platform or a certain amount of new ideas that emerged from this project, and that use blockchain technologies to solve local problems. Such criteria would help to understand what visibility and impact the project was able to achieve.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3656, "q0": "Voters, the proposal basically consists of creating the first online educational platform that provides content in French on Blockchain and Cardano for students and future entrepreneurs.\nThe potential impact of this proposal is linked to the number of French-speaking people in the world \u2013 136 million. It is a language spoken by more than 40 countries in the world and many of them are in Africa, opening up a great possibility to spread knowledge about Blockchain and Cardano in this continent. In this sense, the proposal clearly has 2 communities that will benefit: the first is for students, who will have the opportunity to learn about Cardano and become part of our ecosystem, bringing their innovative ideas to be put into practice here; and the second would be the French speakers in general, but especially the natives of Africa, who can receive an opportunity to get to know Cardano as a possibility of economic development for them and for the continent. In this sense, I see that the proposal does not only correspond to this campaign, but also to the 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano' campaign, solving two problems with a single project.\nOverall, the proposal generates the possibility of a very complete project. I believe that only these requested funds are not enough to contemplate the full potential of this project.

The same is true for other items that are not \u201cbroken\u201d into smaller items to explain in more detail to the community how the resources will be distributed. Proposers could create a clearer specification of the pay, whether per person, per function, per hour, etc.\nThe proponent also does not present a timeline with the phases of the project. He just points out that the project will need 3 months to finish. At this point, he believes that if the proponent presents a timeline with each phase of the project and its respective deadline, it will be simpler for the team and the community to follow the progress of the project. This way it becomes easier to change some point if any phase is delayed, with the objective of not disturbing the final delivery of the project.\nFinally, the team considered and explained the challenges the proposal may face. For each challenge, appropriate actions were presented to reduce the risk of failure of the proposal, bringing more security and reliability to the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the proposal, there is a clear explanation of both the problem and the proposed solution. In this sense, there is correspondence between both, since the proposal solves the problem presented in the campaign.\nThe proposal cites some metrics to measure the success of the project and I suggest adding some others, such as: number of students who join the platform, number of projects that reach Catalyst through this platform, satisfaction surveys of students who follow the content on the platform, tests, instructors' opinions/perceptions, etc. All these metrics can be used to assess whether the project is performing well or not.\nIn addition, there are metrics that can be used to track the progress of the creation of the platform, such as: steps completed on time, level of team synergy (surveys may occur that the product manager itself can apply), level of quality of each completed step , etc.\nIn addition, the proposal could better explain a roadmap with deadlines corresponding to each stage of the project that needs to be completed to achieve its success. This would increase the project's auditability and enable better monitoring by both the team and the community.

Africa is the continent with the most French speakers in the world. French in Africa as a colonial language; French speakers in Africa are a large part of the Francophone Community. Therefore, it is advisable to transmit blockchain educational content in French to be more accessible and quicker to grasp. This project will provide students with a digitized academic quality control system using blockchain technology. The ultimate goal of the project is to expand to all universities in this country, encoding university degrees through the Cardano platform. The e-learning platform will be interactive and demonstrate that E-learning is not an obstacle for learners to gain social skills, but also promotes educational development as well as solving employment problems for students.\nThese solutions are perfectly suited to accomplish the project's goal: to educate the people of Africa about new technologies and to familiarize themselves with blockchain. To do this, we should apply directly to the problem that Africa is still lacking, losing compared to other countries, that is the illiteracy rate; weak infrastructure, inaccessibility to information; underdeveloped economy. In addition to these issues, I think we should mention one problem is corruption. If Africa wants to grow, corruption must be eliminated so that the budgetary funds work for everyone. If this project can make those budgets transparent, corruption won't be a concern.\nWith an underdeveloped country in terms of economy and information technology like Africa, investing in a large project like Cardano still has risks and the risks mentioned are completely possible. So we need to come up with solutions to overcome these risks: Africa needs to expand government interventions and educational development. It is necessary to add more in terms of quantity and quality of teachers, the curriculum must be consistent in both teaching language and teaching method, and it is necessary to change towards teaching students to be fluent in the national language. Switching to a European language can improve literacy. For starters, the educational content should be simplified as much as possible by teaching students the fundamentals of blockchain technology in a fun and simple way.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I think that the tasks outlined are quite complete, clear and have a specific and reasonable allocation timeline.
