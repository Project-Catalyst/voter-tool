The proposer has clearly and succinctly articulated the importance of the challenge \u2013 and I think that is a good way of doing it. The proposer states that the challenge wants to avoid centralization by promoting diversity of dReps and to promote higher voter delegation in order to ensure the system is functional. Great insight there. The definition of success is a bit less convincing to me as it includes some metrics such as 200+ dReps from 100+ countries have participated \u2013 although it is currently difficult to predict is that achievable and whether a key measure of decentralization should be the national affiliation of dReps (although it is one of many valid measures). Fortunately, in the challenge brief, the proposer also includes other metrics about the diversity of dReps. As regards the second definition of success \u2013 I presume that \u201850%+ of the voters are voting \u201ccarefully\u201d\u2019 means that voters are delegating their votes to dReps or voting directly, however \u2013 this might be clarified a bit, if this challenge proposal is not accepted this round and is resubmitted.

This would be expected as this is a relatively niche category \u2013 so that doesn\u2019t surprise me. However, it does indicate that it might be too early to do a repeat of the same challenge, if interest for the previous challenge was relatively lower. Furthermore, the dReps system has yet to be launched and there is no indication that the previous challenge for dRep improvement and onboarding will not provide sufficient results. The previous challenge had a larger budget and is attracting proposals. Hence, it might be overkill to launch a back-to-back challenge to achieve something that might be resolved with the first challenge.

Some metrics seem more general like \u201cHow many dReps were onboarded?\u201d Also, the timeline of the challenge implementation will  probably coincide and overlap in great measure with the dRep onboarding process and the previous Fund 9 dRep challenge, making it very complicated to verify whether this challenge will have the desired effect or whether it is the effect of the previous  challenge for dReps \u2013 or whether it was the natural outcome of a well-organized dRep onboarding process.
