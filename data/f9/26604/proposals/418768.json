The price drop and the bear market weakened companies (as Celsius and BlockFi), Venture Capitals (as 3 Arrows Capital) and protocols (as Terra/Luna) that were leveraged and with bad financial conditions, this caused thousands of users to lose large amounts of money and this has consequently brought greater scrutiny and negative visibility to some sectors of the blockchain space. This problem causes greater pressure for government regulatory bodies around the world to increase rigidity and compliance for non-decentralized companies and protocols.\n\nOne of the best examples I can give about the pressure that the crypto space has been under is that in 2021, the SEC opened an investigation (https://blockworks.co/report-sec-investigating-defi-exchange-uniswap/) against Uniswap, which is one of Ethereum's supposedly more decentralized protocols, this could be an attempt by the SEC to make Uniswap an example and thereby intimidate new developers from building software and companies in the blockchain space. We need people who can defend the interests of developers and companies in the blockchain space and this challenge would allow support towards Cardano.\n\nDozens of countries around the world are developing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), some are already applying pilots and by observing all these factors together we see that the scenario for the development of startups/companies and financial investments is more complicated, there is uncertainty for entrepreneurs and developers.\n\nHaving to deal with the additional problem of regulation ends up taking the focus away from developers. It is not productive to have to create a team of lawyers to deal with regulatory and legal issues. In addition, each jurisdiction has a different regulatory approach, so this challenge can mitigate these problems and make the funded projects focus on developing their product without having to waste excessive time and resources on the bureaucratic part.\n\nBecause of this scenario I see that this challenge has great potential to contribute to the Cardano mission, the moment is very propitious and because of that my score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Legal & Financial Implementations challenge was previously proposed and was approved in Fund8 and funded in Fund9. 49 proposals were created under the challenge in F9, so there is considerable demand.\n\nThis challenge has a large area of \u200b\u200boverlap with the former Lobbying for favorable legislation challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26446/stage/stage-governancephase151c10/ideas/unspecified) that was present in Funds 7 and 8 and presented reasonable demand from proposals and interested people. In F7 there were 18 proposals submitted, 14 approved and 7 funded and in F8 there were 23 proposals submitted, 22 approved and 12 funded.\n\nThe fact that Cardano is a blockchain that integrates identity and presents a more present compliance approach than the vast majority of other blockchains makes Cardano position itself in a more integrative and less combative way to regulatory bodies and this can serve as a tool integrative approach with governments, this can already be seen in the progress that Cardano has made in Africa, as in the case of the partnership to use the ATALA Prism with students in Ethiopia.\n\nThis positioning of Cardano means that there is greater potential for work in this niche of legal implementations, which is a factor to be considered for the feasibility of the challenge.\n\nWhile the points cited above indicate that there are people in the Cardano community to fill this niche, the nature of the challenge and reliance on government regulations poses many imponderables. which brings uncertainty about the ability of the Cardano community to bring viable and effective solutions. In many cases, regulations are made precisely to curb the development of a niche.\n\nAmerica COMPETES Act is a good example of recent unfavorable regulation in the US government. This article explains more about it (https://www.coincenter.org/new-bill-would-hand-treasury-blank-check-to-ban-crypto-at-exchanges/#:~:text=In%20brief %2C%20it%20would%20hand,power%20the%20Department%20should%20)\n\nCharles also commented about this in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2IP9ApZuUU\n\nThe point is that governments have political and financial interests that often go in the opposite direction to the interests of blockchain projects, especially when we think about financial sovereignty and social control. Today, several countries are studying and applying CBDC pilots. Public blockchains like Cardano can be seen as an opposition and competitor. As much as Cardano was conceived as a blockchain that allows integration with identity and less friction with governments, it is unrealistic to think that governments of powerful countries give up sovereignty to integrate public blockchains at first. It is natural that this occurs in countries that have more to gain and less to lose, such as underdeveloped countries. And to signal this, just look at IOG's efforts to focus on Africa or even the revolution that the government of El Salvador has made with Bitcoin.\n\nI cited these aspects as they can limit the feasibility of legal support in many jurisdictions, which ends up limiting the feasibility of the challenge. Despite this, Cardano is one of the best positioned (perhaps the best) blockchains to champion favorable regulations.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success for this challenge is clear and will facilitate the creation of proposals aligned with the concept.\n\nFour solid and relevant metrics were defined for evaluating the impact, usability, scalability and adaptability of the proposals, but there is no temporal indicator, which makes the performance evaluation more subjective. The proposals created in this challenge in theory could successfully meet all four key items presented, but without a time factor, the auditability of the challenge over time becomes ineffective and the outcome of the challenge would end up with no clear outcome. I would recommend setting a time window for the four items to be checked, or checkpoints over time. (e.g. 3/6/12 months after funding).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 7, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3280, "q0": "In regards to Fund 10 goals, this proposal exhibits the following characteristics:\n\n1) Prepare people to contribute: there is excellent alignment on this point, I feel, because they are targeting two cohorts who need this preparation.   The first cohort is proposers who need education on frameworks and process so that they can be ready for their funding, and the second cohort is the educators and builders of these frameworks and processes, who need guidance to find and service this community.  It is \"bridge building\" by any other name, and with core Swarm veterans behind the challenge, you know that this bridge building is The Way.\n2) Opensource: no really specific descriptions here related to this, however the very idea of creating these educational frameworks implies open standards.  they also request that proposers consider issues like scalability and interoperability, which also implies the power of opensource.\n3) Real world solutions: also an area of excellent alignment, given that we are talking about regional law and financial consequences.  The kind of guidance envisioned by this challenge also gives rise to things like working groups that can eventually provide data and inform processes for changing regulatory environments, so we see both long and short term goals being met here.\n4) Improve tooling and UX for humans: good implicit alignment, with a few notes here and there that strongly correlate, since any tools that make funded Catalyst proposals more likely to achieve success would align with this goal.\n\nDue to very good alignment in multiple areas, I feel this proposal should receive full marks for alignment:  5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "If there is an issue with this challenge setting, it is that there is a need to engage a community of participants that is few and far between in Catalyst: professionally trained and educated specialists from finance and law, in particular lawyers and accountants.  Whenever I see these kinds of promising skillsets in the community, they are always tightly bound to projects (often as founders and cofounders).  I believe this is because the sectors they service are so disrupted by the nature of blockchain, that these skillsets can't really enter the ecosystem without being changed by it.\n\nBecause of that factor, I would anticipate that the participation target here may be off-center and ultimately less than fruitful.  I do feel that there is enough space provided here to sort of draw in proposals in a more scattershot way, so there is definitely potential.  I expect that a lot of the draw will be to those with ideas or who need the services suggested, but that lack the high level skills and knowledge needed, so there will be many suggestions for basically mini versions of this challenge setting, searching for the bridges that actually link that skill to this community.  I feel what is missing is some support and guidance for how to be bridge builders to things like schools and vocations, and to better standardize the types of legal and financial support being sought.\n\nWithin the scope laid out, the budget seems perfectly reasonable, and I think there is a solid basis for proposers and ideas to orient themselves to the challenge.  However I am removing one star due to there not being quite enough support for a wider scope to the challenge, which would bring it more within the actual capacity of the community to address. 4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics provided highlight what I am saying about the scope of the challenge setting.  All the metrics are built around the idea that the solutions sought are \"out there\" and we just need dedicated space for them to present themselves.  As I indicated earlier, I think the issue here is deeper than that, and that we are actually being challenged for how to build bridges between the ecosystems before we start seeing solutions transported across.  I would have liked to have seen some metrics that described the success of projects that were setting out to *look* for these solutions, or to connect things like student communities or legislative working groups.\n\nBecause the guidance and support provided by the included metrics will be able to help proposers with specific solutions to tune their ideas to quality objectives, I feel there is a good foundation for verifiability here.  However, because the scope of the proposals under this umbrella are limited and under-served by the chosen metrics, I am removing 1 star for verifiability.  4 stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 99, "q0": "The team behind this proposed challenge setting has posed a relevant Challenge question \u2013 \u201cHow can we build effective solutions to explore and provide legal & financial services and support to funded Proposers?\u201d. It is clear that most proposers do face legal issues and there are some (a lot?) financial limitations facing proposers regarding the exchange rate of the ADA that they receive, tax implications, payments and disbursements for services and team members. I remain doubtful whether this Catalyst challenge can provide critical feedback in the form of solutions that will support funded proposers across the globe [addressing only legal services here], especially in smaller or less developed countries, as Cardano is a global platform. What might emerge is a two-tier legal services support system where some proposers in more developed constituencies end up receiving legal services support \u2013 and others in marginal constituencies who do not. The alignment with the Fund 9 goals seems especially good with Fund 9 goals 1, 3 and 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Catalyst community will be able to address this challenge in certain jurisdictions, but I am doubtful that the Catalyst community currently has the capacity to resolve legal issues for the majority of people and proposers on the edges of our system. There are many countries where there is a lot of legal uncertainty that cannot be resolved even with good will and experts \u2013 just because the state-of-play is such that crypto is not an established industry and Proof of Stake has specifics of its own, not to mention the impending use of stable coins such as Djed. Just look at the problems that IOHK has in trying to advance a favourable and clear legal framework for Proof of Stake systems in the US legislature and the uncertainties regarding taxation and financial implications. The proposed budget of ADA500,000 for this challenge seems to be too high for a challenge that is still exploring (in my view) whether such \u201ceffective solutions to explore and provide legal & financial services and support to funded Proposers\u201d can be provided. Hence, I retain some doubt whether it is feasible to wisely use that amount of Catalyst funding for what seems to me to be a very wicked problem \u2013 due to its global nature, legal and financial complexity, fast changing landscape and due to the distributed nature of our entire Catalyst community. If this proposal is resubmitted I would advise the proposers to try a little less ambitiously in terms of budget, which would increase the feasibility of using the funds wisely in my view. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team behind this challenge has developed four metrics that are in my view relatively good to measure the ultimate effect of the challenge. It is not easy to measure the progress in this type of a non-technical challenge, so kudos to the team for thinking about the available pathways to do it. The Use Case metric (how many teams are using it) is a good one and I would also advise (if the challenge is resubmitted in the next Fund) a relative metric that would be a percentage measurement of how many teams of proposers are using these tools and solutions relative to the total number of proposing teams that were funded. Not sure about how would the Impact metric be measured \u201cHow many of these new implementations are mutualistic to funded proposals?\u201d \u2013 what does mutualistic here mean? Effectively this sounds like a very similar metric to the Impact metric (or else I didn\u2019t understand the difference). The scalability is a very good metric \u2013 and it would probably be best to measure it as effective scalability (how many proposers are really using a single solution) \u2013 not potential scalability (as everything has \u201cpotential\u201d, but things tend to crumble during implementation). Finally, the Adaptability metric \u2013 or can these solutions and services be used anywhere in the world. I think that last one is key for a successful challenge and should probably (if the challenge is not funded this time around) \u2013 be part of the challenge brief. Namely, initially the development of these tools and services should not lead to further divisions that will result in proposer teams that have great Catalyst-funded legal and financial tools and proposer teams that do not have the same tools and services.

As someone who has no financial background, which to my understanding is something that various funded proposals also have in common, having access to financial services would free up a lot of time, therefore as the project lead can then focus on delivering all the KPI's.\n\nFrom another perspective, although I have no experience yet that concerns legality of having a blockchain base start-up, it indeed is a growing discussion internally in the Cardano community but also externally in the general blockchain start-up community. The growth of the industry outpaces the relating government's appetite to formulate regulations that protect and serves the players in this industry.\n\nA particular government may not even have the human resources to formulate a regulation. This is where this Challenge Setting can shine. Perhaps ones government or it's representative can issue a call to collaboration to the community through a proposal for the creation of open-source regulatory sandbox.\n\nWith that said, as the industry grows, this Challenge Setting will become more crucial and demands more funding allocation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From the perspective of the financial aspects, Cardano already has a community that provides financial services in the form of the Treasury Guild (if I am not mistaken). Where these individuals provide financial management services to funded proposers for a percentage of the managed assets. Having this Challenge Setting provides these individuals with funds to further complement, develop and or refine their services.\n\nWhile from the perspective of the legal implementations there are already congregations of individuals from prominent backgrounds as far reaching as the World Bank who are formulation a regulatory sandbox. Again, by having this specific Challenge Setting, it will only accelerate the development process of this individuals. Knowing their reputation they will easily get funded which in return will benefit the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposers followed up their Success criteria -which is straightforward- with simple metrics that directly measures progress.

This is very important since blockchain and cryptocurrencies are relatively new, and most countries still don\u2019t have clear rules about the regulations related to it. This challenge proposal directly addresses Cardano\u2019s goal of help building real world applications, since the implementation of many projects that use blockchain wouldn\u2019t be possible if the government, for example, doesn\u2019t accept or recognize blockchain related activities. Also, it allows people with different specialties to be onboarded to Catalyst and Cardano and find clients in the ecosystem.

Although, we still don\u2019t have the results of this fund to know how many proposals were approved by the community and how many were successful as well. I believe there are enough people in the community either able to submit proposals themselves, or at least to onboard new community members to tackle these issues, especially because many projects in Catalyst are currently struggling with either legal or financial challenges.

Most funded proposals would benefit from easy to use legal and financial help as many of them do not know it works. This challenge will help break the barriers of legal compliances which in turn should give project owners the time to focus on development. I think that this challenge can be considered as critical to achieve the Cardano mission and fulfill the strategic goal of improving the catalyst human processes. Catalyst is a big part of the Cardano ecosystem. It is really important to focus on challenges like this that help the proposers get more done quicker without any road blocks. Proposers are the most important piece of the catalyst ecosystem because they are the actual builders. That\u2019s why the proposition of this challenge is really important as it will simplify certain tasks for them. On the other side, this challenge will bring a new category of builders in the ecosystem. In fact accountants and lawyers will be needed to achieve the challenge goals. These layers and accountants will help proposers build the financial framework needed in the Cardano ecosystem.

However, the challenge proposer could have done a better job by giving some examples of projects that proposers can focus on. This is because the challenge is a little vague in this area. It\u2019s definitely something that can be improved in this challenge in case it doesn\u2019t get funded this round. Now crypto in itself is not regulated adequately, so it\u2019s complicated to know exactly what to do if you are a new entrepreneur. Furthermore, geography is a part of the equation as law and regulations are different in each country. The proposers of this challenge have a great task on their hands. They have to come up with great solutions that can benefit anyone regardless of the location. As you may know, Cardano is a melting pot where people from all around the world come to join forces in order to collaborate and build together. Accountants and lawyers are needed in this challenge. They will have to collaborate with developers to solve these problems for the community. An example that can be taken as inspiration is the stripe atlas which allows anyone to build a company in the United states from anywhere in the world.

The challenge proposers have decided to measure the number of funded proposals that use the services created in this challenge as metrics of success. Potential proposers have to keep in mind on ways that will attract funded proposals to use their services. The potential proposers have also to think about the impact that their solution will have on the funded proposals. Can you solution allow new funded proposals to expand and reach new levels thanks to your services? Each potential proposer on this challenge should ask this question when submitting proposals for this challenge. Another area where the potential proposers of this challenge have to focus on is scalability. Now keep in mind that not every business is scalable. Some are and some are not. The important thing is to know beforehand if your service is scalable and act accordingly. The challenge proposers want to measure scalability by 10X, 100X and even 1000X. Last but not least, future proposals should think about adaptability. They will have to ask themselves if this service provided will be usable anywhere in the world?
