This challenge as formulated seems not to be critical in my view to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission. The Challenge Brief in my view seems to be a bit overly specific as it presupposes a specific method of rewarding great Cardano open-source contributors. This is a challenge, not a proposal \u2013 but the Challenge Setting here veers into very specific solutions. \nThe brief seems to verge away from a classical challenge that will invite proposers to submit their own ideas how to reward great Cardano open-source contributors \u2013 and instead the challenge already gives a prescribed solution. \u201c A person or organization can either be nominated or self nominated during the proposal submission phase. Additional information can be added to provide a link to their code repository that has been made available through an open source public license. Voting will be done during the voting phase with only the top 4 nominations awarded a prize of 25K Ada each. \u201d.  \nThis is a challenge setting exercise and as such the Challenge should not distribute the budget beforehand, as this limits the proposers in the future challenge. If the challenge is not approved in this Fund, I would advise the proposer to resubmit it \u2013 but leaving the door open to all future proposers to think of how they would address the question. \nEven if the solution stays as proposed, then it would have been good to find an explanation why the award of ADA25,000 to each of four winners would be seen as a good Catalyst investment at this moment. I question whether money could be better spent. This could be explained in more detail if this proposal is resubmitted next fund. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "On the surface, I would think that the Catalyst and Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge, namely the organizing a vote and distributing the budget. Yet, there are some problems that complicate things. The proposer has not given sufficient details of this suggested Cardano Open Source Hall of Fame \u2013 and what is it. This might be confusing to proposers in Fund 10, if this challenge is approved. Different proposers may have different visions of the Cardano Open Source Hall of Fame \u2013 possibly leading to different interpretations and overlap or not. The proposer of this challenge also specifies that \u201cAs an added bonus, I will create a plutus smart contract that allows the name of a person or organization to only be added once to the Hall of Fame smart contract, which will be recorded on the Cardano blockchain.\" Due to this addition, it seems that the proposer of the Challenge is also an implementer of part of the challenge \u2013 which seems to be blurring the line between challenge setting and regular challenges/proposals. If resubmitting, I would advise the proposer to submit either a Challenge Setting idea or an implementation proposal for Cardano Open Source Hall of Fame \u2013 under a different challenge. As it stands now, it seems to be a proposal that is partly Challenge/ partly implementation proposal", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer has set metrics for his challenge \u2013 but they seem to be metrics for positive open source impact leading to the introduction of people into the Cardano Open Source Hall of Fame. \nThe proposed metrics are \n\u2022\tNumber of github forks, clones, and traffic for an open source repository\n\u2022\tCommunity involvement (discord, telegram, cardano stack exchange, youtube, twitter, etc.)\n\u2022\tOpen-source project proposals in Project catalyst\nAs it stands now, I am not sure exactly how can proposers submit any proposals in this challenge. \nThe budget of ADA100,000 has been pre-distributed to top 4 nominations awarded a prize of $25K each. \nThe metrics for introduction into the pre-defined solution \u201cCardano Open Source Hall of Fame\u201d have been published. What can Fund 10 proposers really do under a challenge like this \u2013 where the budget is pre-allocated by the Challenge. There is effectively no budget available for proposers in Fund 10. \nThis is - in my view - not really a Challenge Setting \u2013 but an implementation proposal that seems to have missed its niche. It could have been submitted to another specific challenge in Fund 9 \u2013 and then implemented. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 21, "ne": 7, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 141, "q0": "The development of open source code is critical for any public blockchain that intends to be decentralized, after all one of the characteristics for decentralization is to have a diverse community of core developers and with that to distribute the risks and dependence on specific people.

Although, I think the minimum number of nominees would be achieve and most probably surpassed. On the other hand, there are some things that should be mentioned in the challenge brief, in terms of guidance for not only the nomineed, as it was done, but also for the challenge team and the proposal assessors. In this case, the PAs wouldn\u2019t be assessing the candidates using the usual criteria, but they would be responsible to verify that the number provided are true, for example.

At last, the requested budget is 100k ADA, and depending on ADA price, it\u2019s not going to be $100k, which seems to be the most probable scenario.

However, new developers are unlikely to be incentivised by this type of rewarding mechanism per se as the distance to become a top-4 is likely (perceived and actually) relatively high. In a similar vein, this is not directly preparing a group of people to contribute as the target audience are already people who contribute, and it is a reward that is given post-ex (when contributions have already been made, implying they did not do it for the chance of winning). It is also not a real-world solution nor does it improve the human processes in Catalyst.  \n\nUltimately, the aligment value stems only from the extent new or existing developers see this as an additional incentive for them to contribute more/work for the ecosystem.

The challenge setting does not address the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem) because its only purpose is to reward 4 individuals/groups with 25k ADA each for being contributors to the open-source nature of Cardano. Unfortunately, this challenge setting has no relevance to preparing a group of people to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe challenge setting does not address the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract more developers) for the same reason as above. The entire premise of the challenge setting does not address the strategic goal. Allowing people to nominate those they think should enter the open source hall of fame does nothing to attract developers or contribute to the open-source nature of the Cardano blockchain. The proposer aims to reward people for already having done something to contribute to the open-source nature of Cardano, instead of doing something in the future.\n\nThe challenge setting does not address the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) because it is only rewarding people for already having contributed to making Cardano more open-source, instead of encouraging people to build real-world solutions. No real-world solutions will come out of this challenge setting, only rewarding 4 people for having already made contributions.\n\nLastly, the challenge setting does not address the fourth strategic goal (improve the tooling to support human processes of Catalyst) because there is no reference at all to Catalyst in the proposal. I do not see any way of tying this challenge setting into Catalyst or the human processes behind it.\n\nThis challenge setting proposal seemed more like a normal proposal, instead of a challenge setting.

Most of the Cardano community is concerned with building the Cardano ecosystem and making real-world impacts, instead of squandering precious time nominating people to be rewarded for making open-source contributions. Most of the Cardano community members I interact with on a daily basis would not see the point in dedicating 100K ADA towards a challenge setting that would not yield any meaningful impact on the blockchain. 100K ADA is a lot of money that could be better spent elsewhere on actual development processes, such as DApps, integrations, or even research into new ideas. As a result, the budget is neither realistic nor reflective of the requirements of the challenge. A significantly lower budget for this challenge could be justifiable, but 100K seems way too high for something that is just a reward for people. In the future, I would recommend that the proposer pick a smaller budget for this challenge setting, like 10K ADA.
