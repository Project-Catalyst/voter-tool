The optimizations delivered to Cardano (still referring to the Goguen stage) with Alonzo and the imminent integration with Vasil, allow the blockchain to have better scalability, but the future of scalability in Cardano goes through the Basho phase and the scalability it will bring through Hydra. After Vasil HFC, the focus to advance Hydra development increases and the demand for scalability is high. I believe this is the best possible time to present this challenge, as scalability is a hot and necessary topic in the development of Cardano's Basho phase. Adding this to the fact that Cardano's development is increasingly influenced by the community, through CIPs, tools and governance, I believe that bringing greater community integration into Hydra's development and integration is essential in Cardano's mission. This challenge setting is directly aligned with 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals (items 1, 2 and 3) which highlights its degree of urgency and importance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although we have not yet seen any related-themed challenges in previous funds, which makes it more difficult to quantify the demand for the proposed challenge, the concept of scalability brought by the Basho phase is only a few months old and until now was not a priority that justified an unique challenge. The previous focus was to build the solid foundation for smart contracts with the Goguen phase. That said, we don't have a previous parameter for comparison in Catalyst, but we can evaluate the demand potential by the guiding directions mentioned in the challenge setting.\n\nThis challenge setting has a wide scope, solutions dedicated to scalability improvements through the Hydra head can have a great variety, as scalability is a desirable feature in many types of dapps, as can be seen in the potential directions mentioned in the challenge brief.\n\n Due to the wide range of potential directions, I believe that the community has full capacity to develop proposals in quantity and quality, in fact, several projects already need to optimize their applications for better scalability and others are waiting for the delivery of Vasil's optimizations to be feasible.\n\nThis challenge can be seen as an incentivized testnet for the Cardano community to test and develop dapps, frameworks, tools, documentation and other activities necessary for the integration of Hydra Head into the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success in this challenge is clear and very positive. Cardano's development has been increasingly distributed among people outside the IOG, the community is taking on a more relevant role and this challenge would allow a greater integration of the community in the Hydra roadmap and in the joint development between IOG and the community (individual contributors or companies/ protocols).\n\nThe suggested key metrics are relevant for evaluating the performance of the proposals and the integration of the community in the development of Hydra. My only suggestion is the inclusion of key temporal metrics, in order to establish a time horizon, so that the key metrics already established can be measured over time and this can be more clearly translated into a successive outcome or not.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 427, "q0": "this challenge proposal meets the alignment criteria for Cardano catalyst with room to spare. the proposal very carefully outlines the goal to onboard developers with Hydra, an infrastructure improvement that will greatly improve the power of Cardano to run useful transactions. specifically temporary side chains for any number of uses, governance, complex contracts that don't fill up blocks with data that doesn't need to be preserved, and more. additionally, the challenge specifically seeks to onboard developers into the open-source Hydra layer 2 protocol, certainly meeting the open-source metric. \n\nany proposals under this challenge would by their nature meet the real-world applications criteria, as each one would be a real-world project incorporating layer 2 solutions on Cardano. \n\nthe challenge even meets the tooling metric in that any wide-scale use of hydra is, by its very nature, going to include tooling and educational elements to bring them to fruition.\n\nlastly, the proposal is being brought by IOHK themselves. this fact conveys a very high standard for meeting the alignment criteria all by itself.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "the project seems eminently feasible. the budget of 1 million ADA is very reasonable and in line with successful challenges in the past, leaving plenty of budgets to fund other challenges in fund 10 while still providing room for successful and challenging projects to meet the strict criteria for this technically imposing challenge.\n\nthe Cardano development community has demonstrated many times over the last 9 challenges that they possess the willpower, interest, and most of all the technical savvy to bring very interesting and fascinating proposals to close out and powerful tools into being from the goals of this challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The verifiability of this challenge is very good. being a technical/developmental subject dealing with the Layer 2 implementation on Cardano (Hydra) the criteria available to judge and drive proposal competitiveness is very strong.

Therefore this challenge is likely to engage a large number of voters, and developers, and will help springboard Cardano adoption. \n\nWhen smart contracts were first launched on Cardano there was a lot of community hype, followed by some disappointment when people realized it would still take a significant amount of time for projects to develop their smart contracts and start delivering usable apps. \n\nThis challenge can help us avoid that same mistake with Hydra by boosting development activity. Now that we are well into the Basho scaling era, the community is excited to see the potential of Hydra, however we need to incentivize developers and companies to begin using this new technology. https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/how-were-scaling-cardano-in-2022\n\nAs explained in the proposal \"This challenge, proposed by IOG, serves to direct development priorities towards uncovering, analyzing, and validating new Hydra-enabled business models, as well as to improve the experience of developing DApps that will rely on Hydra.\" This is where the power of open source (and this challenge incentive) can unleash the power of multiple developers experimenting, discovering, and implementing new use cases for Hydra layer 2 protocols. \n(My only concern here, is that it is unclear to me if there will be Ada incentives going back to Kris and/or IOHK if this challenge setting is voted in by the community.)

The challenge budget is large enough to encourage both large comprehensive proposals from established companies and solution providers, and also fund a wide variety of smaller proposals from independent developers and contributors. The challenge is both broad in scope, as Hydra has many potential applications, but also helps to focus the community on one specific aspect of Cardano scaling technology, and leveraging the unique opportunities Hydra presents to see it reach it's maximum potential. The challenge was provided by Kris Baird of IOHK, so the challenge team will be Kris and the IOHK hydra team. https://iohk.io/en/team/kriss-braid \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics included will help to verify success of the challenge, and will encourage competition between the proposals. For example the metrics below can be quantified and verified, but they are also broad in scope so there are many potential proposals that could be developed to fit this challenge, each serving different needs but still related to Hydra solutions. For example, see the metrics included in the proposal below:\n\n\"Developers have resources needed to integrate Hydra into their applications (e.g developer tools and frameworks, example applications, case studies, documentation, training content)\n\nImproved understanding of business models and scenarios that can benefit from the Hydra technology framework, starting with the Hydra head protocol and matching the Hydra roadmap beyond it\n\nDeveloper community on Cardano is engaged and actively contributing to the core Hydra technology stack and supporting tools, frameworks, and documentation\n\nCommercial solutions using Hydra head protocol deployed in the Cardano mainnet\"\n\nFor these reasons I think this proposal is rated 5/5 for verifiability. The challenge setting is also clearly aligned with the fund 9 strategic coals listed below with my comments in brackets:\n\"Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem. (by incentivizing them with this challenge)\n\nTurn Cardano into an open source project & attract more developers. (Incentivizing open source contributions with this challenge)\n\nBuild real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain.

This challenge touches at least 3 out of the 4 strategic goals specific to fund9. Hydra being one of the major parts of the Cardano scaling solution, it is critical to start thinking about all the use cases and benefits that we can get from it. That\u2019s why, the challenge is calling out developers and businessmen of the ecosystem to provide real world implementations of the hydra. There should be many businesses that can benefit from hydra as it should enable more speed which should translate into a better user experience, and lower fees. Moreover, as specified in the strategic goals, Cardano is aiming to be an open source project. We need to attract more developers into the ecosystem. For that to happen, we will have to set up a great environment that gives developers all the tools they need to make building dapps easy. That\u2019s why the challenge is also about building tooling and documentations that will make it easy to create hydra ready solutions. So, I think that scaling the network is a must and, with the Vasyl hardfork around the corner, this challenge should boost the Cardano scaling era and make this a thriving ecosystem. I also think that the proposer has done a great job by suggesting the type of businesses that can really benefit from hydra. For example, payment systems such as micro-payment, in-game payments and more, can get the best out of hydra. Hydra can also be used on NFT drops which often require high speed and large throughputs to handle the participants.  I think that the community will take from there, and with great imagination, come up with the best solutions for hydra use cases.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community will surely be able to address this challenge. There are already a lot of great developers and business men that can come up with real world hydra solutions. With this amount of talent in the ecosystem, there is enough room to find great real world implementation of hydra. I think that new businesses can emerge and existing businesses can be developed by the community. Cardano already has a lot of dapps that are not released yet. There lending platform, NFTs, metaverses, gaming, wallets and more. All these dapps can benefit from hydra especially when the user base grows exponentially. Adoption is inevitable in the Cardano ecosystem and this will require solid platforms that can handle all the transactions with a great user experience. In order to offer a great user experience, great scaling solutions should be in place as I doubt the main chain can handle billions of users. Not only should we make it easy for the end user, but we also have to give the developers a great environment that will allow them to build easily in the ecosystem. I think that this challenge is setting up the scene to build the tooling than real world solutions to achieve Cardano goal of adoption. The budget of 1000000 usd seems realistic to me as it takes great developers and resources to build all the tooling, documentation and real case dapps needed in the cardano ecosystem. I think that the proposer has done a great job with this challenge and it\u2019s written clearly and should give the community the guidance needed to execute it properly.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has provided clear measures of success for this challenge. I don\u2019t see any ambiguity how the proposer has defined metrics the proposers should look for. The first metric refers to the fact that the proposals should aim at giving developers infrastructures needed to build real world and scalable solutions on hydra. This is related to the tooling and documentation that will facilitate the use of hydra by developers. They also need resources that will facilitate the integration hydra in their applications. After the developers, there are also businesses that need to understand the ins and outs of hydra, in order to plan and design great solutions. By improving the understanding of business models and scenarios in which hydra is beneficial, better solutions can be developed and adoption can be increased as well. The next step is to iterate on the hydra technology by improving it with the help of the community. Encouraging developers to actively participate in the hydra development, by writing codes, building frameworks and adding documentation, is one unit of measure of success of this challenge. Last but not least, the proposer wants to measure the commercial hydra heads deployed on mainnet. This is great and I suggest to the proposer to also measure the user experience as part of the success of the challenge. However, this can be a topic of future challenges, as, at the end of the day, the end user experience is crucial for the Cardano adoption. Altogether, the proposer has done a great job with this challenge setting and I think that it is needed right now in the Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2332", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2729, "q0": "Hydra is one of Cardano's main solutions to speed and scalability. To be able to match the centralized approach of the regular financial system in terms of transaction time and number of transactions, we need to build solutions on top of the base blockchain, Layer 2 solutions. Hydra is a layer 2 solution which offers state channels, where participants can transact outside Cardano (off chain) and then settle those transaction once done on the blockchain. Visa and Mastercard are typical examples of Layer 2 solutions. While Cardano Layer 1 will never reach the millions of transactions per second and fast settlement times required to compete with the regular financial system, a Layer 2 solution like Hydra could theoretically do this. Thus, Hydra is critical for Cardano's mission.\nHowever, it is curious that IOG has proposed this challenge, and not included it explicitly in the strategic goals for fund 10.

If you start here (https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/wiki/Simple-Head-and-Tail) you can then branch out to all the issues faced, conceptual hurdles discovered and clever approaches taken to solving for Hydra.  You can see how they approached studying the Lightning network, and how they applied parallelism to solving for both software and hardware (note: this paralleling of cores is an area that could use study under this challenge setting), among many other topics.  Between the Wiki and the changelog, any user can bring themselves up to speed on the current state of Hydra, and be on the same page as IOG moving forward.\n\nAs mentioned above, scaling is an area of interest and concern for developers on Cardano, made clear in Fund 8, so the $1m budget here is quite reasonable for this mature protocol PoC.

Hopefully, with Hydra's implementation, Cardano will have the fastest TPS and lower transaction fees. In addition, the fastest TPS is also required to compete with the traditional payment systems like Visa or MasterCard.\nThis challenge helps with the strategic goals as it prepares and supports people who will be able and willing to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.
