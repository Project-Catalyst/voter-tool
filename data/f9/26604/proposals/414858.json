So we continue by turning the four strategic goals into fundamental  questions and trying to come up with decent answers. \n\nCan this challenge help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? \n\nSo my take on this is that agriculture can greatly benefit from blockchain applications, but only after critical technologies have already been implemented in sectors where scalability and concrete results arrive faster, perhaps healthcare or global distribution chains.  \n\nCan this challenge turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? Again, this is a mixed bag, since there aren\u2019t very strong connections between developers and the agriculture sector, especially when focusing exclusively on the open source projects. Of course, anecdotic examples can definitely show up here or there, but lacking any evidence of widespread synergies between these two sectors I have to argue that an agriculture challenge is unlikely to attract significant numbers of developers into the ecosystem. \n\nCan this challenge help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? Absolutely, since there aren\u2019t many other sectors getting as real as agriculture does. But what kind of solutions can there be? Are we, as a community, ready to target the average 5 acre farmer and offer solutions for him? I would argue that we can\u2019t just yet, not without risking loss of keys, funds or the need to interact with complicated web applications. We are also still lacking the basic decentralized infrastructure to target the small farmers. DIDs through Atala Prism are still some time away. And so are payments through Coti Pay for instance. And so are user-friendly wallets. And so are open communication systems. Let\u2019s give more time to World Mobile - like technologies to flourish first. So while Cardano agriculture solutions are a beautiful idea. I find it unlikely to create a significant impact, simply because we\u2019re not there yet in terms of supporting infrastructure. \n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? Unlikely, and due to the rather obvious lack of connection between the two subjects I won\u2019t go into additional explanations. \n\nSo while agriculture solutions on the blockchain might seem like a tempting value proposition, I think we are still too early for them and I am only offering three stars for alignment with the strategic goals. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Can the Cardano community address this challenge? I have mixed feelings on whether there is enough capacity to fill the challenge with healthy competition, let\u2019s say 3x its budget. While Fund 9 definitely has a few proposals directly (Algae Rhythm, CO2 capture unit, sustainability index) or indirectly (CH2O Africa) connected to the agriculture sector, I am not sure whether a fully fledged ecosystem already exists to tap into this potentia just yet. If you think about it, agriculture is not the easiest sector to disrupt: it\u2019s at the mercy of the weather in most of the years, progress takes sometimes years to show up due to growth cycles, huge disparities of technological use between countries, vast areas to cover and challenging infrastructure development to name only a few of these headwinds.  \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? I have searched high and low throughout the Fund 8 and 9 proposals to find evidence of potential within the agriculture sector. And there are indeed a number of agriculture related proposals, under ten. A few unsuccessful, four voted four but only two funded so far (supply chain, agriculture and metaverse). So there is at least some potential, but I feel that perhaps a 500k amount would have been a better choice. \n\nIn conclusion, there are some indications that the Cardano community can address this challenge and the budget is fairly feasible, albeit we are unlikely to see strong and healthy levels of competition within the challenge, so four stars.     ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and try to answer it, and this is where it leads us:  \n\n(1) Is the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nI dare to say that not quite, and unfortunately this is the case for many challenge proposals. When defining success metrics and targets one has to pay particular attention to their capacity to be \u201coperationalized\u201d, meaning translated from words into useful, relevant and measurable metrics. Here, success is defined as \u201ccreating a healthy and transparent agricultural chain which will go down in favor of the production, supply and consumer chains\u201d. I find the terminology rather unfortunate and I will only point out to a few flaws, trying not to be very nit-picking: \n\n- A few terminology items bundled together:(1) the circular reference of a chain which goes down in favor of another chain, (2) consumer chain: perhaps distribution chain more appropriate? And (3) going down in favor will be again difficult to translate to a more useful term\n- it will be challenging to measure the \u201chealth\u201d of an ecosystem\n- a few of the following key metrics are very difficult to measure: physical markets (not clear what the term encompasses), producer satisfaction (producers hardly measure or are worried about their satisfaction, if such a thing can be applied to a business, decentralization (of what exactly?)\n\nI humbly offer a few alternative avenues to explore for future iterations: \n\n- measuring the strength of land rights for cadastral solutions (tools already exist and have been widely used to draw connections between how powerful land rights are within a country to the economic welfare of the population\n- measuring the length of the supply chain and the number of intermediaries when blockchain targets a certain crop (we can infer that a blockchain solution that minimizes the number of intermediaries interposed between small scale farmers and consumers will increase farmers\u2019 margins or decrease end prices, all things equal)\n- identifying the emergence of new cross-cutting enablers (access to irrigation, lower transportation costs)\n- concrete new solutions of accessing capital\n- emergence of swarm-like behavior that increases resilience (risk sharing agreements like insurance type products, revenue sharing agreements, crowdsourced negotiated agreements with intermediaries down the value chain, etc.)\n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals? My take on this is rather grim again - since I don\u2019t think there will be enough demand within the category to lead to an optimum level of competition, considering past examples and the quality of the proposals read by me so far. I would have rather started with a lower overall budget, and once a clear sign of healthy competition emerged - that would have been a perfect sign to increase the amounts for future financing rounds.\n\nConsidering all of the above, I have to maintain my neutral stance towards this challenge\u2019s verifiability potential, so only three stars.

As mentioned, the agro industry has many problemas that could be solved by the usage of blockchain, and in many aspects, this is a sub-set a the supplychain and auditing issues that many other indutires also face. The agro industry is especially important in developing countries, located, for example, in South America, Asia and Africa. This would help to onboard and provide opportunities for community members from these places, and also for community members from other places to develop solutions to them. This challenge is very well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10, since it directly tackles the goal of building real-world solution based on the Cardano blockchain. In the past, there has been many proposals submitted in different challenge, especially the dApps & Integrations challenge, there were proposing to solve issues related to the agro industry, and if this challenge gets funded, it\u2019s guaranteed that this sector will have at least some proposals funded and some solutions will be developed. The budget for the challenge, though, seem to be a bit high, but at the same time it wouldn\u2019t be very cheap to develop real world solutions for agro and to integrate them with other parts of the process.

Also, some other projects like DLT360 have been focusing on analyzing the risks and opportunities related to blockchain projects that focus on the agro industry.

While it could likely be a useful challenge setting, and agriculture is a deeply significant sector that deserves specialized focus, it would have been helpful if the proposer had provided some features and characteristics of this challenge setting in regards to each Fund 10 goal.  For example:\n\nFor goal #1, prepare people to contribute, they could have suggested proposals related to education about how the parts of the food supply chain interreact and where opportunities for decentralization lay, or for prioritization of apps and tools specific to small-holders or AG SMEs for onboarding them to blockchain solutions.\n\nFor Goal #2, opensource, they could have included the need for repos for AG specific DAO tooling, or governance and contract templates opensource libraries for adoption at all levels of the supply chain.\n\nFor Goal #3, Real world solutions, it is easy to imagine what could be innovated, but what is needed here are explanations and examples to provide inspiration for proposals and help see where the impact and relevance is for various ideas related to AG.\n\nFor Goal #4, Improve tooling for humans, they could have included guidance on creation of education, documentation and onboarding  mechanisms, and inclusive design principles that make the solutions accessible at different levels of the supply chain.\n\nBecause the proposal can easily be imagined to fit into the Fund 10 goals, but because no specific details were provided to that end, I disagree that this proposals has established good alignment with the goals of the fund.  2 stars.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This is an area where more details, and a longer challenge brief that digs into the problem as presented would have been useful.

What is needed is guidance and support for proposers within this challenge to understand the scope of what is being considered, and to be inspired with examples of the types of proposals that would be accepted under that guidance, and align well with the goals of the community.\n\nWhile the budget seems reasonable given the scope and role of the AG industry as a whole, the lack of the details mentioned above will make it difficult for proposers to orient themselves within it, which puts that much budget at risk of either over or under optimization.  Even if the criteria had been better defined, the newness of this challenge setting (i.e. the need to learn what are the best KPI s and objectives to set, and to clarify its scope) points to lowering the funding into the $500k range which is the norm for feeling out emerging categories over the last few Catalyst funds.\n\nBecause the details provided are only of limited help in guiding proposers in this challenge setting, and because the budget comes in high for such an unexplored area of funding, I disagree that this proposal is Feasible.  2 stars.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The KPIs included are numerous, but could be fleshed out more individually to better understand how they could be used to measure success and help proposers frame objectives under this challenge setting.\n\nFor example, decentralization of the food supply chain is a laudable objective, but how do we measure that?  Can we include under this heading sub-metrics like number of sources of input to individual supply chains (say for coffee beans, to a given smart contract in that market, i.e. how many small-hold farmers are able to combine under a given buyer's quality protocol, which diversifies and strengthens the quality of downstream supply chain?).\n\nAnother example is \"Information Flow\" where it would be nice to know what kinds of objectives might satisfy this metric...real time market updates, consumer access to producer data, etc. would be good places to start.\n\nAll in all this broad category has a future in Catalyst, but in the present more concrete and well characterized KPIs would go a long way towards structuring the challenge.

For the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem), I think that the proposers could have done a better job of including more information or guidance for future proposers. In the challenge setting\u2019s current state, there really isn\u2019t any guidance for proposers besides general problems to address, like fixing 21st century agriculture using blockchain technology (which is very vague and not very useful to a reader). However, people who address this challenge setting can make contributions to the ecosystem by bringing in new customers and use cases for the Cardano blockchain. More context about how blockchain technology can fix the current agricultural problems would have been needed to conclude that this challenge setting addresses the first strategic goal. \n\nFor the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract new developers), I think that this challenge setting only partially addressed it. Firstly, the proposers made no mention at all whether proposers should make their software solutions open-source or not. I could see a case where this challenge setting attracts some new developers to build the solutions people come up with, but the agriculture area is not necessarily the biggest growth area for blockchains in the current moment. As a result, it may be hard to attract developers to this challenge setting and Cardano as a whole if the guidance is very sparse.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) because the outcomes of addressing the agriculture industry could have the impact of improving the production chain, the supply chain, and the consumer chain (according to the proposers). Fixing the problems with food production can have long lasting impacts on people around the world. It could help solve the food security crisis and also reduce waste. The possibilities for real-world impact are huge.\n\nThe challenge setting does not address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst) at all. Since this challenge setting is specifically targeting an off-chain sector, it has no impact on Catalyst whatsoever. If the proposers could have addressed how this challenge setting could improve human processes on Catalyst, it would have greatly improved the proposal.

However, there will definitely be lower interest in this challenge setting than for other challenges because the agriculture sector is not a huge priority for growth on Cardano. Over the past 3 funds, I do not recall seeing any challenges specifically targeting agriculture. I only saw a few proposals in various categories that could maybe fall under this challenge had it existed. As a result, I do not know if there will be enough developers and community members to fully address this challenge setting. If there were more examples from past funds of Cardano being used to address the agriculture sector, I would be able to say that the Cardano community could address the challenge, but that isn\u2019t the case.\n\nAs for the budget, I think that 800,000 ADA seems a bit high. I did not see any reasoning provided in the proposal as to why this budget was requested. Additionally, based on my previous comments that there might not be too much interest in the challenge setting, I don\u2019t see how there would be enough proposals to use up 800,000 ADA worth of funding. I think the proposers could have chosen a slightly smaller budget for this challenge setting because of the lower interest in it.

I don\u2019t see how metrics like these could help many future proposers because there is no indication of how one could measure success using those metrics. How exactly can one measure success with information flow? Are the proposers supposed to increase information flow? Streamline information flow? For all of the metrics provided, the proposers should include some more context on how those metrics can constitute success. A good way to address the point I just mentioned, the proposers could have added something to the effect of \u201cimprove information flow between producers and suppliers.\u201d Anything that provides more clear information as to how success can be measured would have made the challenge setting more clear. In its current form, the challenge setting\u2019s metrics of success for its single focus area of agriculture are not as well defined as they could be.

Because of this point, I am rating four stars. \n\nThe author did not provide any details about the challenge team, and as this challenge was not selected by Catalyst earlier, there is no challenge team available. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The author defines success as the 'creation of a more healthy & transparent agricultural chain.' This definition and the metrics mentioned in the challenge are somewhat vague but can be utilized to measure the challenge's success. \n\nThe author did not mention metrics to measure proposals' success separately. Still, auditors can use some of those vague metrics (transparency & traceability) to evaluate proposals' success. \n\nOn the other hand, proposers, auditors & other parties also need metrics to track/audit proposals' progress. As these proposals will be developmental, the metrics can be the development updates on platforms such as GitHub or Jira board or via some reports. Therefore there is room for improvement in this challenge. Hence I am rating it four stars.

There are 05 paths in Cardano's mission:\n1-Driving adoption of Cardano\n2-Shaping legislation and commercial standards\n3-Growing the global Cardano community\n4-Ensuring stakeholder accountability\n5-Facilitating partnerships\nI think challenge is more suitable for path number 1. However, Proposals for these challenges can be placed in a category like dApp, DAO or local community rather than creating a separate challenge.

Total funding for 23/107 Agriculture related projects funded in all funds is $645K, while this challenge proposes 800K.

This will allow for the tracking, monitoring, and creation of a marketplace that can supply \"green\" agricultural products to customers all over the world. The implementation of Blockchain technology in agricultural practices has the potential to alter the conventional method of labor while also enhancing the community's familiarity with the Cardano Blockchain. Consequently, this assists farmers in becoming more knowledgeable about Cardano and Blockchain. The issue that you brought up in order to be able to set up a challenge in fund 10 is an important one, and it needs to be solved in this fund specifically.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It can be seen from all of the votes on the websites that Cardano compares all aspects of Cardano with other ecosystems, which is the overwhelming crowding of ecosystems. In point of fact, Cardano's community is quite powerful. and additionally complete faith placed by the community in the natural system. Along with the explosion of decentralized applications (Dapps), products, and a bridge between Ethereum and Cardano, there will be a large number of developers passing through and developing for some other ecosystems because of the low cost as well as the low cost. Cardano's use of POS systems is an example of one of its advantages. Therefore, finding a solution to the problem posed by the challenge is not particularly difficult. A budget of 800,000 ADA for the challenge, which is equivalent to nearly 400,000 USD at the moment when the price of ADA is 0.5 USD, is a reasonable level for developing a large sector such as agriculture at the present time.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Applications that can be applied to agriculture are needed in order for the challenge to be successful for the proponent. The goal of the challenge is to create a clean and transparent agricultural chain. It is necessary to have transparency that is both clear and verifiable in order to link and connect supply chains from production to consumers. The community as a whole places a high value on food, which is why elucidating its provenance and striving toward greater \"greenness\" in food production are among the most pressing concerns. In light of the criteria that will be used to evaluate the success of the proposal, I believe that it is quite reasonable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3497", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "21st century Agriculture is facing a lot of issues that could be solved by blockchain technology through Cardano.", "success": "Creating a more Healthy and transparent Agricultural chain which will go down in favor\n\nthe production chain\nthe supply chain\nconsumer chain\n"}
