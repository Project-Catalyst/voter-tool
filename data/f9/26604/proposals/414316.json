Additionally this will likely result in individuals having more responsibility and accountability, which could lead to them delivering results, as opposed to just waiting for someone else to fix whatever problems may be present in a more decentralized system. However, it's not clear if this idea is 'critical to achieve Cardano's mission'. This is perhaps a controversial idea, as there is some risk of creating a class of Catalyst experts that become deeply entrenched in the system, and this may not be the most efficient solution. This could potentially create more opportunities for corruption or wasted treasury resources. The goal of Catalyst is not to re-create existing governance systems with full time politicians and \"government employees\" but to build something innovative, different, and hopefully a more efficient systems that empowers the end users and Ada holders. This proposal also re-creates a system that is less inclusive of anyone willing to participate, as candidates for the position of Catalyst contributor will be asked to submit their full name, professional background and be judged based on their past performance, job history, education, etc. as opposed to the current system that focuses only on their current contributions to the space. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is potential for this challenge to create a wide range of proposed solutions, but it is also similar too, and overlaps with the Catalyst Circle reps. Results could be delivered within 6 months, but it may take more time for the wider voting community to get used to these new changes. This proposal includes information about changing the Challenge Settings to Funding Categories, which is a different topic than the discussion about funding full time Catalyst contributors. My concern is that for every full time contributor, you also need to fund managers or fund incentives for the community to oversee and audit the work of each individual full time contributor. The proposal includes the statement \"Tracking success for contributors will include improving the reporting process so it becomes easy for the community to understand what each contributor is working on to support the ecosystem.\" in this case first the paid contributors will develop their own reporting processes, and then be required to complete them. There is a possibility for the contributors to create work for themselves that may not benefit the ecosystem for the sole purpose of having something to put on their report to justify their compensation. When incentives are no longer directly related to results, we could inadvertently incentivize unwanted behaviour within Catalyst. In the recent townhall there was discussion of creating a \"catalyst parameter\" that would be used to fund catalyst activities, and this would potentially be a better alternative to align the incentives of all participants than having full time paid contributors who\u2019s true motives and intentions, and results, may be difficult for the community to audit. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics included in the challenge, to determine the success of the challenge are not necessarily aligned with the challenge brief which includes the following guiding questions.\n\nWhat challenges will engage the highest number of voters? - This proposal may engage a high number of voters, but that may be due it's more controversial nature as opposed to it\u2019s necessity or popularity. \n\nWhich challenges, if addressed, will provide a springboard for Cardano adoption? - It is not clear if this challenge would help or hinder Cardano adoption. There are several potential downside risks as I have mentioned in this assessment.\n\nWhich challenges, if addressed, will advance Cardano's mission? Cardano's mission may debatable depending on what community member you ask. However the Cardano.org/governance page says the following:\n\"\nA Model To Marginalize None,\n\nAnd Give Power To All.\n\nOur current systems do not work for everyone. A better, more positive future is possible. If the world is to serve the many, it must be agreed to by the many. Consensus must drive progress and where disagreement occurs, it must drive creative solutions.\"\n\nThis challenge strives to concentrate more decision making power and Ada compensation among a small group of full time Catalyst contributors. Those Catalyst contributors will then have more power than the average ada holder/voter over the future governance model of Catalyst. Therefore one could argue this Challenge is not well aligned with the Cardano Mission to create \"a model to marginalize none and give power to all.\" As it could further marginalize the general ada holders who are not paid as full time contributors.  The same governance page also says \"It is a blueprint for change that is decided by the many, as well as the few, and which will redistribute power, eliminating intermediaries, to improve the lives of all.\" so if one of the goals of Catalyst is to eliminate intermediaries, this challenge is contrary to that goal by creating more intermediaries.

Catalyst has been increasingly embraced by the community since Fund2, and many roles are performed impromptu and without remuneration, this ends up limiting the potential for people to contribute.\n\nThe Catalyst model since Fund2 has been fund proposals, but many Catalyst-related jobs and roles could benefit from a different model. Several roles in Catalyst need flexibility and agility to troubleshoot. In many cases problems arise and a person can simply solve it or wait for the proposal submission period in Catalyst to open, write a proposal, go through the whole process and then maybe receive funding. As a CA and contributor since Fund2 I've seen this happen countless times and luckily the Cardano community doesn't usually expect funding to solve problems, many just do the work and it ends up going unnoticed by many. The point is that we cannot rely only on the generosity of contributors, if we want them to focus on the development of Catalyst, we need to provide financial conditions so that they can have tranquility and due dedication in these activities.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that, today, IOG is responsible for much of the development of Catalyst and if we want to transition to a more distributed model it is important that there are alternative models for hiring contributors. This model of \"hiring\" contributors can be a way to test the transition in Catalyst development and Cardano governance from IOG to the community.\n\nThis challenge clearly aligns with items 1 and 4 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe that this challenge is important in Cardano's mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community has already been filling the roles of contributors and this has gradually increased since Fund2.

The concept for resource allocation took into account the ADA price fluctuation, the key roles to be filled and the priorities of these roles, the market remuneration of these roles according to the OECD. Considering these factors, they arrived at a number of contributors between 9 and 22 for the challenge.

Funded contributors will need to submit weekly reports with data and KPIs. The suggested key metrics associated with the reports and various items mentioned in the definition of success will allow measuring the outcome of this challenge over time in a practical, critical and broad manner.\n\nThe success metrics and definition of success for this challenge are very similar to the Catalyst Contributors challenge, so my assessment will be largely similar.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 3, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 603, "q0": "This proposal has a very different approach in comparison to other \u2018regular\u2019 challenge proposals. Instead of having proposals submitted, it would have candidates running for a position to work full time in Catalyst. The budget would be used to pay their salaries and their contribution would be focused on different aspects of Catalyst: Development, Coordination, Analysis, QA & Auditing, Marketing, Product and Design. I believe the concept behind this challenge is good, and it is fully aligned with improving Catalyst processes, which is one of Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10. Although, there is one thing that decreases the overall trust in the challenge proposal, which is having a lot of information provided as external links, and these are editable even after the refining phase of Catalyst of closed. This may cause trouble with PAs assessing and with the execution of the proposal in the future, since it would be difficult to track exactly what was presented for this Fund and what was possibly modified afterwards. It is understandable due to the amount of information included here, but I would have preferred to see this information in the attachments of the proposal, for example. Additionally, I didn\u2019t find the information about duration of these mandates.

The first topic is about the kind of proposals to be submitted. Since instead of projects, people would be submitting themselves as candidates, everything in the assessing stage is going to be different. There is some guidance on how to assess the candidates - even though this is included as an external page and could be modified in the future, which is not ideal -, but we know from previous experience that having specific assessment guidelines for different challenges causes a lot of friction. The example is the Challenge Setting challenge, which always has a lot of assessments filtered out because PAs don\u2019t understand correctly how to assess proposals there, and in this case the challenge is recurrent since the beginning of Catalyst. Also, the guidelines have some rules such as auditability shouldn\u2019t be 1 or 2 to any candidate, but I believe some PA would give this score and it wouldn\u2019t be removed in the QA stage, which would cause disturbance in the whole process. The budget of 1.1M ADA, which might be close to $500k if the price of ADA doesn\u2019t change until results are tallied, is good but I believe it\u2019s too high for a first iteration of this challenge. I would believe that this challenge would be less risky if the budget requested was lower, and if all the information was provided as attachments instead of external links, to guarantee that the provided information hasn\u2019t changed.

Since the scope is very open, the elected contributors could almost propose and execute anything related to their roles, and I don\u2019t believe this is an issue in itself, but this increases the complexity of auditing their performance, and this should be closely related to the success of this challenge as well. There are some guidelines on how to assess their performance, but I believe this is something that is going to change a lot with time and that should be adapted and evolve as results are shared with the community. Also, I missed some KPIs related to the success of this challenge related to individual success of the contributors, like how many contributors are performing well, above or below expectations, since this would be a good indication of the challenge\u2019s ROI. Other related metrics should also be added to provide more insights about the contributors\u2019 performance. The first KPI provided is too high level in my opinion, \u201cNumber of contributions to support Catalyst\u2026\u201d, and the second, \u201cCommunity support - Conversations with existing projects\u2026\u201d, is not easily measurable.

I see this proposal to challenge as simply the next step in the series of experiments we are doing as a community. This is my fifth fund in Catalyst and I have experienced firsthand the growth and passion of many of the members. Many of them have devoted some of their time and energy to facilitating different discussion spaces, researching different topics, preparing proposals for improvement of the projects in Catalyst, and conducting data consolidations and analyses, among many other things which show the passion of its members. This challenge seeks to attract all these collaborators who in one way or another contribute to the community from their possibilities, to consider being full-time contributors to Cardano. So it is more than obvious where the description of this category and Cardano's mission align.

What is the evidence? In my mind, the proliferation of communication channels, many spaces in twitters, data availability in blockchains, tools and co-creation of documents to improve catalyst processes come to mind. Looking at data in previous funds we can identify consolidated teams in the community that have been operating presenting proposals with the current funding model, for example, SWARM has presented more than 15 proposals in previous funds, QA-DAO who has two funded proposals and Catalyst School has 5 funded proposals. This challenge seeks to strengthen these initiatives by offering an alternative to project based funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For this type of challenge (aka challenge category) the measurements are also expected to be different. In this case it is critical to keep in mind that the nature and range of the services provided can vary considerably. Therefore, it requires weekly progress reports on what they have worked on in the community, as well as KPIs similar to what a standard proposal would include. When assessing the auditability of a proposal, it is important to consider aspects of the types of roles that are performed by community members.

By doing so, this could change the lives of people actively contributing to the ecosystem. It is mission critical to introduce something like this at this time because it corresponds with virtually all of our current strategic goals and the overall mission 'to explore the highest potential of human collaboration'.

If you saw Charles' recent roadmap whiteboard (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwP-omMwd3A) you will recall that he mentioned there would be an opportunity for members of the community to apply for  and be paid for full time work directly from the treasury, so at first glance this seems to be in alignment with that.\n\nBut there are numerous important differences.  The main one is Charles is talking about using  CIPs to establish the process and accountability for things like committees, which is far different from ad hoc community voting and meetings due to the high degree of formality and oversight required for CIPs.  The other difference, also along the lines of formalizing and accountability, is that there is already governance in place with Catalyst for governing the treasury, not so for this category (except what they lean into from Catalyst).\n\nFor this challenge setting, the idea is that any proposals under it will be for 6 month salaries for the proposers ranging from $25k to $60k based on how they describe their role.  Presumably this side treasury would apply to allocate  funding every fund via this challenge setting proposal.\n\nTo the degree that this proposal seeks to align with the long term goals of Catalyst, this is a solid idea.

It is one thing for swarm to hand out 50Ada bounties for timestamping, and quite another to \"hire\" someone for for $50,000 for 6 months.  The problem is that there is no framework for establishing the validity of claims or submissions, the ways in which risk has been anticipated and accounted for, or even a basic code of conduct for participants.  That all of these things can be designed isn't the point either:  none of them have been designed.  6 bullet points don't make a governance framework.\n\nThere is still so much work to do before this experiment should proceed, starting with a formalized code of conduct, an absolute baseline of acceptable behavior from participants in this protocol.  Circlev3 failed to make one, and they got dragged through the gutter because of it (and still haven't recovered).  Imagine if the stakes there had been a million dollars.  Second, a thorough framework for governing the dsibursements of the treasury need to be designed.  Principles are a good start, but it involves so much more:  trust assurance, clear objectives, roles for administration, documentation and HOW TO REVISE THE DOCUMENTATION...no matter what gets designed, front and center should be the ability of the community to both lock it down for security purposes (emergency revision) and short and long term alignment (formal revision of normative statements).  And there is more, which this team will discover when they actually try to build a working framework.\n\nThe experiment has its place, and contributors should have options for incentivized participation, so I am not totally opposed to trying to move the ball forward here, but without critical tools, this experiment is going to be over before it starts, so I can't agree that this is a feasible attempt to address its ideas.  2 stars", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The best parts of this component are contained under the headings of figuring out what candidates are suitable, and what makes candidates less than ideal.

There is a lot of documentation so I may have missed this part, but it isn't even clarified in what way funding is dependent on these reports or what is to be done around risks (or what those risks are) such as someone submitting inaccurate progress reports or being blocked on a difficult project.  What is to be done when someone is working, but not delivering?\n\nAgain, this is a project that still is very, very raw.  A proper governance framework, even just a skeleton with full complement of bones, could serve to be built around and would provide many auditable points.

What is presented here could not begin to pass for a trust registry with any actual validity.  What could be issued from an actual trust registry for the side treasury would need to stem from peer to peer feedback loops based not on Ada wallet voting (though that could be given weight) but verifications between review of proposals and community acceptance of those reviews, and assertions of deliverables, accompanied with attestations to actual deiveries, and those attestations are based on curated standards, etc.  Credential validity is based on the depth of the peer loops that can be obtained, and no such structures have been described here.\n\nBecause the experiment does provide lots of documentation towards achieving many of the ends laid out here, yet has attempted to create none of them, I can't quite get to neutral territory on this proposal.  2 stars for verifiability.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3325, "q0": "This challenge is unique in that it invites people to propose themselves as full time workers within the ecosystem.

Secondly, since these appointed contributors are finely compensated and rewarded professionals by Catalyst, the community can retain a good portion of the ownership of the works made by the contributors and then Catalyst as a communal effort will absolutely want these works to be open-source for the sake of communal advancement in Cardano.

This fresh alternative to the classical challenge setting process overcomes many downsides (low entry barriers for malicious actors, unilateral budget weighting, limited understanding of challenge teams, suboptimal time consumption, etc.) and aims to be more efficient, flexible, scalable as well as legitimate. Let\u2019s see if it also has the capacity to deliver on of the strategic goals from Fund 9. \n\nCan it help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? \nCatalyst Contributors challenge, if implemented, will be in a unique position to help prepare many diverse groups to contribute to the ecosystem. First, there are extremely well thought out principles and requirements to join / apply for funding under the challenge, so the first relevant group will be the actual contributors themselves, who will have to adhere to the rules and guidelines set out by the challenge. Second, the activity of the contributors will also have a direct effect on other Catalyst members (proposers, assessors) since their job will be to support these other roles, and thus prepare them better to fulfill the requirements for their respective position. \n\n\nCan it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? To a lesser extent, since this challenge is not mainly focused on developer projects. However, since the contributors working on the technical side will already be immersing themselves into an open source ecosystem, it is unlikely that the ethos of the community will be affected in any way.\n\nCan it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? There would only be indirect effects here, since, again, we are not dealing with a challenge that supports building real projects. However, it is likely that contributors can enable proposers to better understand the opportunities within Catalyst and to connect them with outside needs for real world applications. In conclusion the effects of this challenge on real world solutions would most likely be significant, albeit long term, indirect and difficult to measure. \n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? This challenge will provide extensive opportunities to support the Catalyst processes, since this is exactly where its focus lies. The contributors will be encouraged to focus on solving the biggest community\u2019s problems (creating tools, coordinating, improving everyone\u2019s experience) but also to offer general support through answering questions or generally raising awareness to the areas that need support, in a similar fashion to what the Catalyst Circle does today.  \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is well aligned with the Fund 9 strategic goals. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? There is already great effervescence in the current roles around Catalyst, most of them self-appointed and not remunerated. Many members are undertaking small scale projects having the sole drive to help the community advance at least marginally. This challenge will greatly enhance this capacity, since it will bring an overarching system to stimulate these roles, with funding and a very flexible approach to the necessary time commitment (ranging from full timers to project based positions). I can thus say that there is a perfect fit between this challenge and the Cardano community, and I have no doubts that it will be able to address it exceptionally well. \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? The budget has been established following a vote open to all community members, secured by a few gatekeepers that anonymised voters identity and the vote itself, thus ensuring a high level of trust as well as legitimacy. And the results of this vote have been transposed into the budgetary splits present in the challenge. If the budget is realistic it will definitely be clear post-factum, if we notice enough implementation capacity from the community in terms of sufficient projects, sufficient competition within each category as well as a general good quality of the projects submitted. But the budget is close to a wisdom-of-the-crowd solution, so there has to be merit behind it. A back of the envelope calculation shows that, should this budget be considered for a three month period, it would be able to accommodate easily 70+ full time positions, or of course any other combination of full time + part time + project based participation. To fully answer the question whether the available budget is a right fit for the challenge, the community needs to first perform a scope of necessary positions in order to gauge the overall needs of the ecosystem.   \n\nIn conclusion this challenge is definitely feasible in terms of being implemented by the community, with the small caveat that for the budget there are unknown variables and only experimentation will paint a more clear picture on how realistic it is. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\nIs the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nThe challenge is extremely well scoped in terms of defining the roles for contributors and their duties in the ecosystem. It also makes it very clear what attributes are desirable for them (approachable, open minded, pragmatical), so there are excellent measures of success already available. Now, if the selection process will lead to community voting, this will turn into a beautiful experiment sitting at the edges of politics and business, since ADA voters will have to carefully decide which applicants should fill the proposed positions, and it will most likely necessitate more than a beauty contest to convince the community of one\u2019s added value.  \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe narrow scope of the challenge implies a very healthy competition will take place. One risk however is that the selection process will be prone to the same disadvantages encountered usually in elections, where imperfect information and mis-alligned incentives lead to suboptimal outcomes and even unintended consequences. I find it extremely important that any governance decision on the allocation of funds and the constructions of its supporting mechanisms are backed up by solid research, in order to offer the new systems the best fighting chances against these centuries old problems. Hopefully IOG\u2019s role in shaping and nurturing the debate on this front will carry on well into the future.  \n\nIn conclusion, there is a good potential for verifiability for this challenge.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Catalyst needs more community members working full time in the ecosystem so it can reach its potential", "success": "Catalyst community members solving important problems are funded so they can continue providing high impact"}
