The crux of the idea behind this Challenge Setting proposal is to \u201ccreate a VR platform to showcase various Architecture, Design & Research Projects and create alternative funding avenues\u201d. The challenge question alas does not touch upon the key elements that are critical for Cardano\u2019s mission. Furthermore, the proposer seems to have posted this proposal as an implementation proposal, not as a real Challenge Setting for future proposers in Fund 10. A Challenge Setting proposal should open up the field for solutions to be proposed by future proposers in the next fund. In this specific proposal the person who filed this proposal is already suggesting how the question should be addressed through an implementation of his own team\u2019s plan: \u201cWe would have created a VR platform to showcase various Architecture, Design & Research Projects and create alternative funding avenues.\u201d The blockchain aspect of the Challenge Setting seems to come partially as an afterthought. Yet, the attached file is more specific and it references a KALA studio VR & Cardano Implementation Proposal that will be based on a VR virtual space platform. One of the specific references in the file is that the project will use smart contracts, to enable future clients to generate an (AIA-) Architect-Client contract which will then allow the architect a 4-month period where the construction documents are to be put together and ready for construction bidding. Clearly, this is not a week-prepared Challenge Setting proposal. I would advise the proposer to submit it in a regular challenge in Fund 10 and to work out the blockchain-related aspects in more detail.

Yet, this is a Challenge Setting category that should attract general categories that will be the basis for many future proposers in Fund 10. As specified in the Alignment field, the proposer has probably misunderstood the Challenge Setting category and submitted an implementation proposal. The proposal itself might be an interesting way of addressing some ways of integrating architecture and blockchain, so the proposer might consider resubmitting in the proper category in Fund 10.

They are related to the specific proposal that the team wishes to implement.

The metrics refer to the proposer\u2019s own project. Furthermore, the proposer\u2019s take on the metrics somehow seem to be always positive \u2013 even if the project \u201chas gone poorly\u201d, if the \u201cproject has gone OK\u201d and \u201cif the project has gone well\u201d. This seems to be a bit lax approach to metrics and seems to be a very lax approach for a proposal worth ADA250,000. I would advise the proposer to take a more careful look at metrics \u2013 as they should measure success and failure. If the project \u201chas gone poorly\u201d \u2013 this should probably be a mark of relative failure rather than a more wishful thinking approach as defined in the challenge text: \u201cIf the project has gone poorly - we have a cloud platform where Architects can plugin their work to be experienced by any VR user in the country and hopefully the world.\u201d ", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 8, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 539, "q0": "My comment are below in brackets that explain my rational for alignment while considering the fund goals included in the challenge brief.\n-Prepare a group of people willing and able to contribute to the ecosystem (This challenge setting may be inspiring to some, but it does not directly contribute to tools/training/resources that will help prepare people to contribute. )\nTurn Cardano into an open-source project & attract more developers. (Does little to Turn Cardano in an open-source project, but it may attract a small number of developers.) \nBuild real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain. (This is in perfect alignment, as this challenge focuses on using Cardano blockchain to create innovative use cases for real world construction and architecture projects. )\nImprove tooling to support human processes in Catalyst. (not related to Catalyst improvements) \n\nGuiding questions:\nWhat challenges will engage the highest number of voters?\n(This challenge is unlikely to engage the highest number of voters, however it could engage an important group of inspired architects and builders that can begin merging the virtual and real world through the Metaverse. )\n\nWhich challenges, if addressed, will provide a springboard for Cardano adoption? (It's difficult to predict, but this challenge does have to potential to bring a large group of professional builders to Cardano, that can start working on real world projects and elevate the Cardano brand) \n\nWhich challenges, if addressed, will advance Cardano's mission? (This challenge has some very interesting potential to work well with projects like Empowa.io to advance Cardano's mission of improving lives in Africa with real world use cases.) \n\nJudging by the attachment on this proposal, this challenge proposal does appear to be specifically targeted by the proposer to help Kala studio achieve funding for their project in F10.

It is unlikely this challenge would show results within 6 months, as it would likely require longer term timelines due to the complexity of building both real world architecture and virtual spaces.

However, for a novel topic like this, I would have expected the author to present a context, with market data, potentialities for attracting new audiences to the blockchain, examples of use of the solutions he proposes made in the traditional world, explaining what is new about bringing those solutions to the blockchain industry.

As stated by the author, it is essential because the untrained human eyes usually cannot understand the architecture designs from the architect's perspective.

It is known that many famous architects, such as \"Zaha Hadid Architects,\" are already experimenting with Metaverse. They have built different buildings and showcased their work. I think this is one of the positive use of the Metaverse, and we should work in this direction too and onboard the Architects to Cardano. It seems Metaverse will do for Architects what NFTs did for Artists.\n\nThis challenge will help with at least two of the strategic goals as it brings in able people who want to build and contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Also, it will help grow the developer ecosystem as Metaverse-related solutions will be developed by proposers concerning Architecture.
