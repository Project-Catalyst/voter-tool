The fact that the proposal focuses on Africa, a priority for the Cardano blockchain is to be welcomed. Also, focusing on aspects that would help facilitate the use of Cardano as a financial OS for the unbanked is great! There are some problems with the way the challenge is written, however, in my view. The proposer states that users are charged 3% or more to send funds to an exchange, although some additional documentation would have been welcome to back up these statements \u2013 for example information from some major African exchanges in leading markets. I do not doubt it, but this is a claim that can easily be backed up with data \u2013 especially for a proposed challenge worth ADA 2 million. But, that is a smaller issue. The proposed definition of success \u2013 seems a solution to a problem \u2013 not a challenge. The proposers of the Challenge state that the solution is \u201cCatalyst funds the operating capital while DAOs allow the Cardano community to fund the required central bank deposit for this institution\u201d.  Hence, this Challenge already wants to provide a solution \u2013 to its own questions - instead of letting future proposers suggest how to address the three separate challenge questions they themselves posed: 1. \u201cHow do we on-board the unbanked without offering financial services?\u201d 2. \u201cHow much would it take to incorporate and expand a crypto-first financial institution in Africa?\u201d 3. \u201cHow can DAOs raise this capital?\u201d The \u201cquestion\u201d in the challenge question field is a bit confusing \u2013 as there are three questions \u2013 which on the surface seem related. However, they are very different questions and they make the focus of the challenge \u2026 well, unfocused in my view. As it stands now, the proposed challenge seems to me to be incomplete and not sufficiently well focused \u2013 the three questions are an indicator of part of the problem. If it is not approved this fund, I would advise the proposers (if resubmitting) to focus on forging an excellent challenge question (probably best a single question) and to allow future proposers in the challenge to offer solutions. Also, I am a bit confused about the name of the challenge: \u201cAfrican Digital Banks Network\u201d as a digital banks network is not mentioned in the proposal, although this is not as material a problem. Due the aforementioned contradictions in the challenge proposal, its alignment with the Fund 9 goals is not fully clear. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team proposes that the \u201cchallenge will allocate 1/4 of the funds are working capital to the winning proposal and 3/4 as the required deposit for obtaining Electronic Money Institution licensing in targeted countries\u201d. This is a valid attempt to create a challenge with specific rules. Yet, the rules seem more implied than clearly explained. There is no such thing as a \u201cwinning proposal\u201d in Catalyst funds. All proposals that are supported by voters and their budgets add up (fit into) the challenge budget are winning proposals. Maybe the proposers of this challenge setting wanted to create new rules for disbursement of the Challenge funds amounting to ADA2 million. Namely, to award all the money to one proposal. That is a valid proposition, but this has not been explained in detail and will potentially lead to confusion. The team should have explicitly listed the specific rules for applying in this challenge. What if we have five proposals submitted and each is for a budget of ADA400,000 \u2013 maybe the teams do not need ADA500,000. What happens? What is a winning proposal here? Also, it would have been good if the proposers had backed up (with detailed reasoning and market research) their suggested distribution of \u201c1/4 of the funds as working capital\u201d and \u201c3/4 as the required deposit for obtaining Electronic Money Institution licensing in targeted countries\u201d. Why set the license deposit at ADA1.5 million? There is no rationale behind this that would explain it and the feasibility of such a specific challenge. No list of targeted countries, we are left in the dark about the targeted countries and whether this 1/4 : 3/ 4 split is perfect for all African markets. Due to these very specific rules, I am not sure whether the community has the capacity to address this challenge well and in a way that will lead to the rational utilization of the proposed ADA 2 million budget. Throwing money at a problem is not the best solution \u2013 at least if the problem is not well defined enough, and this challenge proposal seems could benefit from more improvements \u2013 in order to improve its feasibility. I think it would benefit from more detail, background information and market research \u2013 especially in relation to the large budget of ADA2 million.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics for the challenge seem interesting. Some are also a bit imprecise, such as \u201cDetailed plan for the establishment of a financial institution in targeted region\u201d. Namely, is this a challenge for setting up banks or any type of financial institution? Not clear to me. The success criteria states: \u201cto fund the required central bank deposit for this institution\u201d, however it is not clear whether the target is an exchange or a bank or any type of financial institution. One of the metrics is \u201cFocus on the unbanked (rural, farmers, etc.)\u201d- however might be easier said than done and is imprecise. There is no real metric there, just advice. Also, there must be some core problems why the unbanked are unbanked in African markets and it might not be enough for the future proposers to focus on them \u2013 if the problem is lack of electricity or no internet coverage or low familiarity with modern tech. \u201cPromote adoption of Cardano\u201d does not seem a true metric, more of an advice. The metric \u201cSound African banking experience\u201d is too vague. For example, one metric that could be used is \u201cUsers are charged much LESS than 3% to send funds to an Exchange\u201d \u2013 as this 3% was cited in the importance field of the proposal.  The verifiability of the following also seems difficult \u2013 \u201cthe remaining 1,500,000 will be reimbursed to the treasury after a period of 5 years through funding rounds within the Cardano community.\u201d I do not understand who will reimburse ADA 1.5 million to the treasury if the ADA1.5 million has been spent as a deposit to obtain \u201cElectronic Money Institution licensing\u201d. How will this be enforced and why mention the funding rounds? So, if this challenge setting proposal is resubmitted in the next Fund (if it is not approved now), best to tighten up the text of the proposal, to make it crystal clear what is being proposed.

This challenge aims to offer on/off ramps solutions for Africa, a region with major financial problems and an unbanked population, so it is important for Cardano to achieve more adoption.\n\nThis challenge aligns with item 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n\nAs there is no suggested period of time for the implementation of this challenge, evaluating how critical this challenge is at this moment for Cardano becomes more subjective. I would recommend establishing a period of time to guide proposers to create their proposals. Success association with time is important to indicate how critical this challenge is.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this challenge setting, the winner takes all. The concept is that the entire budget is allocated to the proposal best positioned at the voting stage, at least that's what I could understand (it could be clearer in the description). The concept of this challenge needs to be better articulated. I am not sure that this challenge setting has a broad enough scope to be called a challenge, because although the challenge questions give the idea of \u200b\u200bbreadth of possibilities, the challenge brief specifies that proposals must obtain a specific license to meet the theme of this challenge. . I would recommend providing more information on the financial landscape in Africa indicating why an EMI is the solution to on/off ramps in Africa.\n\nThe blockchain industry and community is still very dependent on FIAT on off ramps, there are many political and financial interests that make the use of cryptocurrencies in commerce difficult or prohibited. It is in the interest of a government that the population uses the local FIAT currency to guarantee the sovereignty and financial relevance of the government and the country's monetary policies.\n\nOne issue not addressed in this challenge setting is the political difficulty of creating a crypto-focused financial institution. In some countries cryptocurrencies are simply prohibited, so any solution created in this challenge setting depends on unpredictable external factors. This is an important point to be addressed by any proposals to be created in this challenge setting as this may limit the community's ability to address this challenge.\n\nThere are several projects related to Cardano being developed in Africa, only on Catalyst hundreds of proposals focused on Africas were funded over about 2 years, so I see demand and capacity for proposals being created, but as I mentioned above there are external dependencies that may limit the community's ability to address this challenge.\n\nThe description of this challenge setting doesn't explain or cite sources to indicate how it established the amount of $1.5M ADA to fund the required deposit for Electronic Money Institution licensing.\nIs this amount an estimate? To which financial authorities should this amount be deposited?\n\nLet's say this estimate is correct and the deposit amount to obtain the license is 1.5M ADA. As far as I know financial authorities will require deposits in FIAT currency, therefore the amount of 1.5M will need to be converted into a FIAT currency, which was not specified in this challenge setting. I will not even consider the legal and tax issues of this conversion, although this is important and should be addressed in the challenge setting.\n\nLet's say the conversion is done and the money is deposited. How does the winning project of this challenge setting intend to return the amount of 1.5M ADA? it is necessary to consider that in 5 years the market value of ADA may be above or below the moment of conversion. If above, how does the funded team intend to return the resources to the treasury? There is a risk of unaddressed \"default\" in this challenge setting. Another scenario is that in 5 years the ADA price is below the conversion value, in which case would the funded team return an amount greater than what it received to the treasury or would it keep the profit?\n\nThe point above is important, as proposals that are created in this challenge need to indicate how they will deal with the situation.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The definition of success is not aligned with the context of the challenge setting, which should be offering financial solutions for the unbanked in Africa. The proposed definition of success \"Catalyst funds the operating capital while DAOs allow the Cardano community to fund the required central bank deposit for this institution\" indicates only how budget management should be handled at a high level.\n\nThe key metrics are related to the theme but are not appropriate for evaluating the success of this challenge setting.\n\nThe key metric \"Focus on the unbanked (rural, farmers, etc.)\" is more a suggestion of how to address the challenge than a metric. Percentage of unbanked vs banked users using the service would be better suited to serve as a key metric.\n\nKey metrics such as \"Promote adoption of Cardano\", \"Sound African banking experience\" are related to the topic but lack specificity, could be more specific to facilitate verification of success. e.g.\n\nNumber of users using FIAT on/off financial ramps during the first year.\n\nThe focus of this challenge is to make on/off ramp services more accessible to the unbanked, so this should be the focus for defining key metrics. Considering that the idea is to repay 1.5M ADA after 5 years it is important to have information about the financial health of the project over this period.\n\nAn essential key metric would be:\n\nAmount returned to the treasury over x amount of time.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 6, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 627, "q0": "This challenge\u2019s goal is to solve the issue of high costs to deposit and withdrawal money form exchanges in Africa. It states that there is a 3% cost related to these operations and this makes it unfeasible for many people and increases the entry barriers for many. A solution would be to create a financial institution that would have lowers costs compared to this. Although, it was not clear to me what the solution would be, exactly. It seems that 75% of the budget of this challenge would be used to pay for this 3% fee for a period and 25% would be used to create this financial institution, and only 1 project would receive the 25%, which is 250k ADA. Although this challenge proposal could facilitate the operations of many people in Africa, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not following the guidelines of a challenge setting and I\u2019m not sure if the money of a challenge could have its utilization defined in the challenge brief as it is done here.

I am not sure if it\u2019s feasible to set how the money of the challenge would be spent in the way it is done here and I believe it would cause some issues related to the way Catalyst operates. Also, creating a new financial institution is not so simple and as far as I know the community has not yet created anything like this and it would be a major step if this was done by it.

By doing so, there is a possibility of great societal impact as Africa has been one of Cardano's major target areas because of its young population and economic growth potential. However, with our current strategic goals and market situation where we are forced to prioritize infrastructural development to differentiate ourselves from other blockchains, it does not seem like the right time to devote a challenge to this. Therefore I regret to disagree that this challenge setting proposal is mission critical at this point in time.

Taken into consideration that there are community members with experience in traditional finance as well as decentralized finance, the community should not have much hurdles to overcome to find a solution to this challenge. However, when the subject of banking in Africa comes up, the CFA is a very influential entity in that part of the world and has ties to the ECB. The likelyhood of running into unexpected problems trying to invoke a competitor to them is therefore rather high. The combination of these factors has led me to determine a neutral stance on feasibility. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Creating an environment where one wins all is bound to induce some fierce competition.

They would have detailed financial plans with a focus on banking the unbanked (identity is the core of RealFi, but not mentioned here).  So far, so good, though it could use more RealFi details.\n\nBut it goes pretty sideways in the challenge brief, where it describes only one winning proposal (not how Catalyst works in general, and no side-protocol has been described or established), that receives the entire funding allotment.  The description of how it is distributed makes no sense...$500k for operating costs, $1.5m for (what I am paraphrasing as) Official Financial Entity costs (with a suggestion that this involves registering with a central bank...not all countries have central banks and very few central banks have these kinds of policies, except for what are called \"dealer banks\", and frankly, $1.5m isn't even a drop in the bucket at that level) so it really isn't clear how this funding is meant to be distributed, or how it aligns with Catalyst, and thus how it could possibly align with the Fund 10 goals or Cardano generally.
