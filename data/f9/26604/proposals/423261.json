It is mentioned that this is the most watched event in the world and only happens each 4 years. This is true, but on the other hand, for this same reason any marketing related to the World Cup is very expensive. If it is desired to reach out to all that people, the 50k ADA budget of this challenge wouldn\u2019t be enough even for a single advertisement. Other ways would have to be found to advertise Cardano in other places where the reach is lower. At the same time, it would be better to have advertisement that is related to the world cup instead of just general statements about Cardano. So, the question would be, how football could be connected to Cardano? There are some answers, NFT for collectible cards, for example. Since the main goal of this challenge proposal is to increases awareness about Cardano, is would indirectly address Cardano\u2019s goals for Fund 10. I believe the aligment of this proposal is ok.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Since the success of this challenge would be engaging a global audience as mentioned in the success definition of the challenge proposal, I believe the budget wouldn\u2019t be enough even if only a single proposal gets funded. The advertising costs during these events are huge. I\u2019m sure the community would be able to come up with ideas for marketing Cardano relating it to the World Cup and football in general, but the amount of funds available won\u2019t be enough to reach a global audience as expected by the proposer. I believe this challenge is not feasible. Also, there\u2019s no mention about a possible challenge team to manage this challenge in case it gets voted in.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The challenge doesn\u2019t include any KPIs at all, so the verifiability of this challenge proposal, based on the proposal itself, is null. The proposer could have added some KPIs related to social media engagement, which I believe is all that could be done since this challenge would be mainly focused on marketing and advertising. Maybe some numbers for new wallets creates or people onboarded to Catalyst could also be tracked if they use trackable links for this purpose.

The first argument is that it only contains around 70 words, so don\u2019t expect a very long assessment either. In a nutshell (how else) the proposal wants for the community to unite and increase the reach and awareness for Cardano through the 2022 World Cup. While the growing adoption is laudable, there are no more specific details offered. What kind of proposals are welcomed? What would be the target population to onboard and grow adoption levels? How can such a world wide event be targeted effectively with 50K USD, probably not enough to even buy 10 seconds of mass market advertising. To keep it simple there simply isn\u2019t any alignment between this challenge and the Fund 9 strategic goals, so one star is sufficient.

We only know that success looks like \u201csocial media outreach and engaging a global audience\u201d, while creative teams should find ways to reach the global audience.

The idea behind the proposal is social media outreach and engaging a global audience, in summary, marketing and advertising Cardano at the World Cup. As an idea it has possibilities, however no details are given. Does the marketing involve team sponsorship? Is it advertising space? Or giving away merchandise with the Cardano logo? Or, anyone who signs up and connects a wallet during the event gets a bonus?
