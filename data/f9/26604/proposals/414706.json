The challenge question presupposes that the global healthcare community can leverage Cardano tech to provide better pharma R&D & global access to life-saving medications. It might be true and this challenge could lead to some breakthrough projects that do achieve this. I would have been happier to see \u2013 inside this challenge - some examples of how distributed ledger technology already solved other critical issues in less complex systems than the global health care industry. Why? Because this is a very ambitious challenge and there is always a risk that it might prove to be too big a challenge for resolving with a Fund 10 Catalyst funding round. The proposed challenge wishes to attract proposals for projects that use Cardano to decentralize development, production, access to drugs & tech to combat critical global illnesses. This sounds very good to me. I would only question whether the use of \u201cdecentralize\u201d is necessary, as a good proposal to use Cardano would imply decentralization in the proper measure. I mention this as proposers should not be required to add unnecessary elements of decentralization inside their proposals \u2013 apart from the use of Cardano - if not explicitly necessary for success. The task at hand \u2013 marrying blockchain and better pharma R&D & global access to life-saving medications \u2013 is already complex enough. As regards the Fund 9 goals, I would say the challenge aligns especially well with goals 1 and 3. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think that the team did well in setting a realistic budget of ADA200,000, despite the complexity of the issue. One could initially be tempted to submit an enormous budget. Throwing money at a problem that still has an uncertain outcome (can blockchain really help to improve pharma R&D & global access to life-saving medications?) would probably be the wrong way to approach a new \u201cfield\u201d. I am not completely sold on whether the Catalyst community has the capacity to address this challenge. If this proposal for a Challenge Setting is not approved this time around, I would advise the proposers (if resubmitting in the next Fund) \u2013 to cite some examples of unexpected collaborations between distributed ledger technologies and vital services that have radically improved global access to certain utilities, commodities, services or even democratized access to some resources. I would imagine that providing some existing examples would also serve as germs for ideas and as proof of feasibility of such an endeavor. So, due to my reservations about possible feasibility I detract one star. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\nOne of the proposed metrics is to check the number of proposals that address a critical global illness such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, malaria, dengue/TB, Covid-19, cardiovascular diseases. I think that this is a weak metric, as it is very easy to include a reference to a critical global illness inside each and every proposal \u2013 even as an afterthought. A better metric would probably be the number of proposals that have at their very core or predominantly use Cardano blockchain to address important issues that will improve development, production, access to drugs & tech to combat critical global illnesses. To be frank, as this is an early stage of the marriage of DLT technology with healthcare \u2013 there might even be no need for introducing \u201ccritical global illnesses\u201d \u2013 as some of the technology integrations might be easier developed on non-critical illnesses \u2013 and based on lessons learned, the use can be spun out to more critical areas of healthcare. The second metric (\u201cNumber of proposals that focus on improving health care outside of the geographies currently housing the headquarters of big pharma companies\u201d) seems imprecise in the sense that \u201cgeographies\u201d does not clearly refer to countries, continents, states, cities\u2026 This seems to be a metric that is not overly relevant \u2013 especially if the criteria for membership in Big Pharma is not specified. If this proposal is not approved in this Fund, I would advise the proposers to reformulate this metric to make it clearer and to avoid a metric that seems loaded \u2013 but is fundamentally unclear and not very relevant. Finally, I think that the remaining metric [\u201cNumber of proposals that democratize, decentralize, or broaden access to life-saving or life-improving drugs and devices\u201d] is spot on.

I know there is this mantra in Cardano to take it slow and sure but Cardano must understand we have competition in Africa and it is not one that can be disregarded but must be taken seriously. Superior technology does not mean automatic adoption anywhere.\n\nAs poetically mentioned by the proposer, \"\u201cHe who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything.\" That is what Cardano needs to strive to achieve in Africa.

All potential drawbacks personally for me are pushed aside for I believe this Challenge Setting is strategically smart.\n\nThere will be of course the old story of the limited developers that can be sourced to support any potential healthcare solutions based on Cardano which would need creative and attentive measures by the community to address.

For example ; onboarding hospitals/research group to integrate potential use of Cardano in their existing research then go for their current Success criteria.\n\nTheir current KPI's although are correct and coincides with the content of the proposal, are KPI's that are a bit too advanced.

The mission is to decentralized as much as possible the manufacturing process of some meds and to make them more accessible to the whole community by being more efficient, increasing the number of manufactures, therefore decreasing price, and thus increase the general well being of the population. This challenge is very well aligned with the goal of creating real-world solutions on top of Cardano. At first, it seems that it would be difficult to use Cardano to achieve this goal, but the challenge brief includes an example of a similar project that aims to offer insulin to people who wouldn\u2019t have easy access to it. It also suggests the products what would help to achieve the challenge\u2019s goal, such as supply chain solutions, DAOs, DIDs and cost reduction initiatives.

Also, it would be a good experiment with a very focused challenge, in an area that has the possibility to increase the quality of life of many people. It might be a good experiment that could be replicated to other areas in the future. I believe the feasibility of this challenge setting is good.

It woudl be good to add some KPIs like number of users for the applications developed, number of tools developed to support a broader access to health solutions, number of dApps, DIDs, DAOs and other entities created based on the projects funded.

Now, as in many other industries, the Blockchain could positively affect access to healthcare services and reduce disparities that still exist. However, if you do a quick google search you find articles on sites like 101blockchains.com, blockchain.works-hub.com/ and medicalstartups.org/.

My assessment is that the Cardano community as it stands today do not have this capacity in general, though it is possible and only required that one or two groups have the relevant expert understanding of the sector. With this said, however, it is also possible that a number of ideation stage proposals can be funded with this challenge size. In the latter case, this budget is indeed appropriate.

And not only this, but global healthcare and blockchain technologies need each other - since there is no way to even conceptualize a thriving society that lacks basic healthcare, just as it\u2019s impossible to visualize one in which its population lacks financial health. And the potential for Cardano to become a crossroad between these two topics: banking the unbanked while offering basic healthcare solutions? An absolutely thrilling concept.  \n\nNow, the challenge does a very good job at setting the right tone for this discussion, but it somehow misses the broader point in answering the \u201cwhy is this important\u201d question by just focusing on Big Pharma and the medication value chain. In my view, a better context of how blockchain can interact with global healthcare would have included two key messages (1) individual data has value and is a yet untapped market (2) healthcare stakeholders need individual solutions to their pain problems, and blockchains can deliver this. \n\nCan this challenge prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem? Blockchain solutions can definitely solve existing problems in the global healthcare system. Not all at once, but one at a time. Each supply chain stakeholder has a different pain point: hospitals suffer from supply chain inefficiencies; universities are more focused on credentials / identity solutions, while pharma companies can benefit from better clinical trial solutions through agnostic ledgers that ensure data validity and verifiability. All of these healthcare stakeholders can be brought onboard with the right value propositions so yes, there is a significant market potential to bring onto Cardano not only people, but entire value chains with the right solutions.     \n\nCan this challenge attract more developers? Can this challenge turn Cardano into an open source project? In this case I think the focus should be on flexibility and a good understanding of each stakeholder\u2019s needs. In some instances perhaps, some segments of the value chain might necessitate compromise solutions that include permissioned ledgers, federated learning solutions or simply the development of side-chains on which value can flow freely between the side and the main Chain chain. So even if not all the proposals from this challenge would offer open source solutions, I think the value added by a healthcare use case outweighs the downside of a closed source solution. \n\nCan this challenge build real-world solutions based on Cardano? Absolutely. Let\u2019s focus on the market for individual data. We have a huge untapped market for individual health data - the main impediment being that people still do not realize that their health data has value and blockchain can help unleash it for them. Cardano can also foster the development of alternative business models, where big players are hoarding user data and extracting all economic rents from that data. How? Through tokenization of data, privacy preserving features (zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption) and exchange tools where valuable data can change hands and become liquid. And I won\u2019t go into the details of other potential applications to keep this assessment reasonable. \n \nIn conclusion, this challenge offers tremendous development opportunities for Cardano adoption and real world use cases that can disrupt existing business models.

I am not sure if the Cardano ecosystem currently has the critical mass of people with the right blend of healthcare background, business acumen and blockchain understanding in order to create meaningful value propositions within this framework. There are definitely a few notable exceptions to this, at least in Fund 9: a few digital identity initiatives, one rather complex supply chain application, a metaverse proposal, etc. but I somehow feel that more competence is needed, or rather a right blend of complementary competences. But,\n\nthe budget in this challenge would be very modest, perhaps too small to offer the right incentives for the big players to join the ecosystem right now. In contrast to other challenges where having a small budget can play to its advantage (due to the high likelihood of small proposal that can bring even with modest budgets) I don\u2019t think this is the case for the healthcare segment, where there is a need for an excellent understanding of the context and somewhat significant resources to wedge the entrenched systems into moving slightly and accepting new players. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m saying this, but the budget is definitely too small for the potential use cases. \n\nGiven this mix of good but not excellent competencies within the existing ecosystem and a rather (too) small budget, I think only three stars are appropriate since it\u2019s unlikely this challenge will attract a critical mass of quality proposers and proposals.

Given my rather grim outlook for Cardano\u2019s capacity of servicing this challenge, this also translated into a similar outlook for the state of competition within it. We will definitely have competition given the modest budget but the quality will most likely not be on par with more popular challenges when competence is already proven and constant (dapps, infrastructure, etc.)  \n\nConsidering these two points (lack of focus for setting the success measures and unclear quality of competition) I think three stars are sufficient for verifiability.

Independent applications outside governmental scope, carry a fair potential to spread and become widely adopted pulling new people to the industry. \n\nI'm not sure how matured the basic decentralized infrastructure currently is for high level applications like healthcare services. However, I do believe that blockchain components can already serve as part of the many specific solutions and this Challenge has potential to attract those. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This challenge may potentially attract infrastructure solutions which are possibly applicable by governments when they bring blockchain components into their healthcare systems. Similarly, many existing decentralized healthcare projects could participate to build some specific features for their platforms. Being able to establish good collaboration with many other areas like identity solutions and NFT design may be a key for finding feasible approaches. \n\nI don't dare to expect a large number of high quality proposals. But I see a reasonably high probability of a few very impactful proposals. My view is that the challenge budget can probably not serve many serious high impact projects in this category. On the other hand, with a lower budget the risk is lower as well.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The number of proposals addressing critical global illnesses capture the impact which may touch everybody. If you wanted to add precision at measuring the impact, you could organize to weigh more solutions which cover more at ones. \nThe extreme case would be addressing aging which addresses so many of the other serious diseases along the way.\n\nThe number of proposals for democratizing access to services outside the big pharma geographies is a very powerful metric especially when it comes to access to reliable verifiable data and information. Being able to measure the scalability potential of the solution would have a remarkable impact. This challenge is well equipped to successfully measure and track the progress in pursuing the goals set. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3138", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Currently Big Pharma controls manufacturing, pricing, and global access to life-saving medications and devices.
