Non-governmental organizations in theory could benefit from decentralized governance structures on blockchains like DAOs. DAOs are one of the most discussed models to serve as an evolution of centralized systems of governance. This point could be included in the challenge setting as a use case, since none were mentioned.\n\nThere is an interesting concept presented in this challenge setting, but I believe it has been little explored. Examples of NGOs/NPOs could be mentioned to illustrate use cases. The challenge description could also have given more context to the problems faced by SPOs/NPOs to make it clearer how critical it would be for these organizations to adopt blockchain solutions. What are the bottlenecks/inefficiencies and reasons that make blockchains a suitable option?\n\nI believe that this challenge setting needs to demonstrate more clearly the potential to be explored on Cardano.\n\nThis challenge setting may be in line with items 3 and 4 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The concept of this challenge setting is not clear enough to indicate that the community will address this challenge.

The main rationale behind submission of this challenge proposal is that we could have Cardano as the go-to blockchain for NPOs/NGOs, instead of other blockchains. These organizations would have to use Cardano to leverage their services to the community. The scope of this proposal is very broad, but I can see it going into many different directions. NPOs/NGOs related to education could teach young developers about blockchain and Cardano. If the NPOs/NGOs can create real world applications on top of Cardano to help their communities, they will be directly addressing another goal of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10. In general, I believe this challenge proposal is very well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission and will be very beneficial to the ecosystem if delivered successfully.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There have been a few proposals so far in Catalyst, as far as I know of, that were somehow connected to NPOs/NGOs. For this challenge proposal to be successful, it would be necessary to onboard NPOs/NGOs that are currently not in our ecosystem, which creates a new challenge for the success of this proposal. It is possible that there are already many people in the community that work with NPOs/NGOs, but since this information is not available, we cannot be sure. On the other hand, the budget set for this challenge proposal is not so high, so I believe it would be possible to fund a few proposals in this context, and if there are not enough proposals to be funded, the remaining budget would go to the leftovers. The challenge team for this challenge proposal has not been set yet, and the two proposers of the challenge are deeply involved in other projects in Africa, so I don\u2019t know if they would be available to be in the challenge team. Ideally, the challenge team would have people who understand about NPOs/NGOs to be able not only to track the progress of the execution of the proposals, but also to provide some support and guidance.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs presented in this challenge proposals to track its success are good, but there are some that are not so easy to track, for example: \u2018Extent of Cardano and other blockchain education\u2019, \u2018Number of people that get to know cryptocurrency and blockchain technology\u2019. The latter would be measurable, but tracking the real numbers is very difficult. I would include some metrics about how many NPOs/NGOs were onboarded to Catalyst, how many people were affected by the projects developed and other metrics that are more easily measured.

Personally I have been in several organizations in the country where I reside and they always seem to be the same problems. Donors tend to be concerned about outcomes, impact stories, budgets, program outputs, among others. In the end, it is trust and transparency that tend to be the recurring problems. This is why I believe that by incorporating the benefits of using a blockchain like Cardano, it would give us on the one hand the possibility to enter a growing market. Why? In addition to the rising number of companies dedicating parts of their budget to corporate social responsibility (some by their own choice, others by legislation or tax interests), there is also the possibility that the impact of these organizations can be enhanced by resolving trust and transparency issues. From my previous arguments I can affirm that the objective of this challenge is aligned with Cardano's mission, as well as fulfills at least two of the four strategic goals we have for the next fund.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Cardano in general and the Catalyst community in particular are known for their high social sense, as evidenced by the proposals that have been approved for allocation of funds to improve conditions in communities in Africa, educate vulnerable populations, and in a variety of SPOs that donate part of their profits to NPOs and projects like the WMT that are the perfect intersection of social and financial objectives. The reason I mention this is that I believe that the community would respond positively if this challenge were selected. It appears that the amount selected is a bit high, however, I do not consider it to be a problem. I would like to mention, although I will not consider it in my score, that this challenge competes with at least two other challenges with relatively similar topics, I mean social, environmental and sustainability education topics. If there is a previous organization, and a challenge setting is presented that concentrates all these social causes, on the one hand, it would have greater chances of being selected, and also there would be an additional security to the community that they would not be distributing the community treasure in an inefficient way.

Where this proposal is able to increase its alignment, it is with the idea of Real World Solutions (Goal #3).  Again, this is mostly implicit, and drawn from the idea that these NGOs and NPOs are almost always working on Impact issues or SDG issues, which typically address issues and problems \"in the real world\".\n\nThe issue I have is that these alignments are all implicit, and thus not totally clear (and in the case of NPOs that aren't working on real world problems, not aligned at all, yet still covered under this umbrella).  Because the alignment is present, and can be sussed out with enough careful reading, but because it was not addressed in a clear way, I am downgrading the alignment score by one star.  4 Stars for Alignment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The only place I found the kind of support and guidance needed to help proposers orient themselves within the proposal was in the final sentence of the Challenge Brief, where it gives broad examples of the kinds of proposals and ideas that would fall under this challenge.  This is just barely adequate in my opinion.  I would recommend that the team include a section with these broad types, and include more specific subtypes, including approaches that go beyond onboarding the NGOs and their needs, and addresses support for builders of those specific connection or the bridges they get carried out on.  Additionally, adding in possible avenues to pursue provides inspiration and guidance for proposers as well.\n\nThe budget is suitable in the sense that this is a sector with usually large funding needs (of the 3 NGO projects I have spotted so far in Fund 9, the average budget ask is ~$90k) so too small of a budget would severely limit participation.  On the other hand, too large of a budget for an experimental category with no track record would face real risk of not being funded, so I feel they have balanced this reasonably well.\n\nBecause there is a reasonable budget and a small amount of support for proposers to orient themselves to the challenge, I feel that there is a sound basis here, but without more specific details I don't believe that proposers will have enough guidance to effectively bring ideas into alignment with the Fund 10 goals, so 3 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I really don't know what to make of the provided KPIs.  There is only one which is directly linked to the idea behind the proposal (a classic \"count'emup\" metric for number of proposals from NGOs) and it measures the Challenge setting rather than provide guidance to proposers on how to set their objectives.  The rest only obliquely touch on NGO adoption and impact, usually based on assumptions around an NGO/NPO's influential role in a community (which isn't always the case...some valuable impact organizations are running counter to their communities (knowledge dissonance) and would have a hard time driving adoption to other ecosystems...and these instances may need support more than most).\n\nWhat needs to be included here are metrics that would be useful to proposers who are trying to describe objectives and goals that are actionable and attainable, i.e. KPIs of how proposers can find and show successful alignment with the goals of a fund.\n\nBecause the provided metrics are not suitable for proposers and won't help them evaluate their objectives, I am afraid I have to give a very low score for verifiability.

Firstly, the proposal doesn\u2019t address the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the Cardano blockchain) because the plan for the challenge setting is to distribute funds to NGOs and NPOs, but it provides no guidance for how those NGOs or NPOs could actually make an impact on the Cardano blockchain. There are no guidelines or recommendations for future proposers, except for generalized outcomes, such as \u201cCardano becomes the best crypto\u201d or \u201cmore people engaged in Cardano.\u201d The \u201cWhy is it important\u201d section of the proposal states that NPOs can \u201cscale up Cardano and Project Catalyst through the numerous projects that are funded by major organizations.\u201d But isn\u2019t the point of Catalyst to propose projects/ideas for funding? What is the point if the NGOs already have funding? Why would they need to come to Catalyst then? The proposer could have included more info about this in order to address the first strategic goal. \n\nThe proposal does not address the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract developers) because it makes no mention of encouraging proposers to make open-source software or other ideas. I do see how the challenge setting could potentially attract new developers since NGOs can hire developers to build their ideas, but the first part of the strategic goal was not addressed. \n\nThe proposal sort of addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain). The challenge setting says that NGOs can use the Cardano blockchain to improve transparency, hold attendance sheets, and report publications. These solutions are real-world, but I feel like there could be more elaboration here. What are some other ways NGOs can build real-world solutions on Cardano? Are NGOs going to be using the blockchain to provide financial services to people? Can NGOs use the blockchain in their work to change the lives of people outside of the blockchain?\n\nThe proposal does not address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst). There is no mention of how this challenge setting could help improve human processes in Catalyst. How exactly would the NGOs improve Catalyst? Since the proposers did not address many of the strategic goals for fund 9 challenge settings, I can only give this proposal a score of 1 for alignment (score given: 1)\n", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Based on my knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst, I think that the Cardano community could address this challenge setting. I am sure that there are NGOs and NPOs who would love the funding to build some of their ideas on the Cardano blockchain, but are these groups already within the Cardano community? How many NGOs are actively in the Cardano blockchain and have been seeking funding for months or years? It is very hard for me to say that the Cardano community can address this challenge when it is targeted at a very small percentage of the Cardano community (NGOs) and the proposers provided no insight into how many NGOs are in the Cardano ecosystem that could address this challenge setting. \n\nGiven the scope of the proposal, I think that the budget of 350,000 ADA makes sense because it is a smaller challenge with a smaller target proposer audience. I think that quite a few NGOs could receive funding through this challenge setting, which would help them with whatever their goals are.

Are there any examples of NGOs teaching people about Cardano? If the proposers provided more metrics of success that are more relevantly connected to project ideas, or had they provided different NGO project ideas that matched the metrics of success given, it would have greatly strengthened the challenge setting.
