The main reason why I say \u201chas the potential to\u201d is due to the fact that this is a miscellaneous challenge that can encompass any proposal that did not fit into any other challenge setting. As a result, any proposal could technically fit into this challenge setting. \n\nHaving an open category addresses the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people who are able to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem) because it gives people a place to put their unique ideas. This challenge setting essentially encourages people to put whatever fun or interesting ideas they have to help grow the Cardano ecosystem. \n\nThe challenge setting can address the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract developers) through its open nature. A developer might have an idea for the Cardano blockchain that doesn\u2019t fall under any other challenge setting. As a result, there would still be a place for them in this setting because it is open to all other ideas. The proposers did not make any explicit mention of saying people must make their software projects open-source, but the proposers did say that people must address at least one of the strategic goals, which includes the open-source aspect. \n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) by allowing for new and novel solutions. Maybe someone has an idea to solve a real problem they see in their community, but they need a place to put it. Now, with the miscellaneous challenge, there would be a place. Receiving funding from a source like this challenge setting could kickstart a whole new branch of the Cardano ecosystem just from a single proposal idea. There are endless possibilities for how proposals in this challenge could solve real-world problems.\n\nThe challenge can address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst) if there are proposals that are Catalyst focused. If, by some unfortunate chance, there is no challenge setting that encompasses proposals for Catalyst tool improvements, then it would be necessary to have this challenge setting, so those proposals could receive funding. I could think of a few areas where this might be helpful, such as PA improvements or vPA improvements. Since all four strategic goals were addressed, I can give this proposal a score of 5 for alignment. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on my knowledge of Cardano and past Catalyst funds, I believe that the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. In fund 7, there were 119 proposals in the miscellaneous challenge. In fund 8, there were 141 projects in the miscellaneous challenge. These are huge numbers of proposals, so there is clearly enough demand for the challenge setting amongst the community since the numbers increased from fund 7 to fund 8. There is never a shortage of interesting ideas, so this challenge setting is the perfect way to give some of those ideas a home. Additionally, since there is no miscellaneous challenge setting for fund 9, there are likely to be even more proposals that need funding in fund 10. \n\nThe budget of 500,000 ADA seems very reasonable given that it is an open category. In the past, the miscellaneous challenge had a budget of 500,000, and I don\u2019t see why that needs to change. 500,000 ADA is enough funding to support a good number of smaller proposals, while not taking away from the other more specific challenge categories. I had no complaints about this challenge setting proposal from a feasibility standpoint, so I can give it a rating of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I think that the metrics are slightly defined. There really isn\u2019t a focus area since it is a miscellaneous category. However, there are a couple interesting metrics to note: the number of successfully funded proposals that don\u2019t fit in any other category and number of successfully defined challenge setting areas for future funds based on the proposals submitted in the miscellaneous category. I think that these metrics are important because they help track the success of the challenge setting overall. However, the proposers could have added some other potential suggested metrics of success, taking inspiration from other challenge settings. For example, the number of users and the number of countries involved are both metrics that could apply to a lot of different miscellaneous proposals. Including some examples, such as these, could provide future proposers with some more guidance. General examples of potential metrics of success are a good idea to include because they make it clear what is expected at the very minimum. I understand that there are a lot of different metrics that could apply to this challenge setting, but just a few ideas would have been helpful. Also, more metrics would need to have been included in order for me to conclude that they could drive healthy competition between future proposals. Two metrics of success that aren\u2019t about the future proposals themselves isn\u2019t quite enough.

I believe there should be more parenthetical conditions, such as not being able to vote for proposals with less than three points, as there will be a large number of proposals submitted in this category and a better idea is required, or exclude proposals submitted in other challenges as many teams will want to increase their chances of being funded and will submit an idea in two challenges, leads to higher competition for ideas.\nFor the reasons stated above, I give this section 3 points.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "If this challenge is accepted, I believe a large number of developers will submit challenge ideas. As a result, I need a better method or tool for selecting good proposals that will make it more competitive with other challenges. As I mentioned above, multiple teams will submit ideas for two categories, making this challenge less competitive than the others challenge.\nThis challenge is entirely consistent with the stated strategic objectives. However, the scope of impact is too broad, resulting in ideas that do not focus on solving a specific problem, and the ability to compete with other challenges is low due to a lack of some screening conditions.

Without the Miscellaneous challenge setting we run the risk of losing this insight to the constrained scoring criteria of Proposal Assessors.\n\nRadical inclusivity is of paramount importance in Catalyst, you never know in what form or from where paradigm shifting insight might come. This iteration of the miscellaneous challenge setting has included strategic goals that are a common theme in past and present funds and is therefore highly aligned with what drives the Catalyst/Cardano ecosystem forward.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Because miscellaneous has been proposed as a challenge setting since fund 6 we can easily examine it's feasibility. Fund 7 had 68 proposals submitted to the category while Fund 9 had 88 showing a 29% increase in submitted proposals. There was also only one challenge setting (DApps and Integrations) that had more submitted proposals which by it's self might indicate a need for the miscellaneous challenge setting. The budget that has been asked to fund this category has remained at 4% of the total funds available for the challenge setting categories, since it's original iteration. It should be noted that as a fund 9 challenge setting it was approved but not funded which might be more of an indication of funding competition than budget.\n\nI was particularly pleased to see the inclusion of some guidance for proposers (fund 9 strategic goals) in the challenge brief but it might also be helpful to have included in this section, that proposals aligning with other challenges should be in those challenges. I would however call this an improvement to the proposal overall and see no reason to deduct any stars.\n\nThere is another challenge setting proposal \"Nurturing Ideas and Teams\" that is similar to this proposal and a future merging of the two might help provide clearer guidance for Miscellaneous challenge setting proposers.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We can see from looking at previous Funds that Miscellaneous as a challenge setting had high competition for funding for the proposals submitted (as I said before only DApps and Integrations had more submissions in fund 8). We can also see that there were 17 voter approved and funded proposals in fund 7 and 24 voter approved and funded proposals in fund 8 that did not fit well into another funding category. This seems to indicate the need for the Miscellaneous challenge setting as well as providing a history to gage performance and success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3545", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13895, "q0": "This proposal of a \u2018Miscellaneous Challenge\u2019 has been funded in previous rounds of Catalyst. I would not argue that this challenge is \u2018critical\u2019 to Cardano\u2019s mission or whether it strictly adheres to the fund challenge setting strategic goals, however there is potential. As the proposers state, sometimes challenge categories can be so specific that it\u2019s like fitting a \u2018round hole for a square peg.\u2019 Hence the idea for a catch all, everything else, be creative as you can challenge. In the challenge brief, they\u2019ve copied the challenge setting goals directly, and stated that any proposal is welcome as long as it can demonstrate that it addresses at least one of these goals.\n\nThere is however no definite value in regards to Cardano\u2019s mission that can be guaranteed from this challenge. There may indeed be amazing small proposals that add high value and impact, or there could be many interesting ideas that are very loosely supporting the strategic goals. With an overall budget of 500,000 ADA, this significant budget may be siphoned away into many random directions without clear alignment to the goals. Overall, I rate this proposal 4 stars for alignment.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, a challenge that is open and all encompassing leads to an extensive range of possible proposals. The proposers state within the description that any proposal is welcome, with some caveats that they must be somehow related to the one or more of the challenges setting strategic goals. As an ever growing community, Cardano and Catalyst members are definitely able to contribute proposals within this extended scope.\n\nHistorically, in Fund 8, we saw the successful miscellaneous challenge fund, with a similar design brief and instructions to this proposal. With a budget of $500,000, in Fund 8, over 140 ideas were submitted. Sure, some were way off task, but the sheer number competing for this limited amount meant that some truly ingenious proposals got their first chance at funding success. As an educator for many years, sometimes students develop their best work outside classroom settings, through experiential learning, field trips or just day to day life. Connecting to this, some teams and proposals just don\u2019t fit within the normal funding challenges, yet have a lot to show and offer the community.\n\nI think the Catalyst community can easily rise to this miscellaneous challenge to provide many proposals within this proposed funding category. I rate it 5 stars for feasibility.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Due to the nearly totally open-ended nature of this challenge it is harder to set criteria and measure against them, but not impossible. The proposers list only two key metrics they plan to monitor, from reading other proposals, particularly those from the PACE group, a more detailed plan of the success criteria would be appreciated within this proposal.\n\nThe initial criteria for success listed is the number of approved by community fund proposals - that wouldn\u2019t have fitted in the other challenges. Here, the team will have to make a value judgment, as to whether the proposal is truly \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 or whether there was a more accurate challenge fund and the team possibly choose the easier, quicker, budget unlimited option to place it in the miscellaneous fund. So then, if it\u2019s a successful proposal, but placed in the wrong challenge, do they plan to mark this as a failure?\n\nSecondly, the proposers state that the miscellaneous challenge might attract a collection of similar proposals that in turn lead to the creation of possible challenges for the following Fund. This would be easier to track, but time consuming to analyze and process this information. A simple example I could think of, perhaps there are a group of people all proposing creating different types of books to educate a range of audiences about Cardano, think audio books for the commuters, kids graphic novels to introduce the next generation, to even Cardano infiltrated romances. These \u2018book\u2019 type proposals all get approved, and are hypothetically all successful, so in the next round someone proposes a \u2018Books about Cardano\u2019 challenge. I can see this happening, if the challenge setting team are willing to go through and follow up with an in detailed look at their successful proposals and the progress. However, it seems like a lot of work for little direct reward for the team\n\nOverall, I see some measures to verify this challenge setting proposal, but not as much detail to see that it could ensure success and accurate monitoring. I rate this proposal 3 stars for verifiability. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "A Miscellaneous Challenge will enable outlier concepts & great ideas to be proposed & funded even if they don't fit another Challenge.", "success": "Funding great ideas that focus on problems that are not covered by any other Challenge."}
