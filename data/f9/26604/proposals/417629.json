However, I remain a bit confused. Was this proposal well written as a challenge and designed as a challenge? Seemingly not completely. The proposer states that he has been a member of a challenge team for the Dapps and Integrations challenge for the past two funds and has ideas on how to make challenge teams more efficient. This is excellent as Challenge Team members are good sources of information on how to improve the process. What seems unclear to me is what kind of challenge is this specifically. It has a very large budget of ADA900,500. This means that future proposers in this challenge in Fund 10 would submit proposals to tackle the Challenge question. Yet, when I look at the question \u2013the question for the future proposers seems to be a statement: \u201cCatalyst has run Challenges in fund 7&8. After iterations and two rounds of Leading Dapps and Integrations I have revised a process to make challenge teams more effective at their overall goal.\u201d Effectively, the proposer here does not invite ideas from other proposers in the Fund 10 challenge. There is no question and the proposer states that he has a solution to make challenge teams more effective. Hence, this proposal is somewhere in no man\u2019s land between a Challenge Setting and an regular proposal. If it is not approved in this round, I would advise the proposer to rewrite the Challenge Question as a question and to expand on the importance of the issue. Currently, the proposer states \u2013 when talking about the importance \u2013 what has he and his team done. [\u201cWe have taken Onboarding, Proof of Life, Collaboration, Teambuilding to new levels within our team.\u201d] \u2013 however, this is a proposal for a future challenge and it should reflect the importance of the challenge for the entire Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer states that the brief of the challenge is to better define the roles of the Challenge teams. Indeed, the Catalyst community certainly has the capacity to achieve this \u2013 as stated. The issue that I find somewhat confusing with this proposal for a Challenge is its outsized budget of almost 1 million ADA. I am certain that the community can submit proposals to \u201cbetter define the roles of the Challenge teams\u201d \u2013 although I can not ignore the fact that it might not be feasible to spend almost 1 million ADA in a rational manner on this process. The proposer might have meant that the budget is to be distributed among some future Challenge Teams or to fund the research behind better defining the roles of the Challenge teams and experimenting with different processes. The challenge brief does specify that part of the funding can be used to fund \u201cChallenge teams for continuing support\u201d \u2013 however, it would be good to have some criteria as 900,500 ADA is a lot of money. It is unclear whether the 900,500 ADA is a one off for funding Challenge Teams in Fund 10 or 11 \u2026 or for many funds. Hence, the use of more precise language would help guarantee the feasibility of this challenge. If this challenge is resubmitted in the next fund (if it does not obtain sufficient support) \u2013 I would advise the proposer to rewrite the challenge for more clarity about what is exactly expected from proposers \u2013 and to include a question in the Challenge Question field. Maybe also good to avoid references to \u201cWe have\u201d and \u201cI have\u201d \u2013 and to use generic language \u2013 in order avoid muddling the waters between a Challenge and an implementation Proposal.

These two things have been required from a challenge team members in previous funds, as was another of the listed metrics: \u201cEarly feedback to help projects meet goals\u201d \u2013 in effect, challenge teams already are required to hold Office Hours in order to communicate with funded proposers inside their challenge, thus allowing for early feedback from the challenge team and an exchange of ideas. Hence, I would say that practically all of the key metrics of this challenge are already in some form part of the Challenge Teams\u2019 modus operandi and might seem not so relevant for a new challenge in Catalyst \u2013 as they are already inbuilt. If this challenge is not selected by voters in this Fund, I would advise the proposer to resubmit with some key metrics for this challenge that would go out and beyond the existing Challenge Team scope. The challenge brief inside this proposal for a new challenge seems to be the strongest and most original part of this proposal and if this challenge is not voted in, I would advise the proposer to work on expanding the challenge brief into a more substantial and approachable challenge for future proposers.

The first point to be mentioned is the budget, which is almost $1M and in my opinion is way too much for this topic. Such a challenge should have proposals that would, for example, have defined budget to increase the effectiveness of challenge team if they execute some tasks that are currently not their responsibility, as state in the challenge brief, for example, \u2018Critique new proposals before CA Assessments\u2019. There are goals to what a good challenge team would go, and ways to measure their performance, but it is stated that this challenge exists to help defining the roles of challenge teams, like \u2018Outline Checkmarks for meeting goals\u2019, \u2018Create collaboration environments between similar proposers\u2019 and other things.

I don\u2019t think it would be difficult for the community to come up with many good proposals for this challenge. On the other hand, in my opinion the budget of this challenge proposal is completely wrong. It should be maximum $100k and having a 1M ADA, potentially $1M, doesn\u2019t make sense especially since these improvements should be done step by step instead of all at once. There would probably be a huge leftover in this challenge, or many redundant proposals being funded at once.

TAccording to the author, these topics should be addressed as a challenge. However, from this proposal it is only possible to understand the existing problem associated with workload. According to the author, the workload is determined by the number of submissions. Therefore, it is necessary to have a team proportionate to the scale of the challenge.In spite of the fact that I agree with this problem, for example, because I believe that the workload in the onboarding process for the winning proposals in the Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge will be totally different than for the proposals in the dRep improvement and onboarding challenge, I find that the proposed scope is too narrow, and I also consider that there are not enough arguments to elevate this problem to a challenge.

Furthermore, the main body of the description lists various appealing sounding items without contextualizing them in how  they solve problems. \n\nFor this reason, I can't imagine giving this proposal more than 3 stars.

Where can it happen, if it's open? If all these questions are left unanswered, all you're introducing into the Catalyst system is more uncertainty, which is the opposite of what a proposal like this should be aiming for.\n\nI hope this helps explain why my response to this proposal is so tepid.

Continuous improvement in the process of Challenge Teams is necessary. For example, Proof of Life is one of the time and effort-consuming activities of Challenge Teams. CT Members need to manage a lot of meetings, record videos, etc. Tracking \u201cProof of Life\u201d of proposers who have more than 2 proposals in different Challenges is very very tiring because proposers may do POL in one Challenge but skip it in the rest Challenge. CT Members need to cross-check with other CT (through Telegram, Discords..) to be able to confirm that. Here is an example of one of the efforts to improve the CT Process (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422817). This proposal proposes the idea of creating a web portal, where CT can manage their tasks easier with the help of automated tools. This is just an example of an idea to improve the effectiveness of the CT process. There may be other ideas, too. I believe there will be much room to enhance the CT process. If this Challenge is available in Fund 10, such above ideas will surely fit this Challenge. \nThis is aligned with the Fund 9 strategic goals. Especially it is directly aligned with \u201cImprove tooling to support human processes in Catalyst\u201d and \u201cPrepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem\u201d. These are also the most contribution of this proposal. The proposal is also aligned with other strategic goals like \u201cattract more developers\u201d, and \u201cbuild real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain\u201d in an indirect way.
