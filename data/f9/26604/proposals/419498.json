It will help to prepare people willing and able to contribute to the ecosystem. NKKR Studio has the potential to onboad many new NFT projects and simplify the entire process. Additionally it will provide a valuable service to those looking to Launch an NFT project and evaluating what blockchain to launch it on. Services Like NMKR Studio make Cardano stand out as a great place to Launch a large NFT project. As we have seen with Martin Lawerence, this could be a great starting point for celebrities looking to Launch a project on Cardano without getting to bogged down in the technical details. This challenge will also incentivize more Cardano developers to become familiar with NMKR studio and become proficient with the platform.  \n\nI do not think it will help with turning Cardano into an open-source project, because while NMKR is one of the most successful NFT platforms on Cardano, it is currently not open source, and is operating as a for profit, closed source, company. They have created alot of value for Cardano, however this challenge would increase their existing competitive advantage and potentially make it more difficult for other open source NFT platforms to emerge and compete for market share. In terms of building \"real-world solutions\" this term may be up for debate, but this challenge proposal focuses on digital assets only, and not real world (non-digital) solutions. \nThis proposal is not aligned with supporting human processes in Catalyst, as it is focused on building out the NMKR NFT marketplace, and does not have anything to do with Catalyst improvements. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I do not see this as a challenge setting that will welcome a wide variety of solutions. While many different tools could be built for NMKR, they would all be for a single NFT platform. I would suggest the proposer re-submit to Catalyst as a series of smaller proposals to build out specific tooling, or as one proposal to incentivize new ideas. However, as mentioned above using a challenge setting to allocate funds and resources to one specific company is not well aligned with the purpose of catalyst challenge settings.  This proposal is likely to achieve results within a 6 month timeframe, as developers could work on simple tools/documentation that can be delivered quickly. It is not clear from the proposal if there is a challenge team in place to help guide participants of this challenge.

This API has already been developed by the NFT-MAKER project, and the goal is to create tool that will focus on integrations, standalone tools, marketplaces, launchpads and other applications. This challenge is good, but it required the use of a specific tool built by a team and a challenge in Catalyst ideally should not have this kind of requirement. Although, some of the goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10 might be addressed by this challenge, such as attracting more developers and building real-world solutions using CNFTs. Since the budget requested for this challenge is 100k ADA, which is relatively low, I believe the issue of having a project-specific challenge is lower, but it would be better to have something like this as a Catalyst Natives challenge. Overall, I believe the alignment of this proposal is ok.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The main characteristic of this proposal that increases its feasibility, in my opinion, is the requested budget of 100k ADA. Using current ADA value, the budget for the proposal would be around $50k, and I believe that Catalyst already has a community that is able to come up with good proposals to be submitted in this challenge and use its budget in a positive way. Also, developers that are already using the NMKR Studio API but are currently not in Catalyst will have this change to enter the ecosystem by submitting proposals in this challenge. Besides that, there are already many developers in Catalyst that don\u2019t know about the tool yet and might end up getting learning about it and getting interested in submitting their projects there. Because of all this points, I believe this challenge proposal\u2019s feasibility is very high.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs included in the proposals to track the challenge\u2019s success are good and they are all measurable. It\u2019s possible to track the number of tools/projects successfully released, the time from funding to market and their number of users. These KPIs would already be enough, but I could suggest some more. For example, KPIs related to the applications suggested: integrations, standalone tools, marketplaces and launchpads. Also, KPIs related to Cardano\u2019s mission: new developers building on Cardano and real-world applications that are using the tools developed through this challenge. Considering all this points, I believe this challenge success can be verified by the community and the challenge team in the future, in case it gets voted in.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 0, "ng": 14, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 865, "q0": "NFTs are definitely one of the torchbearers of this outgoing bull market (or recently ended bull market), both in Cardano and every other L1 that has experienced the phenomenon. In fact, Charles himself stated that the phenomenon of NFTs was something he was not expecting. Having said that, there is no doubt that NMKR is one of the most prominent players in the NFT market in Cardano. Which is why said team comes up with this challenging proposal, which seeks to empower creators through the creation of tools that can integrate with one of their best products, the NMKR Studio API. While I can find alignment with Cardano's mission, I would have liked the team to touch on the open features of these proposals.  \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While this challenge is particularly technical, I don't think it will be a problem for the community in terms of responsiveness and engagement.

The challenge setting addresses the first strategic goal (prepare a group of people to make contributions to the ecosystem) because it encourages people to make more use cases for the NMKR studio API in order to enhance the Cardano NFT ecosystem. All of the people who address this challenge and are funded will end up contributing to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposers of this challenge setting provided some basic guidance on what is expected of future proposers, such as integrations, standalone tools, marketplaces, and launchpads. If I were someone looking to address this challenge, I would feel mostly prepared.\n\nThe challenge setting partially addresses the second strategic goal (build an open-source ecosystem and attract developers) because it will definitely be able to bring in new developers. Building new integrations with the NMKR API, new marketplaces, and new launchpads will all require people with developer skill sets. As a result, I foresee new devs coming into the ecosystem trying to work on NFTs and making more of them on the Cardano blockchain. However, the proposers did not mention anything about future proposers making their work open-source. Since blockchain is all about open-source software, I would encourage the proposers of this challenge setting to build in a statement encouraging future proposers to have a plan to make their software open-source when possible. That way, this challenge setting would better address the second strategic goal. \n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) because NFTs themselves can have real uses. For example, NFTs can be used for digitizing famous art, real estate, music rights, etc. Making it easier to mint NFTs would open the door to more of these potential real-world cases on the Cardano blockchain. More integrations of the NMKR API would allow regular developers to also contribute to the NFT ecosystem, boosting NFT growth on Cardano. \n\nThe challenge setting does not address the fourth strategic goal (improve tooling to support Catalyst processes) because there was no mention of how this challenge could do so. I understand that it might be difficult to tie in a project, such as this one into the fourth strategic goal. One connection I see that could potentially have use is the implementation of NFTs that can serve as digital identities for Catalyst community members. However, this use case would only be accessible after proposals from this challenge setting make the NMKR API more readily usable by normal developers. Just a suggestion that would have made this challenge setting fully address this strategic goal.\n\nSince the challenge setting did not fully address all four strategic goals, I can only give it a score of 4 for alignment. (score given: 4)\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on the information provided in the proposal and my understanding of Cardano, I think there is potential for the Cardano community to address this challenge. I am not too familiar with all of the NFT developers on Cardano. However, I think there would be interest from developers who want to make these technologies more accessible to a wider audience. People would always appreciate easier ways to create NFTs, so there is demand from the community. This challenge is relatively small, so it does not require a huge group backing it in order to be successful \u2013 even a handful of developers could make it happen.\n\nAs for the budget (100,000 ADA), I think that it is reasonable for this challenge setting. It is important that there are some funds delegated towards building the NFT space on Cardano. The budget can fund a good number of proposals. At the same time, it is a smaller challenge setting with a smaller scope, so the budget accurately reflects that. Overall, I think that there are no problems with feasibility, so I can give this challenge a score of 5 for feasibility. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I think that the metrics of success are defined for the focus area (increasing the number of use-cases for the NMKR studio API). The proposers of this challenge setting listed three key metrics of success: tools/projects successfully released, time from funding to market, and amount of users for these tools. While I think that these metrics are good ideas because they show certain aspects of success, the proposers could have been a bit more specific about metrics on the NFTs (as they are the most important outcome of this challenge setting). Maybe a metric like \u201cnumber of NFTs minted using tools developed from this challenge setting\u201d would have been good because it shows how the challenge setting resulted in more NFTs in the Cardano ecosystem. Adding some metrics like these would also make the outcomes for future proposals clearer \u2013 people would understand what kinds of things they can use to measure success for their API applications. The metrics given can encourage healthy competition between proposals because future proposers will try and optimize the efficiency in which people can mint NFTs using their platforms. \n\nSince this challenge setting proposal had some good metrics of success for the focus area but could have used a couple more in other areas, I can give this challenge setting a score of 4 for verifiability.
