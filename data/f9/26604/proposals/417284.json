The scope of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide. as it could increase and prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem. The description and arguments used in the challenge brief are generic and could be used for several regions/countries besides Vietnam. A challenge dedicated to just one country is something that greatly limits the scope of a challenge, so it is desirable that the arguments for such a specific focus are solid and supported by more data. It is a fact that blockchains that have greater support from Venture Capitals such as Solana, Polkadot or Ethereum are able to receive tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in the development of blockchain solutions. However, Cardano had an ICO where decentralized distribution of supply was prioritized, which led to VCs being left out, so there is more organic growth and dependancy on our treasury. This argument is relevant for requesting funds in Catalyst, but could be used by all challenge settings.\n\nIt was mentioned that Vietnamese proposals have increased significantly but no figures were provided on this increase. If the raise is being used as a key argument for the importance of the challenge setting we need the argument to be backed. e.g. Number of proposals related to Vietnam in Fund 7 and 8 and in previous Funds to show what the increase was. It is important to note that one of the possible reasons for this increase in proposals may have been due to Fund 8's \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" challenge, which would indicate a non-organic increase caused by the offer of resources in Catalyst, in this case I would recommend also indicate how many proposals related to Vietnam were submitted in relation to the 34 proposals submitted, as this would indicate whether proposals related to Vietnam presented a proportionally greater demand than the other Southeast Asian countries. To understand how critical this challenge setting is to Cardano's mission, we need to better understand the social, political and economic context of Vietnam.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "No quantifiable information/data was provided on the demand for Vietnamese proposals, which would be essential to assess community demand for this challenge (\"The number of Vietnamese proposals rose sharply in recent funds...\" is not a solid argument to be referred to as an indicator).\n\nI could find dozens of proposals related to Vietnamese teams and projects on Catalyst, which indicates demand and capacity for community create solutions. I would recommend including information on Vietnamese projects being developed on Cardano\n\nAs this challenge setting is requesting a budget with a specific regional scope in only one country it would be important to indicate more preciselly the demand for Vietnam-related proposals from previous Funds with data such as: number of Vietnam-related proposals per Fund, budget of these proposals per Fund and if possible number of teams/people involved in these proposals.\n\nThis challenge overlaps with the \"Grow E.Hemisphere, Grow Cardano\" challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417316) and \"Grow Vietnam, Grow Cardano\" challenge (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421545)\n\nIt is important to note this because in case voters want to prioritize funding in a specific region or not. I would recommend coordinating the definition of challenge settings scope and budget with the other proposers in order to avoid overlapping themes. Overlapping themes brings uncertainty about demand for certain challenges and makes it difficult to assess feasibility. Funding these 3 challenge settings would result in an imbalance of funds for proposals dedicated to Vietnam in relation to the Cardano community as a whole. I will not deduct points due do the points raised in this paragraph rationale as each challenge setting needs to be evaluated independently.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success could be more objective \"Success is having multiple submissions in Fund10 for designs based in Viet Nam, which have a massive impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\"\n\nMultiple submissions would indicate demand for proposals, which is relevant, but not in the outctome of the challenge over time after funding. Massive impact on the Cardano ecosystem is a vague and generic definition, it could be used in any challenge setting. It would be important to establish a more tangible and objective goal and within the context of this challenge setting (greater specificity).\n\nOn the other hand, the challenge question clarifies the mission: \"How will we seed, persistently grow and support the Cardano ecosystem in Viet Nam in the next 24 months?\"\n\nIt is important to establish a time frame for successful benchmarking. 24 months is an appropriate period to evaluate the outcome, my recommendation would only be to emphasize the 24-month period, mentioning the period in the key metrics as well and thus making it clearer that the key metrics and success of this challenge are in relation to the 24-month period months.\n\n\n\n6 metric keys were established.\n\nThe first key metric establishes \"A number of proposals address the obvious problems preventing Cardano adoption in Vietnam.\"\n\nIt is unclear what the \"obvious problems\" mentioned are. The description of this challenge setting did not present details of the Vietnam panorama that would allow us to understand what the local problems are and this brings uncertainty about how to verify this key metric. What is the political/economic/social situation in the country? What is the level of cryptocurrency adoption in the country? How big is the developer community compared to other countries? With information like this it would be easier to understand how to check the first key metric.\n\nKey metrics would also allow us to gauge the number of new users, voters, PAs and proposers, Vietnamese projects and gauge the Vietnamese community's interaction with Cardano, Catalyst, government agencies and legislative bodies, which is relevant and appropriate for verification of success. of the challenge.\n\nQualitative metrics were not included, which would be essential to understand if the interaction of the solutions with the Vietnamese community is showing quality.e.g\n\nWhich scores of the proposals present in this challenge in relation to the other challenge settings?\n\nWhat is the level of competitiveness in this challenge in relation to the other challenge settings (ratio of submitted/approved proposals and ratio of requested budget/available budget?\n\nSurveys could indicate whether new members are satisfied with the onboarding process.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 92, "q0": "The proposed challenge might be a bit too narrow for excellent alignment with Cardano\u2019s vision, as it focuses directly and only on one country.

In that sense it is a bit narrower as it focuses on the empowerment of one community among almost 200 nations in the world \u2013 although it is fair to say that the Vietnamese community has been a tour-de-force in Cardano and Catalyst. One of the arguments of the proposers is that the number of Vietnamese proposals rose sharply in recent funds \u2013 which is very welcome. However, this might also serve as evidence that the Catalyst mechanism as it is designed right now allows for a strong presence of Vietnamese participants and that a specific challenge to this effect may not be necessary.

Still, I question whether the allocation of ADA500,000 for a single-country challenge will lead to proposals that are feasible and whether this will be addressed by Vietnamese proposers in a way that provides value for half a million ADA. Had the budget been smaller, the feasibility concerns I have would be smaller. If the challenge is not approved this time around, the proposers could resubmit in the following fund maybe with a smaller budget. The proposer definition of success might be a bit too lax \u201cSuccess is having multiple submissions in Fund10 for designs based in Viet Nam, which have a massive impact on the Cardano ecosystem\u201d \u2013 as it defines success as having multiple submissions from Vietnam. With a half a million ADA on the line, I am certain that there will be sufficient submissions \u2013 what is key is probably halving proposals that are completed and useful and self-sustaining after the Catalyst funding ends.

Every proposal will tackle issues, but the better measure is probably how many proposals effectively solve some problems that they set out to solve. Just mentioning this in case this proposal for a challenge setting is not approved this time around. Not sure how would the number of wallet signups from Vietnam be measured \u2013 although it is a metric. The metric of \u201cengage between the government agencies and legislative bodies with the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem\u201d seems to be a little hard to measure \u2013 as what exactly constitutes an engagement under this definition. Some other metrics that could be included \u2013 possibly \u2013 are the number of Haskell programmers educated or attracted to work on Cardano from Vietnam. The number of Plutus and Atala pioneers\u2026 etc\u2026 In general, I think that due to the specific nature of the challenge that focuses on one country and one community (in that country) \u2013 the metrics could be more focused and more focused on critical issues for Vietnam that blockchain could help alleviate/address.

As mentioned in the challenge brief, other blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot and Near are currently dominating the Vietnamese market, and Cardano has a limited reach there. There has been proven by the Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall that there is a significant number of people from this community, and this can also be seen in the Eastern Catalyst School and other community projects as well. This challenge proposal, since it focus on a specific community instead of a specific field, has the potential to cover all Cardano\u2019s goal of its mission to Fund 10. It would be possible to onboard new members, prepare contributors, create real-world applications, and make Cardano an open-source project. Though, none of these goals are directly related to the proposal challenge, but they can all be covered by it.

The budget of 500k ADA might be too big for the existing community to submit enough proposals to use it all, but since one of the goals of this challenge would be to onboard new community members, I believe it is appropriate. Nevertheless, since this is focusing on a single country, this could be challenging still since other similar challenge, like the ones focusing on Africa or Latam, ask for a similar budget. At the end, I think the feasibility of this challenge is good, it might be possible for the community to successfully use the whole budget proposed here, but I\u2019m not so confident since this would be the first time of this challenge focused on Vietnam. The challenge team for this proposal has not been set yet.

Some might be a bit more difficult to be tracked, for example, number of voters and CAs (PAs) since these roles are anonymous by default, but the other KPIs proposed are good enough to track the impact. I would also add some KPIs related to engagement in social media, numbers related to awareness, advertising, and marketing in general, since this seems to be an important topic to be covered by the proposals submitted in this challenge.

With their recent Industrial Revolution 4.0 mandate, the Vietnam government has been cultivating more and more ties and attracting more blockchain education and business to the country, with  recent examples being the formation in April of the Vietnamese Blockchain Association (https://blockchain.vn) which oversees a highly collaborative approach to blockchain adoption and creation of standards and regulations.  One if the offshoots of this kind of organization has been tapping existing crypto ecosystems for development, such as AEX exchange investing $100m into the industry and organizing the above mentioned VBA's hackathon events.\n\nWith these kinds of intiatives taking place, it can be demoralizing to see the list of the top twenty blockchain developers in Vietnam and see zero specializing or even listing Cardano in their proficiencies (https://clutch.co/vn/developers/blockchain).  This challenge seeks to address this gap.  The Eastern Townhall, a rapidly growing community in Catalyst, has been tracking Vietnam adoption since fund6 and are seeing rapid increases.  The challenge provides plenty of community development focus points and the sharing of knowledge and collaboration that highlights opensource projects, so we see a couple of areas of alignment with the Fund 10 challenge settings arising from there.  This strong foundation leads me to give the proposal 5 stars for Alignment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They provide decent suggestions for how proposers can approach the challenge setting and bring their ideas within scope of the communities capabilities.  The biggest focus is the education and collaborative elements, including with entities such as the VBA and the wider government regulatory and standards backdrop.  Alongside these areas, increasing awareness and proposals among the developer community in Vietnam would create the most durable form of impact.\n\nThe budget is in the right range for this highly regional challenge, as it is quite broad in scope within that region and represents the high degree of participation from that region already represented in Catalyst.  Whether it would be sustainable to have this be a persistent challenge setting does not fall within the scope of this review, but it is worth noting that there is also a wider \"East-Asia\" challenge setting, and that this targeting of a specific country within that region needs to be considered alongside and in relation to eachother.\n\nBecause the team has provided good guidance for proposers to accurately align their proposals to the challenge and because the budget is reasonable, I see no reason to mark down the Feasibility category.  5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics provided do a good job of describing the characteristics of objectives that could be adopted under this Challenge setting.
