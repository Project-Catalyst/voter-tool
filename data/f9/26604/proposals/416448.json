I like the fact that the proposers have introduced a time horizon of 24 months for supporting the onboarding of women, although it seems an overly long horizon for a single fund, i.e. Fund 10 challenge. Indeed, attracting a larger number of women will help Cardano, while attracting other demographics would also help. Seniors, younger people, people from marginalized communities, people from outside urban environments. Yet, if a demographic is to be granted a challenge of its own, we would need more backing information from the proposer that there is some kind of objective barrier \u2013 or historical barrier \u2013 that has prevented women from entering the Cardano ecosystem. There seems to be a weak case for that argument, as Cardano and Catalyst have had an open doors policy from the very beginning. I do not see this challenge as critical to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission, as Cardano has not had any special barriers preventing women from entering the ecosystem. It has been a merit-based and interest-based ecosystem that is open to people of different backgrounds and walks of life. If there are some barriers, the linguistic barrier and the education barrier might be ones that would need more support for overcoming possibly. This challenge addresses all four Fund 9 strategic goals but half-way \u2013 or roughly 50% - as it specifically excludes men. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposed Challenge for Fund 10 is high as Catalyst and Cardano already has a large presence of women active in the ecosystem. The proposed ADA200,000 budget can be utilized, in my view, by a range of teams and individuals focusing on the empowerment of the Cardano women community. The feasibility of the proposal is high as it involves a single request \u2013 which is to focus on women or include female members. However, this might also be a risk factor in achieving the true aims of the challenge. Namely, as in real life, teams might include \u201ctoken\u201d female members in order to prove their diversity, although this could be done only for the purpose of obtaining funding through this challenge. Just \u201cincluding female members\u201d seems to be a bar that is a bit too low and might ensure superficial success, while avoiding true empowerment. I commend the team for not going overboard with the size of the budget. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I feel that the selection of the key metrics would have been strengthened had the proposer provided some statistics on the existing percentages of women-sponsored proposals that were funded by Catalyst.. I would have liked to see more info on how we would measure the proposed metric of \u201cquality of sponsored proposals sourced from women's group\u201d. Also, the metric of \u201cAre we increasing the participation of women in the Cardano and Catalyst communities?\u201d would be more relevant if we knew right now whether the situation is dire (<5% of female participation right now) or if we have more than 50% of female participation \u2013 as it also speaks to the urgency of the challenge. Also, the metric of \u201cWill we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators with Women as Moderators?\u201d might not be so relevant, as the key to a having a functional SPO business is having sufficient pledge and delegation. Namely, having a sudden surge in female-led SPOs that are unprofitable would not do much for women\u2019s participation, as without sufficient pledge we could be setting up these female-led new SPOs for failure. If this challenge is not funded, I would suggest to the proposer to resubmit with a presentation of some data concerning the current state-of-play in Cardano \u2013 and then to try to improve on those metrics where female participation is proven to be too low. Why? Because the basis of this challenge is presupposed on a low participation of women, which may be true \u2013 but is currently a guesstimate. Also, it would be important to avoid token participation in order to just improve metrics. For example, we might attract a proposal that will finance women to attend Catalyst townhalls \u2013 which will improve the metric \u201cIncrease the number of women attendance in Catalyst Townhall\u201d. However, token attendance might not be the key. The community benefits from active participation \u2013 not just attendance.

Also, not only women would be able to submit proposals in this challenge, but everyone who wants to onboard more women into Catalyst and Cardano. I don\u2019t see any big difficulties for the community to come up with solutions and ideas to be submitted in this challenge. The challenge team for this proposal has not been defined, which is not ideal, but the proposal has 4 proposers in total, and I believe at least one of them would be interested in taking part on the challenge team, and if this is not the case, I believe it won\u2019t be difficult to find interested community members to be there as well.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The KPIs presented are all related to women\u2019s participation in Catalyst.

It would be interesting to add some KPIs related to the success of proposals submitted by women that are not focused on onboard more women in Catalyst, and these could be general KPIs, like number of users using their dApps, number of transactions and total amount of ADA transacted, and other similar KPIs.

Diversity is a positive concept from any point of view, helping us to confront our own biases while acknowledging and respecting that different ways of being are not necessarily our own. An initiative dedicated to attracting more women would be very beneficial for Cardano, and from that perspective, I believe it would be aligned with its mission.

To put it simply, how can we accelerate the number of women involved in the Cardano ecosystem? (As being stated in the title). One of Cardano\u2019s core values is to represent the unrepresented, and involve them in realizing their potential (which would in turn be highly relevant to this challenge). Basically, it addresses a real world problem with a real world solution (Addressing strategic goal number 3)\nThe proposed challenge brief underlines that more diversity will lead to a broader perspective (and thereby development). \n\nI agree that nuanced perspectives is vital in innovation and collaboration, from my experiences as a researcher of social behavior and pedagogy. A creative and broad perspective will aid the possibility of creating innovative collaborations and thereby attract both new proposers and developers (strategic goal number 2 and 4, although there is no mentions of open source within the proposal). \u2028The proposers of this challenge setting are numerous, which leads me to believe that there is both commitment, dedication and a wide variety of expertise in the challenge team. (Addressing strategic goal number 1). \n\nChallenge settings that are outside the box, not limited by areas of expertise but a broader scope (like this one being based on equality and inclusion rather than for example dApp integration) will attract different types of proposals, and may end up with cross-scientific collaborations. Historically, cross-scientific collaborations is what ended up in fantastic innovations like the transistor radio, so I see great benefits of having this approach to this challenge setting. \u2028\u2028Overall, I strongly agree that this proposal is in alignment with taking steps towards achieving Cardano\u2019s mission.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned under \u2019impact\u2019, the broad scope of this challenge setting (equality and inclusion) will grant proposers for this potential challenge a lot of freedom in submitting their intended proposals.

Especially since similar challenge settings has been present during previous funds, and the discussions on this topic is present in the discord groups, telegram channels and in After Town Hall-meetings. \n\nThe Challenge budget of 200 000 USD is large enough to make an impact by allowing a number of proposals to be funded, but still substantially smaller than most other Challenge settings. So the benefits overweigh the risks, in my opinion. Depending on if the challenge team would deem it more valuable to have lots of smaller proposals funded or a couple larger ambitious ones, I would suggest putting a budget cap limit for each proposal submitting to this challenge.
