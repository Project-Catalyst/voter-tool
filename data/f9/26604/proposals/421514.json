How to measure or weigh which locality has a booming and which doesn't?\n\nDevelopment of local communities is important due to the wide variety of social, economic and political aspects in different regions of the planet, but there is not enough information to clearly understand how important this challenge setting is for the Cardano mission.\n\nThere is a similar challenge that has already obtained funds in several Catalyst Funds called Scale-UP Cardano Community Hubs and seems to have the same purpose, but with a much more detailed context that allows us to understand the magnitude for Cardano.\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/414312-48088\n\nI would recommend that the proposer of this challenge setting provide more details like the example above.\n\nThis challenge setting is in line with items 1 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Cardano has a very distributed community in different regions, it is one of the most engaged blockchains, probably the third most engaged, if we consider the number of members on social media such as Reddit and Twitter. This means that there are people with different financial, political and social backgrounds in different regions of the world, which is an upside to understand that the community has the capacity to address this challenge setting.\n\nAs I mentioned in the alignment rationale, challenges aimed at developing local solutions have already been present in some Catalyst Funds, mainly through the Scale-UP Cardano Community Hubs challenge that has already been present in 4 previous Catalyst Funds and has shown a reasonable demand for proposals by the Cardano community. Due to the great similarity between the concept of the two challenges, I believe that the demand can be projected based on the demand of the Scale-UP Cardano Community Hubs challenge, which in Fund 8 had $500,000 USD of available budget and had about $1.6M USD in total budgets. requested among 70 proposals, a moderate demand in relation to the other challenge settings.\n\nOne point that makes it difficult to assess feasibility is that this challenge setting contains very few details, does not provide potential directions and clarity to adequately understand how the community can address the challenge.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The definition of success is subjective and does not help to assess the outcome of this challenge setting.\n\n3 bullet points were defined as the definition of success:\n\n\"Involvement of business and non-profit sectors as use case owners\" This definition doesn't bring the notion of magnitude.

I suggest attaching some information about these specific places. This way, future challenge proposers will have better understanding of what is expected of this challenge.

I propose evolving on these ideas, and present more details of what would these goals look like when reached.\nKPIs also require more clarifications. It is just mentioned as before, the Catalyst participation set as key metric is not enough to be an intrinsic metric for success under this challenge. This requires more specific details that can be taken as an KPI.\nFor the KPI, \"Change in number of projects in region\", it is necessary to define what a region is.

Also, supporting these places contributes to centralization, instead of decentralization. Since this challenge proposal is not well defined, it is difficult to assess its aligment with the goals stated in Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10.

And, as mentioned previously, the region is not well defined. 2) \u201cCatalyst participation\u201d.

It is argued that a greater focus and budget should be allocated to projects that seek to establish or strengthen Cardano's presence in local communities with a booming blockchain industry. In spite of the fact that the intention of the author of the proposals can be understood, there are no valid criteria, at least provided within the challenge setting, allowing the identification of such communities. In order to have a clearer understanding of the geographical areas mentioned by the author, I decided to use the presence of startup concentrations as a criterion. As a reference the article presented in StartUs Insights (shorturl.at/dxAHW) who made and analysis of the geographic distribution of global activity in the blockchain startup field and found that the top 5 hubs (in terms of number of startups) are Silicon Valley, London, New York City, Singapore, and L.A. They are home to 1,061 startups and account for 34% of global startup activity. Other hubs would be Toronto, Paris, Zug, Hong Kong and Amsterdam to complete the top 10. A perfect example of the author's argument is the impact Cardano had on the recent Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, from which I can infer an indirect connection with Cardano's mision. As well as meeting one of the four strategic metrics we have for the next fund.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Although the focus of this project is to establish some blockchain hubs in these cities that will allow Cardano to be exposed to a wider audience and enhance its synergy with a demographic segment of society that has a passion for everything blockchain-related. Catalyst has had challenges focused on community building since its inception, so while this is a relatively new approach, I do not see any impediments that indicate the community does not have the capacity to respond or any limitations. Based on the data available on historical Catalyst funding, I cannot find sufficient proposals seeking funding to build in these major cities, except for Japan. Tokyo may not appear in the list of major cities mentioned in the reference article, but it may qualify for this type of challenge. Taking into account my previous argument, and the fact that a budget of $500,000 is requested, which represents almost 4% of the total funding available for the next fund, I assign a score of 4.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The description of success is ambiguous, for example, what is meant by \"developer community\"? In case this challenge is chosen for the next fund, I don't think that the definition of the metrics will be a problem for future proposers, because from my experience, the expected metrics should not be highly technical and easily verifiable. Unfortunately, they present a very generic set of metrics, making them difficult to measure and without a clear focus. Fortunately, the challenge brief includes some questions that can be used as a guide.

Unfortunately there really aren't any descriptions of such things here.\n\nFor coming into alignment with the Fund10 goals this proposal should be presenting information on what kinds of existing regions with blockchain communities it is talking about (does it have to be blockchain?  Could it be highly technical communities with blockchain principles like decentralization or interoperability?  Or what about dense locations like southeastern Washington State in the US, where cheap power concentrates several hundred petahashes worth of blockchain computing power?) Are there communities that embody opensource, like maybe San Francisco with the Linux Foundation?  Beyond just needing more clarity on the possible \"where\", there is the very real question of \"how\"... though it is presented as an open question, there really does need to be some vision presented here of what kind of approaches would lead to alignment with the Fund10 goals:  how do these community hubs help prepare contributors, what kinds of real world problems would they be addressing, and how would they be improving processes and tools in the ecosystem?\n\nBecause these are left unaddressed in the proposal, I find that I cannot agree that there will be good alignment with the short and long term goals of Cardano, except within the narrow area of adoption.  2 stars for alignment.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Because alignment is shaky at best, feasibility really doesn't stand a chance.

It is essential as it helps reach out to people to spread awareness about the Cardano blockchain and helps bring them into the ecosystem by being among them in their communities. Most of the people who are in Crypto have come through online mediums. However, many people are hesitant to invest in protocols they came to know online, especially when it relates to investing money. Hence, establishing community hubs and showing the practical way of getting into the Cardano blockchain by investing or participating in efforts via Catalyst will help bring those people into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe language barrier is another problem barring the participation of the non-English populace. Many proposals in the past or currently in other challenges are presently addressing this issue. The people in many countries do not speak or understand English which becomes a hurdle to onboard those people into the Cardano ecosystem. Establishing communities with support in local languages will solve this issue. \n\nThis challenge will help two of the strategic goals. 1) Preparing people who will be willing & able to contribute to Cardano, 2) Accelerate the growth of the developer & app ecosystem by bringing the developers who, in the absence of community hubs, would not have come to Cardano.\n\nWe cannot immediately expect the highest number of votes with this challenge, but over time this challenge will help bring more people into Catalyst who will be prepared to vote.
