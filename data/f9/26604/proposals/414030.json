I believe that the team could have better presented the context of the African continent and the importance of this for Cardano as well as citing sources for the various information presented.\n\ne.g.\n\"However, the other blockchain protocols recognize the potential of crypto in Africa, without concrete sustained action, Cardano risks losing a potential $1 trillion in market share of the African market to other blockchains within the next 3 years.\"\n\nWhat blockchains are developing in Africa and why would Cardano lose market share in the next few years?\n\nI think it's important to make it clear that hundreds of proposals dedicated to Africa have already been funded in Catalyst and IOG injected $6M USD into projects based in Africa in 2021, through cFund. (Not counting companies that are investing millions like World Mobile)\n\nhttps://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/25/blockchain-fund-injecting-6m-to-support-africa-s-pioneers/\n\nI believe that a description of the African continent landscape and the potential of the Cardano x Africa relationship would be more appropriate for the challenge brief:\n\nThe African continent has a peculiar characteristic in relation to other continents, the demographic conditions. The African population is younger and has been growing more than on other continents, this signals that there will be a huge workforce with great productive potential, these characteristics create a promising scenario for the African economy.\n\nhttps://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africas-demographic-transition\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/20/by-2050-a-quarter-of-the-worlds-people-will-be-african-this-will-shape-our- future\n\nAnother important factor is the technological and banking system lag of much of Africa. This lag creates a scenario where technological leapfrog becomes more likely. In many African countries, a large part of the population is unbanked, so it becomes attractive for these unbanked Africans to opt for blockchain-based services and solutions. Offering blockchain solutions to people who live in more developed countries such as Germany, Canada or Japan does not have the same effect as the population of these countries already has services that serve them well enough, which makes many not interested in adopting blockchain. solutions.\n\nIn addition to the above reasons, we also have the option of helping populations that need support due to economic and social problems. It is an alignment of interests that makes the development of projects in Africa something very desirable.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why IOG and Cardano give importance to the development of Cardano-based solutions in Africa.\n\nThis challenge is in line with items 1, 2 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The \"Grow Africa, Grown Cardano\" challenge has already been present in Funds 5, 6, 8 and is present in the current Fund 9. In Fund 8 the challenge was the 2nd most competitive, with an available budget of $250,000 USD and 56 proposals were submitted with an added value of around $1.7M. The available budget/requested budget ratio was 6.9x.\n\nThese numbers indicate a high demand for proposals dedicated to Africa.\n\nDespite the challenge setting establishing a priority focus on proposals aimed at improving infrastructure and education, there is no limitation on the type of solution created, only the geographic limitation for the African community, so it is a broad scope and should not impose difficulties for the Cardano community and the feasibility of this challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success is reasonable, but I think the challenge should have provided more detail on infrastructure and education development. A challenge setting needs not only to sell itself to the voting stage, it is important to remember that if it is approved and funded, proposers will have to read the challenge brief and create proposals based on it, so the more details the better the outcome.\n\nThe definition of success did not consider a time window for measuring success, I would recommend including it so that the outcome of this challenge is more tangible.\n\nThe key metrics seem appropriate for the context of the challenge and intend to measure the number of people onboard (users, PAs, developers, proposers and voters), partnerships with institutions, number of solutions in infrastructure and education. I would only recommend including more qualitative metrics in relation to the projects developed, user retention level, developers, PAs, onboard proposers and voters and performance of PAs and proposers in Catalyst (what percentage of funded proposals and overall score of onboarded proposers? performance of PAs at the assessment stage).

Outside of Charles vision, Africa itself based on various reports, with the assumption of a trajectory free of conflict, will become a region with exponential growth in the upcoming years. Hence the heavy infrastructure investments by various nations ranging from US, France and most notable China. With China being a nation that is well underway to develop their own blockchain and add to that their existing efforts to win influence from African governments, Cardano needs to focus all their efforts in ensuring their goal of adoption in Africa is achieved.\n\nOur community should understand we will most likely go against China in terms of blockchain adoption. China itself, in a recent UN referendum, the majority of African nations overwhelmingly support China in any decision. This in my view should serve as a warning for Cardano. To either step up their efforts by providing more assistance and funding, or just leave Africa all together. All under the premise of China's influence and China's goal of creating their own blockchain. On should understand that China is the leading nation by a lot in term of quantum technology.

Cardano is all hands aboard in terms of developing Africa, what they should understand is to not be complacent but push further. Ensure all Africans are influenced by Cardano for rest assure China is not far along with their blockchain initiatives.\n\nContinuous support and development of this Challenge Setting is key. Shying away or being complacent at this point of involvement in Africa will become a huge setback for Cardano.

Under this challenge, a diverse set of projects have already been funded, e.g. \u201cGrow Wada, Grow cardano\u201d, \u201cCardano student clubs in Ethiopia\u201d, \u201cTheCatalystSchool - focusing Africa\u201d, therefore, having this challenge for Fund 10 will keep us on track of mainstream adoption of Cardano in Africa.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "What success looks like section explains about Innovative community building along with Web3 education, eventually helping big scale adoption of Cardano.

The reason is that this challenge has been around for at least the past 4 funds or so.

The Cardano partnership with the Ethiopian Government and the launch of World Mobile Token in the Africa are the testimonies of the importance of the Africa region for Cardano. It, thus, makes perfect sense to keep developing innovative solutions focused on this region for growing the presence of Cardano and also helping the people form there to have access to the financial and other services which were not available to them otherwise. \nThis challenge perfectly aligns with all these goals and is very critical to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This challenge is already part of the Fund 9 and we have seen many great proposals being submitted by the community members under this challenge.

Most African countries lack the most basic infrastructure. This challenge is needed to achieve Cardano mission and the strategic goals specific to fund 9. I have to say that this challenge has been included in more than one fund now and I\u2019m curious to see what results it has yielded over the few rounds that it\u2019s been up. This will allow us to see how we can improve the challenge. That said, Africa is a fertile ground that needs to be nurtured. I believe that blockchain technology can solve most of the problems that countries are facing in Africa. We have to think of ways to promote financial inclusion which is one of the biggest problems of Africa. Something needs to be done in order to give Africa the capacity to be an active part of the world economy. Another area of focus is transparency. In that regard, Cardano offers the decentralization needed to fight corruption. We can think of tools like Atala prism which is a decentralized identity tool that we can use to build better systems in Africa. Why not explore the power of DAOs to promote better ways of governance. Let\u2019s not forget about education which is the pillar of society development. This challenge is also a must in the Cardano ecosystem as we can create solutions to bank the unbanked which is one of Cardano's primary Cardano missions. Succeeding in this, can change billions of people\u2019s lives.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. I have high confidence in the feasibility of this challenge because there are a lot of tools that can help proposers come up with great solutions. Proposers have the opportunity to create products for the future of Africa. Billions of people can be onboarded by educating and solving real world solutions in this challenge. I think that in this challenge, the proposers should focus on education. Teaching people the benefits of blockchain technology is a must, especially young people, entrepreneurs and developers. Another route that potential proposers can explore is by creating hubs that focus on onboarding new catalyst members. The network needs more proposers, PA, CA and more roles.  Moreover the challenge should include proposals that focus on building real use case applications that have direct impacts on the local community lives. Financial applications such as microlending or crypto to local fiat conversion dapps can be good examples that can help a lot of local communities in Africa. Furthermore, finding a way to involve local institutions can be another path for potential proposers of this challenge. Regarding the budget, I think that it sounds realistic to achieve the challenge goals. However, I think that in the future, with more proposers, the budget should be increased.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This challenge is well written and it includes some metrics that can help measure success. It\u2019s important that potential proposers take these into account when they submit their proposals. One of the key metrics to measure is the number of proposals offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns. Education being an important part of this challenge, encouraging more proposals related to education is a great idea. Potential proposers should keep this in mind and think outside the box in order to propose top notch educational solutions. Moreover the challenge includes another metric which will track the number of wallets created and signed-ups in platforms built by proposers. They also want to measure the number of new African catalyst members onboarded by proposers. Many Africans are not aware of the catalyst program and the benefits it can offer. Potential proposers have the opportunity to find ways to attract and onboard new members. Amongst these new members can be some developers. Africa and the Cardano network need more developers who can build applications and real world solutions for the masses. So I think that potential proposers should focus on onboarding new developers in the ecosystem. In a nutshell, these are the metrics that proposers should focus on in order to deliver great solutions for this challenge.

The proposed focus on infrastructure and education hints that the low hanging fruits have been picked. That is not a reason in itself to not support the challenge, but we have to look to Cardano ecosystem as a whole to see what gives most return on intent.\nAlso, the challenge is not aligned with the strategic goals from IOG for the next fund.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The current fund (in fund 9) has several proposals regarding education and community infrastructure.

By having this challenge setting, it allows people from African countries to receive funds for their projects and ideas to grow Cardano in their communities. This proposal addresses the first strategic goal because it will definitely create a group of individuals who are ready to make contributions to the ecosystem. There are many key metrics to guide future proposers when they make their own proposals, such as creating a proposal that can address key issues that prevent Cardano from expanding in Africa or onboarding new users and developers. Local impact and local partnerships are also a huge part of this challenge setting, which will definitely prepare more people to contribute to Cardano. The challenge setting also addresses the 2nd strategic goal by attracting new developers who might one day create new open-source projects to further Cardano\u2019s growth in Africa. I can\u2019t guarantee that this will happen, but having the challenge setting in fund 10 is the start that is required to make more open-source projects in Africa (not having the challenge setting prevents these things from happening in the first place). The challenge setting addresses the 3rd strategic goal by encouraging proposers to offer solutions to the real-world problems they see that can help Cardano grow faster in Africa. As the challenge setting states, there has been over $105 billion in growth in the crypto market in Africa, but there are many problems to expanding that potential to $1 trillion. Some of the real-world solutions that can come out of this challenge setting, such as language-specific content or even community hubs (both very useful solutions) can help make the small steps towards Cardano\u2019s expansion in Africa. Lastly, the challenge setting can address the fourth strategic goal of \u201cimproving tooling to support human processes in Catalyst\u201d through some of the projects that arise from the funding provided. For example, proposals that offer solutions to infrastructure and education problems would help improve some of the more human aspects of Catalyst \u2013 specifically the ability for people to more easily get into Catalyst and build their own solutions. This proposal is very foundational in nature. By providing the funding for African proposals, it opens the doors for more people to grow their ideas that can support others with their journeys as well. (score given: 5)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given what I have seen from past funds, the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge. Grow Cardano, Grow Africa is an active challenge setting in fund 9 with about 90 proposals submitted to Ideascale. Not all of those proposals will be funded in fund 9, meaning that there will be demand for the same category in fund 10. The more times that Grow Cardano, Grow Africa is a challenge setting, the more people there will be from African countries who participate in Catalyst, increasing the demand and interest in this challenge setting. In the Grow Cardano, Grow Africa challenge, there were only 48 proposals in fund 6, then 83 in fund 8, and now 93 in fund 9 \u2013 this data shows the growth in this challenge setting over the past year. I have previously reviewed many proposals in this challenge setting from past funds, so I can say from my own experience that there are many amazing proposals and ideas, proving that the Cardano community has the capacity to address this challenge setting. Some notable examples include the African Town Hall, African Catalyst School, and Wildlife Conservation NFTs (among many other great project ideas). The budget of the challenge setting (500,000 ADA) is reasonable. In the past, the Grow Cardano, Grow Africa challenge setting had a budget of $500,000, but it makes sense to keep the value of 500,000 in ADA because it maintains the same relative value compared to the total amount of ADA allocated to fund 10 challenge settings. Overall, many proposals will be funded from this challenge setting, which is what is most important.

The proposers listed many good KPIs that future proposers can use to guide their projects. For example, the number of proposals offering solutions to education and infrastructure problems, number of new Africa-based Catalyst members, and number of African developers onboarded in 2023 are all very easy metrics that can be tracked by the Cardano community. However, I think the proposers could have provided some more specific KPIs related to their focus areas. For example, if the proposers wanted to have a KPI for the number of new Cardano community members, they could have added a KPI regarding the number of new community hubs created. This idea is just one possible metric that the proposers could have added to make their KPIs slightly more specific. Most of the KPIs listed in the proposal were with regards to measuring the success of this challenge setting, rather than providing metrics for future proposers to follow when making their proposals. As such, I would recommend to the proposers that they include some of these specific KPIs in their future challenge setting should they be selected for fund 10. Despite this issue, I did appreciate how they listed local impact and local partnerships as a KPI because these metrics are purposefully broad, allowing for future proposers to interpret them in any way they see fit. Thus, it can create healthy competition between proposals that might have varying levels of scope and target audience.

However, still many African countries lack proper banking infrastructure, due to which money lenders charge very high-interest rates on loans, and the African population faces high fees in transmittance from other countries.

The number of resisting institutions is relatively low. Small blockchain projects have room to grow quickly and have a large scale impact on the national level. This means higher expected return and success for the money invested. \n\nThe challenge is focused especially on infrastructure and education. In many African nations there is a requirement but also an opportunity to build the whole stack of infrastructure on a decentralized basis. This means that communities of people run and maintain these systems which somewhere else are maintained by corporations or institutions. Because of fast growth in the need for services, there is a fast growth in the need for talents and education. Focusing on these two factors provides required inputs for growth and prevents bottlenecks from forming. Communities building real world solutions for themselves, is more than well aligned with the strategic goals of the Fund. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Setting up decentralized community controlled infrastructure, requires things like for example identity tooling and reputation systems. These are currently under rapid growth and development in Cardano ecosystem, so fund by fund it becomes more feasible to utilize those opportunities. \n\nAlso, the development of other blockchain infrastructure and tools as well as the awareness of opportunities improve the possibilities to start successfully tackling the real world problems where they exist.

Not only that, Africa is an area that has high financial potential. Looking at the current proposals in the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano in Fund9, I see a lot of proposals presented that are aligned with the overall objectives of project catalyst, such as growing the Cardano community and furthering the adoption of the Cardano blockchain system (i.e. more blockchain applications based on Cardano, etc.). However, after doing a non-exhaustive search of the Fund10 challenge settings category, I found 6 settings with a similar idea (challenge settings for growth in a specific area of the world). I think that the challenge settings focused on gathering proposals that seek growth at upcoming economies can be categorized in the same challenge because even though they are targeted at a specific area, they have many in common in my opinion. Overall, I agree with this challenge settings getting included in the next round of funding so that it can gain an even bigger platform to achieve its goals because even though it may have similar theme with other challenge settings, it\u2019s also not a bad idea to target the Africa region since it is an emerging economies that is vital to the future growth of the blockchain ecosystem.

A more pertinent question will be to ask how much of this is in the Cardano ecosystem? It will not be far fetched to think its not that much.\nCardano is a blockchain with a strong focus on Africa, as formally stated  in Cardano's strategic goals. However it stands to lose a significant portion of the African market if sustained action is not carried out to bring more people on board, and educating them on the benefits of investing in the Cardano blockchain rather than the others available on the market.\nCardano must become a front runner when it comes to the crypto market, not a distant follower.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As stated, a more focused approach to addressing infrastructure provision and onboarding education can go a long way to bring Africa up to speed on the digital currency economy.\nMore funds can, and should be allocated to projects focused on growing Cardano in Africa.

This makes them feel more scared than excited.\nBut African countries are different, they want their people's lives better, and their people are willing to change so they can rise and change their lives.\nCardano aims to make it easy for African people to get loans to improve their lives. To do that will need to have decentralized applications that solve the problems of identity verification, appraisal, consulting, and community building.\nThis challenge is essential to Cardano's future goals.

Because they will have the opportunity to study and work at faster internet speeds with talented mentors around the world.\nWith a rapidly growing young and tech-savvy population in Africa. I think the requirements from the Challenge will be met and fulfilled by the Cardano community in Africa.

Or all those proposals are just for money and stop when the results are completed.\nWe need more than that; we need sustainable business models and are not too dependent on cash flow from Catalyst. Catalyst is a place to help start-up ideas, not just a place to provide money to do work and tasks.\nI think that's what Cardano and Catalyst are aiming for in the future.
