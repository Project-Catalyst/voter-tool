For the first strategic goal (preparing a group of individuals to make contributions to the ecosystem), the challenge setting encourages people to develop their projects for different end-user products and integrations. Almost all end-user use cases are covered in this challenge setting. For example, hardware, Defi, climate change, national governance systems, and business solutions (there were many more listed in the proposal itself) are all different products that proposers can request funds to develop/build to benefit the Cardano blockchain. I really appreciate how the proposers included a \u201cconsiderations for proposers\u201d section at the bottom of the proposal because the tips would be incredibly useful for anyone hoping to propose a solution. Some tips mentioned include, determining the difference between existing solutions and proposed solutions, determining what other development tools are needed for success, and whether the blockchain is ready for this solution right now. These tips would help any proposers in this challenge setting to better develop their proposal. After reading the challenge setting proposal, I think that any proposer who gives deep thought into the provided information will be able to make a successful proposal in this challenge setting.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the second strategic goal (build open-source ecosystem and onboard new developers) by attracting new developers to the ecosystem. This challenge setting, alone, can cover lots of different challenge settings, so when developers see that such a huge pool of funds are dedicated to supporting their endeavors, they are more likely to participate. Some of the other focus areas, such as social media, gaming, and artificial intelligence, are all rapidly expanding fields, so more and more developers are looking for ways to get into it. As for the \u201copen-source\u201d part of the strategic goal, I think this will be addressed, should proposals in the challenge setting be committed to open-source development.\n\nThe challenge setting addresses the third strategic goal for fund 9 (build real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain) because this entire challenge setting is about building products and integrations for the community. Climate change, transport/logistics, insurance, mediation, and legal are all focus areas that will have a huge impact on the lives of people in real life. There is a tangible impact that can be attained. One example would be a DApp that can manage logistics for large companies. This idea by itself has the potential to save billions of dollars for companies because they can manage their ever-growing systems using blockchain technology. The possibilities are endless for real-world impact from this challenge setting.\n\nFor the fourth strategic goal (improving tooling to support human processes in Catalyst), the challenge setting addresses it slightly more tangentially by covering wallet development and hardware. New devices and wallets that allow people to vote increases the participation in the Cardano governance systems (specifically Catalyst). The more wallets and pieces of hardware that are available to the community, the more people who will join the Cardano ecosystem and participate in Catalyst. Some of these integrations might even include Catalyst itself, making Catalyst easier to enter for newcomers. As a result, there are many possibilities for how this challenge setting can support human processes in Catalyst. Since the proposal addresses all four strategic goals, with some being more covered than others, I can give this proposal a score of 5 for alignment. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on my past knowledge of Cardano and Catalyst, I think that the Cardano community has the capability to address this challenge. In fund 8, there were 339 proposals under challenge settings that are encompassed by this single challenge setting proposal. In fund 9, that number was 668. Based on this information alone, I can say that there will certainly be enough participation from the community to make this challenge setting lively and vibrant. Not every proposal in fund 9 will be funded, so many of those unfunded proposers will return in fund 10, which is where this challenge setting comes in. There is a huge demand from the community for all sorts of different products and integrations, such as Defi, wallets, marketplaces, etc. Thus, it will be incredibly critical to have this challenge setting to kickstart the development of those projects. The challenge setting budget of 3,000,000 ADA is definitely good given the huge scope of this challenge setting. In fund 9, roughly $7.85 million is allocated to DApps, products, and integrations (definitely an anomaly in terms of the huge budget). Despite this, I believe that 3 million ADA is reasonable because it will allow for a huge number of proposals to be funded, while also leaving some funds for other challenge settings. There will always be more product ideas, so the budget needs to reflect that, which it does. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the information provided by the proposers, this challenge setting clearly defines some measures of success for the focus areas. For every single focus area given as an example, the proposers also provided a list of KPIs/metrics of success for those areas. For hardware, it is the number of users, number of items sold, number of interactions with hardware solutions. For climate change, it is the total number of users, tons of CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness produced, number of people changing environmentally damaging practices. These are just some examples of the detail that the proposers of the challenge setting went into to provide proposers with ideas for how they can audit success for their own proposals. The proposers also purposely left the list of measures of success open-ended by saying that the list was \u201cnot exhaustive\u201d which is important because it can create healthy competition between proposals. Each proposal in the challenge setting can come up with their own ways of measuring success. Thus, there will be a variety of different metrics that will be seen in fund 10. The metrics of success were well-scoped, but also inclusive of other ideas that might not have been included in the challenge setting proposal.

Blockchain can be compared to the \"operating system\", which the vast majority do not know how it works and most likely do not care, but the applications developed are what make blockchain technology revolutionary at a global level and this challenge opens space for these applications and integrations to be funded\n\nThis challenge represents one of the seven challenge categories participating in the Funding Categories and I believe that among the seven defined categories, it is the challenge/category with the broadest scope. Products and Integrations is about blockchain integration with the end user and there are several types of applications and integrations that can be used in blockchain, some categories such as DeFi, NFTs, marketplaces are broad enough to allow a challenge of their own as has happened before in Catalyst , but the concept here is exactly to have less specificity in order to embrace these subcategories at once, this avoids a recurring problem in Catalyst, winners take all and losers run out of funds, that's because challenges with popular themes like DeFi and NFTs tend to have greater visibility and shadow challenge settings that would also be linked to products and services that in many cases end up not having space in the current Catalyst model.\n\nThis challenge is critical to the Cardano mission not only because it is Cardano's showcase to the end user and the channel through which Cardano will achieve mass adoption but also because this is an appropriate time for the challenge. The timing is important because with the Vasil upgrade the blockchain will have a considerable improvement in scalability and performance necessary for applications that need to present a good user experience.\n\nConsidering the wide range of proposals submitted in the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge in Fund 9, it is possible to infer that the challenge can cover all 4 items established in the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals, however, when analyzing objectively, item 3 is the which indicates a strong connection with this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Products & Integrations challenge was proposed as one of the \"Funding Categories\" in the previous Fund and was ranked third in the voting stage of Fund 8. In addition, another similarly themed challenge \"dApps, Products & Integrations\" was ranked sixth. in the voting stage and was also approved and funded in F8.\nIt turned out that due to the similarity between the two challenges they were merged resulting in a challenge with a budget of $7.85M dollars.\n\nThe potential directions of proposals in this challenge are diverse, such as Integrations with Hardware, DeFi, Gaming, Governance systems, Transport, Logistics, Social media, Marketplaces, Insurance, Wallets, Business solutions, Artificial intelligence, among others. The Cardano community has already developed in all the above categories and I will mention some teams that have already been funded by Catalyst as a reference.\n\ne.g.\n\nHardware - Integration with Ledger\nDeFi - Liqwid, Minswap, Indigo, Maladex\nGaming - Playermint, Adaquest\nGovernance - SWARM, PHOTREK, Catalyst Circle\nMarketplaces - Adosia, NFT-MAKER\nInsurance - Ensuro\nWallets - Nami\nArtificial Intelligence - Nunet\n\nThese projects are just a small sample of the enormous demand that exists for development in the theme of this challenge.\n\nIn Fund 9, the community submitted more than 400 proposals for this challenge. These data indicate great demand from the community in this niche and bring confidence that the community has full capacity to create a large number of proposals.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The established definition of success is clear and objective. Key metrics were defined for the challenge and individual success metrics were also defined for the subcategories suggested as potential directions, this makes the verification of success in the outcome of this challenge clearer.

The first reason is obvious, it was the category that attracted the largest number of proposals and therefore the one that probably will make the greatest contributions to the ecosystem (at least referring to the number of users involved, it is not my intention to make an assessment here on their quality or scope, since it is too early to determine it).\nOn the other hand, it is also evident that it has the capacity to promote ideas that help support human processes in Catalyst, given that through this challenge, in Fund9 proposals such as: \"Chatbot AI for Project Catalyst\", \"Catalyst Proposal Assistant [SDA]\" and \"Catalyst Research & Voter Tool\", to mention a few, were submitted. Again, it is not my purpose here to provide an assessment of the above proposals, I just think it is worth mentioning them as proof of the challenge's ability to generate value according to the strategic goals, at least in intention.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As I mentioned in my previous rationale, based on the current fund, this category has had a high level of engagement from the community, with more than 45K idea views and more than 1K comments at the time of writing this assessment, which demonstrates the ability of the Catalyst community to meet this challenge.\nRegarding the budget of 3,000,000 ADA, it is realistic and balanced compared to the budget allocated to the other categories proposed by the PACE team as a whole, which by the way, was the result of a voting process by the community before finalizing the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unlike the way in which challenges are currently formulated, part of the idea of the shift to the Funding Categories modality, is that the categories do not change as do the challenges in each Fund today, therefore the metrics are not particular to the Fund or the challenge.\nInstead, the team proposes a non-exhaustive list of potential success metrics according to the type of proposal, as a guide for the proposer as to what would be some examples of KPIs to implement.\nReviewing the aforementioned list, I consider that the metrics are appropriate and serve as a clear example to the proponents to help them demonstrate the auditability of their proposals, as well as to promote healthy competition among potential proposals.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3161", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7989, "q0": "Products and Integrations is 1 of the 7 funding categories that PACE intends to include.

In essence, they ask for the entire funding available in F10, and offer a unique distribution of funds along several categories which have been previously selected by the community through a complex mechanism, culminating with an open vote for whomever wanted to take part. Any voter entirely supporting their approach should thus vote for the encompassing \u201cFunding Categories Full Fund\u201d. If, however, one feels that the approach goes a bit too far, this proposal is simply one piece of PACE\u2019s puzzle. \n\nThis challenge is peculiar since it reached its shape following an open but intricate process. This fresh alternative to the classical challenge setting process overcomes many of its downsides (low entry barriers for malicious actors, unilateral budget weighting, limited understanding of challenge teams, suboptimal time consumption, etc.) and aims to be more efficient, flexible, scalable as well as legitimate. Let\u2019s see if it also has the capacity to deliver on of the strategic goals from Fund 9. \n\nCan it help prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem? Yes it can, since it will focus on providing funding to development teams across a multitude of areas, from hardware and physical products, all the way to DeFi, gaming, wallets, artificial intelligence, legal applications and many others. This challenge casts a very wide net and is as broad as it gets in terms of scope. Are there groups willing and able to rise up to the challenge? Such groups are already present in the Catalyst scene, and the need for funding will only increase in the future - look only at the increasing competition from the previous two rounds, including this one. There are many teams out there ready to pick up a shovel, jump on board and start building things.  \n\nCan it turn Cardano into an open source project and attract developers? I would argue that attracting developers is a clear yes, since the challenge makes no distinction between projects needing developers and other types of proposals that require non-developer skills. Hence developers will be able to compete within the challenge along with any other team. The budget is generous enough to allow both mature teams as well as allowing the small scale builders to compete and flourish. Is this also the case for open-source projects? The answer here has to be nuanced a bit. It appears that there are no additional entry barriers for closed source products, however this should be judged against the fact that ADA holders are voting on projects, and they are ultimately the enforcers of this strategic goal, hence the burden lies on them more than on the challenge to exclude closed source proposals. \n\nCan it help build real-world solutions based on the Cardano? Absolutely, since there is a huge expectation from the Cardano community that such solutions be built and we have proven real world solutions being built or at least experimented with: Atala Prism and Coti Pay spring to my mind right away, but we can of course fill pages of such examples. And all of these projects, and many new ones, will necessitate additional funding to build additional features and carry on experimenting until reaching financial stability and enough real world traction to be independent from Catalyst funding.\n \nCan this challenge improve tooling to support human processes in Catalyst? To a lesser extent I dare to argue, since this challenge will not be focused on the Catalyst ecosystem. This does not imply however that projects that improve the human processes will not be present, I merely say that their presence will be the exception rather than the rule. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Does the Cardano community have the capacity to address this challenge? Its capacity to address this challenge is undeniable. The strongest argument is the fact that Catalyst has already been running for quite some rounds, the last two of which being fully-fledged in terms of overall budget, and we have seen a consistent, and increasing, number of teams and proposals sprouting within it, across all previous challenges. This F9 alone has a 6.8X competition, thus requests for funding almost seven times higher than the available funds.  \n\nIs the budget realistic and reflecting the requirements of the challenge? In this case, the budget has been established following a vote open to all community members, secured by a few gatekeepers that anonymised voters identity and the vote itself, thus ensuring a high level of trust as well as legitimacy. And the results of this vote have been transposed into the budgetary splits present in the challenge. Are the amounts realistic? The answer to this will definitely be clear post-factum, if we notice enough implementation capacity from the community in terms of sufficient projects, sufficient competition within each category as well as a general good quality of the projects submitted. But the budget is close to a wisdom-of-the-crowd solution, so there has to be merit behind it. Moreover, the budget is half of the one in the current round, where competition is already high. So the budget is definitely sufficient, and realistic, with no risks whatsoever that the community will come up with excellent proposals to fill the supply.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To assess the challenge\u2019s verifiability, we go one more time through the process of turning the verifiability statement from the guide into a fundamental question and answer it:  \n\n(1) Is the challenge well scoped in defining the measures of success? \nThe challenge is fairly well scoped in terms of defining the types of accepted proposals. We have a multitude of examples included, ranging from hardware and physical products, all the way to DeFi, gaming, wallets, artificial intelligence, legal applications and many others. The rather negative aspect is the fact that it ends with \u201cMany others\u201d thus losing scope, since there will be many questions from proposers and assessors down the road. Many more products? Many more integrations? Many more way-out-of-the-box proposals? How far can we stretch this net is thus not very clear, and a negative point from my point of view. \n\nThe more difficult task is in defining the objectives, since we don\u2019t have any, but this is a feature, and not a bug. PACE\u2019s philosophy is that the community collectively has to gather first of all enough knowledge to work with: data, feedback, problems, etc. Only then can it proceed to the creation of objectives within each individual category. One benefit of such an approach is that there is much more flexibility in terms of defining what objectives are important, and that we can have a matrix-style environment in which a certain proposal can help reach multiple objectives, across different categories. Another benefit is that incentivising teams / individuals can be done in multiple ways: we could have proposal based funding (the classical approach) as well as rapid funding (other similar attempts have sprouted in F7 too) as well as payment for full timers. The downside however, is that Catalyst currently does not have the tools in place to set these objectives independently from the funding categories. Therefore an extra step would be necessary to make the entire challenge functionable for the next round. How long would that take? Will it manage to muster enough support from the community, will it be legitimate? These are still unknown variables.    \n\n(2) Can the challenge drive healthy competition between proposals?\nThe very broad scope of the challenge also implies a good potential for competition. How healthy this competition will be it\u2019s a more tricky task, since first of all you would need to define the \u201cmarket\u201d to measure its competition. Should we be looking at the market in its broadest form, the entire challenge?. If so, we have a healthy ground for competition because the funding is fair game for everyone. Should we be looking at the market segments? In this case things are more nuanced, since we might perhaps see a lesser quality in a certain subdomain (physical products for instance) and hence lower funding in that space. Will we be able to state at that point that we need more targeted competition in order to increase the range of deliverables? Again, this will depend on setting the right objective. \n\nEnding with a high note, this is an extremely well thought out challenge, with a very informative website dedicated to it, that analyzes in great detail the many facets of this new funding philosophy. From my point of view, it passes with flying colors all of the checklists from the guide, is clear and leaves no room for interpretation, with the only caveat of the \u201cMany others\u201d item which should perhaps be reconsidered.

Too often we see blockchain or crypto projects die because either they deliver nothing useful or significant, or they deliver bad products, or they just delivered something good once or twice then stop building.

In the \u2018Full Fund\u2019 proposal the team have created 7 all encompassing categories to split the challenge into, rather than individual challenge setting briefs. The detail, effort and thought gone into the main proposal is astounding, so instead of risking its disapproval if it doesn\u2019t get the highest possible votes, I think the proposers are hedging their bets by putting each of the 7 categories as separate challenge proposals. I believe this is a relevant detail when examining this proposal as the categories or parts they have developed do indeed cover all of the Cardano Catalyst strategic goals, however, individual categories, such as this proposal do not necessarily achieve all the goals stated.\n\nSo, looking at this \u2018Products & Integrations\u2019 challenge setting proposal is in itself very familiar to anyone with experience in previous rounds. Within Fund 9, the successful \u2018Dapps, Products & Integrations\u2019 with over $7m ADA in funding attracted by far the highest number of proposals, over 600. The Products & Integrations category proposed for Fund 10 similarly allows for a vast range of proposals that allow creativity and innovation to achieve the Catalyst goals. It\u2019s worthy noting the time, effort and support the team have provided in the form of their https://docs.catalystcontributors.org documentation. This isn\u2019t simply a copy paste of the previous funds statements, although there are a lot of connections. \n\nIn terms of the strategic goals for challenge setting, this proposal clearly hits goals #2 and #3. Goal 2 describes turning Cardano open source and attracting more developers, within the scope of this products and integrations category there will be clear opportunities to complete this goal with an attractive budget possible for proposers. Even more directly, goal 3 describes Cardano blockchain being used to develop authentic solutions to current problems. Within the proposal description this is reiterated as a key focus, and it is likely to effectively contribute to the Cardano ecosystem through these new innovations.\n\nOverall, this challenge setting proposal of \u2018Products & Integrations\u2019 is a tried and tested category that brings value, people and energy to the Catalyst Cardano environment. I rate it 5 stars for its alignment to the strategic goals of Cardano\u2019s mission.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal can be seen in the sheer number of proposals this challenge setting type category has attracted in previous rounds. Previously in Fund 8, the similar category, just \u2018DApps and Integrations\u2019 attracted 189 ideas for the $2.5 million ADA budget. Currently, in Fund 9, with an over $7 million ADA budget, over 600 proposals have been submitted. Although we don\u2019t want the number of proposals to become unmanageable, a solid number, for healthy competition is a benefit to the Catalyst Cardano program and encourages proposers to put together really thoughtful propositions if they want to stand out and gain funding. \n\nThe category itself is highly feasible in that it is generic enough to incorporate a wide range of innovations and doesn\u2019t stifle proposers based on their specifics. For example, many challenge setting proposals now have a specific region attached to them: Africa, Vietnam and Latin America are mentioned in the next round. How does Cardano Catalyst declare the value of certain regions above others? Whereas, with a general challenge for products and integrations, teams around the world can effectively compete and certain regions are not favored due to the current member base. If anything, areas with fewer members should be prioritized to grow the community there, anyone for outback Australia? \n\nLastly, as mentioned in the alignment section, the team provides solid guidance on their  https://docs.catalystcontributors.org website. This will allow proposers to have a clear idea of what is expected, and raise the quality of proposals overall. Due to the past success, and detailed plan I rate this proposal 5 stars for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team at PACE have put together three clear and achievable success criteria and suggested metrics to accurately measure their success. They have also gone into specific details about the types of projects and the different success metrics that may be applicable within these sub categories. Once again, it is pleasing to see how well thought out and specific this challenge setting proposal is.\n\nThe first criteria for success they list is: \u201cIncreasing the number of products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.\u201d The proposal details hardware, physical products, DeFi, and Gaming as just a few of the types of proposal they expect. Success could then be further measured by metrics listed such as: new items sold, numbers of new users, total value, new players, and, overall qualitative feedback, among an extensive list. This criteria for success is easy to verify and for the community members to witness the success of projects completed with these specifications.\n\nThe second and third success criteria stated in the proposal surmise increasing integrations of existing solutions and improving the quality of existing products. The same variety of proposals can be expected to succeed, though the metrics will look slightly different. Projects may need to provide starting data, whether that\u2019s value, users or current integrations. Then provide data showing the increase within these aspects or others over the duration of the project. Although a little harder to find easily, proposers with solid documentation, a website, Github link or similar developmental documentation will have no trouble proving their success through these methods.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s highly likely that proposers and the challenge itself will be able to demonstrate its success, aligned to KPIs and metrics to measure specific progress objectives. I rate this plan 5 stars for verifiability. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3252, "q0": "The way to understand this category, within the proposed system of Categories presented by (pace), is that this is Project Catalyst, everything goes here, unless it belongs specifically to one of the other 6 categories.  This is where the familiar challenge settings of Dapps, Games, AI, Atala, Miscellaneous and others all reside.  To the extent that this is aligned with the mission statements, they have described it as (paraphrasing): the most interesting and useful decentralized projects that can provide better alternatives over their centralized competitors.  Which is as good a way of stating the goals of Catalyst as any.\n\nIf there is an issue here, it is the overlap between this proposal and others within the Categories experiment.  Options for governance are listed under this proposal (there is also a governance category), as well as Misc (there is also a nurturing category that also covers Misc) as examples.  It points to a broader issue with the experiment that this attempt to be comprehensive isn't perhaps fully in alignment with the actual underlying process?  Is this general inclusiveness to abstract to help propsers and voters to decide what should or has been prioritized?  I'll leave that question to each voter.\n\nAs far as this proposal is concerned, it effectively subsumes anything submitted within Catalyst, so it is really hard to say that it won't be in alignment...on the other hand, it is so general that it really offers no insight to proposers about how best to realize the funding goals of Catalyst within Cardano, i.e. to realize impact.  For that I will dock 1 star on alignment for a total of 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Obviously this is a category that falls within the scope of what the community can deliver.  To this end, the final three bullet points at the bottom of the proposal are worth rereading, as they make quite clear that proposals should be seeking to be unique and not duplicate previous work, that proposals should be aware of technical limitations and needs and that proposals need to cognizant of the wider Cardano ecosystem development, to take account of functionality in the roadmap and make sure their project is in both short and long term alignment.\n\nThe budget itself has been a moving target, partly due to an earlier iteration of this category experiment.  Since fund 4 the general Dapps category ran alongside things like Developer Ecosystem and SSI challenges pretty equally, with around $250,000 to each sub category.  In Fund 8 there was a sudden 10x for Dapps, and corresponding 2-3x for other categories when the fund jumped from $8-$16m.  We have yet to see the ROI come in to validate this jump (it is far too early to expect to, either), and in the meantime this side-experiment in challenge setting protocol was introduced, running alongside another Dapps challenge (so there was duplication of effort), with the result that both got voted in, and the Dapps and Integration challenge bumped 3x again to nearly $8m.  Again, it is too early to see what the ramifications of that are going to be, but it is good to see that this category proposal  has returned to some semblance of reasonable, dropping back down to $3m (with community vote, it should be noted), while also absorbing some large budgets such as Gaming and SSI.  The experiment is in such flux that it is really hard to say if THIS is the right budget, finally, but it is certainly a reasonable contrast to the accelerating numbers we had been seeing.\n\nBecause the budget has a well defined process built on community consensus, and because the team did such a good job laying out support for proposals to align themselves with wider Catalyst/Cardano missions and objectives, I give full marks for Feasibility.  5 Stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The included list of KPI examples will be a significant source of inspiration for proposers, and goes beyond general suggestions to quite specific metrics for typical proposals for this category.  Unfortunately, almost none of them are contextual and amount to merely raw particiaption counts.\n\nWhat would be most helpful in any discussion of metrics would be for the challenge team to support the ability for proposals under their umbrella (and for this category, this would necessarily be a very broad skill set) to effectively link KPIs tnot just to the superficial nature of the proposal (legal, gaming, dex) but to the deeper meaning and purpose of expressed in the proposals alignment with the Catalyst Fund10 mission statments.\n\nThe team should add KPIs relating to how these projects might align with those goals, such as what makes a good opensource repo (mission statement 2) or how to approach making  projects inclusive and user designed experiences (mission statements 2 and 4).  These are the metrics that truly inform success as it relates to the promised impact of a proposal, rather than random headcounts with no sense of user retention, user delight, etc.\n\nBecause of the lack of relevant impact success metrics I am docking 1 star, however, the proposal is well laid out with lots of resources to draw from to dsign these better metrics, so I believe the eventual verifiability will still be strong.  4 stars for Verifiability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1882, "q0": "Fund 9 was the first time this proposal got funded and I am glad to see it again.

Replacing challenge settings with funding categories has a strong likelihood of achieving greater innovation while simultaneously streamlining future funding mechanisms. One of the current problems with the challenge settings is projects having to contort and contrive their structure to fit into very narrowly defined challenges. In the current funding round, there is no allocation to community projects, onboarding and other extremely beneficial areas of need. Broadening the spectrum of project integration through a more generalized funding categorization allows for far greater innovation and diversification of projects that could be extremely beneficial to the Cardano mission and it's thriving community. \n     \nThe concept of a weighted vote determining future funding levels for subsequent funding rounds is certainly revolutionary and could allow for much greater allocation of human resources to other necessary tasks within Project Catalyst. However, in the opinion of this assessor, more community input is required to fully flush out the relative benefits vs. possible detriments of automating future funding based on a previously unused algorithm. Despite that caveat, this idea is well worth a rigorous analysis, which will mandate a larger community involvement and a more lengthy investigative process.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "At the moment, this community does not have the capacity to address this challenge due to the infancy of the adoption of digital identity (DiD) in the Cardano ecosystem.

This adoption of a weighted vote is dependent on the widespread issuance of DiDs, which will take several funding rounds (if not more) before the level of implementation necessary for this project to succeed can occur. Furthermore, the moderators who will issue proof of life DiDs are not currently in existence and there are several highly controversial hurdles that need to be overcome before moderators can be chosen. Perhaps the most contentious areas of debate prior to community adoption of moderators as the issuers of DiDs are privacy vs. KYC and the selection criteria for determining who has the trust and experience to become a moderator. I have two recommendations to address the aforementioned dilemma. 1., that more time be allotted to create the necessary infrastructure to implement DiDs and moderators; and 2., that the project be broken into smaller components in order to have successful implementation of funding categories immediately, whilst allowing more time for the other components to solicit community input and build the necessary structure to implement a comprehensive DiD issuance protocol.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\nThe success criteria and KPI metrics for this proposal are in need of further refinement.

I am especially glad since this challenge explicitly invites products focused on solving the climate change, which I believe is the topic of utmost urgency for our planet. Wouldn't it be great when Cardano-based products solved this and many other important social issues? This challenge allows for exactly that since it doesn't constrain the participation to specific topics.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Personally, I am particullarly interested in the topics of climate and ecology, so this may influence my viewpoint, but, in my opinion Cardano has one the most diverse and socilally-oriented communities, capable of tackling any challenge.

With the additional funding provided by this challenge, nothing can stop us from solving some of the most important global issues!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are tons of additional suggested metrics in this challenge, but what I like the most (and what I think is equally important for the Cardano community) is that this challenge focuses on actual things being done (products or integrations created) rather than more abstract things. In my opinion, in some of the fields, such as Climate, there have been already too many investigations, analyses, and discusstions, but an insufficient number of actions. So this challenge differentiates itself very positively, and exactly due to that it's easy to measure - the actiual things done - the actual use cases solved, the actuals solutions created.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4018", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Cardano needs innovations and solutions that help the ecosystem reach its potential and help improve the systems we use across the world.", "success": "An increasing number of products and integrations that offer new solutions for people to interact with and benefit from using Cardano."}
