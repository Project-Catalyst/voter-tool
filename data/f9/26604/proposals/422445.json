There is an underexplored workforce in universities and colleges that could be used on Cardano. This challenge intends to fill this hole, however one of the minimum requirements defined is the existence of only one student in the team of a proposal, which in practice could result in several teams including one student, of random course, just to fulfill the requirements. The concept of this challenge setting is interesting but I don't believe this requirement is aligned with the objective of this challenge setting, as the requirement could easily be circumvented.\n\nConsidering the fact that there is already space for student projects on Catalyst, I do not agree that this challenge setting is critical in the Cardano mission, but I see that it is an important and relevant topic.\n\nThis challenge setting is in line with the item 1 of the Catalyst\u00a0Fund9\u00a0Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This challenge has no technical challenges that limit the community's ability to contribute, it just has a simple requirement to include at least one student in the team, which also does not significantly limit the ability to contribute.The budget is relatively low compared to the other challenge settings, so there is no tendency for low demand and low budget requested/total available budget ratio.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success is not appropriate for the context presented in this challenge setting.

Key metrics are missing to assess the quality of projects and proposals after funding and how they are delivering what is expected by the concept of this challenge. Would it also be important to provide a time frame for evaluating when key metrics and success will be measured? 6 months? 12 months?

The experience that this challenge creates, with competence and trust, funded students can be prepared to create bigger projects in other challenges in future funding rounds. Students can bring young, creative and engaging new members into the ecosystem.\n\nThis challenge can be an ongoing onboarding challenge for students around the world. The challenge certainly supports Cardano's mission, and supports directly two fund9 strategic goals. I strongly agree that this challenge can bring good positive progress in Cardano's mission for change and progress.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Cardano community most definitely has the capacity to address this challenge.

By setting the budget cap, the challenge team expects to support at least 10 students (teams), that will be able to raise funds. The challenge brief suggests to the students to submit small proposals to this category and see if their idea makes enough traction to make future bigger projects.\nEverything seems to be well thought of within this challenge, for feasibility I can strongly agree that this challenge will be a successful one.\n\nThe challenge team members are well known members of the Catalyst community, Eastern Town Hall members, with direct connection to the Waseda University in Japan. Both members share the role of Cardano Ambassador, Catalyst funding round participation, SPO, Certified accountant, representative of multiple Catalyst challenge teams.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "First off, this challenge setting is, as it seems, a translated one from Japanese language. With that said, I must urge the challenge members, to work on and fix the Key metrics, presented under this challenge. The first one, \"Number of proposals for this category\u201d, is ok. The 2nd one, \"Number of applause and comments from the community\", to not go deep into it, I would scratch this one completely. Maybe the meaning of it is lost in the translation. If the challenge member's idea was to measure the social engagement within the community, comments from the community, or any exchange like that, is not a factual way of measuring success of this challenge. My suggestion is to focus on things that can clearly be identified as a definite success of this challenge, or the teams proposing their projects successfully within the challenge. The third metric, \"Number of collaborations with other proposers\", this one touches on the suggested focus. 4th, \"Number of proposals that participated in the next round\", this one is not clear to me what is meant to describe exactly, perhaps another one lost in translation, please try to rephrase, or edit this one.\n\nThe challenge brief makes it easier for the new proposers to identify with this challenge, it is well-structured and written. Students can apply who already have a business idea and are looking for funding for their startup. Development ideas, education programs (seminars, content translation, hubs), leveraging student experience is the main driver of this challenge.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2081", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 468, "q0": "As someone who has been trying to persuade university students and head of faculties from the three best universities of my community, I have continuously found that students are almost always crippled by the feeling of inadequacy seeing how there are many technically sophisticated proposals which are written in perfect or better English than the students. They have this fear of failing, of embarrassment. Perhaps it is a cultural specific attitude, perhaps it is a character related phenomenon, what is interesting is, that it is prevalent amongst students. Where the general conceptions are that students, specifically university students are encouraged to explore, to develop and to fail forward.\n\nBy creating this specific challenge, although it is not mentioned specifically in this proposal, of the importance of failing forward, it creates a safe zone for students to gradually learn and build confidence to submit more intricate and more financially demanding proposals. Having specific goals also creates clarity for these potential students and also for the larger Cardano community on what does this Challenge Setting seek to achieve and provide cover of. Therefore there should be limited misconception between the general Cardano community and the students proposals.\n\nThere is this lingering notion that we should focus on the current crop of available developers, which suggests that the language used by Cardano is universally prevalent and available all around the globe. This is a mindset that is Western Hemisphere oriented. Although Japan, Korea and Taiwan are advanced countries, the number of Cardano developers coming out of these nations are alarmingly limited. Let us take the example of Japan, the largest holder and supporter of Cardano, yet they do not have a thriving Cardano ecosystem. This proposal can slowly change that. They keyword here would be \"slowly\".\n\nLearning Cardano is tough. The syllabus developed by Lars, which takes 10-12 weeks to finish has a high drop-out rate in general. By allowing students to onboard themselves in ways they see fit, and supervised by the general Cardano community, we can slowly guide our way to finding bespoke education solutions that is by the students for the students, which hopefully ensures more success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We have a number of available and prominent Cardano developers from the community, taking shape in the form of Gimbalabs, whom are dedicated in providing free education on Cardano. We also have the individuals from EBU, who are integrated throughout the larger Cardano community, providing education materials and syllabus on Haskell and Plutus. There is no shortage of helping hands who can further the impact and effectiveness of this Challenge Setting and the potential proposals that will come of it. Emurgo themselves has setup an academy to assist proposer in creating proposals for Project Catalyst.\n\nThere is no doubt on our capacity as a community to nurture and provide guidance for proposers in this Challenge Setting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt, for at Project Catalyst current state it only effectively supports English speaking proposers. Support of various languages are in place but would take time to mature.

It is not a mission driven Challenge Setting, more metric driven. The metrics used are mostly addressing \"the number of proposals\". Although this is well, having a balance between quantity and quality would have been more effective. Perhaps in the metrics that are intended to be achieved, it could be added on metrics such as ; the number of proposal from leading universities, or the topics of proposals that focus on blockchain education, or proposals that addresses key topics of Cardano development. \n\nBy having specific guidance, we not only address the need of onboarding students, but we also guide them to address key issues in Cardano which then bolsters the effectiveness of this Challenge Setting in the eyes of the general Cardano community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 4, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 648, "q0": "The goal of this proposal is to create a challenge exclusive to start-ups created by students who want to build their projects using Cardano as a platform.

Although, I believe there was some confusion since from Fund 10 the budget of each challenge is requested in ADA, and a total of 100k ADA was requested. If ADA\u2019s price continues to be around $0.5, then the budget would be $50k and only 5 proposals would get funded. Although, this would be a very nice proposal anyways. It is mentioned that information about the students and their emails form their institutions would be used to verify that they really study there. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but it might work. The proposals would have to be focused on students\u2019 start-ups or activities to foster them. Although it\u2019s not guaranteed, I believe this challenge might help creating real-world solutions using Cardano blockchain, but other 3 goals of Cardano\u2019s mission might be more challenging to address through this challenge setting.

I believe this is possible, though some marketing and advertising would be necessary, especially because the time window between when results are out and the submission phase of the next fund are not so wide, usually a few weeks. During this time, it would be necessary to attract the attention of students and to have them start idealizing their projects using Cardano and to prepares a business plan in case they haven\u2019t started doing so already. Since the budget of this challenge, at the end, is probably going to be around $50k, and not $100k as stated in the proposal, I believe it very likely that there will be enough submission in this proposal to make it feasible and good proposals would be chosen by the community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs suggested to verify the success of this challenge proposal are not related to the final results of the challenge itself, but only to the stage of proposal submission: number of proposals submitted, applause and comments and collaborations.

Doing so helps a large number of students, specifically more than ten proposals can be funded if the challenge that you are attempting to complete is successful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to the fact that you have stated as a requirement that a member of the group must either be a student or a student, or be a PhD student in order to be accepted, it goes without saying that other members may be experts; consequently, it is reasonable for students to combine with experts in order to receive direction and instruction from those who have more experience.

What they lack is only experience and knowledge, and advice from experienced advisors.\nThe contributions of students may not be much to the development of Cardano, but in the future, they will be a continued resource to help Cardano go further in fulfilling its mission.\nThis challenge is crucial in making Cardano's future operating model sustainable and efficient.\nWhat we need to do now are sponsored proposals with simple, easy-to-implement ideas that will inspire and motivate young students to develop their careers on Cardano. Help them know Cardano's potential and believe in Cardano's future growth. Let them confidently put their future careers in Cardano and contribute to creating a civilized, innovative and sustainable Cardano ecosystem.\nI am a big supporter of this Challenge and look forward to this Challenge continuing to be funded in other funding rounds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a Challenge with simple requirements. So students participating in the Catalyst community can easily participate in proposal writing.\nHowever, authors should carefully review and monitor funded proposals that work.

Why?\nBecause the students are the ones who still lack a lot of experience in planning, financial management and do not foresee the risks.\nGiving students too much money is not a good thing. When they have less money, they are more creative and find more creative solutions to problems.\nI was also a student, so I understand very well the danger when students are funded with too much money. Since they still lack a lot of experience and knowledge, their current contribution to Cardano is not great. So give them a small amount of money so they can implement simple yet effective ideas so that they step up to more complex challenges that are within their reach.\nI judge the picture to be successful because the author needs to make it more transparent and stronger. For example, there will be many students at the university who know Catalyst or Cardano and participate in Catalyst activities, for example.\nRegarding the success index, I think it is necessary to add important indicators such as increasing the number of students participating in Catalyst, increasing the number of students using applications on Cardano.\nThose are the results that show the impact of students on Cardano's development instead of too general indicators.\nI hope the author will think about what I contribute and add to my Challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3702", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}], "importance": "Student entrepreneurs lack the resources needed to startup.
