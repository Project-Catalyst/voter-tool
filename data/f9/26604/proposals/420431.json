The project Catalys itself is an incentivized testnet of Voltaire that started to be embraced by the Cardano community about 2 years ago and aims to build the foundations of Cardano's governance model. Today thousands of people actively participate in this ecosystem.\n\nThe existence of governance structures such as DAOs is extremely important in the future of Touring Complete blockchains for different reasons, but in short the idea is that a blockchain and the dapps on it need to be upgradable in order to maintain security, competitiveness, performance and meet the demands of their communities.\n\nSome communities see governance as an unwanted feature, like the Bitcoin community, but in their case it is advantageous that the Bitcoin protocol is more rigid, because in theory this is what gives more stability to the store of value feature and maintenance of monetary policy of inflation. On the other hand, the choice to ignore governance means that protocol upgrades are decided by a centralized core of developers, where token holders have no say.\n\nCardano, unlike Bitcoin, is a blockchain that allows greater expressiveness in its programming and this makes it a tool for the development of dapps and different solutions, so Cardano has as one of its value propositions being a \"smart contracts\" blockchain and this puts pressure on it to remain competitive with other competitors in this niche. To maintain competitiveness and continue to be a secure and promising blockchain, updates are necessary and at this moment political and social issues arise that require a robust governance layer and that have well-architected incentives in order to prevent a group of players from manipulating governance and taking the development and updates to a side that is negative for the community as a whole.\n\nThese points indicate the importance of governance structures such as DAOs for the maturation and improvement of governance models and this challenge aims to make Cardano's DAO models more attractive and progressive, therefore of great importance in the Cardano mission.\n\nThis challenge is in line with items 1, 3 and 4 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide, which highlights the importance of the topic.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The DAOs <3 Cardano challenge has previously occurred in Catalyst's Fund 7. In Fund 7, the available budget for the challenge was $500,000 USD, the challenge received 41 proposals, 30 of which were approved and 12 were funded, which indicates that there was significant demand and above the available budget.\n\nCatalyst is today the largest decentralized innovation fund in the world, which shows that the Cardano community has embraced the quest for governance.\n\nhttps://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle/\n\nMy only caveat is that there is another challenge (\"Governance & Identity\") at Fund9 that also proposes funding for DAO development, but also proposes a larger budget and has a larger scope, as it serves to embrace proposals dedicated to governance as a whole and for identity solutions. This aspect will not change the evaluation score, the intention is to draw the voters' attention so that they understand that there are overlaps of ideas and that they reflect when deciding the vote. Considering the combined budgets of the two challenge settings in 3M ADA and the current market value of the ADA of around $0.45 USD I think that even funding the two challenges there would be sufficient demand from the community and I say this based on the demand seen in the recent challenges aimed at Catalyst governance and identity. Considering challenges dedicated to governance and identity (as these are the themes of the two challenges that are overlapping), the demand for funding of approved proposals in Fund 7's \"DAOs <3 Cardano\" challenge was around $1M USD, the demand for approved proposals in Fund8's \"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\" challenge was around $1M USD as well and\ndemand for successful proposals in Fund8's \"Self Sovereign Identity\" challenge was around $900,000 USD.\n\nAggregate demand for proposals approved in the challenges aimed at governance and identity was around $3M USD.

Perhaps through transaction costs between DAOs on different blockchains or the number of active users voting on DAOs on multiple blockchains.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 8, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 108, "q0": "The proposed challenge is aligned with Cardano\u2019s vision of having a decentralized infrastructure and decentralized decision-making, as well as empowering the fringes of society \u2013 by pushing power to the edges.

Since the DAO concept is very broad, this challenge has the potential to cover of the goals of Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund 10: it can help preparing people to contribute to building DAOs and its tooling, to create open-source tools, attract developers, build real world solution using Cardano and improve Catalyst\u2019s human processes.

This shows that the community has ideas for projects related to DAOs and is willing to propose and execute them. Also, there are already many DAOs being formed in Catalyst and they have already been working on some tooling, and some community projects are already building some DAO tools as well even without funding. With this challenge, they can dedicate more time and effort for this initiative.

From the regulatory perspective as well, it has become important for the projects launching in the space to become decentralized otherwise they run the risk of being categorized as securities by the regulators of different countries. \nThe answer to all these problems is to create Decentralized Autonomous Organizations which consist of holder of these token and which governance the decision making process of these projects. This shows that DAOs are becoming integral part of the projects launching on Blockchains.
