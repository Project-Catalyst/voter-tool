It is important that we seek to expand knowledge related to blockchains to non-technical courses, as there is a large gap to be explored.\n\nThis challenge setting is in line with items 1 and 3 of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.\n\nFrom what I understand the solutions that can be created in this challenge would be courses, workshops, research, applications, legal solutions, which is a good variety of niches, but I would recommend including \"potential directions\" or \"list of projects appropriate to this challenge\" to give more examples of where the boundaries of this challenge setting lie. This can inspire proposers and facilitate the understanding of PAs on how to evaluate proposals.\n\nI would also recommend expanding the rationale of this challenge to give readers, voters and PAs more context about teaching blockchain in universities. What is the current outlook? Is there any research that indicates knowledge about blockchain in course students in general? What additional information can tell us how critical this challenge is for Cardano?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Cardano is a project developed based on first principles and research, so there is already an extremely important academic background.

In the current Fund we have the challenge \"Challenge & Scouted for Students\" which has a small area of \u200b\u200boverlap with the theme of this challenge setting, but with a budget of only 10% of this, which ends up not a good indicator to project demand in this challenge setting.\n\nMy recommendation for challenges with themes not founded before is:\n\nAvoiding relatively high budgets, the absence of past funded challenges to use as a demand benchmark partially compromises the feasibility assessment.\n\nOr compile a list of proposals (from previous funds) related to this topic and with respective budgets in order to better describe the demand more accurately.\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26599/about", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The definition of success seems reasonable and within the context of this challenge setting, I would only recommend including a period of time to assess the outcome of the challenge over time.

As mentioned in the challenge brief, there is much misinformation about Crypto in general, and this creates a lot of resistance for researchers and college students to decide to work in blockchain related areas. The ways that this challenge suggests to solve this issue is to organize training in colleges and universities, engage collegue students in already existing projects and incentivize Cardano related research, creating partnerships between IOHK and colleges/universities. The goal of this challenge proposal is well aligned with Cardano\u2019s mission for Fund10 to prepare a group of people willing to contribute to the ecosystem, it support Cardano as an open source project and will definitely attract more developers to the ecosystem. The budget of 1M ADA might be a bit high since this is the first time this challenge proposal is going to be there, in case its funded, so I\u2019d prefer a slightly lower budget.

On the other side, the preparation of these proposals and the part of the execution that depends only on the Catalyst community I believe is very feasible, since there are already projects and groups that do what is mentioned in the challenge brief, like provide training for blockchain and there are many projects that are looking for new team members to help them executing their ideas. I\u2019m just not sure if the budget ia appropriate, since this is the first time this challenge proposal might be in, we cannot be sure if there will be enough interest in the community to have all the 1M ADA budget spent in proposals related to college outreach.

Nevertheless, the Challenge brief could have been written in a bullet list, with addition to potential directions, covering multiple facet use cases for Cardano and how university outreach could exploit each one of them. \n\nFor instance, educational certificates on a DID solution such as Atala Prism OR Many students who go through the thesis, internships during their graduation or undergraduation tenures, and bringing them to think of local solutions to real world problems for it could be also a great addition. Such points could be added in potential directions for this challenge.\n\nFinally, I agree that this challenge is critical to achieve Cardano\u2019s mission, but with further room for improvement in write up.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I neither agree nor disagree that the Catalyst community has the capacity to address the challenge. I have some concerns with respect to where and how the outreach would occur. Many universities are run by governments and introducing any new course OR promotional events usually means to deal with a lot of bureaucracy and obstacles. Ofcourse, this means that a lot of training or outreach must occur in local languages rather than English, and this could also be challenging if we do not have enough resources yet to address this at a good scale.\n\nAdditionally, it would be better if we understand why the challenge team thinks that this should get 1 million in funding. There has to be some explanation on it, because challenges such as grow Africa or grow Asia operates upon half of this budget, so maybe in the beginning it would be good to have half million as starting funds for this challenge and upon seeing progress ask to increase this to 1 million. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I disagree that the success criteria is measurable. The challenge idea is nice, but it is quite abstract and vague at this point. For instance, brief mentions, College level participation by use case of blockchain/Cardano : Does this mean that people can get proposals funded if they are promoting general blockchain such as BTC/Ethereum ? I do not think it directly helps Cardano, which should be the goal. \n\nAdditionally, there are free courses on MIT YouTube channel about blockchains, similar to this, could we have hackathons, technical fests organization, or eUTXO seminars as potential key metrics and then how many students were trained in Plutus programming and hired as part of funded catalyst projects? There are a lot of such focus areas that potentially this challenge setting could build upon and hence provide a more clear structure and use cases for the future proposers. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2114", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "PA brings valid points in auditability and additional metrics that can be added.We can look at all categories and take metrics from all these fronts, with only difference being that this challenge centers around students/colleges/professors. 1M ADA sounds a lot but if we divvy it as 10K/college we can reach only 100 colleges or projects. In some ways to enable global participation, like we saw in Facebook growth the use scenario has to be clear and simple. With Cardano transactions not being mainstream, this will open up new possibilities, new questions, new solutions, new papers, new training requests, etc and an unprecedented level of attention with magic number 1M.

I strongly agree with the idea that college or university students can become an abundant human resource and bring great creativity to blockchain in the future. However, I don't really see a big enough impact of the challenge if implemented at this point. To just say that the Cardano community is leaning towards technology but ignores the goals of developing or disseminating knowledge about blockchain applications into practice, perhaps this is not accurate. Because Cardano's ecosystem development orientation is considered to be the most diverse in platform blockchains, not only in technology (e.g. logistics, e-heath, governance)", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With some examples of the range of proposals that will be addressed in this challenge such as universalizing blockchain knowledge on centralized and decentralized finance, decentralized governance or empowering tokenomic, I see the challenge as incalculable. more feasible than many of the blockchain education proposals in previous funds. And even in this fund 9 there are many similar offers in all challenges and fund 10 probably too. With a budget of 1mil ADA along with the fact that there will be many similar proposals in other challenges at fund 10, I find the budget amount to be unreasonable. Close to 10% of the total budget or more, this can be a hindrance to Catalyst's other growth goals. Although I strongly agree with the view on developing communities, the group is intended for college and university students. My suggestion for the challenge is that maybe reducing the budget to around 500000-600000ADA would be more feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To audit the challenge, we will have key metrics for the number of students participating, the number of academic studies, the number of ADA transactions, but the challenge has not given the key metric for the number of colleges and universities. learn to measure.

Perhaps the challenge team should take note and add this goal.\nHow successful the challenge will be, it can be seen that this is a good challenge, bringing high efficiency to the Cardano community, creating many opportunities to access Cardano, blockchain for students around the world.

In addition there is some implicit alignment with the ideas around preparing people to contribute via the suggestions for things like \"awareness training\".\n\nBecause of the presence of alignment with some fund 10 goals, I can somewhat agree that alignment is there, but because of the lack of details and limitation so the suggestions present I also disagree that the alignment is adequate.

I fear that this rhetoric will not serve well in the attempt to increase adoption among students pursuing these disciplines where blockchain principles are yet to be understood or adopted, and may only exacerbate the disconnect.\n\nThe budget is definitely high for such an experimental undertaking, where the standard over the last few funds has been for around $500k for new challenge settings that did not have a lot of data supporting their use cases or applicability.

This would imply that the challenge would be enough to finance about 100 university hubs, which is a lot. However, the $10k is definitely an upper bound and it is entirely feasible to launch a student hub with only about $2-3k, as venues are often free of charge and the only real expenses relate to food and possibly some labour hours of a small team. Overall, however, I do not believe the size is appropriate given the past number of (in the 10s) proposals seeking to set up university hubs.
