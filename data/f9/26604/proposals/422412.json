The hacker is selling this data for 10 bitcoins.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-05/china-hack-data-on-more-than-1-billion-people-likely-leaked-due-to-sloppiness\n\nThis is a coincidence, but data leaks are something that has become commonplace in recent years. This is a big problem, as citizens have had important personal data leaked, compromising privacy.\n\nThere are no appropriate incentives for governments and companies to create robust security systems to avoid this type of problem and unfortunately a large part of the population does not understand or care about these problems.\n\nThe blockchain industry has tools that allow solving this problem through decentralized identity solutions and user sovereignty over their personal data.\n\nIn addition to avoiding problems, using blockchain identity solutions can improve business models such as supply chains and create credential models for educational institutions and governments.\n\nCardano was conceived as a blockchain that allows integration of identity solutions, such as ATALA PRISM, in order to solve the aforementioned problems and allow products and services that can benefit from identity to have space on Cardano.\n\nIdentity solutions are important for Cardano, however there are some disturbing points that compromise the understanding of this challenge setting. \n\nNo clarity in the definition of the scope of this challenge increases the uncertainty about which aspects need to be taken into account in the challenge alignment assessment.\n\nThe challenge question is generic (which stakeholders? governance stakeholders?) and confusing and does not make it clear what the purpose of this challenge is. I would recommend clarifying the relationship between the theme of this challenge and the challenge questions, so that the mission of this challenge is clearer.\n\n\n This challenge setting mentions the previous version of Fund 7 (\"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\") as a reference for use cases and potential directions, but a significant update to the challenge brief has been made and this causes confusion. If this challenge is approved and funded, what will be the official challenge brief? Will you merge the old challenge brief with the current one? Will you only keep the challenge brief of what was proposed in Fund 9? What should the proposers of this challenge take as a reference to create proposals? The Fund 9 challenge brief or the Fund 7 challenge brief? I would recommend that the team aggregate all the data they deem appropriate in the newest challenge setting to avoid confusion for voters, PAs and proposers.\n\n\"...We are revisiting our prior challenge themes and building upon them with an additional challenge...\"\n\nThe snippet above suggests that the items mentioned in the previous challenge of Fund7's \"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\" challenge will also be part of this challenge brief.\n\nA challenge should lead the way for proposers, this challenge setting in its current form brings a lot of uncertainty.\n\nThis challenge aligns with items 1, 3 and 4( of the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals mentioned in the Proposal Assessor Guide.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This challenge is the continuation (with some modifications) of the \"Accelerate Decentralized Identity\" challenge, which was present in Fund 6 (as an even older version called Atala PRISM DID Mass-Scale Adoption), 7 and 8. In the last appearance of the challenge in Fund 8 of Catalyst the available budget was $500,000 USD and the challenge had moderate demand compared to the other challenges (4x more resource requests than available budget). In Fund 8 we also had another challenge dedicated to identity solutions called \"Self Sovereign Identity) whose budget was $400,000 USD and presented moderate demand among the other challenges.\n\nIOG started training people in the ATALA PRISM ecosystem in October 2021 and hundreds of students have already completed the program.\n\nThese points indicate that there is already a community interested and capable of developing identity solutions.\n\nDespite the problem of lack of clarity in the scope of the challenge (the items mentioned in the Fund 7 challenge brief were mentioned as references for use cases, which leaves uncertainty about what can be considered/submitted in this challenge) I will not deduct a score point in this regard because regardless of the scope (Fund 7 or Fund 9) the Cardano community is suitable for both contexts.\n\nThere is another challenge that has identity as a theme, which I think is important to point out, in case the voting community considers prioritizing one.\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414304", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Verifiability is the big issue I see with this challenge setting.\n\nFirst, because the scope of the challenge got mixed up with the old version of Fund7.\n\nSecond, the definition of success is vague and does not establish a period of time for measuring the outcome.\n\n\"Establish key relationships and learnings early in the development cycle, leading to faster and more successful business outcomes.\"\n\nThird, the challenge setting mentions the old version of this challenge (from Fund 7) as a reference, so it is doubtful whether the metrics from the old challenge should be considered in this one.

On one hand to give new projects a platform for a first proof-of-concept, on the other hand to pave the way for existing projects to become a working business model. Unlike normal crypto projects, this is a bit more complicated in the SSI world: a lot of it revolves around concrete ideas with real-world implications. So it's also about finding standards, getting involved in working groups, coordinating with other projects, and communicating with stakeholders and decision-makers in the real world. Crossing this threshold from digital to analog is not so easy.

With the Atala roll out grinding along, now is the perfect time to start preparing the community for the hard work of building and understanding reputation, trust registries, trust assurance frameworks, internal integrity controls and many more of the governance requirements that are required by VCs and DIDs, and above all, SSI.\n\nAll of these things typically fit under something called a Governance Framework(GF), which is a formal ecosystem of interrelated documentation that describes roles, processes, actions and more in order to manage risk, create deeply collaborative processes and assure trust.  Normally, such GFs are designed and built by Working Groups(WG), which is where this challenge setting comes in.  The suggestion is to fund teams to create WGs (and working groups are typically characterized by unlimited membership, though there is usually some combination of core actors who have administrative responsibilities within the group), and then for those WGs to create GFs to serve their community or sector.  WGs could potentially form for DAO governance structures, Catalyst processes (currently there is a GF in the PA/vPA community for a rapid funding Treasury that is coming online), and one of the biggest sectors, is adoption of DIDs, as a GF makes up a root part of any trust registry, which is where a DID issuer builds in the validity of any DIDs they issue.\n\nThis proposal has perfect alignment with all of the Fund10 goals: 1) It is designed to prepare groups of people in the community to build tools for the future of decentralized governance, 2) these WGs will be producing opensource knowledge, repos and tools, 3) the real world applications of DIDs and SSI are numerous, and without GFs that potential cannot be realized and 4) Existing tooling is inadequate for our needs, so having WGs build out actual frameworks with documentation improves the process for everyone.  5 stars for Alignment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team lays out clear guidelines for proposers to approach this challenge, including how to structure their proposals and what core things to include, as well as 7 specific requirements that proposers need to have a plan for in their proposal.  \n\nThere is also plenty of details and links around the goals and approach that proposers should pursue, and how to come into broad alignment not just with Fund10 goals, but with the the broader requirements of funding DID or VC projects, and above even that, maintaining a coherent vision of a future with SSI as a key part.\n\nThis critical challenge is directly addressing an area that has been lacking (support for the community to develop its own governance protocols) and with a $1m budget it is very competitive among other challenges that also have such excellent alignment with the Fund10 goals.  5 Stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Because the specifics have been laid out so well for how a proposer needs to approach the challenge setting that it is easy to address each point that is a deliverable expected of all proposers:  creating or join a governance framework working group, create documentation, hold regular meetings, deliver reports and then depending on the purpose for the WG, deliver a PoC, MVP, pilot, or commercial launch.\n\nWhile the establishing of a GF creates lots of documentation as a byproduct, and thus a lot of auditable points, what really needs to be highlighted here is that there are two key deliverables in the metrics that a proposer can be easily guided to and through.  The first is an opensource governance framework that can be forked or absorbed into a higher governing body, or can spawn or recognize many more smaller governing bodies, and which can lead to transitive trust throughout the ecosystem if designed to be interoperable.  The second is the idea of documenting and reporting on the process itself, which is almost another form of opensource, since the report is a sharing of knowledge for the next team to walk the same or similar path.  With guidance for these two items, proposal teams should be able to effectively both achieve and measure the impact of their projects, so I feel this proposal deserves a full 5 stars for Verifiability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6370, "q0": "This challenge incentivizes the launch of pilots and products based on Atala Prism. The Atala Prism is a self-sovereign identity platform & service suite built on Cardano. As mentioned by the author, we can check the Fund 7 challenge 'Accelerate Decentralized Identity' for various use cases such as digital identity, verifiable credentials, verifiable presentation request & proof, cryptocurrency, NFTs & smart contracts. Although these use cases are not exclusive, the proposers can be creative and explore new use cases. For Example, with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Solutions, people can store the original piece of identity data as a credential on their device, cryptographically signed with their private key, and share the record with any organization. Then the organization can verify that it came from an authoritative source with a simple check on the ledger. Hence this challenge is essential and will help in Cardano adoption.\nThis challenge will help with at least one of the strategic goals. It will pave the way for the growth of the developer & DApp Ecosystem. Everybody in the crypto industry will require DIDs to use many DEFI platforms. In the upcoming period, there is a fear of regulations. I think DIDs will help to comply with those regulations. Hopefully, it will solve the hurdle of regulations and prepare the people or groups who can contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.\nIn terms of votes, in Fund 8, the two similar challenges' proposals accumulate good votes; we can expect the same for this challenge. Because DIDs solve multiple problems faced by the crypto industry and outside the crypto world, this challenge will be helpful for Cardano's adoption.

In Fund 8, the total budget was $900k for 'Self-Sovereign Identity' & 'Accelerate Decentralized Identity' challenges. It is almost on the same level as Fund 8, but it will be better if this challenge sees more proposals.\nThe challenge is proposed by 'Atala Prism Product Identity Head' from IOG and other Atala Prism team members conducting regular After-townhall meetings and serving in the challenge team.
