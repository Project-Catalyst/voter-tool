Other challenge setting proposals with similar goals and budgets in this fund include the veteran Developer Ecosystem team (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422540) which doesn't require opensource but has a strong pivot there this fund ($2m), and the broad Funding Category experiment Development and Infrastructure (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414308) which also is not exclusively opensource ($2m).\n\nThis challenge setting has performed well in the past, pulling in 25,803 unique votes in Fund8 and averaging 300(!) votes per project.  For perspective, only the above linked Developer Ecosystem performed better with 26,030 unique votes and 531(!!) votes per project.  If there is a key difference between the performance of the two, it is that DevEco tends to fund larger projects, while opensource tends to support small and medium size projects.  Either way, it is a high impact area of the ecosystem.\n\nBecause the team has made very clear their deep opensource alignment (Fund10 goal#2) and also prioritized community building in opensource (Fund10 goals #1 and #4), I believe it has achieved an exceptionally strong alignment score.  5 Stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is the heavy addition of collaborative guiding points that is really shifting this challenge into a unique approach to supporting the community.  By including and prioritizing alignment between community and IOG roadmaps, engagement of teams with opensource at any level within their project, and the wider distribution of knowledge inside and outside the ecosystem, I feel like they are setting the gold standard for support for opensource needs to be realized, and cementing this challenge setting in a way it really hasn't been before.  This support plays directly into the ability of the community to address these challenges which is a strong component of Feasibility.\n\nFurther the budget is set at a very reasonable (indeed, strategic) amount.  On the one hand there are other challenges which cover the same area (though none have this degree of design support for OS specifically) and they have twice the budget...on the other hand, at this rate OSDE could be funded alongside other proposals, which not coincidentally aligns with it's own internal ethos of collaboration.\n\nBetween this appropriate budget and ability to bring the challenges of opensource within the scope of the community's current abilities, I feel this proposal warrants a full 5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is an excellent list of KPIs and metrics that proposers can use to target the Fund10 goals, but one in particular deserves attention.  They have a general KPI that immediately arouses my cynicism, as it states \"increase quality of opensource projects\"...  These type of abstract KPIs are always red flags for me that a proposer may not have a good grasp of their goals.\n\nHowever, as I read through the proposal, they end up providing numerous examples that pin this abstraction down (many related to documentation, the low hanging fruit for all projects or processes to improve their quality):  commit resources to documentation, include corporate viability elements like professional risk analysis and integrity controls, adopt and build frameworks rather than one-off solutions that result in duplication of work, and more.  These are clear, actionable, measurable and deliverable, and this is the kind of guidance that serves proposer's well under a challenge setting.\n\nBecause the team has provided thoughtful metrics in line both with the Fund10 goals but also with the widest benefits of Opensource adoption, I believe this proposal merits a full 5 star rating for Verifiability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Dear PA, Thank you for the very supportive assessment and for taking the time to review our proposal because you are doing a good thing for the community!

Thank you so much again!"}, {"id": 171, "q0": "Building a robust developer ecosystem has been a priority when thinking about Catalyst/Cardano since Fund2. Cardano has undergone many technical upgrades in 2021 and 2022. Goguen, Alonzo and Vasil are delivering tools and possibilities that greatly expand the type of applications that can be developed, but for these applications to be developed it is necessary that developers have access to tools , documentation, courses, SDKs, among other solutions. Many of these implementations and developments end up becoming open source and this makes Cardano's blockchain more complete and accessible, but open source development in many cases ends up not having enough financial incentives to stimulate the necessary dedication and in this context Catalyst and funding by Cardano's treasury is essential to leverage this development. \n\nThe challenge also understands the importance that commercial projects have part of the non-open source code for commercial interests, but the focus is on open source development, however there is a problem in the description of this challenge, from which I will not deduct points because the problem is the most related to clarity in description than the Catalyst evaluation criteria.\n\nIn some parts it implies that only open source proposals can participate (\"...and it is not to be confused with other challenges that don't require open-sourcing a project to the community.\") the word \"require\" implies that the challenge will restrict proposals that are not intended to be open source, but in other parts of the description the idea is that it is important to maintain commercial value and that only part of the code being open source is acceptable (\"The projects funded by Catalyst should be able to generate business value retained by the teams, and at the same time contribute back to the Cardano community.\" ).\n\nI understand this conflict, it is natural for projects to want to maintain some strategic business advantage, but this leaves room for projects that open source all their code and projects that open source only 1% of their code. The challenge concept is promising but it is important to clarify the criteria for what is considered \"open source\" and acceptable within this challenge. Without a clear definition any commercial project can submit a proposal, create any code or documentation and make it public just to call itself open source. The intention of the challenge is excellent, but without clearer criteria, the purpose ends up being compromised. As I mentioned before I will not deduct points as 10% or 100% open source, the challenge remains aligned with the Catalyst Fund9 Challenge Setting Strategic Goals and continues to be important, as the developer ecosystem is extremely important in the Cardano mission.\n\nDue to the similarity in the themes of some challenge settings, parts of my assessments will also be similar.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The topic addressed in this challenge has already been funded by Catalyst since Fund2. Challenges dedicated to improving the developer ecosystem have been present in all Funds (since Fund2) and community groups such as dcSpark, 5 Binaries and Gimbalabs, just to name a few, have created countless solutions for improvements in tooling, education, infrastructure,  among other improvements, so there is demand and evidence that the Cardano community has the capacity to create proposals in quantity, quality and increase the development of solutions related to the theme of this challenge. In Fund 7, there was a drastic reduction in the budget dedicated to improvements to the developer ecosystem, the community responded negatively on social media, a sign that the community values \u200b\u200bthis topic very much.\n\nThis challenge is very similar to the \"Developer Ecosystem - The Evolution\" challenge. Both are focused on developing the ecosystem and increasing open source development. The descriptions are different, they contain different suggestions but considering who can create proposals / what can be proposed in the challenge, I don't see significant differences, because of that I see a great overlap between both and I would recommend that in a future Fund the teams seek collaboration to define scopes and budgets in order to avoid redundancy. I'm not discounting points due to the similarity of the challenges, just making an addendum so that the voters and proposers of the challenge settings pay attention to the situation.\n\nIn this Fund, there are several challenge settings related to the developer ecosystem, this is not necessarily a problem as each of these challenge settings has a different focus, however it is important that voters understand that the combined budget of these challenge settings is 9,925M ADA, which correspond to about 78% of the entire budget for Fund 10. I have linked links to the challenges listed below.\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422540\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421335\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423218\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423220\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423239\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414308\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/423211\n\n\nIt may be that none of the above challenges are funded or that they are all funded, this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict community demand on this challenge.\n\nIt is difficult to assess the feasibility of this challenge in relation to the community's ability to meet the supply of funds, as if all challenges are funded, the supply of funds intended for this challenge tends to cause low competition compared to other challenges. Low competition tends to result in fewer quality proposals. Judging by Fund8's data, there were two challenges themed to improve the developer ecosystem, \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\". The total requested/available budget ratio was 3.1 and 2.8 respectively, indicating a below-average competition when compared to the other challenges. In Fund 8 the total budget was $16M USD, the budget for the \"Developer Ecosystem\" and \"OSDE: Open Source Developer Ecosystem\" challenges represented $1M USD(6.25% of the Fund) and $1.2M USD(7.5% of the Fund) respectively . The combined budget available for the development ecosystem at Fund8 was $2.2M USD (13.75% of the Fund).\n\nTherefore, challenges dedicated to the developer ecosystem had 13.75% of the total available budget and a competition for funds below average in Fund8, this is an indicator that the combined budget of all challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem of Fund9 is well above of reasonable and balanced demand for Catalyst.\n\nEach challenge setting must be evaluated on its own merit, so I don't think it's fair to deduct points due to the excess of challenge settings dedicated to the developer ecosystem in this Fund, but it's important that voters pay attention to this, as it fund most of these challenges can cause a resource imbalance in Fund10, causing other important areas to run out of resources. It is also important that the challenge setting proposers try to collaborate with each other and check the possibility of merging in similar challenge settings or if they do not believe that the best way is to merge, at least try to coordinate the budget definition together in order to make the distribution of more balanced funds.\n\nNote: Due to the similarity between the challenges and the situation I mentioned above, my assessments should present a relatively high degree of similarity, and I will make adjustments in the necessary points.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The definition of success for this challenge is clear, objective and consistent with the premise established in the challenge setting, which I believe is appropriate as a definition of outcome. Several key metrics were included that will be appropriate to capture the quantity and quality of open source contributions (tools, documentation and SDKs), # of contributors, level of collaboration between peers and interoperability, among others. All this information can allow a good outcome assessment in this challenge.\n\nThere is no time window for defining the success of the challenge and the key metrics do not establish a timeframe to serve as a comparison, I would recommend including timeframes to facilitate checking the outcome of the challenge over time.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2048", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 9, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability: \n4 stars.
