Currently, Erdstall (the name of the platform), is being built on Ethereum, and the funding is requested to include Cardano. Nevertheless, they plan to include other chains in the future, but it is not in a scope of this proposal, and funding will be asked from these chains, respectively.  The proposer believes, that compering to other bridges, their solution is superior because it is easily extensible and trust-less. The proposer sees a large impact on Cardano, that in the future, when more chains other than ETH will be connected via Erdstall, they will automatically connect to Cardano, and cross-chain collaboration will be increased. The long term vision of Erdstall is to connect many-chain token bridge and eliminate constraints that currently exist.

The second milestone regarding multiple blockchain architecture is estimated to be finished after 4 months. Then another 3 milestones are expected to be finished by the end of fifth, fifth and sixth month. To improve the clarity at least first month (or even two months) could have been described on the weekly basis, what tasks are expected, what will be the time donation. To provide only the result after three months is not meeting this level of detail. Regarding the budget, the proposer is asking 231k USD, and it is broken down to milestones and number of devs. The proposer state, that the monthly salary for the company is 16,5k USD, and it covers fees for devs, researchers, management, etc. Since this is a request for funding voted by the community, I think the detailed calculation should have been disclosed. Also, comparing the milestones in the roadmap, e.g. MS1 (done after 3M), MS2 (done after 4M) = it takes 3 months to deliver 1st milestone, and 1 month to deliver 2nd milestone, but form the budget, there is 3months for MS1 and 3 months for MS2. So this does not add up. In case that MS2 development is starting after the first month (so it will take 3 months to do it, but it will be done after 4 months), then proposer should ask for 4 months for MS1 and MS2, instead of 3 and 3.

Their proposal intends for this bridge to be decentralized, but now they are in testnet on Ethereum and hosting the main operator nodes.

This proposal also have stated the risks of not enough typescript from Cardano libraries and they have stated some buffer on their timeline and they aim to be more close contact with the Cardano core developers for assistance.

It aims to migrate its cutting-edge multi-chain layer 2 platform Erdstall (based on a novel CommiTEE commit-chain protocol co-invented by their research lead) to  Cardano and develop a token bridge between Cardano and Ethereum. Erdstall currently runs on the Goerli test net on Ethereum and has proven to achieve better-operating characteristics than both plasma chains and ZK roll-ups. Having Erdstall integrated into Cardano is great precedence for other Ethereum-based platforms and DApps to migrate to Cardano. EThe proposal meets the goals of the Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge by creating new connections between the two blockchain communities with cutting-edge, well-researched technology and enhancing existing collaboration, thus attracting new users (it is a multi-chain NFT marketplace and some other layer 1's users would come to Cardano through it).  It also meets Fund9's strategic goal by providing an open-source project on Cardano that may attract more developers. The proposer points out that Erdstall is very scalable, as it achieves better properties than other layer 2 solutions while being lightweight and lean.

The team is highly solid, comprising the head of the research group for applied cryptography at TU Darmstadt, Germany (the patent co-owner), several PhDs in computer science, and 4 core developers who have been working on Erdstall for 1-2 years. The team has also acquired an understanding of eUTXO through another proposal funded by Fund8. The proposer offers a timeline with key milestones concerning the two implementation parts mentioned above. The budget breakdown and unit cost look reasonable for a mainnet-ready production. The proposer offers technical explanations for the project in great detail that are easy to follow for even a non-technical audience. Risks are well-considered and mitigations are provided. There is one implementation risk that I see is the uncertainty to deploy new technology on Cardano, and the team also mentioned this fact in their risks section.
