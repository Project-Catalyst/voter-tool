This makes sense, given the growing imprtance of attracting new people to Cardano, specially in topics related to sustainability and is aligned with challenge, as the idea is to include not only Cardano but also other blockchains in the promotion, addressing challenge definition of success (\"Collaborative value creation between Project Catalyst and other communities, through (..) initiatives alike\"). This challenge alignment is very well explained in the proposal section to describe how the solution will address it. As for risk part, proposer identifies 2 truly existing risks but the mitigation part is more based on expecting these risks wont be as challenging as they could. It's a fair expectation/approach but its good to prepare a pre-event communication strategy and the event content itself ready to address these points (current crypto market situation and possible lack of interest on blockchain), in case this mitigation arent enough.\nGiven all that, it indeed a good proposal, with a considerable high potential impact and that fits well the challenge. It's strcuture also is good, presenting well the problem and solution, including descrbing the event they intend to promote blockchain/Cardano in a convincing manner. My rate is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Timeline provided has enough details on the acitvities, in a logical sequence, starting since the fund is receving up to after event and includes and planing/preparation phase, which is essential in nearly all projects.

Both linkedin links and coomplete descriptions on each team member background is provided.\nAll in all, projects seems feasible and the team seems to have the competencies to run it succesfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For auditing purposes, proposers offers a good set of milestones and key develiverables per project phase. Moreover, one kpi, with target, is suggested (>200 participants reached) and reports will be issued throughout events. These are good ways to audit the project but I think it include more metrics or approeaches considering the aftermath of the event. For instance, to really evaluate if proposal motivated investors (and attendees as a whole), it will be imporant to somehow monitor their engagement in blockchain projects after the events and see how it really helped to promote Cardano (and other blockchains). This would demand, of course, some network effort from proposers to keep in touch with attendees and maybe help/mentor/guide them into this world, at least in the beggining. One possible way to measure this is the amount of investments made by the ones who were there in blockchain projects or even how many projects were started with their incentive (not necessarily financially). Other simpler ways can be considered such as collecting their feedback.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6123, "q0": "Currently SDG Blockchain projects are not fully recognized outside the Blockchain ecosystem. The disconnect between Blockchain and the Impact industry is holding back credibility and potential for scaling. The team proposes a solution: \u201cBuilding the Bridge\u201d is the largest Finance and Sustainable Impact conference in Switzerland, partnering with Cardano and the Blockchain for Impact event to solve the problem. The proposal impacts the challenge and is detailed and richly described. Switzerland is known as a country in the European region, with a population of 8,637 million (in 2020). Tavis Digital is a young and innovative digital asset management company based in Switzerland. investment products are developed, targeting institutional investors in the crypto space. The team proposes to work with Cardano and other leading Blockchains to develop and promote the \u201cBlockchain for Impact\u201d as well as the \u201cBlockchain Impact Investing\u201d space. The \"call to event\" contest, Bridge Construction accepted the team's proposal for an event. The goal of the conference is to raise awareness and credibility of the Blockchain Impact space and its huge potential. Besides, the author of the proposal also recognizes the possible risks. At the same time, there are solutions to reduce risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We have the information we need about the proposal's plan to measure project viability. The team provides a detailed 3-monthly analyzed project roadmap, from August to October. At the same time, the team specifically explains what needs to be done in each month, especially month-end milestones. . From the roadmap, we know the work will be done and in what time... Next comes the funding. The team proposed a budget of $18,950. This is a reasonably recommended value and is explained in detail. We are told, the budget value will be allocated to the following works: Event organization / preparation; Marketing and communication activities; Logistics. Work budgets are calculated daily (average daily rates of $1,250 apply). We know what each budget will be allocated to. However, it would be nice to have a budget breakdown, budget range, for specific tasks. Finally, about the proposed team members. The team has 4 members and Christian Speckhardt, Partner at Tavis Digital and Cardano is the proposed project lead. In addition, the group also provides introductory texts about each member. We know the identity, skills and experience of each member are suitable to carry out the work in the project to come to the end result which is the success of the project. A very good point is that all members have attached links so that we can understand more about the history and work of each member. From the plan table, it can be seen that the proposal has good feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposal has a plan for the successful implementation of the project in a transparent manner.

The proposed team provides us with delivery plan and progress metrics, including defined milestones, measurable progress: Delivery milestones and work, Save message date sent to Cardano and Tavis Digital contacts. Milestones and Accomplishments, and Milestones and Deliverables And the final product to be expected, is the success of this project.

But the proponent is missing the most important element, which is a clear commitment to the project's impact on Cardano as to what the blockchain wanted when it came to this Challenge, potential indicators that this Challenge poses are always associated with the phrase \"number of...\", and the proposer's task is to have clear estimates/predictions/targets expressed with specific numbers instead for that phrase \"number of...\". The proponent's way of dealing with risks is too dependent and trusting in the thinking of the target audience without clearly describing proactive solutions to break those situations.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In this section, the proponent has done a great job of what this Challenge requires, which is a solid action plan and description of the resources required for the development of the project. The timelines for the action phases are clearly defined, the workflow is consistent with the proposal description, and the development plan presentation of this project is ideal for tracking and managing progress. For the key people leading this project, besides describing their work experience, educational background, and professional qualifications, the proponent can go one step further in defining the role of each member in this project, there are many positions listed in the action plan and budget section, but we do not know exactly who will perform them and their qualifications are suitable for the position or not. 1000 USD for invitation and logistics costs for speakers is something very vague if the proponent does not have a clear description of this intention/work, eg which speakers will be targeted invite list (this is to be able to determine if their ability, experience, knowledge is suitable to deliver Cardano related content), number of invited speakers, working time of the person this, etc. Other expenses are described very well and are in line with the plan outlined.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "While there is one KPI related to the expectation of 200 event attendees, the other KPIs mentioned by the proponent that are related to the prospect of post-project success are yet to be targeted.

For all of these reasons, it will be very difficult to define meaningful KPIs to track post event success.\""}, {"id": 14766, "q0": "The proposers commented on the situation that SDG Blockchain projects are mostly unrecognized outside of Blockchain. The development potential of these projects is limited due to the disconnection between Blockchain and the Impact industry. Faced with this situation, the team came up with the idea to build a Blockchain for Impact platform to create a bridge between the Cardano community and major conferences. This is a great idea. I believe that when the project is successfully completed, it will bring huge benefits to the community and expand the Cardano community to a greater extent.\nThe proposal refers to a large and reputable company investing in this project. It can be seen that this project is the heart of the proposal team. By presenting an extremely specific Solution, the proposal can convince the community that the project will bring a positive impact to the community. The functions and features of the project are explained obviously. The main goal of the project is to raise awareness and reliability of the blockchain and expand its potential. This goal is completely in line with the goal set by Challenge. In addition to the project activities, the proposal also identified the audience that the project aimed at and showed the viewers the impact of the project on these objects.\nThe proposers claim to have met the key metrics of the Challenge very well. The project elevates the reputation of the community and promotes the expansion of the community. At the same time, the project also takes on the role of promoting Blockchain. With the content that the proposal has presented, the community can see that the results that the project brings will have a great impact on the Cardano community.\nThere are 2 major problems that are likely to hinder the project implementation: insufficient interest from participants and unfavorable market conditions in cryptocurrencies. The team has carefully analyzed and looked at the problem deeply. The team will soon have a solution to overcome these problems and increase the likelihood of project success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal offers a very detailed roadmap. The project implementation plan is divided into 3 phases. Work items are broken down for each timeline in the roadmap. The proposal also recommends a suitable timeline to complete the given tasks. The proposal showed a reasonable plan not only in terms of what they would complete, but also outlined the criteria and requirements for each item of work. The details of the technical and technological aspects required to implement the plan are also outlined in the proposal. In general, the plan proposed by the proposal is completely consistent with the goals that the project aims at.\nThe team asserts that the budget plan proposed by the proposal is based on commercial market prices of the financial sector. However, project advisors still receive a lower salary than the market because this is the early stage of the project. The budget plan outlined in the proposal is very detailed. The team presents the budget plan in a way that is easy to grasp. Investment items are presented in bulleted form. Budget is reasonably divided for each item. Project activities that require funding are also carefully calculated by the team and given a reasonable number.\nProject leaders are experienced in the field. The knowledge they gain will greatly contribute to the success of the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Detailed information for the milestones in the roadmap and the time to achieve the goal has been specifically mentioned in this section. The proposers also provide specific numbers to measure the success of the project. Based on those quantitative indicators and the results described in the proposal, the community can easily track the progress of the project and evaluate the success of each stage.\nThe image of the successful project is also described in great detail.

The proposal is about taking Cardano to this convention that takes place in Switzerland and is a great center for entrepreneurs, investors and relevant actors that can contribute to the wide adoption of Cardano in the country. It is also strategic for us to invest in Switzerland, as the proponent claims, it is a global hub and a major player for blockchain. We know how Cardano is a third-generation blockchain and that it is still being known, little by little, and it is super necessary to trace this network. The problem is, precisely, that the exact agenda of what would be presented at the convention is not presented. This somewhat undermines our understanding of the impact, but in theory it is a proposal that aligns with the challenge as it could generate future collaborative work between Cardano and other networks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We know exactly what will happen in the following months of August, September and October. The proponent enumerates the actions in great detail, and exact temporal division contributes greatly to our understanding of the process. Talking about the division of the money, it is very clear how it would be used. The parts are divided and subdivided, it is not only said which installments the total amount would be destined for, but also a little about each: \u201cLogistics: Travel cost, accommodation: USD 1,000. Invitation, ie logistics cost of high-end speaker: USD 1000. Cost of event, payable to Building Bridges: USD 200. USD 2,200 in total\u201d. In my view, the project is expensive, but it would be unfair to say that it is not clear how the values would be used. The professionals involved are presented in an excellent way. We know who they are, resumes, previous experiences, linkedin profiles and so on. Total confidence in this team is passed on.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We know what is expected at the end of each month, so it is only necessary for this information to be told directly to our community members. The proponent is aware of this, according to the excerpt: \u201cTavis Digital intends to report on the progress and goals of the project. Any potential deviation or delay will be communicated to the community in a transparent manner.\u201d It's just not clear how, in fact, that would happen. What would be the communication channel used between the company and the members of the Cardano ecosystem. The success scenario is well explained, but in my view, it would be necessary for the company to carry out some direct research with the conference participants, in order to collect information, feedbacks, how they understood about Cardano, if there was an interest in acquiring Ada , and especially: if any cross-network project emerged from there. It would be important to have this coverage, which is not mentioned exactly.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "\u201cBuilding Bridges\u201d is the largest Impact and Sustainable Finance conference in Switzerland with global visibility.
