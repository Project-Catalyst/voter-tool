Having said that, there\u2019s always the possibility that one of the images goes viral and\u2014hopefully\u2014has the desired effect (and no unwanted backlash).\n\nIt would have been useful to include current numbers of the KPIs listed in the proposal, to see what the reach has been with the drawings created as part of the previous proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Shlomo & Co have proven that they are able to deliver what they promise.

The proposer believe that art, caricatures and images could be one of ways how to create bridges between communities, as well as increase awareness and open-minded of crypto community. On one side, the idea makes sense and could be one of possible ways how to contribute to cross chain collaboration, on the other hand, I could not find any evidence supporting this idea. Are we able to measure the impact of such art with relation to cross-chain collaboration? How big impact it will cause? If we can not measure it, then how do we know it will be beneficial? Also, the problem statement that there is not enough creative ways that connect chains \u2013 also something I was not able to support with any information.

Regarding the team, there is currently 6 people, with their short bio provided and also linked in profiles. To assess the feasibility, I think it is feasible as it is, but some parts seems redundant, or too much, given the overall described plan, as well as some parts are unclear. 1. Brainstorming session with community \u2013 why, when there is already 6 people? Is there a logical reason why more people is needed? 2. One cartoon per week \u2013 who will do the drawing? If only one person, why do we need such many people in the team? 3. The amount per one drawing seems overstated \u2013 if there would be information how many hours are spend on one drawing, it could have been better for visualization.

Regarding the success, the proposer state that \u201cinspired communities\u201d would be the goal. But how would we measure it?  Another metric is \u2013 media sharing these caricatures or getting to mainstream media (these two metrics would evaluate the adaptation and popularity of caricatures, which is not the goal of this proposal).

However, while I am supportive of the idea on principle, I think a better case needs to be made as to how/why these caricatures will support cross chain collaboration. From what is included in the proposal we can infer that the artist believes these caricatures will not only showcase the importance of collaboration and cross-chain dependence, they will also serve an education purposes. \n\nWhat leaves me wondering about the impact is exactly how they will achieve these goals. I would have liked to see more details on the expected outcomes. What is it about the caricatures that will make people understand the necessity for interoperability? \n\nThe proposer mentions that caricatures are a \"Creative way to present the importance of cross chain could lead to higher awareness and openmind between blockchain communities\" but there is no real way to know what affect this would have on cross collaboration. \n\nGiven that the idea is fun and may bring a fun air to the community I am giving it 3/5. To receive higher marks there needs to be a more tangible/measurable impact for the community. Another thing that could help increase the score on impact would be to explain how groups beyond Cardano (the other side of interoperability) would participate in the identification and selection of characters/scenes to caricature.

While I am still not sure about the level of impact this project may have, it is clear from the plan presented that the team is more than capable to deliver, should the be funded. \n\nThe artist provides a very good background on their ability, including their own NFT project they have on Cardano already. The level of the artistic ability is very high and makes it extremely likely that the artist would be able to create excellent caricatures. The rest of the team members are also well described and provide confidence that they could deliver this project. \n\nThe budget and timeline seems reasonable since it's primarily focused on developing the caricatures and using the team's experience to get them into the broader community. What I personally would have liked to see are more details on the plans to use social media to get the caricatures out into the community.

In addition to the actual caricatures being created and shared, the team will create a list of a media network through which their art will be displayed, track the # of views through this network, and then provide a final report to the community. \n\nA strength of the approach of this proposal is that they will use existing venues (After Town Hall) to canvass the community for input on specific caricatures. This will allow numerous opportunities for the community to speak up and guide the project. \n\nThe proposers could have done a bit better job at explaining how the caricatures would inspire communities to build bridges.

The proposal seeks to add very creatively to culture and build something unique for us all to enjoy but also learn from. As an artist, I know the power a simple work of creativity can have on changing minds; it is a very challenge-connected proposal for this reason.\n\nThe positive impact of reading the solution is that the proposal seeks to use artistic dialogue to build awareness of Cardano and promote an understanding of a multi-chain future. This concept adds to the culture of moving past small-mindedness and genuinely seeing the possibilities of working with several chains simultaneously. If the proposer is rewriting, perhaps they will consider adding thoughts about other blockchains into the solution area in writing. The two images are great examples of this and show voters precisely what type of work to expect.\n\nThe KPIs match the Challenge in that they focus on cross-chain connections and collaborations. This type of promotion of the spirit of the Challenge is quite valuable in that others will no doubt be inspired. Voters will see this unique value and likely be pleased with this section's clarity, vision, and weight. Bravo.\n\nIt seems there is a great potential to scale in that the proposer already has a successful NFT project and seeks to do more in the future.\n\nAfter reading the mitigation tactics, the risks mentioned are both reasonable and appear to be manageable. There is a history of experience on the team and a deep understanding of the ideation process that helps produce new ideas. They also seek to involve the community in their brainstorming, which is an opportunity unlike any I've seen in Cardano so far; it says that the proposers also have trust in the community.\n\nIf rewriting, it may be valuable to use distribution as a risk and offer mitigations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is clear which paid elements are part of the proposal.

Voters will benefit from the well-ordered list that carefully mentions each step along the road of carrying out the work. If rewriting, the proposer might tweak the visual appearance of the list to include dates and timelines to this roadmap as headings instead of parenthetically having them into the points.

The rest are straightforward, and only those two could use rewriting if submitted again.\n\nThe community can track with the offered hashtag, as well as through the artist's social media accounts.
