I believe the objective is to promote a healthy exchange and main challenge in favor of blockchain between Cardano and others, as the following excerpt states: \"Blockchain is future and will be fully implemented in our society in a few years, the main actors of Blockchain so students The project here is to unite from different Blockchains to contest the different projects and learn from other Blockchains. Our goal is to create a Blockchain community of students and promote blockchain to more students and university professors.\u201d Our entire ecosystem is part of of the 3rd generation of blockchain and it is important to establish relationships - advantageous as well - between the entire cryptographic universe. Here, we intend to create a group where meetings would take place. The group would be formed by students, mostly. the starting point for the project would be the student of the \u201cGrenoble Ecole de Management\u201d school. from different social networks, in which they would be sent through social networks, which would be sent to some types of symposium, you could say, in which each meeting would be a presentation on blockchain. Research will also be carried out that will have to carry out the best results found in the blockchains. In theory, this is perfect, it is the exchange of information and knowledge in practice. However, some uncertainties may occur during the proposal, the impact of reading. mainly: how can we really draw students' attention to these events? It is an example here that links will be shared via telegram/discord by, it is also here that the best possible marketing would be done about the project; It would be important for more details to be given in relation to this marketing campaign, as will encouraging massive target participation. Mainly due to the fact that blockchain technology is not so widespread, making place where we are talking. How to obtain that there would be a participation of several groups, coming from different blockchains? Another question would be the structure of the meetings: would they all be online? All in English (since the students who will originate the project will be from France)? How these moments recorded? What will be the roadmap to be followed, that is, how can we ensure that the time is used in the best possible way and that all presentations maintain a quality standard? How can we give visibility to different blockchains? Another point that I was confused was in relation to the improvement research. what are the parameters, who would carry out this research? Will a professional get here? If so, how could you support students? Therefore, everyone considers that the idea is good and even with the proposed challenge, it can be more detailed in all aspects.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The first few months of the script are ideas, we know what will happen in a very detailed way. Some activities are proposed, and these are very well explained, through topics on what should be done, for example in: \"some example tasks will be the following: Prepare a post to send to the different Discord groups and a complete list of Discord groups +send the message to the groups + Create the students' Telegram group + Organize all the monthly meetings.\u201d As time progresses, however, the explanations get less detailed, we don't know what would happen specifically in November and December, as these months are covered jointly. It would be important that the same degree of specificity was maintained throughout the roadmap and that all activities were detailed as stable as possible (the same degree of depth for each). What I'm talking about would be: how would the intro presentations be prepared for each call? This would take place between November and December, but how? ro is not bad, but not ideal either. It gives us a clear idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would happen, but not exactly how and when. Talking now about the requested budget, a total of 14,400 dollars is divided into some parts. These could be better explained: preparing materials to reach students would cost a thousand dollars, but what materials would these be (\u201cprepare materials and Reach out for students in the Telegram groups of the blockchains: $1000\u201d)? Posters, videos, illustrations? How many would there be, and who would work on it, dedicating how much time to the actions? Because managing each meeting would cost $800, what activities exactly would constitute that? Why is $250 needed to keep the Cardano community up to date on the project, and who would be responsible for this role? (\u201cpreparing a presentation about Catalyst project and keeping updated information about Catalyst & Cardano: $250 X 8 months = $2000\u201d). We noticed that, like the script, the information is passed on in a basic way, it is possible to understand how the money would be used, but it is not so simple to judge the need for such amounts as they are not well explained. Finally, analyzing the group that will be responsible for the execution of the project, finally, thinking about the team, we are introduced to the duo that would compose the team, being Benjamin Ben Zvi, firstly; it is not so clear how involved he is with Cardano, he claims to already have experience with our blockchain and to be working together with a funded proponent (Shlomo Cohen), but it is not clear how he acts on his projects - if it is as an intern , or official team member, what tasks he performs, etc. In other words, it would be necessary to understand how he fits into our community. As for Yassine Jamou, he provides some information about himself, including his linkedin profile (which is always important), but it is also unclear if he has any involvement with Cardano (probably not, otherwise he would have said in the detail of the proposal). Anyway, I believe that yes, the proposal is viable, but some improvements would be necessary.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent provides us with a lot of information regarding auditability, but I believe that some improvements are needed, both on the part of tracking progress and on the final success. Talking about partial results, first of all, we know that some KPIs would be considered, such as \u201csurveys will be distributed after each call to get feedback + we will see how many participants we have in each meeting and we will decide to maybe put more effort into marketing + number of people who join\u201d. join the Discord/Telegram student group + videos posted on YouTube + number of views/likes\u201d. This is important information, but I think more emphasis should have been placed on qualitative analysis here. That is, how could we actually monitor the quality of these surveys, how would they be elaborated, the questions that would compose each, etc? How would the bidder's work be monitored, how would we know if he was carrying out the promised activities for each month in the right way? What would this final report look like, from what content would it be formed? These are all very important and interesting questions; we must be very careful with both the numbers and the processes behind them. Talking about the final results, once again we have an analysis more focused on quantities - for example, we know once again how many students are expected for each month of progress in the project; Regarding the other achievements, I found them to be a bit abstract, such as \u201cLots of learning content provided on calls and then posted on YouTube\u201d and \u201cHaving good feedback from surveys provided and private messages sent by students\u201d. How could the learning content be considered adequate and of good quality? How can we ascertain student feedback? More importantly: how could we see in practice that this initiative has contributed to Cardano having a better connection and exchange with other blockchains? How can we verify that some of the topics mentioned in the challenge have been met, such as \"awareness and understanding, organization and governance, culture, diversity and inclusion, innovation and decision-making, collaboration tools and platforms\" and etc? analyzed and get to know our community, in a simple and direct way. Which could be done in different ways, such as the participation of the duo that manages the proposal in Townhall, the elaboration of a final research that includes all the information that we need to know, whether it's done through written reports, videos, in a detailed post on our community's communication channels (discord, telegram, youtube channels, etc.) based on what was raised, may it be perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 8, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1133, "q0": "The proposer looks to facilitate virtual meetings with university students. Benji proposes that getting together with people that may or may not know about blockchain will somehow lead to collaboration that would satisfy the goals of this challenge. However, this is not the (unfunded) Scale-Up Community Hubs challenge; the proposer fails to convincingly address how this proposal leads to cross-chain collaboration. At best, superficial knowledge transfer occurs with the allotted time for the meetings and collaboration beyond these events is not incentivized by the proposer.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer has only been involved in Catalyst since this fund but wants to be the spokesperson for Cardano and Catalyst. This is fine, but also speaks volumes in that no support person that is more knowledgeable has been sought out. Under the feasibility, the proposer stated: \u201cThe timing of the funding is perfect as we start the student year in September.\u201c\nThis relates to the detailed plan and is laden with issues. Not all academic years around the world - or even the Western world - start in September. With possible delays, I would not count on the first batch of funding before the first week of October. Nonetheless, the plan to spam discord and telegram sounds simple enough. In my experience as a former internet marketer, this is also a recipe for disaster and low quality engagement, especially if you are not known in the spaces you create unwanted noise.\nThe breakdown of the budget leaves questions open. What is the rationale to pay $1k for material preparation and posting to Telegram? Why then is discord missing from the budget?\nThe information of the three people who are working on this proposal is badly formatted and missing context in how the presented information relates to accomplishing the goals of the proposal.\nThe proposer indicates that he may not be able to finish the proposal, but \u201cmany students can help\u201d to get the work done. This is not aiding the voter\u2019s confidence that the $14.4k are spent on something that will actually be implemented.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The numbers of students joining discord/telegram are not important to the community, as per the proposer\u2019s impact description, the proposal\u2019s value will come from the meetings. The metric may be useful internally to see what the success of the funnel looks like in getting the students into the meetings. Surveys are a good idea (and students are used to fill them out), but we don\u2019t know how \u201cquality of work\u201d will be measured. Is it presentation skills or is it outcomes (e.g. collaborations initiated)? The latter would be closer to the challenge goals. If the goal is for some student to receive an A+, then this is not of importance to the community as it relates to the challenge goals. YouTube views and likes are vanity metrics as well. No amount of views will tell you whether collaboration happens or not - not even if people actually watched and understood the information presented.\nWhile the vanity metrics are easy to track, they are not telling whether the proposal is a success in terms of the challenge setting or even the more limited proposal\u2019s goals.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2209", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1361, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by creating a blockchain agnostic group of university students at the Grenoble School of Management in France. \n\nThe proposers commit to using social networks, such as telegram, to infiltrate and recruit other students who may be working across different chains. Their goal is that by creating this space and doing the outreach, a diverse group of individuals will come together and participate in co-learning events. Overall, the idea is good and could have an impact, however whether it will actually achieve this is unclear. \n\nThe impact of this proposal will therefore be dependent on whether or not these individuals will want to participate. This is not to say that there won't be people who participate but whether they are from another chain or whether they want to engage in collaboration rather than just promoting their chain/project is unclear. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThere are several strong points with the plan presented, the first being the level of detail and forethought that has gone into developing each of the objectives, tasks, and activities. The proposers do an excellent job at articulating exactly what is supposed to happen and when. \n\nThe second strong point here is the team behind the proposal is fairly well involved in Cardano and has direct connection with the institution where they will operate out of. This implies that they will be able to identify and make the necessary connections to help make the project a success. \n\nFinally, as the proposal is set to last about 10 months, the budget is more than reasonable for what is being requested. The budget is very well aligned with the extremely detailed plan and takes the guesswork out how and on what the money will be spent. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs mentioned in feasibility, the plan and budget are nicely aligned with clear milestones and deliverables. The community can easily track whether the events were held, how many people attended, and the feedback received after the event has finished. This approach will allow the team, and the community, to iterate and optimize for delivery. \n\nWhile there are some very good indicators, such as number of telegram groups the project is shared in, and the number of students in the telegram group and number, they do not necessarily make it possible to audit the actual success of the events themselves and whether they are leading to any cross chain collaboration. \n\nTo get that extra star here, there should be more concrete success measures. For example, what does \"a lot of learning content provided in the calls then posted on youtube\" mean? Do you mean all of the materials? Some of it? What portion needs to be uploaded to be deemed successful?

The alignment with the challenge is quite evident in that they wish to \"unite students from different blockchains...\" in the first 5 words of their solution. Clearly a fit for cross-chain collaborations. Well done, proposer. Voters will have no problem understanding the answer from this section. \n\nThe positive impact comes from building bridges (in the form of collaborations and friendships). Opening opportunities to other students and faculty alike about the work that can be done on Catalyst is also a value add for them both and the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe KPIs of increasing interaction between individuals from various chains, the potential to solve issues together, and contribute to the ecosystem are all solid indicators in which voters can see the value.\n\nIt seems that this will be a plan that can scale both in this school and potentially to many others who might use this proposal as inspiration for their own in the future.\n\nThe first two risks offered seem well thought out. The proposer may want to add to the last as it is a bit unclear exactly what the risk is there.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skill sets for this proposal are evident in the work that makes up the solution and plan. The team does appear capable of the task, though experience that fits all facets of the answer is not explained. One team member has no specific knowledge of Cardano listed in the bio in Feasibility, while the others do. If the one does have any, please do mention it if rewriting.\n\nThe plan is precisely what most voters are looking for and is a successful example of a timeline, actionable tasks from September to May in the same school year\u2013\u2013all in the order of execution. Bravo. We assessors often wish for this much detail in proposals. Though not specifically mentioned, it does seem quite a money-saving feature that the meetings are all by video conference. The voters would benefit from knowing more detail about this. Will they be hosted on Zoom? Google Meet?\n\nA specific item to rework is: \"convince people that the blockchain technology is the future\" Perhaps it is better stated as: \"educated, like-minded individuals who have yet to learn about blockchain technology.\" This is a more attainable goal than \"convincing\" and will likely be your marketing target audience. \n\nIn contrast to the detailed plan, the budget is sparse. Please add more detail to explain the individual work of the 3 people, with an $ per hour price for their work, as required by the new budget standards in Fund 9. As a person with event organizing experience, the allocations do seem reasonable for the industry. Lastly, a contingency budget of 5%-10% is typical for such projects. Consider adding if resubmitting.\n\nPlease work on adding greater detail and transparency to this area in future submissions. For the lacking budget area, this section receives 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap provided in the \"detailed plan\" section is outstanding. It not only gives almost an entire month-to-month breakdown of actionable items but offers voters a display of all milestones the team hopes to reach on a time horizon that is quite obvious (one full 9-month school year, September to May). Great addition.\n\nThe metrics offered to track the progress of virtually all actions. These will be an excellent basis to start from. Other metrics that may be helpful would be an \"expectations vs. reality\" sheet for facilitators to fill out at the beginning and end of each month.\n\nThe KPIs define success and will allow the team to see the potential of submitting a similar proposal for the following year as a potential next step.\n\nAll video calls will be recorded and uploaded monthly.

Nice to take that into consideration, even though it might not be a problem at all, as newbies as well as other people trying to get involved on different blockchains will be keen on taking part in that kind of a project. It seems like the biggest effort to bring together those students from all Funds that have passed by now.

You mentioned the marketing and advertising part of the project but it not clear who is going to be responsible for that mission. I only can imagine the involvement of that one student that is studying business. I can also understand that the other two parts of the proposal are going to be implemented from people not specialized in something relevant to those tasks, but that also needs to be clearer. All in all, there is no correspondence between the tasks and the team members responsible for each task. The skills of the team members are there, i would only like to see a linkedin account for the 3rd member of the team, but that is not something that is likely to cost on feasibility.

However, I can\u2019t entirely agree with the proposal's impact because I think it's tough to find students capable of advocating blockchain technology. Maybe it's better if the students act as the participants. Meanwhile, the speakers are people who are more involved with the technicalities and development of those different blockchains.

While the (very excessive) 800USD  speaker fees might be a good motivator for students to prepare their presentations, there are no criteria for how the proposer would pick who would present something. It's a must to set a list of who are allowed to speak, maybe based on the amount of experience they have.\n\nThe marketing items in a budget section might be a bit excessive; perhaps the proposer should clarify how it would take 1000USD because, as far as I know, sharing links in telegram groups is free?\n\nThis leads me to the second point. It\u2019s tough to imagine how the results will be because the proposer is picking the speakers after the project is funded. I firmly believe for sharing sessions to be effective, the speakers must be prioritized first because they are the ones who facilitate the transfer of knowledge.

For example, the proposer allocated 1000 USD to reach out to students via Telegram groups which to me doesn\u2019t sound reasonable and the proposer didn\u2019t specify what goes into the marketing via Telegram to warrant that amount of money. Overall, I\u2019m quite skeptical over the feasibility of this project because of the points mentioned above.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs chosen to measure the success of the project includes metrics, such as survey responses from participants, number of meeting participants, number of people joining Discord/Telegram group, and YouTube engagement (views, likes, etc.). I find these metrics to be adequate as a measure on how popular the activities are and the quality of meetings (by using survey). However, the proposer didn\u2019t mention on how these metrics are going to be reported (what platform, etc.). I also would have liked if the report was done in a more frequent occurrence instead of only at the end of the project so that it can be tracked during the project implementation.

Students, with their fresh perspectives, boundless energy, and eagerness to learn new things, will be of great assistance to those of you who do not have a strong grasp of Blockchain technology. The author has outlined a method for students to connect with one another on various blockchains through the use of social networking platforms, and he or she will hold monthly meetings to introduce Catalyst and Cardano.\n\nRegarding the potential dangers that the project could run into, you have identified three of the most significant threats, in addition to the countermeasures that can be taken against them. As a result, I give you guys a score of five points for this aspect of the impact you could have.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You have provided a comprehensive outline of the project development plan as well as the steps necessary for its implementation by outlining it in terms of a nine-month road map beginning when the project can be funded and proceeding through four main stages.

You are very well known, not only in the place where you are living but perhaps in some other universities, in some other cities as well as in some other countries close to France, because in your capacity there are mentioning Benjamin Ben Zvi, who can speak four languages fluently and learn three others. I am very impressed with you. local, not only in the city where you live, but possibly in other universities, cities, and countries close to France\n\nYou also mentioned in your proposal that you would use resources from other students to be able to finish your project on Catalyst, which is a good idea for outreach, especially the students. In regard to the budget, I believe it to be reasonable in light of the typical income you receive. Additionally, each component of the expenditures is broken down in considerable detail, because determining how well you can build and finish projects within your capacity is a very important factor. I give this aspect of the feasibility a score of 5 points.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The measurement of the progress made on the project is a relatively necessary issue that calls for transparency from the owner of the project. You could come up with content measuring progress, but according to my own personal contribution, you should come up with and create your own social media channels, because right now I can't actually find them. You could come up with content about measuring progress, or your communication methods, such as Telegram or YouTube. Next is the success of the project with the numbers you mentioned, which is considered feasible, with approximately 300 students after 8 months, and if you can still maintain the discussions and apply for funding in funds next year, I think this will be a channel for students to connect, not only in terms of Blockchain but also in humanity and society.

It is true that blockchain technology has the potential to become prevalent and integrated into many aspects of life, just as what the Internet used to be. Therefore, the proposer emphasizes the importance of students becoming the facilitator of this technology, thus planning to create a blockchain community, first within universities. The proposer also sees potential of the students in his international French business university - Grenoble Ecole de Management. The proposer manages to give background information about the school (with illustration) - with a large number of international students, these students will have relations with other students from other schools and back in their homeland, where the idea of blockchain technology will get more exposure. Identifying this advantage, the proposal opens Telegram groups for students to discuss blockchain-related topics. Students from these groups will also have regular presentations as well as promoting this project into their universities. The impact of this project will be widespread among these universities and publicly as the monthly meetings will be recorded and posted to Youtube. The most visible impact of this project will be raising awareness among students about blockchain technology. With students from different chains to discuss with each other, their knowledge will become more profound as they learn from the differences, pros and cons of those chains. This is also a good way to introduce Cardano and the Catalyst project to people who weren\u2019t used to them before. This may also spark cross-chain collaboration, helping to create more innovation and proposals that will utilize the Catalyst project. Therefore, the proposer manages to create the project that will make a contribution to the Cardano ecosystem. The main risks presented are reasonable and sufficiently addressed. The proposer is able to mention the lack of participation and mitigated this through professional advertisement and appealing content during meetings.

The tasks for each period of time are detailed, with clear instructions. Not only does the proposal list what will be done, but also how to do it. The specification is good - informative, instructive but not too lengthy. For instance, in September, the proposal lists a step-by-step set of activities and the tools to help with organization (excel calendar). The budget is also clear. However, for parts such as \u201cpreparing presentation and keeping updates\u201d ($250 X 8 months = $2000), the proposer should account for what determines that specific budget. This could be explained as salary given to presenters, admin per hour or other reasons depending on the proposer\u2019s plan. The team members (3) include students from the business school and an experienced proposer. Two of them have experience with Catalyst and the Cardano community and one will be in charge of professional presentations and editing. Furthermore, they are all enthusiastic with Cardano and blockchain technology in general, which is positive for feasibility. The proposer\u2019s explanation for the question of further funding really shows his determination to realize this project and give assurance about how the next fund will be in the right hands.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer is also able to give good key metrics for progress assessment. Some key metrics are quantifiable (number of views/likes, number of users in Discord/Telegram). Feedback is also collected through surveys. This shows many perspectives that the proposer will gather data from. A report will be given at the end of the project. There will also be deliverables - which are the recordings of meeting and presentation.

The team realized that it was necessary to have a connection of students from different blockchains to share knowledge and widely promote blockchain technology. This is a good idea and I personally support this project. The project promises to expand the community when it is successfully implemented.\nThe proposer represents the future vision of blockchain development and the desire to popularize blockchain to students. The functions and components of the project have been stated very specifically in the proposal. The proposers also outline how the project will be implemented. The target audience of the project is also stated above. It is the students who have not had access to the knowledge of blockchain technology. Readers can clearly see the impact of this project on potential audiences through this proposal. The proposal also details the technical side by giving examples of case studies.\nThe results that the project will achieve are based on the goals of the Challenge. The project supports the promotion of Catalyst and assists several proponents from different blockchains to make proposals for the Catalyst project. This attracts even more people to the community and helps expand the Cardano community. These results completely match the Key metrics that Challenge sets.\nThe team also recognized the challenges of implementing the project.

The plan that the proposal proposes is reasonable not only in specifying the tasks but also in setting standards for those tasks.
