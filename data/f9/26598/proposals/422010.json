I was expecting to see information of perhaps use of native scripts (like Milkomeda), Cardano validators, Plutus or Plutarch smart contracts, or the combination of any or all of these.  \n\nIt's hard to say this proposal is answering the challenge ask when it only provide details about EVM technology for bridging and zero about UTXOs side of the bridge.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project provide a detail milestones and timeline but none of the deliverables speaks towards the Cardano side of this bridge.

Applying this concept with DeFi in mind makes a lot of sense and is a great case study for overcoming tribalism and fostering deeper collaboration between different communities of developers.\nThe proposers do a good job in discussing the different stakeholders that will benefit from this bridge, and not only focus on the technical implementation, but also PR, community and impact of their work. \nThis project promises to have real impact on cross-chain transfer of assets and collaboration between hitherto unconnected open source contributors.

The rest of the costs will be paid out the Sifchain treasury/budget. The project lists 8 team members and 4 auditors, with external links to their profiles. The budget breakdown is detailed and makes good use of external resources and auditing companies. Risks are discussed and mitigated well. \nA lot more discussion and explanation should have been given about the 90% of the budget not funded by Project Catalyst, as it otherwise puts a fairly large part of this challenge setting at risk (>15%) outside the control of Catalyst audit. While this does not deteriorate the likely probability of successful delivery, it puts the audit and influence by Catalyst at risk as we are only a \"junior partner\" in the project. As a grant to make this project happen it might still be well worth it, but some documentation for the funding with proof of funds would have been required in my opinion as this request for fractional funding is quite unusual in the current format of Project Catalyst.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "With Project Catalyst and Cardano only paying for 10% of the budget of this project and no guarantee or likelihood of a partial result were the other funding party not to pay up, I cannot agree that this project will be sufficiently auditable for Project Catalyst challenge team members or auditors.

Interoperability will be valued and a reality in upcoming years for Cardano. The COSMOS chain has a strong community of builders and investors and have made impressive strides in Defi and DAO voting.  Sifchain had some unfortunate liquidity problems during the market crash, but they have since steered back on course, learned from their mistakes, and are building in the bear market.  I have paid attention to some of the projects built on COSMOS and I have often thought that those products would work well with things that are being built on Cardano.

They have no further plans to ask for any more from the Cardano Treasury as they plan to fund themselves after the bridge is completed.  3 realistic risks are presented and possible solutions are provided in the proposal, including the extremely important subject of bridge security.

The problem presented is consistent with the challenge that needs to be addressed. Omni-EVM is a large-scale construction project that aims to connect platforms, ecosystems together such as Ethereum, BSC, Moonriver, etc. The current proposal is only part of it, making cardano connections with Cosmos/Sifchain and vice versa. The solution of the proposal shows that the author has studied the cross-chain interoperability of CEXes, the use of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) technology is in line with the challenge. The solution is implemented to increase the operation of defi, connecting assets will be easier. This impacts the Cardano, Cardano ecosystem which is integrated with global Defi structures. The main goal of the proposal is to connect assets between the Cardano and Cosmos ecosystems, Cardano's users are exposed to the Cosmos ecosystem and vice versa, it will be easier to implement liquidity. This is in line with the installed challenges, solving the problem given. The proposal identified the risks of a possible developer shortage, the risk of a hacker attack, and legal risks. We can see appropriate risk reduction, evidence of the project's ability to implement developers and internal legal experts of the project. We have an opinion on the risks when the bridge's connection is not made, the understanding is not the connection cardano and Cosmos, as far as the solution implements the proposal is part of the project connecting many platforms, ecosystems. So the project that is implemented will have ecosystem connections, for example: BSC is connected to Ethereum, if so cardano can be connected to BSC or Ethereum? We are interested in this, we hope that the author will have appropriate solutions to this problem.\nI rated: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan for implementing the proposal gives details, clearly showing the work done with important timelines of one month. We can see that the plan has identified the work that needs to be done carefully, after only 2 months it is possible to test the evidence of the transaction successfully executed. The recording of the entire Peggy 1.0 demo and Peggy 2.0 demo was planned to perform as stated. The plan of this proposal is part of the implementation of the Omni-EVM project. We are very interested in the stages of the project implementation that have previously been connected by which ecosystems? The implementation of the construction of bridges connecting previous ecosystems that the project has implemented can help us further evaluate the success of this proposal. The Omni-EVM project requires a budget of $1449,500, and the proposal to build a bridge between Cardano and Cosmos requires only $150,000 (10 percent). We haven't seen the details in the spending table of the granted funds, instead the budget analysis of the whole Omni-EVM project, but this is just a summary. We asked for a detailed analysis of the use of the proposed amount of the proposal, and we hope the author will add these data. This helps us better define the possibility of success of the proposal. The proposal has identified human resources to implement the plan, these are also members who are implementing the Omni-EVM project.

Detailed reports on the work done, the research papers, the Peggy 1.0 and Peggy 2.0 have recorded V.etc. The author should consider committing to the implementation of these reports. Indicators/KPIs determine the success of the proposal as appropriate when smart contracts are successfully audited and uploaded in Cardano EVM and Sifchain Blockchains, and liquidity is implemented.
