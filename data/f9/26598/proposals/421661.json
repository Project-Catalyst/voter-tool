Moreover, there's no decentralized way to transfer liquidity across different DeFi protocols.

The proposal clearly pointed out the problems of current cross-chain bridges: the lack of transparency, security, and centralization. To solve the problems on the spectrum network, proposal will use the optimized Roll-Dpos collusion mechanism.\nThe community can refer to Iotex's short explanation of Roll-Dpos here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysdFgTt70Lw\nBasically, this is a great new idea to use the Roll-Dpos consensus mechanism to create a network of intermediaries connecting heterogeneous blockchains. However, I have some notes for the community to consider about the spectrum network's solution, which in my opinion has not been clearly stated.\n1. To solve the problem of decentralization: spectrum network uses roll-dpos and there will be thousands of network nodes joining the network to create decentralization. However, what is the economic incentive for network node participants? although the proposal outlines this as follows: The fidelity of the selected participants is achieved by economic incentives built on the prisoner's dilemma from the theory game, which states that it is more profitable for each participant to betray the attacker and receive a reward than to join the attacker and take the penalty. But in a blockchain that specializes in IoT processing, this roll-dpos is feasible because the number of iot-related transactions is very large and has a small value. This creates an economic incentive for validators to participate heavily and reduces the possibility of network manipulation due to the small transaction value. Defi is completely different, the current Defi transaction is divided into small value transactions and large value transactions. Therefore, it is also necessary to have two solutions for the benefits for the nodes participating in these two types of transactions in Defi to create security for the network. Collusion to manipulate and attack the network will depend on the speed of transaction authentication, the processing mechanism when detecting fraud.\n2. The current cross-chain bridges are all built under the EVM server due to the large number of blockchains using the solidity language and these blockchains also use the Accounting ledger. According to the proposed solution, the Spectrum network will have no limitation on connecting heterogeneous blockchains. Maybe, the structure layer of the spectrum network can handle all data from blockchains with different background structures, so the infrastructure for the spectrum network can understand all smart contract programming languages, the data structures of the ledgers. Basically every programming language can \"understand\" each other if it is compiled to the same basic programming language. Perhaps the proposal will introduce this in the future so that the community can better evaluate.\nIf the proposal can clarify more about the economic motivation for the participants of the authentication network as mentioned in point 1 above and the safety and integrity of data as presented in point 2, then I assess This proposal will have a huge impact on the entire Defi and Cardano ecosystem. If judging from a personal point of view, I think the idea of \u200b\u200bspectrum network is very good, worth developing. But to evaluate from a perspective of a proposal related to finance, it is still necessary to give more details on risk prevention solutions to create trust for the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal will be implemented and completed in 6 months according to the detailed plan of the proposal. The implementation process is all the basic steps to establish a consensus network, create the necessary execution environments for a network to operate in the blockchain, create a test environment or testnet. If it's a regular team, I think this plan is unlikely to be feasible. However, the proposed team to implement the proposal is the ErgoDex development team, this is a team that has time to research and develop Dapps in 2 blockchains Cardano and Ergo. They are fully experienced enough to handle problems that arise during the implementation of the proposal. These factors have greatly shortened the steps needed to create a new layer 2 solution. And the goal of this proposal is just the initial stage of building the network and implementing the cross-chain bridge in its most basic form.\nThe proposed budget of $300,000 I consider reasonable compared to the potential generated by the proposal. Allocate the total budget to each individual who is primarily responsible for the implementation of the proposal for a period of 6 months and does not take into account other resources. This is an encouraging point as the proposal team can manage this part of the cost themselves.\nThe feasibility of this proposal is very high however I have a small note to the community and may not affect the feasibility of the proposal. The budget of the proposal is $300,000, almost a third of the total budget of the challenge. This can be an impact on the effectiveness and objective of the challenge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Based on the detailed plan and key metric given in the proposal, it is not possible to track the progress of the proposal, the proposer should provide more specific information such as:\n1. What source is tracking and checking?\n2. Will the proposed activities be reported on a weekly or monthly basis?\n3. Monthly dynamics of dApps created on top of Spectrum.Netwrok need to give specific KPIs.\nSince this is a very technically complex proposal, the more transparent testing sources are available, the easier it is for the community to be able to check.\nHow successful the project will look, if proposal reaches the testnet stage of the spectrum network without any serious security bug that discovered, there are some Dapps that accept to run the testnet, then this proposal will be very successful.

Cross-chain Defi solves the burden of layer 1 transactions with faster and cheaper cross-chain transactions.\nHigh performance cross-chain Spectrum.Network will impact the development of decentralized financial applications. It becomes easier, faster and more diverse. Based on the results (open source) of this project, it will be easier for developers to create applications that are more realistic, bring more transactions and therefore it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem.

Growth to on-chain activity from cross-chain implementations (of their open source dApp), including participants from other blockchains and several others, propose to feel tailor-made for a Challenge such as this. Voters often reward such effort and will see that, as expected, the KPIs are on track with the Challenge.

This highly skilled dev work (Rust) and breaking down everything the way they did means voters can either take the time to learn or just go to the end and read the \"bringing it all together statement\" this was a conscientious move on the part of the team.\n\nA few risks are offered, though some could use fuller detail for the benefit of voters. The mitigation for the first, answering a lack of dev forces with \"we will definitely find people\u2026\" is inadequate to voters often looking for concrete examples.

It is good that the team added both, as some voters will likely not have time to look into each link. \n\nThe budget is broken down into roles and specifies the type of development work and team roles they will take. Voters benefit from clarity in the numbers, \"showing their work\" for all math, so voters don't have to wonder or go to the trouble themselves.\n\nNext is to consider if the price is reasonable. My own extensive experience as a researcher was hardly necessary to find that many in the field charge twice as much as this team will for its Rust Development. Kudos to them for being good stewards of the Community Funds. The team should feel encouraged to set prices closer to the industry standard if continuing in future funds. That said, it is most practical for this project to ask for the total amount in one fund.\n\nThe plan is detailed and implementable. The actionable tasks are straightforward, and though the reader could benefit from a bit more of a breakdown of steps, it is clear that the team is building something new and will only have those details in their final examination.\n\nThe timetable is a straightforward 6-month set of milestones seen in the detailed plan. \n\nOne concern is the discrepancy between the question of whether they are working on a previous proposal or not, and they answer \"no,\" and later offer a link to their last 12-month plan.

This proposal addresses 5 sub-challenges within the Cross-Chain Collaboration Challenge and meets Fund9's strategic goal as an open-source project that will attract more developers. The proposer also puts into consideration a longer-term plan to scale the project sustainably (e.g., build user-friendly dApps on top of the platform, and engage the developer community). There are two recommendations I have for the team to make this section even stronger and more convincing to the community. First, I would hope to see more elaboration or quantitative metrics regarding how it will add value to the Cardano community specifically after this phase (i.e., the cross-chain capability between Ergo and Cardano).

Given that they want to build the first in the market decentralized, cross-chain platform, I would expect the team to have some sort of white paper or technical R&D paper to demonstrate their plan; (2) please consider security, speed, or other trade-offs under risks & mitigation.
