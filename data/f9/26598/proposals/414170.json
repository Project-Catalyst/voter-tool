It sees them as part of a whole and allows users to imagine seeing both as valid and part of what is possible. It moves users away from minimalistic thinking. And what's more, is that their stated goal is to show possibilities for creative collaborations and cross-chain community building.\n\nThe strategic and focus-realigning vision of the outcome makes perfect sense that it will be a value-add in the Cardano community and positively impact not only Catalyst's native blockchain but Ethereum as well. \n\nVoters will be pleased to see that KPIs match that of the challenge as described, and the team plans to record the results of the work they achieve with this project. Later, they will come back to gather more funding, continue their work, and make sure the Map accurately represents this fuller vision of the NFT ecosystems to continue serving the aims of collaboration and inspiration between the chains.\n\nThe risks mentioned ask questions about the possible reach of the team's work and if they have a complete vision of what to include. Mitigation plans include a media and marketing team as well as a research team to thoroughly look into both ecosystems and map out what has happened thus far and how those various categories of projects might be able to collaborate in the future.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skillsets are explained in the introductions of the team members. The team clearly took the statement \"Relevant Experience\" very seriously. It's hard to imagine a more accurate way of executing that part of the proposal. Voters will find it easy to determine what skills are needed and if the team contains those qualifications. \n\nThe budget continues the exemplary methodology of following the brief, maintaining ease of reading with clarity and identifiability of each area. As a researcher myself, I can say the budget is reasonable for the work and, if anything, is on the low-end of the pay rate for each position, though not alarmingly so. This says the team is conscientious about the spending of community funds and is mindful of the needs of others. Bravo.\n\nThere is no contingency budget, though, for the work at hand, it doesn't appear necessary. Besides this, the team is so multi-faceted that it's easy to imagine that their collective strength is in their numbers and consultations when challenges arise.\n\nThe plan is rigorous. It displays all pertinent previous work up to this point, well-ordered actionable tasks for the beginning of this proposal's mission\u2013\u2013Q3 2022, all the way to the release of version one in Q1 of 2023.

The NFT space has not been spared from this drama and there is often a lot of mud slinging about who is better, more innovative, and important. What is often not discussed is that there is enough room for both, and others. \n\nWhat I like about this proposal is that it isn't forcing cross chain collaboration, instead its highlighting that we might actually have a lot in common we just don't see. By providing a visual and informative overview of the projects building across the two ecosystems, individuals, groups, and projects can identify, connect, and learn with each other. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst off, the team putting this proposal forward is composed of some heavy hitters within the Catalyst space, particularly Swarm, Aim, and ArgusNFT. Each of these groups individually have an amazing track record of success and providing real value to the community, together the are likely unstoppable. \n\nSecond, the development and integration work to be completed to get the map fully functional is well laid out. If I had one critique here is that I would have liked a better description of the reports. They do mention what the goal of the reports are but what they will entail, how they will be structured, and drafted, could be expanded upon. \n\nLastly, I find it unfortunate but none of the map links worked for me. I just kept getting taken to a blue screen. I even changed browsers and cleared my cache before trying again but to no avail. Given this important piece is missing I give 4/5. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nThe team has committed to making their project open source and posting their map on the gitlab. Voters can be confident that the team is open and willing to have others examine and test their code to ensure it reaches the highest standard possible. This also reduces the likelihood of bugs going unnoticed for an extremely long time and then found by a malicious actor. \n\nAnother exciting part about how the team will audit is that it builds on the already excellent work of the Swarm and its integrations with discord and dework. This type of community bounty approach seems to work really well in Cardano and capitalizes on the wisdom of a broad set of community members, not just a small team. \n\nI think the success measures could perhaps be a bit stronger rather than saying \"widely known by thousands of participants\". That's a fine success measure, but how many thousands, by when, and interacting in what capacity? These types of details are likely not enough to reduce marks given the clarity on auditing overall, but something to consider for future funds.

The author has properly identified the current situation and developed a solution that fits the challenge presented, which is in line with the challenge installed for F9. Solving the challenge is creating the Open Source Map, the bridging interaction between Dapps in the Ethereum and Cardano ecosystems. The solution implemented will directly impact users and developers, we will not have difficulty choosing Dapp applications, and have the most suitable choice to build our own project. Ethereum this is suitable for the blockchain world, the proposal is highly scalable when there are structural changes and the number of Dapps increases in the future. It's great when we want to get to Catalyst Swarm, just go to the map and find what we need. The solution of the proposed proposal has a strong impact on the ecosystem of Cardano and Ethereum, developers have many opportunities in developing their projects, building Cardano and Ethereum to develop in parallel. The proposal identified the main risks as maps and reports that had no impact on the community, but this was mitigated by appropriate communication and marketing. We have an opinion: The author needs to develop the same manuals as electronic products on the market, which helps developers to be aware of the map and use the map in the most effective way. With our opinion it would be appropriate to minimize both of the risks that the proposal presents, developers can use maps easily and know information about the project, the most notable platforms and communities in the ecosystems. In addition, we agree with the studies and gather community opinions to get the best selection of projects, platforms, etc. in the map, which will help to make the implementation of the proposal successful.\nI rated: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has been in place since Q2 2022 and has created the project structure on Gitlab, PoC Ecosystem Map and project management structure on Swarm Dework & Discord.

We can see the rationality in the detailed planning process, the work to be done will be solved to bring to the final product is to create a map of the Cardano Ecosystem and Ethereum NFT. In the plan we have not seen the implementation of interface design using \"intense focus on Visualization and interaction\" as the author describes the solution section. We expect the author to plan to implement UI/UX to improve the quality of the user experience on the buttons created. In addition to the fact that communication and marketing are not yet in the plan, it takes time to specify for this. The proposal has introduced us to show that the implementation team is the members who have clear information, competence and ability to implement the proposal. Members have a clear assignment in the implementation plan, capable of completing the tasks well. The required amount is $40,900 for the implementation of the proposal, the Budget Analysis table gives details, the hours of paid labor are appropriate, there is capital spent on marketing and communication. Cloud storage on AuraDB Hosting is paid $1000 for 4 months.

This proposal is a collaboration between ArgusNFT, Catalyst Swarm, Fluid7, AIM & NFT Guild and combines the skills, experience, and resources available to the team.

Therefore, it would be very useful to develop visual tools that promote a greater understanding of the relationship between these two ecosystems; this would promote an understanding that is a prerequisite for designing truly influential projects for Cardano. Proponents state how unnecessary tribalism and ignorance get in the way of community members getting ahead, and I agree, it's not one group against the other.
