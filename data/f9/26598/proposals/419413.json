Not only RootsID team try to bring project to Cardano community, but also via this proposal they would like to represent Cardano in contributing to SSI standards with other developer from other chains. The solution that RootsID team would like to offer is by regularly engage with ToIP/DIF/HL working groups. Furthermore, it will also establish consistent voice from Cardano or Atala PRISM community at the table of SSI leadership. It will spread news about Cardano\u2019s identity efforts in the global audience. And this effort is aligned with cross-chain collaboration challenge setting metrics that is creating new connection between blockchain communities & increasing number of events/workshops arranged with other communities. From my point of view, this is really a good proposal that we, as Cardano community should support. I give 5 stars for the impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When it comes to the experiences in Atala PRISM, I think RootsID team that is part of Atala PRISM Pioneer 1st cohort is capable to achieve the targeted goals. Besides, they have funded proposals in the earlier Catalyst Fund. In addition, they are partnering with lots of other Atala PRISM Pioneer project and active in the global SSI communities. From my point of view, they are very qualified to represent Cardano & Atala PRISM and raise awareness via attendance in working groups or via publication regarding SSI standards. Equally important is that they also explain the timeline including the budget breakdown based on the working hours to produce the vlog plus time they spend to do meetings on several different chain communities. Furthermore, all the possible main risks are concisely answered with the solution to mitigate the risk that they could face during running the project. Overall, I\u2019m quite confident that RootsID team could bring the project into realization. Therefore, I give 5 stars for the feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "To begin with, let us look on the roadmap & milestones. RootsID team defined the work for total 3 months, starting from mid of September 2022 until end of December 2022. During this period, they said that they will produce 10 blog/vlog posts. The community could check the result via their Discord/website/Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWndfxfz5_UxJFWfyXKD_w). And after checking, they already have several SSI report on their YouTube for the previous funded proposal. When it comes to KPI, they clearly defined what does success looks like. For example, adoption/use of ToIP, DIF, and HL specs/tools in RootsID and Atala PRISM software by their growing list of partners. Personally speaking, Cardano community could easily audit/check their project progress via their social media, especially YouTube channel. If you need to ask them a question, I have checked that they will always respond via RootsID Discord server too. Thereupon, I give 5 stars for the auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2174", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for your thoughtful review and encouragement!"}, {"id": 1294, "q0": "The proposer identifies the problem that currently, there is no project that would contribute to SSI DID discussion and therefore the SSI community is not aware of Cardano Identity solutions. The solution offered by the proposer is involving attendance on the 10 SSI meetings where they will be spreading information and increasing the awareness about AtalaPrism, DIDs, SSI solutions, tools or wallets. So from my perspective, the proposal will be completing the onboarding function, as well as it can induce cross-chain collaboration, and increasing the awareness about the current DID solutions that exist on the Cardano blockchain. Considering the final outcome, and that it will be narrowly set (only DID meetings etc) I think the overall impact and on the challenge fund will not be \u201c5\u201d star huge, but at the same time, the continuous effort can potentially lead to unexpected partnerships or adaptations, thus, I keep my score full.

It is not mentioned, whether such meetings will involve transport and accommodation, but nevertheless, it is not decreasing the feasibility of the proposal. Deliverables described by the proposer are: Open source GitHub repo (which will be updated by proposer, after meetings), youtube videos and social media engagements, and meeting notes and documentation. I think all these three deliverables are in accordance with the aim of the proposal, and I find them feasible. The proposal will be performed by Lance Byrd \u2013 who is a member of RootsID.

As for the success, the metrics that will allow us to measure it is increased awareness both of among SSI community during meetings and vlogs, contributions during meetings and adoption. To be honest, I am not sure if these are the most reliable metrics. To follow adaptation and awareness, I would try to follow \u2013 the number of engagements of blogs/vlogs(comments, likes, shares, views). Then, regarding the awareness and adaptation \u2013 the number of new partnerships, new contacts, or new solutions that utilize RootsID products (any) could be followed.

They are linking to a series of other major identity-ledger systems, advancing the integration of KYC into Cardano, and helping develop international standards. \n\nIn addition, the plan is simple, attend the meetings, document the attendance and outcomes, integrate best practices into their solutions.

This is an excellent way to help get information out to the community through a variety of mediums, rather than just a report that sits in an inbox somewhere (although I'm sure the team does that too). \n\nIf the team's track record is to be trusted, then the community should feel in good hands with this proposal too.

Having spent time learning about the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) conversation on Cardano and being a user of some of the apps, I can confidently share with voters that it's integral to have such a dedicated \"seat at the table\" for Cardano as the proposal would provide. Who better than Cardano product developers in SSI? In this assessors estimation, the proposal offers a high value-add to the Cardano ecosystem, especially as SSI becomes increasingly widely used. Voters benefit from the diligence around spelling out and linking likely unknown titles and phrases; it is a conscientious proposal.\n\nThis proposal will be executed within the first 3 months of funding\u2013\u2013its impact clearly within the 6-12 month timeline. By that point, several people, if they choose, will be able to learn from the content and implement it on their projects. As there is much happening with other products aside from RootID, it is clear that several individuals and working groups in Cardano will benefit directly.\n\nThe goals listed are very \"inner-Cardano.\" But it is harder to measure the impact that happens as others at these multi-chain meetings are inspired by this work on Cardano, relationships are formed, and possibilities open. Voters can see from this that the proposal fits within the \"spirit\" of the Challenge.\n\nAt first glance, the risks presented in the Impact section appear to offer no mitigation. If rewriting, calling these out as mitigation tactics would be helpful for voters: The co-working with other SSI platforms for the first and hiring another person for the second. Beyond this, there is no mention of any budget the team has to make such a hire if necessary. This is the PA's rationale behind 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer indirectly offers the needed skill sets in his introduction to \"people who will work on the project.\" Voters can see from the other provided details that the work is being done within the context of being part of a much larger plan and organization, where several teammates and community members may also be able to lend a hand at times.\n\nThe project is pleasingly basic in its stages and extremely clear in budget. There are 3-months of work (a realistic timetable to complete, no doubt), meetings already scheduled (which make up the majority of the work), videos planned, and conversations with the community in their roadmap. Thus, there is a detailed implementable plan. \n\nVoters can also be sure that the cost per hour is justified and likely low (but not too low), as specialized knowledge is required to carry out the work. Such a proposal opens doors for connection with others in and out of the Cardano community. These conversations are (and it is no stretch to say) at the bleeding edge of a more significant conversation around identity for humanity at large.\n\nThe proposer will continue to utilize Catalyst in the future if there is a need but sees that this will be the final proposal for this particular project. \n\nVoters can find further confidence that besides the funding, all resources and technical aspects needed are already in the proposer's possession.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Beyond this, the roadmap is clear, with milestones of meetings attended, videos released and adding the knowledge to RootsID and the community.\n\nVoters can see that the increased awareness of Cardano/Prism/Catalyst among the greater ToIP, DIF, and HL community (representing several blockchains) is the bulk of the \"work\" on this proposal and is at its heart. Bravo, proposer!\n\nThe metrics for measurement are straightforward, as mentioned above, and the KPIs are both attainable and realistic.

Furthermore, the success in raising awareness of SSI standards through the publication of a nearly weekly blog/vlog giving the Cardano/Catalyst communities an easy connection to benefit from these specs/tools/communities, and adoption/use of ToIP, DIF, and HL specs/tools in RootsID and Cardano/Prism/Catalyst software by the growing list of partners are interesting theoretical approaches.
