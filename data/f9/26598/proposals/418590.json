Through this project they propose their solution will improve implementation of solutions from other chains on Cardano, creating more connections between chains, and sharing of best practices and information between chains. However, I think that this proposal is more suited to the DAO challenge given it's primary focus on setting up structures for individuals to work together in a decentralized way, rather than necessarily addressing cross chain collaboration. \n\nEven in light of this, I still think the proposal has the potential to successfully impact the Cardano community, with the potential of bringing in other chains. I just can't give full marks as the fit is more tangential than direct. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe proposal and plan is extremely comprehensive and the team explains essentially every single aspect of their intentions and expectations. While maybe a bit long for the average person, reading through the proposal makes it painstakingly clear that the team is prepared and equipped to deliver. I would encourage the team though to perhaps consider the readability of the proposal in future rounds. \n\nThe breakdown of deliverable, specific activities, expected outcomes, and the groups/individuals for each of the components in the plan really removes any guess work that readers would need to do. The team clearly has a broad overall vision and outlines their path for how they will achieve it. \n\nGiven the work outlined, the budget feels very fair. It is obvious that they are already doing a lot of the work and that the requested funds will be spent on progressing their efforts even further. There is not much to critique in this section, excellent work. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs I've stated in other assessments, any project that commits to being open source by default can give the community assurances that they will have the opportunity to provide input and feedback to the proposers, should they chose to. This aligns with the broad goal of Cardano, and the Cardano Community, which is to be a major open source project. The team also already has a variety of products and tools that the community can engage with and help guide the process overall. \n\nSince the plan and budget are so detailed there is no need to guess how the funds will be spent and what the community can expect for them. The granularity of each section and budget item gives ample confidence in the ability to track the project's success. \nOne thing that may be challenging for the team is to report on all of the measures and indicators listed, however, given the size of their team this may ne a non issue. I did find it a bit difficult to not get overwhelmed by all of the different auditability components so would encourage the team to be a bit more succinct with their writing. However, all the information is there and so no points removed. \n\nExcellent work.

I noticed this issue is related to the goal set in the Challenge which is \"Cross-chain Collaboration\". The team also outlined a solution to that problem: The team will provide updates on development, manage information, and research decentralized organization processes. In my opinion, if implemented and applied well in practice, this proposal will add value to the Cardano ecosystem, the proposal made on the Cardano blockchain platform has also had the most positive impact. to the Cardano ecosystem. Currently, the DAO is in its infancy, dominated by many centralized factors. It is very important to provide and manage information in a decentralized way, as a starting point for building decentralized organizations, DAOs. Information is communicated between all individuals and organizations, which increases opportunities for learning and collaboration. This proposal can scale and solve the challenge in the future. I think that will take a lot of time. But there is hope anyway because the team's proposal is creative, practical, and can be applied in practice. I rate it 5 stars because I am completely satisfied with the impact of this recommendation.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to the proposal, the team has more than 100 members from 15 countries around the world with experience in the use of blockchain technology, and understanding of digital technology. I consider the experience gained to be very suitable for implementing this proposal - a proposal created based on the Cardano blockchain. The team has provided all documents related to LFF for the community to follow and study. I appreciate this action because it is a demonstration of the team's public transparency. One nice thing that I noticed is that the key members are all publicly identifiable through social networks. Each member shows the link to the LinkedIn social network. This has a great effect to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal and build the team's reputation in the community.\nI was very impressed with the presentation of the team's budget, it was very detailed and reasonable with the goal. Specifically, the budget is broken down into sections: Modules, and tasks, based on which, the team has calculated the necessary cost to implement the proposal. The method of calculating the team's wages is applied according to the working hours, I completely agree with this calculation because it is a popular and highly accurate calculation method in most large companies around the world. I just have a small question, other than the (expected) funding from Catalyst, does the team have any other funding sources from other organizations to implement this proposal? I ask this because I want to clearly define feasibility based on the proposed budget.\nOne thing I love about the team is the planning and execution of the proposal. It is very clear and concise, with maps and illustrations. I wish that all proposals on Catalyst were so clear and vivid.\nRegarding the resources needed to implement the proposal, I temporarily divided them into two main resources, which are financial resources and human resources. With the financial resources, I mentioned above regarding budgeting. As for human resources, I am quite confident because the human resources team has more than 100 members from 15 countries around the world. This is a strong confirmation of the feasibility of the proposal - the proposal can be implemented quickly and on time as required. Not only that, the core members are all people who have knowledge and expertise in blockchain, DAO, marketing, and communication. Although a member of the team made another proposal alongside this one in Fund 9, I am confident to say that the team can best implement this proposal.\nIn terms of technical and technological aspects when implementing the proposal: There is a lot of high technology involved: blockchain, DAO, and communication. Applying these technologies to engineering-related tasks and being divided into modules makes me feel very secure when the team does technology-related work. Have you ever thought about hiring experts to assist in the implementation of this proposal? I think with what the team has presented, the proposal can be done well without the presence of an expert unless the team wants to contact the expert to find new ideas and learn. knowledge, the good from them - because they are, after all, the best in the world in terms of expertise.\nAbout the challenges and risks related to the implementation of the proposal: One team fully outlined the risks related to different aspects - capital risk, technology risk, and marketing risk. As for capital risk, I would like to add one more opinion regarding Ada's price slippage, which affects the team's budget capital provided by Catalyst. We all know that the cryptocurrency market is in a downtrend, that's why we have to face Ada slippage (volatile day-to-day). My advice is that the team should carefully consider the budget requested through the Catalyst grant so that when receiving funding from Catalyst, there will not be a budget shortfall to implement the project. Several proposals at the previous Fund have encountered this. This is the experience that I have seen, please share it with the team. Hope the team can consult to make reasonable adjustments. If the team needs more funding, come up with a verifiable plan.\nIn summary, as an active community member, I am confident in saying that the team is definitely up to the challenge. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal - I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The way the team presents the roadmap, and the milestones are exactly what I mean (attaching specific months of the year to the goals to be done) - I appreciate this. In looking at other suggestions, I didn't see many that did this. It will be very convenient for the community to determine the transparency and auditability of the proposal.\nIt's a pity that the performance indicator (KPI) was not mentioned by the team in the proposal. We all know the role of KPIs is important to evaluate and audit proposals. I hope the team will soon come up with a suitable KPI to add to the proposal. Then it will become more perfect.\nIn return, the team has presented key metrics: Long-term initiatives, projects, Dapps, etc... If the team gives specific numbers to illustrate the key metrics criteria mentioned by me above is good.\nThe problems have been described clearly and in detail by the team throughout the proposal and are easy to understand, along with appropriate solutions to overcome the problem and prevent risks. Here are some of my positive comments and contributions to the proposal. Teams can refer. I agree with the auditability of this proposal (I hope the team adds KPIs and specific numbers of key metrics).

The author should also consider the risks that may affect the challenge as: the biggest risk in the immediate future is financial one of the difficulties that the author has foreseen and makes the judgments for Littlefish organization as follows: a complex organization driven by individual effort. Funding is the most difficult challenge that project authors have to face. If there is no funding, they will still build LEF but can implement the project but it will be difficult and slower. Technology is also a problem that is quite difficult if LFF is developing a strong infrastructure to be able to scale that technology and development team cannot meet, that is also an obstacle. grow hungry with them. Stronger marketing is required on the success of the proposal as it is highly dependent on the spread of highly promotional generated information to the users. The author also raises the risk of marketing if the spread of marketing activities is not widely distributed, the information that the team proposes will make the information of the activities not widely spread. it will be slow and ineffective in attracting the public. This is why the author has raised marketing as a risk in this proposal. The author is also developing the team at Love House, and an LFF working group in charge of marketing, the author also does everything to connect with communities from the other side of the blockchain ocean building community and cohesion is mainly because of the thoroughness of the proposed team I believe this project will be successful if funded.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The expected completion date for this project is from September 2022 to February 2023.
