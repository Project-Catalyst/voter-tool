So in short, these will represent stocks in digital form. So investors will have to really consider to who they invest, because tokens will represent the success of the requestors. The proposers plan to meet the challenge goal by approaching the current existing projects on other chains to bring them in, and they are already having discussions with polkadot community, therefore these are aligned with the challenge goal. Regarding the risks, I completely agree that the biggest risk will be to keep the traction. Nevertheless, primarily, I believe it will be serving for onboarding, and to support any type of business, and also increase the awareness regarding the Cardano. The only information I failed to find is how the value of these new tokens will be maintained (I believe, there will be required a legally bounding document claiming that by owning of tokens of particular company, you are actually having their share).

For the item Content and Community manager \u2013 I am missing information what is the expected time donation (full time, part time) and possibly hourly wage. For the item \u201cPaid promotions\u201d I am missing information whether the amount is based on some pre-agreed amount, or if some research was already performed and we know that the budget is based on some information, or whether it is just a guess. The team is having 3 partners and currently is having 7 members in total, from different countries.

For more frequent reports, public channels such as twitter or telegram or discord can be used. Regarding the success of the proposal, the number of boarded projects, interested projects and launched projects is going to be measured. I think, the most reliable metric would be the number of projects that launched on the platform are actually originally from different chains, or, if possible, to somehow monitor funders origin (since we want to increase cross chain collaboration, we can have projects from different chains, or investors from different chains, and both of these will result in increased cross-chain collab.)", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2222", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1443, "q0": "The proposal would be within the challenge goal, and I think that this proposal probably will increase transaction on Cardano blockchain, through Cardano's blockchain native multi token capabilities, facilitating the mechanisms for Tokenization of businesses by minting Digital Assets in the Cardano blockchain, enabling funding and liquidity for both the company and the investors. \nAt the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is only high-level explained and in my opinion it doesn\u2019t clear how the funding market will adopt these features, and it doesn\u2019t clear how this proposal can create incentive for customers and stakeholders.\nI think it's important to improve details about the proposal services solution for the challenge (eg.

It is nice to see such a proposal  enabling funding and liquidity for both the company and the investors. Seeing that the team has been funded for different projects, in other sections,  proves that we are talking about an experienced group of people that are taking seriously the cross-chain collaboration thing, getting in touch with people from the Polkadot community.

The budget is described in a clear manner as well, and has been broken down into identifiable manners. I would like to see what exactly each member is going to be responsible of from the intentifiable items that were mentioned above. Four months seem as a quite realsitic time horizon and it is nice to see that it is a step by step kind of an approach.

This might have a very large impact. Unquestionably, bringing in and integrating ecosystem companies, products, and developers is advantageous for the Cardano chain. However, it is also important to bring in outside companies and developers by providing support in any form that is practical. And I think that this proposal successfully complies with their demands. With Cardano, it's straightforward to enable funding and liquidity for both the company and the investors' thanks to its inherent multi-token blockchain features. In order to enable such a phenomenon, the author advises developing and providing a platform as a service so that companies can plan, build, administer, and sell their tokens. This proposal is an addition to another made by the same team, and it is just being made for research purposes. This proposal is specifically intended to conduct research on and identify the companies that the team believes are deserving of integration into their system. Thus, if this project were to be implemented properly, it would significantly affect the chain by bringing in new business owners and clever developers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no doubt regarding the proposers' skills because Alan and Harry appear to be leaders in their professions and would provide outstanding support for the research project. It's also critical to acknowledge the work put into developing the plan. The proposer provides the community and readers with a detailed road map that includes the necessary resources, potential dangers, and quantitative indicators. A brief introduction to the team and the expertise they might bring to the ecosystem is provided by the team, along with a note that some of the developer and project management positions have already been filled. Since some of the team members have had success in prior rounds, there is a good possibility that the proposal will be successful. The suggested funds are relatively acceptable when compared to the challenge's overall budget. The distribution also seems acceptable given how little developers of competing solutions are paid per head. It is obvious from the available facts that this plan has a fair possibility of being implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has more of a groundwork outlook rather than its sibling project which is more development oriented. The author understands this very fundamental difference and provides suitable metrics accordingly. Progress metrics are defined distinctively for each of the phases and are very closely aligned with the milestones specified in the tentative timeline of the team. The outcome KPIs such as the number of projects onboarded, attendance on the team's social media channels, and the traffic on their website could be wonderful metrics to measure the progress and acceptance levels of the proposal by the community. With the quantifiable metrics with a figure against them are used to help the community picture what the success of the proposal would look like.
