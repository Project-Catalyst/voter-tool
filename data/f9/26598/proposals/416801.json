And this proposal will outreach other chain communities via online event to share knowledge between communities. Furthermore, the key metrics of the proposal is aligned with the challenge setting metrics that is increasing the number of events/workshops arranged with other communities. By having these AMAs, it will bring awareness about Cardano to the other chain communities, and it will further drive adoption/collaboration through exploration and ideas from the community in the future. In brief, I think this proposal will be a good starting point for Indonesian Cardano community to explore ideas from other chain communities. Overall, I give 5 stars for the impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of experience, based on the proposer background, I think that the proposer is quite active within Cardano community, especially in Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall. In addition, Ivan is also Ambassador for Moonbeam Indonesia and advocate for Chainlink Indonesia. Therefore, in my opinion he is quite capable to host event and bridge different chain communities altogether in AMA. On top of that, the budget is broken quite well into smaller detail, plus the total budget is quite reasonable (USD 3420) to host 3 AMAs online via Zoom. The proposal provides also good timeline, where they host 1 AMA / month with different communities (such as: Harmony, Cosmos and Polkadot). I believe that the team (Ivan & Stevani) supported by Cardano Indonesia Community could run the AMA successfully if funded. Taking everything into consideration, I give 5 stars for the feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We live in an age where most of the thing could be checked online. The proposer provided Cardano Meetup link (https://www.meetup.com/Cardano-Blockchain-Jakarta/) where they will post the event to the communities. Moreover, they also provide GitHub link and YouTube, where they will post the Zoom recording so people could rewatch it again. In addition, the proposal also gives good key metrics & goals such as holding 3 successful AMA in 3 months, that could be measured via Meetup/YouTube. The roadmap is achievable within the timeline and the proposer specifically know how to contact the other chain communities. Nevertheless, it would be great if the proposer could give more detail about what topic that they would like to bring up during AMA in the roadmap. In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2174", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6102, "q0": "The author of the proposal realizes, that there are many chains, but they build their own chains independently. There is a need to strengthen communication, coordination and collaboration between chains in Indonesia so that everyone can learn from each other. In terms of geographical location, Indonesia belongs to the Continent: Asia, with a population of 274.1 million people (in 2020). Ranked 4th in the world and 3rd in Asia. More than 53% of the population uses the internet. This is a favorable condition for relationship building, awareness and understanding among the communities of the chain in Indonesia, to learn from each other and inspire each other. The proposed impact on the challenge was posed and described in great detail and richness. The proponent will hold three AMAs with crypto communities and cross-chain communities in Indonesia (once a month, for 3 months). The author provides many cross-chain websites and the Blockchain community. The AMA and the Indonesian cross-chain community will help people better understand the Cardano community and what the team has been up to. Besides, the author of the proposal also recognizes the possible risks. At the same time, there are solutions to minimize risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author of the proposal says that If funded, the AMA will be held for 3 months (September to November 2022).

And the Proposal's Plan is laid out with a clear roadmap divided into 3 months and organized by milestones. And is provided with full links of websites and community channels. We know what will be done in the 3 month period of the project. Next is the budget. The author proposed a budget of $3,420 for the project. This is a fairly low budget for the workflow and the time it takes to do the project. In my opinion, the team needs to propose more budget to ensure the progress and success of the project is feasible and sustainable over time. About the requested budget. The author has provided a very detailed budget table. The budgets are broken down, and allocated to each very specific job, estimated hourly, for each specific job. Finally, about the team of proposed team members. We learned that Ivan Kwananda Pangestu is Eastern Hemisphere City Hall Team Member, Community Developer and network developer at Indonesian blockchain communities...Stevani Ongko is also Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall Team Member. ... We are about the identity, role and skills of each member and have attached links so we can learn more about them.

Detailed step-by-step roadmap and budget analysis for easy audits and successful project progress. Although it is a completely new proposal, it has demonstrated the experience and expertise of the team, increasing the sustainable strength of the project. The proposal team provided us with multiple ways to track and measure project progress. Organized 3 AMAs with 3 Indonesian community chains in 3 months; Posted at GitHub Cardano Indonesia; The meeting is tracked, via the Link: Cardano MeetUp; and upload the AMA to the Cardano Indonesia Youtube Channel. That means we can track how the project will develop in many ways, and we know what value it will bring to the community. And the final product is what is expected, the success of this project.

It aligns well with the challenge's main objectives: \"find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions.\u201d It is a shame that the proposer has not decided what materials to share and whom the session speaker is because the effectiveness of AMA depends heavily on the factor mentioned above. That being said, I think the further discussion takes time, and it's understandable that the detailed topics have not been provided. Overall, I strongly agree with the idea and will join the session if it is funded. It is an exciting first step toward cross-chain collaboration in Indonesia and avoiding the echo chamber phenomenon.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Feasibility tends to be on the agreeable side. The proposer has listed their profiles and is involved in Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall, especially Ivan, who seems to be actively involved in many blockchain communities.\n\nThe budget requested has been broken down into items. However, I found the last item (Operational & Miscellaneous) to be redundant. The marketing materials should be included in the promotion designer item and there seems to be no need for stationery; the proposer could take notes using their laptop.\n\nAnother thing, albeit small, I think the proposer needs to address the challenge of engaging with the listeners. Put it this way; if I were to join a sharing event about a blockchain technology I am not familiar with, I would be confused and feel disengaged, right? There are alternatives to deal with this problem, of course, by providing early handouts about the material before the event starts or simply sharing beginner topics during the session. But, again, I am sure the proposer has a way to deal with this; I want to see it being addressed in the proposal.\n\nOverall, I tend to agree with the feasibility, some aspects could be improved, but based on the roadmap and the implementation outline, I foresee no major obstacles.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There seems to be no problem with auditability. The proposer target to successfully host three sharing sessions within three months. It is also straightforward to track those sessions because of the links provided. However, I would like the cross-chain collaborative efforts to bear fruits, maybe in the form of a consolidated chat group between those chains. Another form would be speaker notes, publicly available so everyone from all communities could see how the transfer of knowledge went.
