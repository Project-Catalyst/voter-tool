An idea in a series of events, but not problems is just by Cardano (since creating a series of events, problems is just about that, creating the intention to study and export over the chains). These workshops would not know as an audience artists who produced NFT, the idea would be to teach them how to mint in Cardano or even present the target technology to those who want to em. I think this is all within the context that we seek, the proponent quite aware of the fact that it looks like the people of Cape Town will not become fully clear - now they are fully aware of blockchain technology, so he is fully aware of blockchain technology , so he is fully aware of blockchain technology specific concepts, coinage such as \"What is discarded an NFT and why is it not just a project jpg Differences between Blockchains and NFTs, sites of similarity and hype, rating tools, past and factors secondary successes, setting up a wallet, and why art is essential to the ecosystem and the long-term vision and application of NFTs.\u201d Ethereum also points out that it will combine with marketing experts to provide smart solutions, according to some electrical methods. , can also be combined with it. further explanations: what would this approach look like?) Only a few details remained pend people here, in my view. First, how many events would there be, how often would they happen, would we already have a defined location to rent? Then, from which audience do you intend to attract the attention of the audience of these workshops? Marketing is always a part of any proposal, but especially as a proposal of this nature, which aims to promote the sum of new active members to the Cardano community - knowing that these people would be super important to be engaged, at first, to study and better understand our ecosystem, its various possibilities and opportunities. How can we arouse the interest of conventional artists, so that they seek to produce NFT? I think these issues would be worth commenting on as well. Quite a proposal, the proposal since we know what I weigh, what are the guidelines to be addressed, what are the issues to be proposed and also how the possible proposals made would be mitigated. All of this is very much in line with the specific goals of the challenge, to bring new members to our community and to promote well-being and beneficial exchanges between Cardano and other blockchains; These challenges are known and are cited, for example, \u201cAwareness and Governance, Culture, Organization and Inclusion, Innovation and Decision Making, Collaboration Tools and Platforms, Encouraged Participation\u201d and so on. For reasons, I believe it deserves top marks when it comes to the impact proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is viable, but we still have a lot to improve here. Speaking of script, first. The whole is divided into phases, these phases are divided into weeks and some tasks are delegated to each, as is clear in the excerpt: \u201cPhase 1 Pre-Launch (1-4 weeks): 40 Days - Marketing, networking, public relations, articles, interviews, 30 Days - Location, lease agreements, staff interviews, hiring and training. Looking for at least two dedicated employee hires for six months.\u201d My question is regarding the degree of detail, we don't know exactly how long each proposed activity would last (or how long it should last, in planning). Not much detail about the actions is provided either. For example in phase 3, between weeks 16 and 28, we know there would be mentoring and training. How would feedback be collected? How would CVs be provided? In general, how would artists be instructed, in addition to synchronous face-to-face moments, to develop these new technologies? It's a little open about how, on a day-to-day basis, everything would be done. That said, I believe, I believe that a further degree of detail and depth would benefit our understanding of the whole. When we talk about costs, unfortunately this part leaves something to be desired, in my view, because the total amount is divided into very high installments, which are not well explained and detailed: \u201cMarketing costs of US$ 10,000 - promotional videos, short documentary of 5 minutes, Twitter, discord, traditional print, posters at artist hangouts + $30,000 Event Costs - Venues and accommodation, catering, setup, decor, projectors, etc. + $10,000 Personnel Costs - Hiring 2 full-time staff per 6 months\". For example, we know that it would be 30 thousand dollars to cover the costs of the events themselves, locations and accommodation, decoration, projectors and so on. But how many events would there be, how much money would go towards each of them, and how much money would go towards each of these little parts (decor and etc)? Likewise with marketing and staff expenses: the $10,000 figure is not well argued. Overall, I found the proposal to be expensive, especially in relation to the costs of the events; it would be important for all of this to be better explained, so that we could have a better understanding of the real need for such investments. And finally, analyzing the team, this part also leaves a little to be desired. We know the names, linkedin profiles and brief explanations about each team member. But we don't have a very detailed curriculum of each, examples of projects they developed before this one, how close they are to Cardano (eg Aaron Arfman is said to be an ecosystem guru - what do you mean? What has he been doing? until then within our community? It would be necessary for this to be clarified through examples, for example any proposal that he has already involved in any of the various ecosystem groups he has participated in - such as Catalyst School, Wada, Cardano4Climate among others). For these reasons, I believe that all parts of the feasibility could be better worked out; although we have basic information about each of them, it would be very positive if we had more details and more arguments, so that we could have more confidence about what would be done, by whom and for how much investment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "When we talk about progress, the suggested auditability is very good. The bidder informs us of various measures that would be used as KPIs to track partial results, such as \u201cNumber of attendees at the event / Number of assessments completed at the event / Skill assessments completed at the follow-up assessment (email delivery)\u201d . Generally, when proposals are aimed at holding events, the proposers turn all their attention to the day of the event, the event itself, without thinking exactly about how the effects of that event can be monitored, that is, how the fruits that arise from it. would they be noticed and proven? This does not happen here since the proponent states that a follow-up assessment, sent by email, would be carried out after the completion of the course. I believe that the questions would serve to understand how the artists would be putting the acquired knowledge into practice, and also, according to the proponent, additional support would be provided. So the only thing that was pending for this part of the proposal to be perfect, in my view, would be some way of auditing the development of the phases, the pre-production that would come before the events. How could we keep up with the tasks that would be necessary, like hiring those who would pass on knowledge, defining the location, calling the audience, that sort of thing? In my view it is both necessary that we know what happens before the events, during and after (these last two parts are quoted). Speaking of final results, success is seen with the maximum capacity of events, the delivery of skill training through mediation tools, transmission of the desired skills and so on. In other words, training the local public. This would definitely drive greater adoption of our blockchain, more artists minting active tokens on Cardano. This is all made clear in the excerpt: \u201cmaximum event participation and social exposure for three major events and four smaller workshops with measurable skills training deliverables \u2013 we will have an assessment to measure your current knowledge and skills around NFTs, Decentralization, Blockchains Multiples, Cardano\u201d, etc. It would be interesting if all the information were gathered in a complete survey, in which we knew what the artists would be producing after a certain time of the events, and also if the cross-transactions between Cardano and other blockchains increased. Such information must reach the community, either through channels such as discord or telegram, or a website created for this, or even participation in Townhall, for example. In general, auditability is good, but not perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 9, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1363, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by committing to host a series of events that engage artists from South Africa to learn about NFTs and blockchain. The proposers state that Africa is largely Ethereum-enthusiastic, so these Cardano-led meetings may help increase the movement of these artists between chains. \n\nOverall, this seems like a good approach to help newcomers to the space, or newcomers to Cardano to engage in an easy, conversational, and in-person manner so they can ask questions and potentially become engaged in the blockchain space. The in-person approach is also smart since it can be very hard to dispel misinformation online, but much easier to have a conversation and clear up any confusion. \n\nWhere I think the team could have done a bit better in the impact section is focused more on the cross chain aspect. While I don't disagree that it could happen, I think the proposers could have highlighted how cross chain collaboration would play a central role in these events. As written the cross chain collaboration feels a bit like an afterthought rather than the focus of the proposal.

Each of the stages, activities, and deliverables are fairly clear and likely more than achievable. I do think that the team should have included the number of events and workshops in the plan section, not just in feasibility, but at least it's there. \n\nThe team seems very well equipped to deliver on what is presented and appears well connected in the blockchain space to be successful. Their position in the locale of focus also will likely increase their ability to reach out to existing networks and communities that might be interested. \n\nPersonally, I maybe would have liked to see a better outline of the budget rather than just high level items, particularly for the $30k of hosting the events, some more granularity would go a long way. \n\nI am not commenting on the Monet Training Curriculum being developed as it doesn't appear part of this proposal. If it was then it could be better explained how it will be used in the events themselves. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nThe team does an excellent job at listing their KPIs which are measurable, with their main indicators focusing on the attendance of the event, online sharing of the event, and new adopters of Cardano. They commit to conducting follow up questionnaires to improve their delivery which will result in direct auditing by participants and community members. \n\nWhat is missing in this section here are success measures that the KPIs will be used to measure. I appreciate the goal is to \"fill our venues with maximum attendance\" and \"impart a sense of skills transfer\" but it is unclear how you would determine what constitutes \"maximum attendance\" or \"a sense of skills transfer\". These are much too abstract and do not align with the KPIs.

Basically, the team aims to focus on making sure to help attendees understand that \"the Cardano community promotes a collaborative ecosystem for a multi-chain future.\" Bravo, team. Well done in keeping with the brief and sharing in the true spirit of the challenge.\n\nBy offering such cross-chain/cross-community events, the proposers provide a valuable addition to the ideas in this challenge. There is no doubt that a successful outcome of this proposal would match the challenge and have a positive impact on all chains and communities involved.\n\nThe mitigation for the risk of coming across as Cardano-only is ensuring that the marketing team focuses first on providing that potential advertisements are given a \"cross-chain\" feel.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the proposer has followed the guidelines and only offers the relevant experience for each team member, voters can appreciate the time this saves them in reviewing such sections.\n\nThe detailed items list offers a clear picture of all of the items necessary to hold the event and almost offers a checklist that the proposer can look back at to track progress. As someone with significant event hosting experience, good work there. If rewriting, please break the $50000 budget into more than 3 categories. Currently, it is difficult for voters to know what $ per hour your team members are charging for their work, if it is representative of an average budget for such work, etc. This is a new ask for proposers in Fund 9, and voters will appreciate the attention paid to it if the team includes it if rewriting.\n\nInformation about a team's current monthly operating costs that are outside the budget ask is unnecessary for the budget area and can confuse readers (voters and assessors alike!).

As the events will not only be focused on Cardano, but also in other blockchains, as Ethereum, it can incetivize interoperability and collaboration cross-chain, therefore, addressing challenge goal (one example of addressed challenge kpi is \"Number of events / workshops / sessions arranged with other communities\").

The team proposed with the idea of \u200b\u200bleveraging their multitude of training resources to create a Cape Town curriculum and event led by Cardano for all artists on any blockchain. The proposed group describes clearly and in detail. Organize training events and design curricula that help promote artistic creation on Blockchain, and the good thing is that it can be freely made available to anyone as open source material. The events will be led by Cardano artists with a wide range of topics: what is NFT, minting, setting up wallets, and more. On the other hand, the curriculum and other related languages \u200b\u200balso apply to other Blockchain users, not just Cardano. Very interesting proposal, I think it will be a fascinating portal for artists.

A relatively reasonable proportion of the proposal, less than 10% of the total challenge budget. However, in my opinion the team could analyze a more detailed budget sheet for each work to be allocated in the project. For example; how many videos, documentaries... per month? Funds allocated? As for the cost of the event, it was $30,000. Account for 60% of the total proposed budget. The team can add more details to this section. We can better understand the cost per job. For example: Where will the location be, how long to hire with a specific cost, which specialist will take on the organizing work. The team can provide information, or a short presentation, about two full-time employees, with the experience and skills to match the job to be performed. (But I understand that it is not always possible to refer all members, in which case you should refer them when they are hired).

The members are all experts and consultants with many necessary skills to implement the project. And there are attached links, so we can learn more about each member.
