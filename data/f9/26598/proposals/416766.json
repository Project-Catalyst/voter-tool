Iagon is migrating a decentralized storage and computing protocol to Cardano from Ethereum, in order to take advantage of Cardano's superior scaling and security.  A key part of this protocol is the $IAG token, whose total $1b supply has already been issued as ERC-20 tokens.  These tokens when staked provide the mechanism by which decentralized node operators (the backbone of the storage and computing layer) receive bonus rewards, and by which investors receive dividends from the fee structure for the Iagon service.  Additionally, investors provide liquidity to the token through arbitrage.\n\nAs near as I could tell they have moved $500m of the ERC-20 tokens over on the bridge, which still leaves a lot more to go.  But the bridge has the potential to be used for any ERC-20 to CNT conversion, and here is where an interesting scaling note comes in:  Iagon is in partnership with the NuFi cross-chain wallet (from the creators of AdaLite) to integrate bridging right into the wallet.  Obviously for such a feature to be successful, optimizing speed and simplicity is a priority, and these smartcontracts are the first step.\n\nIt is also worth noting the team's alignment in vision with Cardano, especially scaling and interoperability (which are really the same thing.)  For that reason, and because this is an effort actively migrating across chains with a high-impact project, I believe that funding the creation and testing of these contracts merits a full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team behind this proposal is extensive, and there is loads of information on the core leaders (CEO, CTO, etc.), as well as good descriptions of the other members such as Andrew Ong, the lead on this project as well as the Head of Engineering for Iagon.  The team includes Haskell developers and UI developers and testers, and they are partnered with a known Plutus developer that has done all of their Plutus work to date, as well as collaborating with the Milkomeda team.  The Plutus developer rates are competitive, and the Solidity rates are comparable, and a little lower, which makes sense, though I don't know what Solidity developer rates are competitive.\n\nThe Iagon bridge itself has been built and is fully operational, and the development of the needed software is clearly mapped out.  Currently the process of using the bridge involves multiple wallet connections and transactions, with multiple fees accruing at each step.  They have clearly laid out the processes they wish to automate with the smartcontracts, which is essentially the back half of each side of the tx:  for the Solidity contract they are automating the milkomeda C1 to CNT, with fees paid in Ethereum, while the Plutus contract automates the C1 to ERC-20, with fees paid in ADA.  \n\nWhile I don't feel this warrants being downgraded, I would have liked to have seen two considerations added or discussed if they are present.  The first is the need to convert to MilkADA for paying the Milkomeda fees.  This would purely be an onboarding issue, since it is easy enough to do, once you know how.  I am wondering how the smartcontracts handle this specifically, and if they mitigate the need for this step as well, or if it is even possible.  Second is the idea of enhancing the overall speed of the Tx process.  Again, this isn't a criticism worthy of downgrade, as many things factor into Tx speed, but I am curious whether they believe these new contracts will speed up the protocol \"on-chain\" (specifically the ERC-20 to Nomad conversion/wrap, where the majority of the wait is built in for the purpose of \"fraud-protection\", waiting to see if any other validators in the system contribute proof of fraudulent activity) or if the only optimization is the \"off-chain\" aspect of a smoother process for the User.\n\nIt is worth noting that professional auditing of the contracts will be something the proposers should do, and they indicate that they would likely be looking for that service in a new round of funding from Catalyst.  Because of ERC-20 side of things, I cannot recommend this path enough, and I consider a solid plan for this to be a critical part of delivering ROI on this proposal.\n\nBecause the team has a clear idea of the architecture and what is needed to create these contracts, and based on their past work and current experience with delivering cross-chain deliverables, I believe they will be able to deliver a working solution on time and within budget.  5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The key here is that this is a software development project at root, even though there are elements such as the UI, NuFi collab, and audit that are lingering around the edges.  Ultimately what progress will be measured on is the development and testing of the smartcontracts and their delivery working as intended.\n\nTo this end the team is using Jira with agile framework, which they have deep experience in, and they included a helpful note that they will be using sprint burndown metrics to track and report progress and KPIs.  Their budget was divided up into a 3 month timeline with most of the funds on the backend once testing and UI came on board, but the funding distribution is well balanced and will fit the Coordinator format well.\n\nFinally, a note on Opensource:  while the project itself is not considered opensource, there are many aspects of the vision of the team and the execution of their protocols which indicate excellent alignment with this long term aspect of Cardano, and short term aspect of auditability.  The team, and especially its founders are very transparent and have shown a willingness and availability to answer any question and address any issues, going back to their early days when an initial round of funding got caught up in issues surrounding the service facilitating their fundraising (all investors were made whole).  Likewise, the backbone of the overall Iagon protocol makes the process of becoming a \"node\" open source and open standards.  Lastly, their documentation is extensive, clear and up to date.\n\nBecause of the team's transparency and availability, and based on the very clear roadmap and deliverables presented for this proposal, I believe that they meet and exceed Catalyst expectations for Auditability.  5 Stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 206, "q0": "Yes, it is exactly in line with the challenge proposed as it addresses the interoperability between Cardano and Ethereum. \nAdditionally, the team has the intention to partner with the Nufi wallet team, another great proposal, to work synergistically.

The team has already released a beta version of their solution, Iagon. All that needs to happen now is taking the bridge all the way to the stable release.\nFurthermore, the fact that they partnered with the Nufi team ( Vacuumlabs) gives them more credit, since Vacuumlabs has a stellar record of developing in this ecosystem, having taken part in Adalite, Yoroi, Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets integration, Wingriders DEX development.. \nThis kind of collaboration is very healthy to foster, and I honestly cannot think of a better way to spend the treasury other than in well established developer teams, and those rising stars who they accept to collaborate with. Makes us all better, and is a judicious expenditure of funds.\nI strongly encourage the approval of both proposals, since they are both very realistic and exactly what we need to happen to facilitate migration between Ethereum and Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the team is well versed in how to make the project auditable. \nThe bridge essentially consists of two smart contract, one in Ethereum and One in Cardano.

A bit more context on the whole process as well as an example of a user journey would have been great. An exact step by step flow of what the user is doing along with what's going on with the smart contracts/backend would have been very helpful to read. Additionally there is a bit of confusion around the \"CNT\" and \"milko tokens\". Is CNT referencing a Cardano Native Token? Is Milko token refrencing ADA on Milkomeda because Milkomeda doesn't have its own token? Providing a bit more context here would have been very helpful.\n\nThe risks provided seemed reasonable and like they were the most pressing. Unfortunately there wasn't any mitigation strategy mentioned. It would have been good to see how their team could utilize a PAB alternative and the use of budget for an audit to get around the risks mentioned.\n\nThe budget does a good job of providing exact information on what will be paid for and how much it costs.

Cardano has several of these bridges that are used at high frequency, however, there is currently many ways to improve the bridges that exist, which this proposal aims to do. As a user of these bridges it is true that they can be confusing and nerve racking, thereby deterring some from using them. \n\nI think the team has taken a good approach, rather than starting from scratch, let's take what is already working and optimize it. This will not only drive further impact of the bridges themselves but will also allow users to seamlessly manage their assets across different chains, which could also encourage individuals to purchase assets on Cardano through the bridge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nA major strong point of this proposal is that the team already has a working bridge (milkomeda) that will be used to automate the process. This means that the team already has a large portion of the work done and now will focus on optimization, rather than the initial build, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. \n\nAnother strong point included in the proposal is the weight of the team behind the project. In addition to those listed as leading the proposal, the iagon team is stacked with a variety of developers and engineers that hold the experience necessary to complete the development of the automation. \n\nWhy I am taking a mark off here is because of the lack of details in the actual plan. While I appreciate that developing the smart contract may be very clear to the team, the proposal should at least include some of the activities that need to be required in pursuit of development. As stated, the \"plan\" is more about the what and less about the how, which is what we look for in the \"plan\". \nBudget is reasonable and well explained for how the funds will be spent.

To show the community the progress the team will provide the percentage completed during each sprint. \n\nThe other major auditing features are the smart contracts themselves. One thing I would have liked to see here is how they plan to test their bridge and code. Will there be opportunities for the community to participate? You list third party auditing as a risk under the impact section yet I don't see how you will mitigate it? Do you plan to use an external auditor, such as VacuumLabs? This could be better explained. \n\nThe success measure is fine (ability to transfer back and forth in one step) but I would have liked a way to gauge the level of use you are seeking to deem it successful. If the goal is to improve the user experience specifically, I'd suggest adding in a way to measure the user's experience to see if you are in fact achieving your objectives.
