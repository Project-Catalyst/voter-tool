For starters, they are leveraging Milkomeda's EVM bridge to bring over a selection of smart contracts behind protocols such as Frax finance, Curve as well as interoperability with AlphaWallet on EVM.  Within the Cardano ecosystem they are partnered with Proofspace, ClarityDAO, MADAO, Snapbrillia, and on the edge of the ecosystem they are leaning into both Djed for part of the collateral protocol, but also prepping the platform to work with Coti's Adapay.  (And this doesn't even mention their collaboration with Chainlink and things like Truflation for oracle data on chain.)\n\nAll of this infrastructure adds up to a member managed DAO that sets and validates an inflation pegged stablecoin $ECC via a governance token $ECS which creates an investment opportunity (likely a place to \"park\" liquidity, though arbitrage will have its place in the protocol) that rewards all member participants with a nascent \"UBI\" payment or dividend, based only on membership secured by an identity wallet with DIDs.  Scaling the platform in the future is included here with two additional phases beyond the funding sought  here:  Expanding Protocol to add marketplaces, and Feature Rich to add functionality through NFTs and other emergent ecosystem needs.\n\nBecause this proposal aligns perfectly with the challenge's goals of adopting cross-chain processes and tools, as well as collaborating as community with cross chain protocols, and because the proposal indicates multiple areas of impact on Cardano, particularly its Atala identity roadmap and token infrastructure, I rate Impact a full 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The amount of detail included in this proposal is astounding.  From the start we see the proposer's background in the tech industry and the extent of teamwork that is going on to make this effort a success.  While the core team presented here is the founder, collaborations across the Cardano space are noted in Impact above, and digging a little deeper you see tools adopted from ADAO (multi-sig wallet), Chainlink analysis, and GoKey.\n\nThe timeline included on the Miro board is elegant and thorough.  The stages are clearly laid out between MVP (this request for funding) and then two later stages that appear to be contingent on market conditions, where an ICO is intended to be the source of funding beyond fund9.  I really appreciated that even though the project is enormously complex and overlapping, the timeline and deliverables were separated out by this MVP concept to clearly show that this funding is meant to be able to deliver the entirety of the core protocol, while a richer pallete of features and scaling is reserved for future funds.\n\nThe budget is clearly demarcated over the next 12 months and broken down by both an hourly wage in the timeline, and by deliverable.  The proposer has even included cost estimates for the phases beyond this funding phase, indicating a very solid grasp of the big picture for delivery.  \n\nBecause I find that the budget and roadmap that are presented are complete and thorough, and rational consideration has been given to what belongs in the funding proposal and what needs to be left for future funding (as well as the fact that the token sale proposed is a well known method of providing liquidity to projects), and given that the proposer has shown experience and the partnerships are extensive, I am rating Feasibility 5 stars for completeness.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Because the core buildout is a series of smartcontracts and and a DAO governance protocol to govern them, you would expect to see community structure in place, and that is what you will find at the everCrypt DAO discord server, where tons of documentation and suggestions for onchain oracles, EVM contracts and protocols are already populating the threads.  The founder has also been a regular contributor to Swarm sessions and breakout rooms as he has built connections in the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\n\nFor tracking work it needs to be remembered that as a community protocol, many of the jobs of the build will be part of the community.  The proposer indicates using dework to track task completion (dework is a kanban style management platform with wallet integration for distributed community work in DAOs), as well as Miro and Jira, and all platforms give transparency with the right settings.  Also, not mentioned in the auditability section, is the Snapbrillia partnership, which has a work management/identity component as well, so that should add another layer of tracking and transparency.\n\nFour core deliverables have been included for the first 6 months of the project, and four more are listed for the second phase of 6 months and all are concrete, tangible results that can be measured.  The proposer has included early evidence of work started, in particular the proofspace integration for onboarding users (and this makes sense since community is both a deliverable and the source of future production).\n\nBetween the list of deliverables and the itemized list in the timeline/budget, I believe that this proposal will have a high level of transparency to the community, and plenty of auditable beats that keep time with the monthly reporting, so a full 5 stars for Auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Thank you for the detailed feedback, please join our discord and help me make this a reality for us all.\n--Proposer"}, {"id": 630, "q0": "The main goal of this proposal is to create a so called pseudo-stable token ($ECC) which would basically be a stable coin that would be corrected over time with a forecast of the inflation, based on multiple predictions made by external sources and using oracle solutions like Wolfram and Chainlink. Part of the development of this solution will be done using Frax Finance as a basis, which is a protocal built on Ethereum. The project also wants to include the concept of Universal Basic Income for those who need it, and integrate this with SSI via Atala PRISM, but it\u2019s not clear how the beneficiaries would be selected, for how long, and all the other details. Also, it mentiones that there\u2019s a treasury that will grow over time based on the delegation to multiple DeFi protocals using multisig wallets, and there\u2019s going to be a mechanism for members of the DAO to suggest strategies and to receive bonus if their strategies result in profit for the DAO itself. They also want to include the option of payment in the everCrypt dApp by partnering up with Coti. Overall, this seems to be a very ambitious project, with lots of external sources and potential partnerships, and also using a pseudo-stable, algorithmic (since its based on Frax Finance) stable coin. To create this kind of project and stable coin, usually much more money is necessary than what is being asked in this proposal (~$150k). In general, I believe that if the project is successfull, it would have a greaet impact on the Cardano ecosystem, but the difficulty to implement such a project is considerable. Regarding challenge aligmnent, the project does not directly brings projects from Ethereum to Cardano. It\u2019s actually forking an Ethereum project, doing the necessary modifications and creating a new one in Cardano, which it not exactly what is proposed in the Challenge. The proposer argues that DeFi users would be brought to Cardano if the project is successful, what is related to the Challenge. Therefore, this proposal partially covers the challenge KPIs. And based on the future goals presented here, this could be highly scalable and have a huge impact in the future. The identified proposal challenges are fair, but I believe that others will also exist that were not mapped, regarding the execution itself, as mentioned previously. Overall, due to the proposal\u2019s complexity, partially alignment with the Challenge, the amount of work that would have to be done for it to be successful, I am not comfortable with giving a very high impact score to it, so I\u2019m rating it with 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer of this project is Abhiroop Sharma, he shared his LinkedIn and his information is verifiable. Although, he\u2019s going to be the manager of this project, and not the executer, and there is no one else besides him mentioned in the proposal, which makes us believe there the team to execute it is not yet assembled, or at least contacted. It would be better to know who, or which 3rd party, is going to execute each part of the proposal. Also, since this information is missing, even though the hours of each task are included, the number of participants in the proposal itself seems to be not known. The budget is broken down per activity, but there seems to be only estimates without much explanation, for example, in phase 2: Community: 150h/$15k, but it does not explain where the 150h come from, what\u2019s the rationale behind it. It is mentioned in the proposal that only the first 2 phases are included in the proposal, which seems more resonable regarding the budget requested, and they mention that there\u2019ll be an ICO after phase 2. This budget seem to be ok for delivering the MVP, even though details are missing about its cost. Due to the complexity of the proposal, I\u2019d like to see some more details about the execution, instead of just milestons for phases 1 and 2, because in order to know if the proposer is able to execute everything, we also need to know if he\u2019s capable of even planning in details. The timeline for the execution seems to be ok, but since the team is not ready to start execution as soon as possible, we cannot be certain the it will be followed. The proposer describes the technology on which its development will be based and how it will do it, which is a good sign. Overall, I\u2019d say that I neither agree nor disagree that this proposal is feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer adds 4 milestones for each of the phases, and proposes to use them to keep track of the progress of the proposal. This is not ideal, since only after 6 months of funding, the community would be updated regarding the progress of the proposal, and by the time, $75k would already have been payed by the treasury to the proposer. The same happens to the second phase, 6 more months until new milestones could be verified. Ideally, the proposer should include monthly verifiable milestones or KPIs, since the reports to the Catalyst community are based on this pace. The success definition of the project is good, even though it doesn\u2019t cover everything that\u2019s being proposed to be developed, and some of the items included here are not going to be verifiable until after the proposal is closed-out, for e.g., \u201c1. Achieve a TVL of $50 Million USD by end of 2nd year of mainnet launch\u201d.
