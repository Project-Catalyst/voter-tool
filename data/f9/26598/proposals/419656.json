This project can be used globally and there is high chance it will scale as more people using Cardano and Ergo blockchains. In fact, the team have already built a working platform on the Cardano blockchain. The team have stated the risk of running out of funds to complete the project.

The proposal stated they are a team of 8 and require $2,000/month over 10 months period. This requested budget is based on their project milestones in their timeline. There is not enough budget breakdown as it is based on like a salary based. The budget requested is reasonable if the team is working on this project full time. However, they are building on other projects which takes up their time and energy. This could impact the project delivery. Considering the team are working on other projects, the budget requested is considered high and not enough breakdown such as how many hours per week in a month to justify the $2,000/month which affects the scoring for this section.

I believe that cross-chain development can be a crucial step to furthering the growth of Cardano and it's ecosystem. Tosidrop and AnetaBTC have been doing very well in promoting this development across chains. Specifically with Cardano and Ergo. One of the ways they have done this is through airdrops to loyal Cardano and Ergo community members. This naturally leads to more creation of wallets on both blockchains, which leads to growth. In this proposal, the challenge is that there needs to be a greater need for cross-chain development and how the team strives to promote this.

There is a detailed roadmap that describes what the team has accomplished so far, and what they plan to accomplish in the next year. Having this roadmap with general timeframes is really important because it gives the community something to look forward to, and suggests that the community will help them to stay accountable to their roadmap.

It also describes how their project and the community will be benefited if the project is funded by promoting cross-chain development. This helps the project to remain focused on bringing decentralization to Cardano and Ergo and creating a platform where new users can benefit from their project and the loyal community that follows them.
