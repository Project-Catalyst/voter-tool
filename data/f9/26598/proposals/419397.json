The proposal is likely to have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, making Cardano the first blockchain to operate a KERI Witness network. While bringing new exciting technologies to Cardano should be welcomed, it is, however, difficult to know the size of the target audience and how many users will end up using the solution. Finally, note that the bridge is a proof of concept, not production. Additional funding will be required.\n\nI think this proposal addresses the challenge effectively. 4/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers provided a short description of who will work on the project, Rodolfo Miranda and Lance Byrd, including their roles, experiences, and past work. They have Cardano/Catalyst/Atala Prism qualifications and have successfully completed past Catalyst proposals in FUND 6 to 8. There is therefore complete confidence that the team can bring this proposal to term. They will be supported by the creator of KERI, Sam Smith, Ph.D. \n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items (Research Technology, Deploy KERI agent, Develop PoC, documentation). Additional funding is required to bring the proposal to production. The budget (16K$) and the timetable (3 months) seem to be reasonable to achieve the set goals. The proposer provided a detailed roadmap for this proposal as well as a list of actionable tasks to complete. Given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a clear and detailed roadmap and a time horizon for achievement (3 months to understand the tech and build a POC). The KPIs that define the success of the proposal are presented and make sense but it would have been nice to see the following KPIs: number of KERI projects reached out to and attracted to Cardano.

The ability to have identities not tied to Cardano speaks directly to the challenge brief. The proposal solution is detailed, easy to follow, and reason. The 1,2,3 plan to understand, familiarized, and proof of concept is a sign of a mature team familiar with working with pioneering technology. \n\nThe proposal so draws a clear-ish line between its solution and the challenge ask.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a clear and detailed milestone and timeline spanning surprisingly 3 short months provided.

This is the truest sense of interoperability: when the user can seamlessly move between chains unbeknownst to them. Integrating the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) into the RootsWallet will allow users to remove the need for useless middlemen and replace it with the blockchain. As witnesses are required for many different types of transactions, having a constant and stable source to use at all times is likely a huge relief. \n\nThis ease of interoperability also will provide an onboarding ramp to users who may be using KERI but not on Cardano. By marrying these two technologies, there may be an abundance of use cases that have not yet been explored, such as in the DeFi space. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team at RootsWallet continue to deliver, and given their experience and the plan presented here, it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe RootsWallet team have a vision and do an excellent job at laying out. Since their first successful proposal in Fund 6, the team has continued to deliver on each of their proposals. They are truly standing out as the go-to identity wallet on Cardano. The team has a dynamite roster of individuals with the expertise to follow through on their promises. \n\nThe team also does an excellent job at laying out the exact steps they need to complete the project and request a modest budget for completion. Should the team be able to deliver what is laid out at the budget requested, it may just be the catalyst to broader blockchain interoperability through identity. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The RootsWallet is an open sourced project and the team provides constant commits and updates via github. The integration of the KERI feature will also be conducted in this fashion. \n\nThis open-by-default approach is very welcome and can give voters confidence that the team is open to constructive criticism. The team also has a good track record of reporting on their progress and is likely to continue doing so. \n\nSome of the success goals are likely too lofty and not achievable through this project (i.e. make Cardano the principal registry and resolver of KERI identifiers) but I respect their ambition.

If another blockchain is first, they will play the role Cardano could...\" This is the rationale of 4 stars.\n\nThe project positively impacts the Cardano ecosystem and certainly opens doors and creates pathways toward various types of cross-chain collaborations in the future. Their close work with the creator of KERI assures an almost definite finish for the team, and no significant risk of not finishing seems relevant.\n\nThe portability of trusted data that this challenge focuses on would, if the team is successful, allow for many potential cross-chain collaborations and is thus, \"in the spirit\" of the KPIs of the Cross-Chain Collaboration Challenge.\n\nThere is a plan to scale and build consecutive versions in the future.

The necessary experience is evident in the knowledge/history provided about the two on the team, Rodolfo and Lance. They have been working on learning more about KERI for quite some time, and with the aid of KERI's creator in their working meetings, it seems they have a solid plan.\n\nThe budget is quite fair, given the unique skills and abilities necessary for implementing and building this proof of concept. Developers in far more common fields are asking twice or more per hour. There is a commitment to be good stewards of Catalyst resources. This only adds to voter and community confidence.\n\nThe proposer has not mentioned what they will do if additional funding is needed. Perhaps a 10% contingency could be added if rewriting in the future, or the team could mention any reserves they currently have for such situations.\n\nThe plan is given a high-level overview and broken down slightly. It is clear that after doing the actionable tasks of initial research, the next step is to deploy a KERI agent and \"play\" with it to see what it does, how it works, and essentially learn. Voters can see from the plan an obvious indication of the clarity and thoroughness of the team.\n\nVoters benefit from the resources necessary, both financially and otherwise, fully explained. The required technical aspects are available through the 140-page whitepaper for KERI and the weekly working group mentioned.\n\nAs far as risks are concerned, the depth of the 140 whitepaper is mitigated by the weekly meetings mentioned in the previous paragraph.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The \"high-level scope\" offered in the detailed plan section (in Feasibility) serves as the team's only roadmap. Given the nature of the work and the unknowns on this end, it makes sense that they have significant tasks to accomplish and will find the deeper details as they move forward with the work. The milestones and time horizon are achievable as described in Feasibility.\n\nThe addition of a roadmap to Auditability would help with further transparency. It may feel Redundant, but the added clarity for the sake of voters is always a priority.

Can Cardano be the first KERI Witness network on a major blockchain? Key Event Receipt Infrastructure ( KERI ) is the first truly decentralized identity system (https://keri.one/). Based on a log of self-confirmed cryptographic key events, it creates a decentralized secure root of trust that does not need a ledger or moreover a portable ledger which means its identifiers are not locked with any given blockchain and are switchable as needed. In other words, the KERI identifier is indeed portable. It is therefore considered a breakthrough technology being applied in major projects such as the Global Legal Identity Organization (GLEIF), which works with partners to grant millions of unique identities to legal entities participants in financial transactions around the world. This project is about implementing a bridge between KERI and Cardano event logs to act as a Witness in each transaction. Activities require two main activities:\n-Understand technology (with paper)\n-Familiar with available implementations\n-Develop a proof-of-concept bridge component into the Cardano blockchain.

In my view, the budget is well calculated (calculated according to the roadmap), breaks down, and explains the activities performed and the number of hours to do them, and the hourly rate (compared to other projects, the salary seems to be a bit higher, but I can't judge that as a moderate or exorbitant number, because it depends on their area of \u200b\u200bwork), overall the team helped us understand what each part of the proposal entails and the costs involved.\nAnd finally, regarding the project team, in my opinion, this team is highly qualified and capable of successfully implementing the project. Behind the project is the RootsID team (this is a group with a lot of contributions to the Cardano ecosystem https://www.rootsid.com/team) and 2 members Rodolfo Miranda, and Lance Byrd we have a lot of information about surnames like Their names, we also have their background, with their expertise explained, what projects they have developed so far, how they relate to Cardano, their affiliate profile.
