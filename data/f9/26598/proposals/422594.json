By developing the JVM side chain, these developers would not need to go through the painstaking work of learning Plutus but instead can continue working and delivering in their language of choice, including: Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, etc., as well as JavaScript, Python, Ruby. \n\nI appreciate that the proposer also listed the exact components of the challenge brief which they align with. By laying it out so clearly it is easy for voters and assessors to see that it is in the right challenge. If successful it certainly would result in more cross chain collaboration by reducing the learning curve to participate in Cardano. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nWhat I like about this proposal is that it's straight forward and simple to follow but has clear deliverables and timelines. The proposer essentially wants to build a proof of concept sidechain using JVM. They do a good job at keeping the scope narrow enough to be achievable. While some of the measures may be a little idealistic \"Potentially thousands of sidechains created with the SDK, inevitably leading to activity growth\", the exact project itself is not expected to achieve this. Rather, getting a working side chain able to interact with the main chain is the goal. To this end, the timelines and deliverables listed appear very feasible given the proposer's experience. \n\nAnother good point about this proposal is that there are examples of already working side chains that the proposer could look to for guidance/advice. I would have liked to know if the proposer has already reached out to these groups and whether they seemed keen to support this project. If they see it as a threat/competition to their already ongoing work, they may not be willing to help, and in so doing, may impact the feasibility. \n\nWhat I do think could be better described is the budget. How did you get to the hourly rate of $256. First off, it's a bit random of an amount and there is no indication that this is market rate or whether it's based on other projects the proposer has worked on. I think for that request there should be at least some explanation as to what comparators you are using. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAny project that is open-source by default (like this one) should give additional confidence to voters that there will be opportunities for auditing. By using github, community members can interact with the proposer and their code, which can reduce the amount of time bugs or glitches go unnoticed, and thereby improve the overall performance of the side chain. \n\nAs mentioned above, the fact that this plan is quite straightforward, the proposer has identified several achievable success measures, such as: being able to download the sidechain with CLI, sending ADA from the main chain to the side chain, and using JS to write a smart contract for the side chain. These clear goals make it easy for the community to know whether it achieved what it set out to. \n\nI look forward to the outcome of this project.

This proposal brings a solution to this issue on the side of sidechains. The proposal is setting out to develop a JVM-based Cardano Sidechain SDK (Oneiron: Cardano Sidechain SDK). There are a lot of people who are well versed in JVM-based or JavaScript based coding in the world. This would enable an untold number of developers to be able to work and develop on the Cardano side chain.\n\nThis proposal is found in the Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge\nThis proposal lines up beautifully with the metrics of this challenge.\n- Oneiron opens up the Cardano ecosystem to hordes of enterprise/web developers.\n- Oneiron is open source\n- Easy creation of Cardano sidechains with the Oneiron SDK and the JVM-based language runtime will bridge the skill gap for existing enterprise/web developers.\n- Potentially thousands of sidechains created with the SDK, inevitably leading to activity growth.\n- Building cross-chain bridges will be far easier with the sidechain SDK.\nThe impact that this proposal brings to Cardano ecosystem is immense and only time can accurately describe just how potent the impact will be as already existing developers would now be able to develop on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThis proposal effectively addresses the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline/plan set forth in this proposal is achievable, well laid out step by step to accomplish their goals as well as resources the proposer will be using. The team has taken the time to consider risks that they may have, and how to go about mitigating those risks. \n\nAs far as the team itself we are given one individual Ivan Mikushin who is the proposer of this proposal. However, the proposer has listed his skill and experience, and has also provided a link to linked in where we can see his developer endorsements, amazing skills, extraordinary experience and the like. Based on this information, I would say he is well qualified to do the tasks outlined in the timeline/plan. \n\nLooking at the budget side of this proposal the proposer has laid it out based on an average hourly wage, multiplied by the number of weeks needed to complete the work of this proposal, and has concluded that 65536 will be sufficient, and based on everything in the timeline plus a little contingency to be sure, I agree that this is sufficient.\n\nThe proposer has also let us know that he will return for further funding, and that this funding is to get the project up and running. He has listed the things he will be needing future funding for. The proposer has clearly thought this through completely. \n\nGiven experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has let us know what metrics he will use to measure progress and success of this project.

It is important for the community to be able to view these releases to keep up with the success and progress of the project once funded.) These metrics are sufficient in monitoring/auditing the progress of this project, though it would have been nice to see a timeline or time horizons and what is expected in those timeframes.

Serving this purpose, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge. Thanks to its well-written and clearly-presented description, the project is quite easy to understand. The proposer provides 5 key metrics to measure the impact of the projects, which, I think, are well chosen and aligned with those required by the challenge for evaluating its success. Once completed, the project potentially helps thousands of side chains created with the SDK, inevitably leading to activity growth of the Cardano system. As for the possible risk that the team might face, the proposal not only points it out but also offers some practical steps to mitigate it. My rating is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As for the timeline of the project, the proposal presents a time-framed timeline that spans over up to 7 months at most with the desired outcome after each milestone.

The second one could have been a little more specific. The proposer expects to see \u201csome amount of ADA\u201d to be transferred from the main Cardano blockchain into the sidechain and back. This criterion will become more specific if the proposer presents a detailed number of ADB to be transferred. Overall, this part is pretty well written, well organized and well understood.

I think this initiative will open doors, because Cardano is really a third generation blockchain and the languages \u200b\u200bwe work with \u2013 mainly Plutus \u2013 are very new, so much so that the official program for learning Plutus is called plutus PIONEERS. Once there is some bridge between the languages \u200b\u200bmost known by professionals and Cardano, most likely the adoption of our network will increase, which will generate new cross-network projects, for example, which are the main objective of this challenge. For these reasons, I believe that the proposal is very accurate, and despite being technical, it is accessible to read, at least for PAs/vPAs/voters who have been part of our community for some time.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is very simple and clear, but it does not lack in terms of placing us in relation to what would happen in the project development process.

Support for other package managers is on the backlog\u201d, a short summary of what would happen each week is given; splitting the timeline into weeks is a great way for us to understand exactly what would be done and when. The hourly rate charged is very expensive: \u201cWith the hourly rate of $256, the total project cost is $256/h \u00d7 8 h/w \u00d7 32 w = $65,536\u201d. From my knowledge as a PA since f5, the average asking amount for developer work is $100, less than half that amount. It is up to the voters to decide whether this value is fair, but in my view it is well above average. A lot of confidence is conveyed about Ivan, who would run the project.
