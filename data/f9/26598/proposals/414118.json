A non-transferable NFT that represents a DID in the Roots Wallet. That being said I do not understand the end user experience. How will users go about creating a DID, recieving it, and then utilizing it in things like governance. The Impact section is a bit sparse in this regard and uses links to various relevant links, but doesn't jump far into how these links are relevant. This tends to span through the proposal with refrences towards different tools like Freeos, Rootswallet, and WAL-CLI without explaining what these tools are. \n\n\nThe metrics section of this proposal gives a good sense of how progress will be tracked but doesn't provide any KPIs. This isn't a huge deal due to the detailed milestones but does come into consideration once the proposal is implemented. What happens the project once developed? How is usage ensured?
