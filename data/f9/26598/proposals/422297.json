Including more information on risks involving event managment would have been good to see. \n\nThe detailed budget section is well written and provides a nice overview of how money will be spent.

The likelihood for this to happen, however, is at least on a shorter time horizon miniscule and not a given.\nThe implied goal that the proposer is committing to is to onboard 100 new users over the period of 10 months, which puts the cost of the acquisition of a new Cardano/Blockchain user at $30.\nThus, the impact for this challenge setting is in the middle.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Adam is presumably already doing meetups ( see his funded proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404815 ), and the budget is realistic.

The commitment to at least announce to the community ahead of time when and where the event would be held would go a long way.

Organizing these happy hours, and putting crypto people together can eventually foster the collaborations over the chains, possibly to cause some migration and generally propagate the blockchain in general.  The proposer believes that since the University is having more than 50 000 students, it is a good place to organize such meetings, because the outreach will be high. Although, a supporting information or evidence \u2013 why do proposer thinks that these meetings can benefit to cross chain collaboration is missing, thus, I am not really sure that this goal can be achieved.

In this case, given the budget is very small, I do not have the need to require more details, and  for 10 months plan it appears reasonable. The proposer aims to organize these meetings himself, and for that there is no special skills or experience required, nevertheless, he provided linked in profile and stated, that he already organized such meetups. From this perspective, I believe this proposal is fully feasible.

Since there is a task to make it better, maybe a report containing \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d can be disclosed. Another interesting metric (proof in this case) that could be provided would be some pictures or even live streams if there would be some public channel such as Instagram or telegram for crypto-enthusiasts \u2013 e.g. greetings from our monthly meet-up. Regarding the success, I am not really sure if we can measure the \u201ccomfort\u201d of \u201cmore\u201d people, so, I would rephrase it - if cross-chain collaboration is the goal, then the result should be some cross-chain partnerships, or projects, as the outcome of these meetups.

I like this idea as the in-person education about Cardano can be very impactful where questions are answered in real time and individuals can be directed to the resources they need. \n\nThe reason why I am giving this 4/5 is due to the relatively limited reach this proposal is likely to have. While it is great for the individuals near the Urbana-Champaign campus, it is unlikely to provide a substantive impact back to the community.

The team also lays out a clear vision here, it's just to raise awareness and education of blockchain in their specific area. \n\nGiven that the proposer is from that campus themself, they appear well positioned to deliver these events. Moreover, since the events will be held through the proposer's newly developed \"The Immutable Research Institute\" they will likely be able to use their existing channels to promote the events and drive attendance. \n\nFinally, for such a small budget there is little to no risk for the community in funding this proposal with the potential for local impact.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs noted above, given that this project is very straightforward and has a very small budget, it is very simple for the community to audit the proposal. \n\nOne thing I would have liked to see here though is a better linkage between what you are measuring and what you hope to achieve. For example, if success looks like \"a vibrant monthly Happy Hour Meetup for students and professionals interested in Cardano and blockchain technologies\" and \"At the end of the academic year more people will be comfortable working with Cardano as a platform\", there has to be a way to measure these. How will you determine if it was \"vibrant\"? How many guests would need to attend?\n\nIf at the end of the year you want more people working with Cardano as a platform, do you intend to follow up with the people who attend?

The significant aspect of this plan is that the concept could be replicated in many locations to achieve the same goal. Great work, proposers.\n\nThe only risk mentioned involves participation.
