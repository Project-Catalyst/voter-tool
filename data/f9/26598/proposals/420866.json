While I understand that seniors are a major population with liquidity there is little indication of the desire of this group to enter the crypto space, or what impact their entry would have on cross collaboration? \n\nAs written, the proposers highlight there is a massive silver tsunami headed towards defi over the next decade, but there is no indication of the scale of this \"tsunami\" or where the information is coming from. It would be good to give readers a sense of the problem you are seeking to address. \n\nAlso, what is it about seniors that makes them so appealing as a target audience? Liquidity? Free time? Also, how does reaching out to other blockchains help in reaching seniors? There are some leaps here that should be better explained. \n\nIn the challenges, I'd like to have had the proposers provide an explanation as to how they will get other chains on board. While they say that a united industry could mitigate rejection by regulators, it is unclear how this \"unified\" community develops, or what incentives are present to drive this unification?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "No, given the experience and plan presented it is unlikely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThis proposal is too broad and unfocused. While the idea is commendable, it is unlikely feasible. There appear to be two different objectives of this proposal that do not appear clearly related to each other. Objective one appears to be use Catalyst funds to jump start a Self Regulatory Organization for Defi that brings different blockchains together. The second objective seems to be related to protecting seniors from getting swindled by crypto scams. \n\nRegarding the SRO development, there may be an opportunity to drive such an initiative but there are a significant amount of assumptions being made within the proposal that could limit it's feasibility. First off, as a starting point this proposal assumes that such a regulatory oversight is appropriate and/or desired, not just by the Cardano Community but other blockchains as well. There is no real discussion of how this project would fit in with the existing regulatory discussions at the national and trans-national levels. \n\nSecondly, the current plan is largely exploratory about the suitability of and potential forms for SROs. The proposal itself acknowledges that this work needs to be conducted. This I agree, but where I struggle is the reason that the proposers have planned out a year of activities without even having the original foundation together. For example, what value would the community get from providing $189k for you to go to trade shows if you don't have anything agreed to yet? If you find out early on that it won't work (for any reason) how would the community get its funds back? What would the team be on the hook for? Also, if this collaboration is by and for the entire space, why is Cardano (specifically Catalyst) footing the bill for everything? \n\nThe only other reason I'll mention here for the low score is the lack of detail on the team. It's fine to say that X has the necessary experience but we are left to take that on their word. \n\nI would suggest that if you come back in a future funding round, the team should break the proposal into smaller parts to make it more feasible. For example, this proposal would be significantly stronger if they had chosen to focus on part 1 and maybe part 2 of the broader project. However, as written it's just too big of a risk, with too many variables, and too little oversight for the community. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "No, the information provided is not sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. What is unclear is exactly what will be measured here. As written, the proposal is about setting up the SRO, including research and onboarding of additional partners, however there is no corresponding measure as to what shape/form/format the SRO would take. However, the linkage to seniors and the benefits for this cohort leave too much room for interpretation, when it should be explicit. This last caveat is a bit concerning since they are a key focus of the larger proposal. \n\nGiven that there would be a necessary amount of collaboration with other blockchains, I would have suspected that success would include onboarding (x amount) of different chains. What steps will you take to onboard these groups? What happens when you have differences of opinions? What happens when a group opts-out? How do these questions impact the actually adoption/success of the solution?  How will you \"know\" that you have reached the necessary amount of participants to make it legitimate? \n\nThe measurements that are provided (agile system) will then be shared through slack and miro board but there is not much explanation as to how these will get out to the community. The way that the plan is laid out, the marketing and PR is for the final SRO product, not the weekly updates. Would they be dual purpose? \n\nFinally, I would encourage the team to include more tangible success measures that are realistic. For example, to say that success is \"no scams involving seniors\" I am assuming you just mean crypto scams, but all crypto? Would you include groups that are not privy to the SRO method? What happens when a scam undoubtedly targets these groups even after the project is complete? Would those reflect a failure of this project? \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2233", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 362, "q0": "The proposal does a good job of addressing the challenge.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The teams 150+ years of experience in the space is good for showing they know what they are doing. \n\nThe risks section does a nice job of addressing the risks at hand and their associated difficulties. It follows them up with a decent mitigation plan that can assist in their defusion. One big risk presented is a lack of adoption of the work done by the SRO. This seems like a major risk that is impossible to avoid. Giving numbers on past SRO success would have built more confidence in this section of the proposal to demonstrate that this major risk can be overcome. \n\nOverall the proposal seems exciting and is tackling and important issue but the reader just doesn't have a solid enough understanding of the project, what it will accomplish, and how it will accomplish it to feel confident in the proposal. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed solution does a great job of demonstrating the passion of the proposer and the issue they are trying to solve. Unfortunately this portion of the proposal falls a little short on describing the solution. The reader can infer that the solution is to educate projects on how to exercise risk managment around employing seniors but it isn't entirely clear. A more in-depth description of what building this framework and interacting with it will look like would be great for the reader to further understand the proposal. \n\nThe detailed plan section does a great job of showing when things will be done, how long they will take, who will be doing them, and how much they will cost. This is helpful in illustrating more information on the proposal. One issue in the budget is the amount of money designated for trade shows. Almost half of the budget is directed to this item and yet there isn't much information on how trade shows will come into the picture beyond communicating with projects/people. If $109,878 is going to trade show involvment for the SRO it would have been great to get a very detailed plan as to how the trade shows will be worth their monetary cost.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2070", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 929, "q0": "This proposal aims to set up an organization to train and certify its member organizations who would then be viewed as more trustworthy players that senior citizens can rely on. \n\nThe witty proposal title stands for Certification of Senior Education & Risk Management in Decentralized Finance. Thus, the abbreviation should be CoSERMiDeFi which doesn\u2019t sound so witty anymore.\n\nSame way as the title is slightly forced, having this in a Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge sounds a bit far-fetched. Algorand and Helium are mentioned but mere name-dropping is not enough. There is nothing in the plan that specifically talks about engaging these particular blockchains or DEXs built on them. \n\nFinally, DeFi user experience is still so cumbersome that no senior citizen accidentally starts losing their life savings in crypto.

Just to get one started could mean massive legal fees, years of lobbying and rubbing shoulders with political decision makers. Not to mention the aspirations of doing this on a global scale. It takes more than presence in five trade shows and definitely more than 200K to get started.\n\nIn all fairness, this is also recognized by the team itself: \u201cLack of Capital to achieve the goal is the biggest risk. To be effective globally, CSERDEFI will require buy in from many of the Industry giants and will require a large budget.\u201d Therefore focusing on US collaboration with existing SROs like FINRA would be a more realistic plan.\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t get funded and you still wish to try in the next fund, I suggest you try to get phases 1 and 2 funded first because asking for a massive marketing budget for an organization and service that doesn\u2019t exist yet is nothing short of daydreaming.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Considering the amount asked, the auditability section is incomplete.
