Haskell is not a new language and after so many years one would expect that this information should be available. If there is a niche that this team is looking to fill, it could be better explained. \n\nOne may infer that the proposers suggest their course would encourage people from other blockchains to learn Haskell although this is not explicit and there is no indication that it would in fact result in cross-chain collaboration. Also, the focus of this proposal is on Haskell and Haskell alone which makes it unfit for the cross-chain collaboration challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented I cannot say whether this proposal will be implemented successfully, for the following reasons. \n\nThe team does a good job of outlining their plan and how they intend to achieve it, including the training sessions and subjects to be covered. What is missing for me is the acknowledgement of work that has already been conducted in the Haskell training space. Sure, it could be feasible but it could also just be reproducing and repackaging existing materials. Perhaps if the team had taken a more targeted approach on a specific population or cohort of individuals but as written it is so broad. \n\nThe reason why I can't say whether it is feasible or not is that it is unclear whether the proposal would lead to any cross-chain collaboration. In this sense, the feasibility is not on the ability to create a course but on the ability to achieve the end goal of breaking down silos or reducing maximalism between the chains. Personally it does not appear that it would be feasible in this sense but given I am unsure I remain neutral. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress of the proposal, however the measures for success leave much to be desired. \n\nThe team uses clear KPIs to measure the success of their course, however, they provide no sort of measurement or validation of the materials they plan to create/adapt. Given that the majority of the work will focus on building the course and collating the course materials from a variety of sources, there should be a way to track and report on this. How will you confirm whether the information you come up with/find is accurate and the agreed upon information? \n\nThe success measures are unfortunately not strong enough to know whether this course is a success. As stated, given the amount of information likely already available (not just on google but via textbooks etc..) it would be helpful to have a baseline of comparison. Say if course x delivers y amount of new web3 developers, then your course will deliver z amount of developers. Moreover, when the proposers say that \" Work could be focused on Cardano or other ecosystems, could be part-time, full-time, in the form of hackathon/grant projects, and so on\" it essentially means that anyone who does anything after the course would make it a success. \n\nI would encourage the team to reconsider submitting to another challenge in an future funding round and providing more details in about the gap they are trying to fill in more specific terms rather than broad statements.

First, about the roadmap, the proposal says that it will divide its milestone into 2 parts, one part is learning and the second part is implementation. The learning part was very well presented. The learning plan is held for 5 weeks, in each week we know what content will be taught in a very methodical manner. However, during the 6-12 weeks we were not given information about this process, so we don't understand what will happen at this stage. Regarding the budget, the total required budget is $70,000 and is also divided into 2 phases\n1. Training program and demo day budget: expenses will be used for activities such as Marketing and Design, Content Management, Bonuses & Incentives... Each activity is included at 1 certain cost. However, I think these costs can be broken down further, which will help the community have an accurate view of whether the requested budget is reasonable or not. Example: Bonuses & Incentives - $10000. Who will the Bonus be for? How many prizes are there and how much is each prize level?...\n2. Educational module development budget: this budget is very well presented, we know exactly what activities the money will be used for, very reasonable.\nFinally, about the team, this is probably the best presentation in this criterion. The main implementation team consists of 3 members, we know their role in the project, their field of activity, their contributions in the field of Blockchain as well as each member's LinkedIn link. In addition, the project is supported by technical support from the Konma Labz team, a group that has contributed a lot to Catalyst.

It would be great if the proposal provides us with a means of being able to track their project progress.
