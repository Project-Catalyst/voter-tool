How can we form meaningful connections across blockchains and web3 communities to promote greater collaboration?", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.238095238095238, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 923, "q0": "Having followed Natalie\u2019s and Dzhuliana\u2019s journey for a few funds now, it\u2019s great to see how they overcame the initial disappointments and are now well on their way to becoming one of the core service providers in the Catalyst ecosystem. And catalyzing through mentorship doesn\u2019t need to stop at Cardano. Indeed, they are now expanding their service to other blockchains.\n\nThe proposal has a multiplying positive impact as it supports the 100 participating individuals, the multitude of projects they are part of and the larger Web3 ecosystem as a whole. This proposal is fully aligned with the Fund9 strategic goals as it promises to bring more people in and open up the Catalyst community to wider participation.\n\nAs the envisioned PR and Marketing initiatives take root, and the initial relationships are tied, OneUpOneDown could then approach other blockchain foundations and their treasuries to scale this up on a global scale.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very well written and it wonderfully follows the Fund8 funded proposal, building on previous successes and learning points. Delivery is planned for October-December 2022, leaving time to work out any open questions.\n\nI am confident in the proposers\u2019 ability to deliver. Their commitment is palpable. This is their bread and butter after all, yet they are not only dependent on Catalyst funding. Sponsorships are also in the pipeline. The budget is almost too humble considering the ever-growing ROI (return on intent).\n\nAlthough the proposal is quite holistic and well thought out already, it still leaves room for further innovation. One point to consider would be the leverage that the incentivization strategy can provide. In the proposal it is mentioned that it is reserved \u201cfor the mentors in the Cardano Catalyst community\u201d but wouldn\u2019t it be more impactful if the nominal 100 ADA reward was given to those participants who come from outside of the Cardano ecosystem. This would be a good excuse for them to create a wallet and start learning how things work on Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The solution addresses the stated problem directly. Their approach breaks the silos between communities and invites meaningful connections to be formed across blockchains.\n\nThe team doesn\u2019t need to see much extra effort for the measurement of the KPIs because their App collects the data for them. They will be tracking the number of participants (mentors & mentees), matches made, involved blockchains and revenue from sponsors.\n\nThe only thing missing are milestones and leading indicators that could be used to measure progress towards the goals.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2156", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1292, "q0": "The proposal is asking question \u2013 how we can create meaningful connections across blockchains and to promote collaboration? Lets start with the introduction of the proposer \u2013 which is a company that is trying to improve the collaboration by creating mentorship guided pairs = e.g. requestor sets her account, fills the area of interest; the same applies for the mentor; then AI will match these two people and the pair is formed. These pairs are having short term duration (3 months) and are focused on increasing collaboration, forming relationship and self-improvements. Right now, the proposer is aiming to create Web3 pools (e.g. pool for Cardano, ETH, Solana, Polkadot, as can be seen in the picture), which I would rather describe as blockchain collaboration, but in order to have it cross-chain, these should be grouped together, or at least a pool for \u201cblockchain\u201d in general. If you split them, then how are we contributing to cross-chain collaboration? I think the idea is sound, creating one-to-one pairs with the similar interest, with the aim to focus on awareness of blockchain. I believe that such solution will create new connections across blockchains, but since the aim is to have approx. 100 users, the impact on the blockchain will not be that big at all.

Unfortunately the expected time spent on these milestones is not disclosed, and therefore we are unable to assess whether it is reasonably set. E.g. how much time will take to finish \u201cMatching to pair mentors with mentees\u201d?; or Incentivization strategy for the mentors in the Cardano Catalyst community\u201d? The requested budget is 22 500 USD, by 7 500/month broken down to specific tasks. E.g. program manager 2k, pr strategy 1,5k etc. The same what applies for the budget as well \u2013 we do not know whether it is full time employment salary, or shorter time donation is expected, and because no hourly wage is disclosed, we are unable to asses whether it is not overstated, or understated. The team is having 4 members, with a detailed bio and linked in profiles provided. For creating such pools, I believe some technical skills will be required (for website design) but neither of these are having this skill disclosed. It is unclear whether it is not disclosed because the work will not be so demanding, and it is easy to perform, or one of team members will be performing the technical solution. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs for measuring the progress, there is a list of trackable numbers such as number of participants, mentors, mentees, matches etc. From my perspective, these are actually number of success, and to track the progress, some weekly/bi-weekly reports about the development can be provided. So for the success, the number of pairs formed is the most reliable metric to measure the success of the proposal, with the emphasize to blockchain matched pairs. Also, growing number of participants will be displaying the adaptation and popularity of this service. At the same time, on the website there are links for twitter, facebook or youtube. It could be worth it to consider telegram or discord (it can boost up the communication between participants/newcomers).

What I really like is that the proposal doesn't push a Cardano angle at the expense of other chains but instead seeks to include women from all different chains in the web3 space to interact, collaborate, and learn from each other. This is inspiring. \n\nSecond, we need more diversity in the blockchain space and projects like this are how it will happen. Entering blockchain is like drinking from a firehose to those seeking to get in, and that is often enough to scare them off. By having a platform to connect those still finding their way with others who have been there will likely have a huge impact on bringing people into the space. \n\nLastly, I like that the team's AI is designed to match mentors and mentees based on set preferences that allow them to be paired with mentors who can teach them the most/can focus on specific issues. This approach is likely to avoid matches that just don't work or are plain wrong, thereby avoiding people from wasting their time or not being able to find a good fit. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe team already has a fully functional website that is linking mentors and mentees within Cardano. They now plan to expand their efforts to bring in women from all across Web3, thereby not only increasing our exposure but working towards what connects us rather than what divides us. After playing around on the site for a bit it is very engaging and shows that the team has put a lot of thought into what they hope to achieve. \n\nGiven the potential impact of this proposal it has a very modest budget of only $22500. What I take issue with a bit is that they would only pay the mentors 100ADA for each of the matches which would include 4 meetings over 3 months. I am not taking off marks for this as it's the team's prerogative but I find it somewhat unrealistic that this amount would be able to attract the level of expertise desired. If one of the challenges is that retaining talent may be difficult, this amount could better reflect their contribution. \n\nWith that said, the budget and plan are good and likely very achievable if funded. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nAs the team was just funded in F8 they do a good job at hitting all the marks in this proposal too. I value that they have several KPIs to measure success (# of participants, # of mentors/mentees) and that their overall success measures actually align with the KPIs, surprisingly not often do I see this in proposals. \n\nAnother very strong indicator that the community will easily be able to track the progress and success of this proposal is that the community is directly involved in the creation and distribution of educational materials, they also will play the role of both mentor and mentee. This provides a valuable feedback that will allow the team to continually improve and optimize their services. \n\nOverall awesome project and hope it gets funded.

For ease of reading for voters who are reading a translation of proposals or in English when it isn't their first language, maintaining consistency is essential. While that is the case, given the context of the Challenge, the first sentence outlines a problem that indeed aims at the heart of the Challenge\u2013\u2013namely that we break down barriers, be a force for eliminating boundaries created by maximalism, and so forth.\n\nThe positive impact comes in the solution statement first, where the introduction of being a mentoring space that from context clues seems to be by and for women, an additional aligning element of the Challenge of striving to work towards diversity and inclusion. It is well-known that women comprise around 5% or less of the Cardano community. Working towards bringing more women into this space will significantly benefit the entire blockchain and the other communities outside of Cardano being targeted.\n\nThe KPIs, as stated, are in total alignment with the Challenge: examples such as opening doors to other communities, learning from other open source communities, and so on. Also, a note that it is exemplary to add KPIs to your solution. This diligence takes the guesswork out for voters and assessors.\n\nThe plan has room to scale, the goals exemplify this, and the clear plan to seek further funding from Catalyst to develop the work of this proposal even further evidence.\n\nThe risks mentioned are 3 in total. Demand, matches, and # of mentors are all topics mitigated by clear plans of action that are in line with reality and clearly defined for voters. Voters will find it easy to see the value, goals, and actual steps of the plan from the Impact section alone.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The skills necessary are clearly defined in more than one place, not the least of which is the Roadmap. Here the team lists tech setup, user onboarding, matchmaking, management, feedback collection, and analysis as skills being used to finalize the current work that will necessarily still be needed ongoing. Further, the coming stage of the project also requires PR and marketing, developing an incentivization strategy, and the development of the curriculum. The team either currently exemplifies these skills in their own experience and education, or they have a clear plan to onboard those who can assist with the work (such as their plan for curriculum development). Thus, the skill sets are adequate, given these examples. The number of team members is 4, along with the assistance they will hire to aid in curriculum development.\n\nThe budget is clear and broken down into identifiable items. Though adding $ per hour for labor is an ask of Catalyst beginning in Fund9, please include if rewriting. Added to this, a contingencies budget of 5%-10% is typical for projects such as this.\n\nThe plan is complete with every step needed to fulfill the tech/matchmaking work from Fund8 and the PR, incentivization, and curriculum plans for Fund9 (October to the end of December 2022). Voters can see the team's intentions and well-defined goals for success. Using my experience managing group mentorship for over 20 years, I can say the timetable is realistic for the group they have, with PBL development likely taking up most of that time.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap offered in their detailed plan does cover every element of the 3 significant areas of the proposal. What's more is that in Auditability, where they describe what they will measure, their list is 6 items long\u2013\u2013certainly adequate for the work at hand. From the number of participants in the pool, mentors, mentees, matches made, distribution, and revenue from sponsors, the KPIs are all very visual ways of encapsulating success that the community will be able to see progress as those numbers rise.\n\nThough the team seems reasonably open to questions, taking the initiative of offering weekly Gitbook updates or Youtube videos would offer further auditability\u2013\u2013an item often rewarded by voters.
