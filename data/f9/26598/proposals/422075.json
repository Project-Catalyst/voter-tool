However, I do not believe that this is the challenge for what is presented. \n\nThe challenge here is cross-chain collaboration, while the proposal focuses on using Cardano (they say blockchain but only mention Cardano) to improve voting in LATAM countries. Unfortunately there is no discussion about how this project would lead to any sort of cross chain collaboration. Even the description of how it fits into the challenge doesn't really align with the brief or what is being sought after. \n\nStrong idea, but likely in the wrong spot. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented, it is unclear whether this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe goal of the project is to develop a new voting system for LATAM countries to run elections. While the team provides details on how they would create it, including the activities and deliverables at each step, it is unclear whether or not the system they propose to build is robust and safe enough for countries to adopt. \n\nThe team's credentials infer that they are up to the task and have experience in working on such solutions in different capacities. What appears to be missing from the plan are linkages to officials who have the capacity to explore the testing and integration of such a system in their region. \n\nTo this end, I think the plan could also provide additional detail on how the team plans to get their solution actually implemented and being used by countries. As of right now it is a bit of an \"if you build it they will come\" approach, but this is not really sufficient to know whether what they propose is actually feasible to be implemented. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the the proposal. \n\nWhen it comes to building the proposed election system, the team has done an excellent job at outlining each of the indicators and success measures. Essentially, they are aiming for 100% success in testing/approvals, functionality, and documentation, which will be measured through bi-weekly reports and quantitative and qualitative testing. \n\nTo my concerns in the previous sections, it would also be beneficial to have some sort of indicators and measures for what success looks like once built. How will you know that the system is successful if not tested on a broad scale outside of simulations? Even having a measure of one pilot/use case that tests the system would strengthen this section as well.

There is low trust in voting currently, and the proposer seeks to use Cardano to begin remedying the issue. Does it align with the proposal? The answer to this assessor lies in what \"communities\" means. It is explicit in the Challenge that this is meant to be an open place to explore what these things mean, and for this assessor, a local voting \"community\" interacting face-to-face with the Cardano blockchain \"community\" through its blockchain to provide trust...I think that's a perfect fit, even if unexpected as well. It seems it was a bold decision to pick this Challenge and truly understand the spirit of its intent. Bravo, proposer!\n\nThe positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem is undeniable as this blockchain used for local or national voting would be worldwide news and add credence to the already noteworthy blockchain. This value-add would likely create millions of new wallets over time\u2013\u2013hard to quantify but highly likely.\n\nThe KPIs, as explained, do match for opening up the community to an entirely new one. We will see how voters respond, but there seems to be a high likelihood of popularity to this clearly-written solution to local and national voting on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nIn terms of scaling, the plan is perfect for scaling. If successful, even at a local level with little funding, it could quickly win support and trust if everything goes well and could be utilized much more broadly.\n\nThe RISK section is extremely comprehensive and a big plus for many voters. There is no improvement necessary, though future proposers should see this as a lesson in the task of writing risks and mitigations. Voters will know that the team has considered many areas where risks are possible.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is as detailed as one could hope for. The author leaves nothing to question. It is all full of descriptive, actionable tasks to implement the voting system, and the timetable for implementation is within reason, even if a bit ambitious. \n\nMuch like the risk section in Impact, the budget is necessarily extensive, an example of a \"clear budget, broken down into identifiable items,\" which is what voters and assessors are looking for; nothing is left to question. Added to this, it seems the hourly rates are in line with standards. What's more, they are categorized into Workforce, Infrastructure costs (the only area that could use a bit more explanation, if rewriting, so voters know what this refers to), and the audit mentioned.\n\nThe skill sets are fully explained for the project, and the individuals identified meet (and at times exceed) requirements. The team is comprised of more than adequate souls who make up the individuals referred to in the budget. The number of members needed (5) meets the needs of the solution, and all qualifications are as required. As assessors, we strive to add helpful suggestions when we find appropriate times\u2013\u2013there are so few in this proposal.\n\nThere seem to be no resources beyond the well-selected team's budget and technical knowledge.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones are broken into \"macro tasks\" and \"tasks.\" Further, they are well organized in chronological order. Additionally, the KPIs offered are the only accurate indicators for success that can be offered, simple: \"100% of the tasks are approved\" and so on, in language as explicit as this. Clearly, the proposer knows the end they are looking for already, and because of it, the proposal is specific for voters to read and determine that this team's work is entirely doable.\n\nThe one area that the team might want to add to Auditability is a way for community members to look at the work being accomplished. A Gitbook would be one such suggestion.\n\nNote: This proposal belongs as a part of Catalyst education to show the depths a project can genuinely go to offer all of what is being asked for and maintain such high levels of accuracy and purpose in your writing.

I see a contradiction with the team members section where the proposal states that 3 full stack developers with knowledge of blockchain and Cardano and a contributor that followed the plutus program.

No mention is made of any other blockchain technology except Cardano. This challenge setting has a relatively limited budget and tries to overcome tribalism between blockchain communities, so it is a pity that this excellent project has been submitted here instead of the many other categories it may have been a better fit for. \nBecause of this dilemma, I neither agree nor disagree that this is impactful in the light of the challenge brief.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer team is highly skilled with Emurgo Academy intructors and consultants and experienced blockchain developers, a scrum master and control system specialist teaming up to tackle this ambitious challenge.

I would have preferred to see a more gradual reporting and maybe the use of open source versioning shared with the community or Catalyst auditors.

The author studied the Latin American context where the adoption/implementation of e-voting or tele-voting is still not feasible, mainly due to the low level of confidence in Electoral Organizations and the implementation of socio-political economy of the region. During the voting process the vote tally will be switched, which processes the tally of votes in a computer system.

Quarter 1 (2023): Developing and completing the project. Quarter 2: Phase 3 (2023): Development of project components. Quarter 2: Phase 4 (2023): Integration and stability.

This way we clearly understand all that will be done, and have a better view of the development of the project. The route is completely doable. Next is the budget. The team recommends a budget of $101,682. In my opinion, the required value is quite reasonable given the complexity and time nature of the project. The author has provided a very detailed budget table. The budget is broken down and allocated for each very specific job, estimated by hour, by job, by phase. The budget is very well presented and completely transparent. Finally about the team members. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project.

But it seems that the proposal submitted to the Challenge section is not appropriate, this is the \u201cCross Chain Collaboration\u201d Challenge for proposals to help Cardano and other blockchain communities increase collaboration and connectivity. Unfortunately at this F9, there is no Challenge for the Latin America region. To be honest, I'm also very confused as to whether F9 Challenge will include this proposal, even though the proposal is presented very well.\nTo apply blockchain to voting, the proposal is to choose the direction of scanning votes from paper to an image file, then converting them to a hash function and storing it on the blockchain. This is a viable idea that can be implemented at the present time. How to recommend presenting decentralized hosted images? I think it's possible to store the image ID only after the image is uploaded to some centralized server, treat that ID as a private key to generate the hash, and keep it on the blockchain.\nThe proposal lists many possible risks and methods to overcome them. I think in order to convince the community it is better to first find a way to deal with most of these risks, and write in the presentation as one of the steps of the project.
