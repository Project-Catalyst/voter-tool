One suggestion would be creating a few metrics around the cross-chain aspect of the event. New Cardano wallets definitely helps but other metrics like number of non-cardano projects in attendance would be great to add. \n\nThe team behind the proposal seems to have a history of success illustrated by past events they've held.

Describing a user journey through the event would paint a good picture of what the experience will be like. Additionally it would be good to understand what a full capacity event means. How many projects could potential partake? How many people could show up? How long is the event held for? Answers to these questions would help build out the detail of the proposal.\n\nThe budget gives a good sense of exactly how the money earned will be spent. The amount of funding compared to the delivered outcome seems to be a fair expense. I would like to know if participants of the event will need to spend any money in order to partake.

The strongest part about this proposal is that they have already conducted an event, in Barcelona, about Cardano. The video they shared appeared to have a good attendance at the event which indicates there is some interest. However, with what is written I am still left wanting much more. \n\nThe proposer doesn't really break down what is going to happen at the events, just that they will be held. It is unclear from what is written whether or not each event would be the same or if there would be a different theme. Specifically, the proposer simply states the first stage to organize an event is \"theme\" but does not provide any. \n\nThe budget is quite low so probably minimal risk to the community, but given the lack of detail in the plan it may not be one voters are willing to take.

The fact that the team has a wealth of experience in setting up and running these public spaces offers a unique opportunity to Catalyst voters.

Great work, team.\n\nIf rewriting, please solve the typo \"threatening\" to the intended \"non-threatening.\" Assessors don't usually mention typos, but this one alters the section's tone in a potentially harmful way for the team. Voters can be sure it is almost certainly a clerical error and nothing more.\n\nThe risk mentioned is relevant to the time, as meeting in person is an element of the gatherings. They do have an excellent mitigation tactic and would likely benefit, if rewriting, from adding different risks/mitigation tactics. Some might be \"risk: the gatherings may not be as cross-chain as hoped. Mitigation: we will begin attending gatherings online and in person from other blockchains to forge relationships and invite who we meet to our events as well\" or \"risk: one of our hosts isn't able to make an event. mitigation: begin right away developing relationships with attendees, and onboard one or two to be backup hosts in case one of us can't be there (which will also just be a smart way of helping participants become active in supporting the project itself).\" I hope that is helpful.

Seeing the outcome on video will add additional value to the community so they can learn from this unique experience of hiring entertainment and putting so much financial expence towards the experience of the night. \n\nThe plan is broken down and realistic.

One idea is to host a low-key event after each of the larger ones to carry on relationships in a bit more intimate meeting. Among those invited could be the most interested or active during the main events.\n\nThe KPIs quantify success and help voters see the events' true intention. If rewriting, perhaps include the content of the meetings that you assume will bring about such interest and connection, or an area of the plan that provides for creating that if it isn't already written.\n\nThe events will be posted for all to see on social media.

However these sorts of events have proven effective and successful at bringing in new cardano users and collaborating with those who are aware of blockchain but may not be aware of cardano. These events can be very popular, and this team has proven effective at hosting and putting on sold-out blockchain events before.

Creating a Cardano hub which require more fund will be a fun journey too ! Yes it will preceed onboarding to any ecosystem. To mitigate the risk, it will be better to prepare the online program as well. Refer to the links provide, it is a convenient way to know, but i have consideration on how they make the used of this utilities as a leads and potential segment to colaborate, not for the interest of those business company only. We have to know a better reason of why the proposer will use Spanishbreak as the only event organizer in Spain, as we know event organizer sometimes cost us so much fund. But again i will not deep dive my assumption since they only request $15000.

It seems the proposal also lacking information on how the participant will come to the event, yes the marketing tool are prepared and Giveaway included. Guess the promotion will be taken from Mr. Alfred as mention before. As i noticed another obstacle is that the proposer is not having position on those organizer.

It does state that they \u201cwill collaborate with local blockchain ecosystem, to deliver a cross-chain event..\u201d but the statement \u201c\u2026, where we can educate and inform about OUR ecosystem\u201d gives me the impression that the events will be solely focused on discussing about Cardano. So instead of having a collaboration with other blockchain community, it ends being a Cardano outreach event that just happens to also target other blockchain community as participants.

As mentioned by the proposer, the project's staff delivered a successful event that was full to capacity in the Cardano hotel in Barcelona, so clearly, if the routine is followed, what the project expects will happen. And, of course, a good event encourages participants to learn more than they already know, so that more people are aware of the ecosystem and willing to participate in Cardano. However, there is one point that is unclear and concerns me. The author mentions the word \"event\" several times but does not specify how it will be carried out, including anything other than advertising for the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal should select one of the events that the team has successfully organized as a detailed example of the events that the project intends to organize. This will provide investors with a more accurate picture of what will happen here. It can be seen that selecting a location known for its diverse events, particularly where one of the most famous football tournaments in the world - La Liga - takes place, is not necessarily a bad idea, because the popularity will undoubtedly attract a large number of tourists to visit and participate in events. A coin, however, has two sides because both tourists and locals appreciate participating in festivals that have historically been held many times to enjoy its quality. Therefore, perhaps the whole team will face many difficulties in attracting participants, especially when using online interactive experiences because of the Covid pandemic as mentioned by the proposer.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "We have a clear budget that is sufficient to meet our objectives. The project budget is $15,000 for main works such as venue and catering estimates, entertainment, or event delivery.

However, it would be preferable if the proposer could describe how the entertainment section will be organized.  The music festival, food, and the game or a combination of those 3, please provide in detail. The realistic completion timetable, as well as each component, is presented in a clear and detailed manner. \nThe project does mention that marketing and content creation will be handled by a local company, and yet no one knows what the company's name is or what accomplishments they have achieved over the years. More than that, I see about three events in 90 days, but we don't know what the themes are. Obviously, choosing the best topic when discussing Cardano will be difficult, so try to give the options that the proposer is considering in order to get help from the voter who is knowledgeable about the ecosystem. Meanwhile, rather than simply introducing the events company in Barcelona or attaching a link to your own Twitter account, the proposer should briefly discuss his or her own accomplishments as well as the company. Only then will investors be willing to place their money in the hands of people they truly understand.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer has done an excellent job of listing the accomplishments that the project will bring, and I am completely satisfied with everything that has been mentioned.
