Sounds great, no? Well, right at the moment the \u201cdatabase\u201d is nothing but an Excel Sheet and due to the hugely successful data gathering efforts funded earlier, the team now needs to make this more user-friendly and feature-rich.\n\nBecause of its blockchain-agnostic nature, this can become a hugely important hub for any do-gooder in any community on any chain.

Cross-checking with other parts of the plan, however, it becomes clear that the proposers intend to use their partner network to find core developers through events and other outreach activities and this last $5,000 is reserved for that. In all honesty, this uncertainty does decrease the feasibility of the plans a little bit.

Instead of tracking the number of new features, it could be more beneficial to include a qualitative measure such as User Satisfaction or Net Promoter Score (how likely is it that you would recommend this?).\n\nAlso, the outlined solution could be a little more detailed. But, I guess those details will come in at a later stage. Periodic \u201cCommunity updates of progress\u201d are mentioned in the timeline, which is great.

This proposal aims to bring Cardano projects onto the site. A simple search for \u201cCardano\u201d on the website yields just two projects at this time (ClimateCoop.com and Cardano Ethiopia) even though the former just appears to be Cardano-friendly, but nothing is built on it. The site itself has some serious usability issues at the present time, but the idea itself is not a bad one.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s value proposition is to continue developing the open source database and new web integration. The site itself does not appear to be open sourced, which is a shame as there are plenty of low hanging fruits that could be taken care of by volunteers to improve the look and feel of the platform. As Positive Blockchain is not just the site but supposedly a non-profit organization in Paris, open sourcing the site and providing links to the repositories would be meaningful and probably not contradicting any business model the organization might have.\n\nA significant part of the proposal is in researching a new web stack. As a developer for some thirty years, I can assure you that the least of your problems, as it relates to the proposal, is in fact the tech stack.\n\nIt is not clear without a doubt whether the database is curated by the Sustainable ADA / Positive Blockchain team or an improved version of the site shall be launched where project owners can manage their projects in a public facing capacity. The \u201cpossible impact\u201d has feel-good scenarios that are not accounted for in the feasibility and auditability sections (e.g. \u201cAccelerate the ecosystem of positive blockchain by mobilizing communities, stakeholders, funding through events and more!\u201d) and empty buzz phrases like \u201csky is the limit\u201d while at the same time they want to become the crunchbase for SDG deep-tech projects. The \u201cdeep tech\u201d part is uncharacteristic of the team\u2019s track record so far. Granted, their work has been referenced by others - adds to feasibility positively - but the lack of focus on what this proposal is really about is unfortunate.\n\nThe lack of focus is also apparent when they mention \u201cSGT platform\u201d in the risk section. Where did that come from? And is it really hard to find developers for a web1 platform? In my experience only when the incentives are not properly lined up. The amount requested is sizable for this type of work and I do not see a lack of developers that can assist in selecting the appropriate tech stack and development of the platform.\n\nUltimately this proposal can be seen as building a simple, central place for people to share and learn about impact driven projects. Because the NGO, non-profit sector is full of fraud and UK\u2019s princes get millions worth of ADA in their local currency in suitcases for their \u201ccharities\u201d, this proposal should have addressed how they ensure that the projects listed on their platform are actually verified.\n\nDue to the lack of focus on what is actually being built and too many open questions, I can only provide a rating of 3 out of 5.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team has the connections, timeline and budget to implement the proposal successfully. Given the outlined budget and the hours allocated, I would be surprised if this proposal was not fully implemented by the end of the year. Cole did a good job clarifying his involvement in other projects.\n\nI would suggest breaking the development part into smaller responsibilities as there is not only work to be done on the database, but also the front-end as well (and UX - which can be a separate cost entirely). Even if just one person ends up building the entire project by themself, it helps with planning and it helps the voter what goes into the successful implementation of this proposal. The $5k that is allocated to do the research should have ideally been already mostly done. The feature set should have been clear in the proposal (see impact comments), so that only final tech stack considerations should have been taken into account. That would be an hour discussion at most for a small team of three senior engineers and less time for one decision maker who knows what they are doing.\n\nNonetheless, I think it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The Sustainable ADA team has historically shown great commitment to transparency of their progress for their proposals. The success metrics are in line with the proposal and challenge overall. Commitment to more nuanced progress metrics would be desirable, but this is one aspect Catalyst proposals routinely fall short. I suggest open sourcing the development of the proposal if possible. That way, the community can get a better real-time understanding of the progress.\n\nStill, I strongly agree that due to the historical communication of the proposers with the community and their success metrics, the proposal provides me with sufficient information to audit the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2209", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1402, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by creating an open source platform and repository for different blockchain projects working on driving sustainable impacts. \n\nThe project appears blockchain agnostic and welcomes members from any chain to submit their projects and help inform the broader community discussion on using this technology to drive fundamental change. \n\nThe team already boasts about having 1200 projects signed up to their platform, which is certainly an indication that they have already achieved some level of impact beyond just Cardano. This type of interaction between different projects and groups will certainly help to reduce the silos and maximalism of chains. Instead, teams may identify others working on similar projects and work towards mutual objectives. \n\nI also like that the team has decided to make their platform a non-profit rather than a private proprietary company, as this has the potential to mitigate some negative incentives that might befall private companies, such as putting profits before people. Instead, the not for profit focus will allow collaboration on issues, not the bottom line. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe team consists of some key Catalyst Community players, such as AIM, and collaborations with others, such as Cardano4Climate. This type of cross pollination of groups is a good sign in the ecosystem and indicates a desire for all groups to succeed. \n\nAs for the plan, the goal appears to be to onboard new participants and develop a new webstack for the PB platform. I am taking a mark off here because the team could have done a better job of explaining the need for a new webstack and what this would deliver. Given that they already have a working website and have 1200 projects signed up, what is currently missing? \n\nFinally, the budget leaves a bit to be desired and perhaps could provide a bit more granularity on the specific activities for each line item. For example, if the team needs $5000 for events, outreach, new initiatives etc... it would be nice to know how that 5k will be divided, even if high level. Right now, this is unclear.

The goals are to onboard new projects, perform outreach, and include new features in the website. The team also does a good job at expressing their intention to update the community on a regular basis through community announcements. Perhaps the team could add in what venues they will use (yes social media but any others? - conferences, non-blockchain specific venues etc.)\n\nHere they mention that they will revamp the platform to incorporate new features and capabilities but perhaps pointing to some of these potential options would give a better sense of what the end goal is, compared to what's available now.

It also focuses on building the correct infrastructure, tooling and UX which is a must in my opinion when your goal is to make information easily accessible and digestible. Moreover, the project is multi-chain by nature, meaning that each community will be used to certain standards and ways of doing things. The proposers' focus on accessibility and user experience should have the benefit of reducing friction and allowing newcomers to feel at ease on the platform. All of this indicates that they fit the category's criteria well (cross-chain collaboration). Cardano as a blockchain and as a community would greatly benefit from being included in a project with such big ambitions in terms of scope. It is also worthwhile to note that they seem to have a track record of being successful at attracting usability for their platform, as can be seen with the list of entities that have used their database for various use cases. The team uses terms such as 'positive' and 'good' as a way to signal their focus on sustainability and SDG goals, however, their seems to lack a clear description of how a project would fit that category and who is responsible for categorizing projects as such. Will it be the team? A community? A DAO? More information on that front would be great. Another point which should be mentioned is the reason for their focus on SDG-related projects. It seems from their current proposal that they are focusing on scaling up their operations and technology stack. Why limit themselves to a specific subset of project listings? There might a technical reason for it but it is not clear in the text. Why not include all projects and attach a tag to projects that fit in the sustainability category, especially given the fact that they are spending a substantial amount of resources to research and implement a more generic and scalable version of their product.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As I mentioned in the impact section, the track record of the team is very reassuring. Their websites point to working products and the number of teams that have used their platform attest to their growing outreach. This is very good sign! The twitter accounts of the main team members are also active and healthy. These reasons by themselves warrant a score of 4 or 5. The reason for not giving a full score, however, is the description of their roadmap, and budget breakdown which could be much more detailed that the somewhat abstract descriptions they have included. In addition to this, there is the fact that part of the success of this proposer depends depends on external factors, such as finding a developer. That said, the team description section is complete and attests to the capabilities of the current members. The signs all point to a potentially successful implementation of this project, but what would have made this section stronger is a more detailed and technical breakdown of the work to be done. A small portion of the research the team wants funded should have been done to a certain extent to show that there is a specific starting point and the roadmap has more tangible results in terms of technological specifications. For example, instead of \"Begin development of of the new PB webstack\", I would have liked to see something like \"Begin development of component X of webstack\" and give an estimate of it completion time.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The nature of this project makes its auditability easy by default. Add to that the fact that the team has already a functioning product and that this proposal is essentially a V2 of their current one, with the fact that the team is fairly visible within the community, and we can that auditability shouldn't be a big problem at the outset. Their key metrics to measure are satisfactory, although they don't go much into detail regarding specific numbers we can expect to see. They simply say: 'Number of...' instead of giving exact numbers or estimations. Now, I usually do not mind KPIs that lack exact numbers, because these can often be hard or almost impossible to predict, but this section just has a general lack of details that makes it a little confusion to exactly pinpoint what the community should expect to see and at each stage of the process. Not having a github link doesn't help much either. Another minor detail is the 'Success measurements' section which is an almost exact copy of their roadmap from the feasibility section. That, in itself, is not a problem but I don't believe it would be unfair to ask for a bit more details (be it in text or number) regarding the different phases of development and what the community should expect to progressively see getting built. Breaking down the varying components of the work would have been very beneficial. One last point I would make for this section is regarding their previously funded proposal. I would usually expect to see in this section a breakdown of how the new proposal differs from the previous one, what has already been accomplished (if applicable) and why a new proposal is needed. Granted, they touch on this a little bit, but I would personally prefer more than 2 sentences to let the reader fully grasp the benefits of a new proposal.
