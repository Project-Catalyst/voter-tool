And to the proposer, that is where their project DarePlay fits right in to fill the holes, committing to convert traditional off-chain games to blockchain feature-rich games. And even more impressively, according to the proposal, DarePlay is a part of the DareNFT project, which has been fully finished for deployment. \nMoving on to the components of the project, this is another area by which I\u2019m genuinely tempted. It includes 3 fully functional parts, all of which offer different functions that in theory should address this Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge. The first component is the Blockchain Gaming Launchpad, carrying the objective of turning conventional off-chain games to on-chain games by NFTfying the items within a game. Personally, I feel like this is a brilliant move, as it not only revives the already fascinating games with the presence of NFT items, but now it also offers the prospect of monetization and blockchain asset owning, giving the games a revitalized appearance and also potentially appealing to a good number of users and players alike. And along with on-chaining traditional games comes the IGO service, undoubtedly. And along with the IGO service comes with a number of advantages to the games as well, ranging from the aid in handling large amounts of market transactions, all of which will be registered in a digital ledger with full transparency, to increasing the liquidity for the token with the token of the game being listed on major exchanges. And those are only some of the fundamental benefits that an IGO service can offer. And finally, the last component available on DarePlay is the Marketplace where the in-game NFTs items will be on display for trade and purchase. And unlike other Marketplaces on the blockchains, DarePlay now integrates 2 unique features that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process of NFT asset owning and monetization, which are Rent-to-Earn and Lease-to-Earn. The combination of these features and components should be able to form a cost-efficient and smooth-operating platform to onboard conventional game publishers to Cardano, and as a result, onboard the fascinated and enthusiastic players and users to Cardano as well. And I\u2019m even more excited to know that the team is ambitiously aspiring to be the dominant platform on the market and has already been on the move with the partnership OneSoft, a highly respected game publisher in the industry nowadays. The proposal also mentions another eye-capturing detail to me, which is the fact that other NFT games will not have to create their own dedicated marketplaces. I\u2019m assuming that It\u2019s possible DarePlay holds the potential to be the shared marketplace ground for those NFT games for the proposer to make such a bold statement. I hope that I could see further details about this feature in the upcoming updated proposal, since there is information in regards to it for now. \nThe proposal has also listed one potential obstacle for the project, which is the game publishers\u2019 concern over the legitimacy and benefits of Cardano compared to other blockchains, which the proposer chooses to handle by hosting meetups with them for further knowledge sharing, understanding and transparency. The only shortcoming in this section, however, is the lack of key metrics to measure the progress and future success of the project, and probably some estimated figures or visual evidence to back up the claims. So I would suggest the proposer supplement those details quickly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With the information provided in this section, I have good confidence that the team will be able to deliver a fully functional platform. The timeline and deliverables stick closely to the listed components described in the Impact section, and I\u2019m quite amazed to see that the proposers have set up multiple nation-based communities and one global community to inform them about the project progress. And they have also stated that they will be able to gain income from the fees generated in each said component of the project, and that income shall be used to sustain the project and push it further its current capabilities. Related to this project, the proposer has also submitted 4 other proposals, and really impressively once again, they claim to have one company working on each proposal, for a total of 4 separate companies, demonstrating the dedication to make DarePlay dominate the leaderboard of the blockchain market. \nThe requested budget will be allocated to the payment of involved members and execution of the project. The proposal has managed to give a highly detailed description of the tasks needed to be done for each position, the time periods for the completion of each task, the number of hands on deck and the funding required for each task. Based on that performance, I believe that the total amount of $75,000 of funding should be quite justifiable.\nAs for the human factors participating in this project, there are 2 major groups, the DareNFT team and the company Paditech, both of which feature a substantial presence of Vietnamese prodigies and talents. Based on the visual evidence which includes the names, positions and expertise of each DareNFT member, along with a 12-page document illustrating them all much further, and a dedicated website for Paditech displaying exactly what they are all about, I absolutely have all the reasons to believe that this project is in well-refined and highly capable hands.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As far as auditability is concerned, I believe the team has met all requirements needed for a good level of transparency. Specifically, they pledge to publicize the progress of the project, including news, updates and changes, on their ANN channels for both internal and external observation and pace-keeping. The outside community even has the opportunity to experience DarePlay beforehand in its experimental version prior to the official release to the public. The team also has full control on the project execution to ensure that it moves towards the direction the team wishes. And there are key metrics for the team to measure progress as well, however, I\u2019m not sure if those key metrics will also be posted on their ANN channels.\nStill, their desired success equals the successful implementation of DarePlay on Cardano. The team hopes to have supported 30 Cardano-built games, converted 10 traditional games to NFT games after just 3 months of launch, connecting with 30 NFT games on Cardano to bring NFT items onto the DarePlay marketplace and the ultimate goal would be having 5,000 users active on the marketplace. All those objectives, I strongly believe, will not only mean the project is heading the right way, but also Cardano itself can expect to acquire some great benefits from DarePlay, fitting perfectly well with this Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2974", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 508, "q0": "This is a great idea and certainly fits in the challenge well.  Kept waiting to read the part where users will be able to move their assets from on chain to another but those lines never came.

Do gamers get to came cross-chain or is this primarily a benefit to developers and businesses? \n\nWould have also love to see more detailed call response to the challenge brief.

I'd say they are qualify for task!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team does an excellent job detailing what they will be tracking and publishing/delivery publicly, and where the community can go to follow along.

In addition, proposers wants also to convice non-NFT games to start using NFT via Cardano, potentially amplifying the reach of Cardano.\nAs Darplay was already created by this team proposing, there doesnt seem to have major obstacles on this integration.

DarePlay is a fully packaged product suite that includes a blockchain game launcher, an IGO service, and a ready-made marketplace for in-game NFT items. The team will partner DarePlay with Cardano through Cardano's EVM to be able to increase the number of NFT gaming markets on Cardano. NFT games on Cardano will no longer have to build their marketplace and also be a service provider that converts traditional games into blockchain games. Therefore, the proposal will help game publishers turn traditional games into NFT games on Cardano. This is exciting because it will combine two very popular interests of the gaming community, the love for the games and the ability to generate income doing what they love. The team also identified a unique risk that many game publishers are currently unaware of Cardano's advantage over another blockchain EVMs so they would be a bit nervous about listing NFT items on Cardano.

However, we do not understand exactly when the project will be launched, and when it will be completed (starting when it is funded, or what month/year?). A detailed roadmap ensures work is completed on time, in a feasible and sustainable manner. Next is the budget. The team proposed a budget of $75,000.

I have a question for all traditional games when there is a need to convert to NFT games, DarePlay will meet them, right? Or what conditions are needed?
