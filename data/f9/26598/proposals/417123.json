The team offers a place for anyone, regardless of blockchain familiarity, to get information and make connections. One thing that I wonder though, what would make this webiste more appealing than any of the other Cardano information sites doing the same thing? For example, many groups have moved to using Dework to list their tasks and activities as bounties - wouldn't this achieve something similar? \n\nSecond, I see that the proposers have listed their suitability for the cross chain collaboration challenge as it serves for an entry point for newcomers, the assumption that they are already working on other chains or that through this site they will move to Cardano is not well justified. I am not saying it can't happen, but also saying it will won't necessarily make it so. To this end, I think the team could have made a better case for how their proposal fits into this challenge. \n\nLastly, the website will only be as good as the amount it is used by people, yet I think the proposers could do a better job at explaining how they will get the word out and what they foresee as enticing people to join. I see that they say it will be marketed but with all of the different places striving for clicks and impressions across the Cardano ecosystem, additional focus on how to  drive reach and impact could be more developed. Addressing these issues would increase the score here.  ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is likely that this project will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe proposers' plan is to create a website that acts as a gateway for those interested in Cardano to learn about events and jobs across the ecosystem. Overall, this is a good idea as it is very burdensome to enter Cardano and can be very disorienting. The team hopes to appeal to newcomers and veterans alike and will update their MVP to include new features. \n\nThe team's credentials are strong and indicate they are up to the task, which definitely gives confidence the product itself (the website) would be able to be completed in the timeframe and budget outlined. \n\nThe team's plan is also simple and straightforward with clear milestones and deliverables at the different stages as it relates to the site itself. What is not included in the plan is their marketing strategy and how they will engage/collaborate with different individuals, projects, or teams. Since the success of the website will be dependent on this, it should be reflected in the plan. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nGiven that the project is straightforward, the team provides good indicators for how they will measure the use/traction of the website overtime. This will help users know if the website is actually being used and by whom. I like how the team split the indicators between users and projects so they can \nprovide a holistic view of use. \n\nHowever, I think the proposers could have done a better job at aligning their KPIs and success measures. For example, if the goal is to have a \"steady increase month over month of users signing up\" there should be corresponding KPI for the community to know whether it is successful. In this sense, the KPI would be # of users per month. Then you could measure if it was increasing at a \"steady rate\". \n\nAt the same time, the team does outline their intent to seek user feedback to improve the system, and in so doing likely offers additional opportunities for community members to be involved. Overall good work, just a bit more clarification throughout would increase the ranking.

Here, our main objective is to promote a healthy exchange between Cardano and other blockchains, so that our ecosystem becomes increasingly known and respected, so that new people start to adopt the technologies offered on Cardano. However, this proposal is not focused on making this contact between different chains, different networks, but between the public and Cardano. Perhaps this idea would fit better with the Dapps challenge, as here it is suggested to create a product (an interface) in which \u201cpeople act instantly based on the information they see. From a Twitter space to a job opening\u201d and \u201cby letting people find out exactly when an event is happening, they can position themselves to get the information they want.\u201d Basically, it would be a site for people to increase their knowledge of the cryptographic world, focusing on Cardano, which is not a bad idea, however there are already other projects in this direction (an example is a site called Cardano Feed, which I I evaluated some proposals referring to the creator in the same fund). Therefore, I believe that it would be necessary for the proponent to invest more in explaining what the user experience would be like here, in what way an audience from other blockchains would be attracted - because the way it is described, the impression we have is that the site would be to the general public, it would be open to anyone interested in the subject of blockchain. The proponent claims that the project meets the objectives of the challenge by providing a \u201cgreat entry point for those who are curious about Cardano or short on time. We want to remove friction as much as possible so that information seekers can get it right away.\u201d However, in this challenge, our work is in another direction, needing to develop projects that contribute to, as proposed in the scope of the challenge, the \u201cgrowth of activity in the chain due to new cross-chain implementations, number of proposals including participants from other blockchain communities , number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains\u201d and etc. For these reasons unfortunately the idea is not providing exact solutions for what is sought in the challenge, this situation could be better resolved if the proposer worked out a way in which the site would be especially attractive to members of other ecosystems, other blockchains, so that these people would gain a better understanding of Cardano and thus get involved with our community, our projects, initiating cross-chain collaborative projects, as is the objective here.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This topic is ok, but also not so suitable, unfortunately. The roadmap is presented in a slightly confusing way, first we are presented with what would need to be done in 2 months, but then we go back in the timeline to 3 weeks and then we go forward again to 1 month\u2026 It would be easier to understand if the advances were organized chronologically, if we first knew the expected results for 1 month, then for 2 months, and so on. Another point that I would like to comment on is the way information is passed on here. In general, it is said which partial results should be ready according to temporality, for example, in 1 month of project the intention is \u201ccreate a more robust profile page + add the ability to post vacancies + add the ability to search for candidates and resumes\u201d; but what would need to be done for these things to be delivered? What are the tasks behind this, what would the work routine of the professionals involved here be like? Therefore, in addition to a more linear temporal organization, I would like the team's work routines to be more detailed, but explicit. Because the way the script is presented, unfortunately we can't get a good view of the process. Talking about the costs, a total of 32 thousand dollars is asked, and the amount is divided into some parts, but these are not very detailed either. Most of the money would go towards the developers' salary (27k), but how long would they dedicate themselves to this project, what would their working hours be worth? The same doubts are raised in relation to the marketing/design work and also the product management. How would the project publicity campaign be carried out, what strategies would be adopted? Speaking of the team, this is definitely the best part of the topic, as almost all the developers have some experience working at Cardano, some of them being the main developers of NFT projects (Keith and Erick). In this way, a lot of confidence is passed that they are indeed prepared to execute this project successfully. In general, we know all the necessary information about the team members: their names, a short summary of their resumes and the links to their linkedin profiles, through which we can verify all the information that is said. However, the other feasibility topics deserved a reformulation to make them more suitable: the roadmap needed to be more detailed - they provide a website where we could see better about the roadmap, but in fact no information is passed beyond what is in the scope of the proposal ; and the use of funding could also be better explained.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Once again, the information provided is not that adequate, unfortunately. Regarding the auditability of progress, what is said is that progressive successes would be measured through tracking new users and project listings on the website. I think that this way we can perceive engagement, but we cannot understand how the process of building the platform itself would be taking place. There would need to be a work schedule to be respected, a kind of planning on what would be done, how and when so that such partial results would be possible. And so, it would be necessary for the project leader, the proponent, for example, to keep the Cardano community always updated on the advances, for example they say that they will audit weekly and monthly how popular the site is, but before that, it is also necessary for us to monitor how the site itself is being created (and this must be reported monthly as well). About success, this is defined as \u201ca community center. A site where people go when they start their day to see what's happening around the ecosystem. It is important to give individuals who are not so in tune with what is happening in the Cardano ecosystem an outlet. Many start out as stalkers, and if we can get these people to be active participants, we've done a great job.\u201d But in addition to the success of the site itself, we need to understand the impacts of this for Cardano and especially if, in some way, individuals from other blockchains would have associated with our ecosystem and from there an exchange would have been generated, a creation of projects. cross network. It would then be necessary for the proponent and his team to do some direct research with the users of the site to understand how they would have become active members of the community, if they come from other communities, what projects would have been generated from there, if that platform would have contributed to the greater popularization of Cardano within the cryptographic universe, etc. Therefore, I think that this topic would also need to be better formulated, both in terms of tracking progress (partial results and the passage of phases), and in terms of understanding whether the challenge's objectives would have been, even if indirectly, addressed. If such changes were made, the auditability would be more adequate, but unfortunately it is not the way it is currently presented.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This is being filtered out because it is an objective statement to say that this proposal does not belong in this category.

I don't doubt the intentions of the author are noble, but I fail to see how--yet another--event calendar would boost cross-chain collaborations for Cardano.

The same thing happens with job portals (CryptoJobsList, CryptocurrencyJobs, Crypto.Jobs, etc.).\nSecondly, because I don't believe event awareness is a defining factor in Cardano's cross-chain interactions.\nOn another note, I find the writing and structuring of this proposal a bit confusing and vague. It repeteadly mentions providing education and value to users, and being an entry points for newcomers.

Additionally, gaining insight on popular events is not a KPI or measurable at all.\nThe same happens when the author is asked to describe what success looks like. \"A community hub\" or \"a site people go to to see what happens\" don't really tell me anything.\n\nHere's an example of what I think an appropriate metric for this proposal could be: \n1.

We have seen it at Consensus 2022 and will also see something similar during the Rare Bloom event later this year. These are some events that I noticed while looking into the Woolly Map Dapp. Their proposed challenge is that there is not a place on Cardano where a user can go to get access to event/job information. There are lots of opportunities in the job market and lots of events that will likely strengthen the community as well. The proposal suggests creating a dapp and implementing more features and including information for all community members. The vision is to create a dapp where all users will go when looking for jobs/events in the Cardano ecosystem. I find this to be extremely valuable. It is a place where people can describe their skills and potentially get a job doing what they love. I find that this proposal could have a huge positive impact on many users in the ecosystem.
