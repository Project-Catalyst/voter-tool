This builds confidence in their capacity to deliver successfully. It is also great to see they are already working on partnerships with different projects across chains. This shows the team is willing to put in the work with or without Catalyst funding. \n\nThe risks section covers a good set of potential issues with the project along with a few solutions to them. It seems they have properly mitigated the challenges that could arise during deployment. \n\nThe metrics and timeline section gives exact dates which is exciting to see. Unfortunately there isn't any other metrics that will be tracked other than launch times. It would have been great to see metrics on number of wallets connected to site by blockchain, number of metaverse integrations, and number of songs played. In addition to this there isn't a clear set of features or user actions that can be taken. What is the experience like for the fan and the artist? More context would make it easier to see if the project will be successful or not. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposed solution section provides an overview of a lot of different topics but doesn't quite drill into any of them. I can get a sense of what is inteded to be built but don't understand exactly what an experience with it from a music creator or listener perspective will be. Additionally there isn't a described set of features that make it easy to understand how the user can interact with the product.\n\nOverall the proposal is exciting but lacks the proper context to truly understand what the product will be. There are notes on an NFT media player, marketplace, and different metaverse integrations but never a solid view of exactly what these things will act like.

So I start by commending the proposers on the idea. In principle the idea is excellent but I am left a bit wondering about the impact this would have for Cardano, in the following ways. \n\nThe proposers suggest that as more artists come to blockchain ecosystems, they will want to be blockchain agnostic in order to maximize their reach. At first blush this makes sense, however, what is not well explained is the actual process. Would it be the musicians who move seamlessly or the fans? Would a musician not need to launch/release their album/music on a particular chain in order to mint it? To this end, the musicians would likely not be agnostic, they would have to go to the chain where most of their fans are, no?\n\nWhat the solution appears to do (or at least this feels implied) is allow fans to mint music from their favourite artist (on whatever chain the artist minted on) and then listen to all those different music from across chains in the Cardano player. \n\nPerhaps I am missing something here but it don't think so. I still think the idea but the way it's framed is not very clear as written. This idea would be great for those on Cardano who use the music player but how it would improve cross-chain collaboration beyond the community could be better explained. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience and plan presented it is somewhat likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe strongest component of this section in the proposal is the listed team members who hold an impressive repertoire of achievements. In addition to seemingly having the music expertise the proposal also represents some large players in the Cardano community (NFT Maker.io) who have a very good reputation for ideating and implementing innovative ideas. \n\nI do wish the plan was a bit more robust and provided better explanations of the steps required to build the music player. The proposers say they will have the media player on soundrig.io but when visiting the website there is just a fillable form. Given that the proposal suggests a July 30, 2022 launch date for the player I'd hope for at least an MVP. Unfortunately in this instance I again am left wondering. \n\nSince we do not have a breakdown of activities it is hard to know whether the lump sums in the budget are appropriate. Some additional clarity around this would be very helpful and likely would increase the score further. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information in the proposal could be improved for auditing the progress and the success of the proposal. \n\nWe are left with two deliverables, launch the player on July 30, then have cross chain compatibility on September 28. Unfortunately this leaves much to be desired for how progress would be tracked, beyond a simple yes/no. For the request of $50k it would be preferred to have some sort of description of expected steps, the intended outcomes, and then actual way you will track whether what was expected matched the real outcome. Just saying yes/no offers no real indication of whether it was a success. \n\nMoreover, since there is a two month window between the deliverables, would there not be opportunities to provide updates to the community? Dev updates? Progress updates on linking with other chains? These are easy things that could help audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nI would encourage the team to provide a bit better of an explanation around some of the key gaps highlighted here if they resubmit. The idea is great. Execution could be improved.

Please know that you will likely succeed if you rewrite and consider the missing elements. Voter support will likely increase as more fields are thoroughly filled in, as suggested.\n\nIn Auditability, there is no roadmap beyond the description of 2 deliverables, one of which isn't even budgeted for (the music player itself) instead of the actual steps that would come before completion of true cross-chain interoperability. Though the deliverables constitute KPIs, other progress markers could be offered, such as the use of the marketplace or traffic to media produced to promote to others. Thus, 2 stars is offered in Auditability.\n\nThe team and community would also benefit from periodical updates to a Gitbook for auditability as well.\n\nIf the proposal is rewritten for a future fund, voters will surely be excited to see the \"gaps\" filled in so we can see what you'll eventually create! Thank you for bringing this idea and plan to the table.
