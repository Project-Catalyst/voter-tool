This aligns perfectly with the challenge that is looking to break down silos between the chains through new and innovative ways. \n\nThere is already a wealth of knowledge in the Cardano community but it is very limiting as it's often only available in english. By translating the existing Plutus module into Japanese, the project will not only break down these silos, it will also make Cardano's efforts more accessible. One could easily imagine the Plutus PBL module being translated into a diverse array of languages. \n\nSince there is already a fairly large Japanese community within Cardano, there will likely be a decent number of people waiting for such materials to become available. The team has already made connections into this community and is responding to their needs, which will drive further impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposal is very straight forward and does not require a ton of time or resources. Since gimbalabs already has the module developed, it only requires the completion and vetting of the translation. The proposal also clearly states that the proposer (Sebastian) also helped develop the actual Plutus module that will be translated, so there close knowledge of the content will be very valuable. \n\nVoters can be confident in the ability of the proposer to deliver given the track record of gimbalabs to date. They have been around since the early Catalyst days and continue to deliver major products, tools, and networks to complete their initiatives. \n\nThere is also very little risk with this proposal as we already know that gimbalabs modules are being used by the community. However, I'd encourage the proposers to include some of the data points for the English products to give some context as to what your hopes are for the Japanese module. Voters may also be more willing to take a risk for <$10k due to the potential upside. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The primary thing to be measured is whether or not the module was translated into Japanese in a technical yet well-understood manner. The team commits to validating the translation at each step of the plan, which will offer the community an opportunity to provide feedback throughout the process rather than just at the end, in an iterative fashion. \n\nOnce the module is translated is when the interesting data collection, tracking, and reporting come into play. The true value of this proposal is not in the translation itself but rather how that newly translated module is implemented. To this end, the proposer does a good job at laying out the short vision (translation) and the broader vision (ongoing use). Once translated, the community, through gimbalabs, will be able to tell exactly how many times the module was used, in what contexts, and what was its impact. \n\nFinally, voters can also have trust in the gimbalabs internal auditing processes that are in place and will be applied to this proposal.

Having worked in companies with diligent translation departments, I learned that translation efficiency comes with time/learning how to translate particular jargon.

Voters will benefit from the author's thorough work on this mitigation tactic.\n\nThere is no need for this particular translation project to scale.

The only improvement is if the team explicitly provides the name of the individual that will fill each role. Even without this more specific information, in the skills sets of the 3-person team provided, we see the necessary talents and backgrounds needed to achieve the task, which seems implied.\n\nRegarding funding, the budget is clear for all three aspects of the work (translation, verification, and corrections). The rate itself (just over US$30 per hour) is quite fair, considering the average price per hour for the level of skill required. Additionally, the more than reasonable rate they will charge is fair compensation for the team and shows mindfulness of the needs of others within the Cross-Chain Challenge. Voters can feel confident that the work is within this well-defined scope.\n\nThe timetable of 4 months (1 month per section) is adequate, given the amount to be translated (links in the proposal to the PBL curriculum).
