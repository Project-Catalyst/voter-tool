This is in my opinion a well though proposal that will help more project use Atala PRISM for DID use case or simply bridge the Hyperledger with Cardano blockchain. The proposal itself answers the cross-chain collaboration challenge by implementing technical connection between Cardano to Hyperledger Aries (building bridges). Furthermore, the key metric is also aligned with the challenge key metrics. That is adding number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains. After all, this project will be build by the Atala PRISM Pioneers and will be made available (open-source) for the whole Cardano community, giving greater impact for the next Atala PRISM developers/pioneers that want to build project in this field.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When it comes to the experiences in Atala PRISM, I think Snapbrillia & RootsID team that are parts of Atala PRISM Pioneer Batch 1 & 2 are more than capable to achieve the targeted goals. Both of them have previously funded proposals in the earlier Catalyst Fund. In addition, in the proposal they explained the team consists of full-time web3 architects, web3 developers, data scientist and full-stack developers. Equally important is that they also explain the timeline including adding one month buffer to deploy the product in March 2023 (see risk mitigation). All the possible main risks are concisely answered with the solution to mitigate the risk. For example, established partnership with Atala PRISM and IOG team to deploy the Atala PRISM on the mainnet in August 2022. After all, the budget is broken down based on the manpower necessities with market-rate salary. Overall, I\u2019m quite confident that both of Snapbrillia & RootsID team could bring the project into realization. Therefore, I give 5 stars for the feasibility.

Community could also check the development progress via their GitHub link https://github.com/snapbrillia/. Additionally, the team wrote clearly what they want to achieve starting from providing Atala PRISM & RootsID with z-KP functionalities until expanding Atala PRISM interoperability with Hyperledger.

The team have stated the risks for this project and majority of them have already been solved by having partnerships with ATALA Prism, IOG, Emurgo, Hyperledger, Plutus devs, etc. This project will be able to scale globally because they are solving DIDs with zKP which will bring more people to the blockchain space.

With the number of developers and skills that this team have, the project timeframe is practical and achievable. The budget break down is also in details and it is according to the market value. The budget requested is enough for the team to execute this project. Most of the budget is used for developing the tool for zKP on ATALA Prism.
