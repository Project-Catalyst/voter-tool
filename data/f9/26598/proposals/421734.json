This is an essential component of DeFi on a smart contract platform and will hugely increase TVL in DeFi dApps. The Rosen bridge linking Cardano and Ergo is soon to be launched, and projects like anetaBTC will help bring the two communities together. Smart contract risk is identified as a key threat, however, the NETA community fund helps to offset this risk. They haven't received any funding from VCs and there has been no ICO. As far as I know the only funding they have received is from NFT sells, their stake pool on Cardano and, I expect, market sells of the token. There have been many generous airdrops to the community with a effort at wide distribution. All of these things make this a great community project. As a user of DeFi on Ergo and Cardano, I hope this proposal gets funded.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The teams seems solid. They have proven to be competent with the successful launch of their Aneta Angels NFTs on Cardano and Ergo. They also set a record on Ergo airdropping their token to the most addresses in one transaction. They are advised by Kyber Network which is encouraging. However, this is the first project from the team and it's still early in their roadmap to fully gauge their competence.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A detailed roadmap is provided, which already shows the successful completion of many milestones. This clear roadmap will allow the project to be easily audited. There is a clear budget breakdown. Audit costs aren't mentioned in the budget, so it would be unsurprising if there was a future request for more funds. There is some overlap in the budget with anetaBTC's other Catalyst proposal. Do core team members have expenses of $10k per month because they are working on two project? It seems like this proposal will pay them twice. Same with developers and cross chain address mechanism.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2133", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4593, "q0": "Bitcoin and Cardano networks share a very fundamental aspect, transfers use UXTO's as opposed to Ethereum's accounting model. In other words, spending coins in Bitcoin and Cardano is very similar to how you spend cash from your wallet and in Ethereum is how you spend money from your bank account.\n\nThis shared aspect makes it easier for bitcoin owners to use cardano because they would find it somehow familiar to what they are used to in bitcoin.\n\nUnlike other bridging proposals this proposal focuses only on bitcoin and the roadmap is geared towards making this work decentralized, secure and reliable. I find this to be a very good approach because it focuses the team and makes it more likely that the project will be a success.\n\nOne aspect I don't really agree with is that they state that the budget will allow them to continue development for 5 months, the time needed to launch this on Ergo mainnet. This is a Cardano Catalyst proposal. I expected that the focus would be Cardano. I do understand that Ergo and Cardano are very similar and basically porting from Ergo to Cardano should be straight forward but still I think it will be fair to use Catalyst funds to develop first in Cardano.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Having worked already on 2 bridges between different blockchains I've spent a lot of time thinking and implementing most of the technical aspects that this project requires.\n\nThe proposed BTC-relay solution is a battle tested solution that is used in a bunch of other bridges out there (Keep, Celer, TokenBridge ...). The main idea is that deposits in Bitcoin are observed and payment proofs are sent to a side chain, from there anetaBTC is minted and transferred over to the receiving address in Cardano.\n\nThe team has a roadmap that shows progress done and the detailed plan until 2023. The roadmap is a little confusing because it contains references to another project that the team is working on, tosiDrop that helps them distribute the tokens that are rewarded to the LISO participants. I would have prefered to see only the roadmap for anetaBTC here.\n\nThe salaries paid for development and research are 5k a month, they don't specify how many team members are in the development or research team and if they work on this full time or not.\n\nOne other important aspect is the security of the collateralized vault, some of these vaults might contain significant amounts of BTC and they will become honeypots, the team is aware of potential risks and they are taking steps to insure funds.\n\nAt last the fact that they focus only on bridging BTC helps alot with the feasibility of this project and makes it a lot more likely to succeed.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project has an active twitter account, discord channel where they post regular updates (at least once a week) and also their blog has relevant articles.\n\nTheir github account is not very active, at the time of writing it seems that the wallet app receives the most updates and it has been updated 12 days ago.

I wonder if the fund is accepted how would that reflect to the community supporters. And how can we ensure the team isn\u2019t funded in duplication.

The AnetaBTC team is doing a great job at bringing the two projects together. There needs to be a greater understanding on how these two projects can work together to help bring scalability to each project. This proposal discusses the different use-cases on how the requested funds will help the community to understand cross-chain collaboration between Cardano and Ergo.

AnetaBTC, the proposer is looking at the problem of BTC not being accessible on the Cardano blockchain. BTC is the highest value asset in the crypto space, and everything moves based on it's performance in current times. Having access to a wrapped version (1:1) on Cardano would have huge ramifications and bring massive value to the Cardano blockchain.\n\nQuality Dapps, products and integrations will increase the utility & adoption of Cardano. AnetaBTC is one such Daap.\n\n- Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.\n- Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products.\n- Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community.\n\nAnetaBTC is in alignment with all metrics of the challenge category.\n\nThis proposal effectively addresses the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has taken look at the risks associated with their proposal and have taken the time to work hw those risks can be mitigated.

To mitigate this risk, we are led by researchers and security engineers from the most prestigious universities and institutions around the world. Additionally, we are working closely with Kyber Network, the inventors and developers of wBTC and KyberSwap. WrappedBTC and KyberSwap, are widely considered the more innovate platforms on Ethereum. To this day, neither of these platforms has experienced a hack or exploit.\n\"\n\nThis is key information and shows that AnetaBTC is working with the best they can find to circumvent any risks that could come about and create a truly secure platform.\n\nMoving on to the timeline we see in this proposal and incredibly well laid out roadmap/timeline/plan with milestones and time horizons. Further more they have marked what has already been completed and what is left, and the plan set forth is reasonable and achievable, and testnet planned for Q3.\n\nLooking at the budget section of this proposal they already have an idea of costs per month based on the work that has been done since the end of 2021. They have laid out what is needed and it is reasonable to achieve the goals which is to allow them to continue development for at least 5 more months, which we believe is ample time to launch our protocol on Ergo mainnet. They have also taken into consideration as to whether or not they may need additionally funding in the future. They have targeted the area around auditing the code as a possibility for additional funds which would be reasonable considering the nature of this project.\n\nFinally we have the team. The team is not listed in the proposal but gives a direct link to the full team to review who they are, and image of each person, and what their experience and skills are. The team is composed of of PhD researchers and developers from MIT and University of Finland. The team is also advised Kyber Network, the inventors and lead developers of Wrapped BTC on Ethereum, the #1 wrapped Bitcoin product in the world.
