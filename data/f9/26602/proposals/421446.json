The issue of the proposal is to expand Cardano's reach in Japan. This problem is suitable for a challenge. Solving the challenge question \"How to develop the Cardano community in Asia\", and Japan as a country in Asia, this proposal solves the problem of developing the Japanese Cardano community. This proposal will be a new step forward for the Cardano community in Japan. Collaborating with key industry and government leaders in Japan will give the community an influential voice and credibility to ensure the community's strong development in Japan and the world. In addition, Japan is a member of the G7 and a member of many important economic organizations in the region and the world. This will contribute to promoting countries to legalize the use of digital currencies by using Cardano ecosystem projects/utilities in daily life, in business, etc. Besides, the government and industry will help guide and support the Cardano community to thrive. Their solution is to leverage relationships with the media and influential leaders in industry and government to broaden their reach and expertise in interacting with them. There is a great benefit to the people participating in the Cardano Community directly and the community at large indirectly. By providing the knowledge, interest, direction, and career opportunities to establish Cardano's aspirational position in Japan... However, in the proposal, there is no specific evidence on how they do it. What industry will they be associated with? What content is focused and widely communicated? They have foreseen possible risks and have a way to deal with them. Their solution is that \"the documents themselves can be used in the initial meetings that their internal team will use to convincely explain the platform, the superior features, and sustained strength\". However, they do not clearly describe what the document includes to convince senior leaders. Their arguments are not really convincing. Hopefully, the team can detail the solution to make this proposal more convincing. However, the impact of this proposal cannot be underestimated.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They already have a plan for the proposed implementation. The total proposed implementation time is expected to be 90 days. They have planned in detail the work to be done: from building documents, scheduling events, to communication, etc. The timeline is reasonable. Big goals to be achieved: number of professionally developed documents; media meetings and interviews; influencer relationship management; media coverage; new media opportunities; opportunities and investments; new business; leading and growing network. However, they do not provide a link address for the community to monitor and check the progress of the project. This is a minus. The fundraising budget accounts for more than 25% of the total challenge. This is a high budget. They have detailed spending plans for the fundraising budget. However, the question is: how many events will they host? Who is the target audience? Online events won't cost too much, so it's important to clear this up to review the cost of \"Conferences and events-$2,000\". Besides, they don't have an additional budget. The total cost they describe is $65,900, not the $63,000 they call for. The community needs accuracy, transparency, and an effective budget plan. About the team, the team consists of 4 members. They have specific tasks assigned to each member. It is commendable that the members are all experienced in this field and have experience relevant to the work they are assigned. However, it is necessary to add the link address or any website for the members so that the community can verify their identity and experience. The team also did not mention the qualifications of the members. To be more persuasive, the group can highlight the relationships and connections they have established with industry influencers and government leaders. This will increase the persuasiveness and feasibility of the proposal, as it shows they are ready to act. I have not really appreciated the feasibility of the project. Because the key point of the project is to have the support and voices of influential individuals to guide and influence the Japanese Cardano community, But they have not yet shown their relationship capacity and potential. So the score for feasibility is not absolute.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The transparency of this proposal is not appreciated. They do not provide specific quantity or quality goals to measure the success of the project. At the same time, they did not mention where they would report the data and results so that the community could verify the success of the project. It's not easy to check if they don't make it public. Suggestions can include goals: number of professionally developed documents? About what topics? How many events and seminars are held? How many participants will it attract? How many influencers and leaders will be present? How many proposals came out after this series of activities? How many people find job opportunities when participating?... These are sustainable values that the community is aiming for. The success of the project is to provide comprehensive and advanced knowledge to the Japanese Cardano community, which is reflected in: professional documentation on Cardano; positive coverage of Cardano in Japanese media; influencer relations meetings that lead to follow-up projects; expanding reach to the upper echelons of the media, business, and government; increasing the number of ADA holders; and converting to the Cardano community. The success of this project will have a huge impact on the Cardano Japanese community, inspiring and motivating the development of the Asian Cardano community. In particular, the Japanese government and important agencies will have influence over the governments of Asian countries. It will be the encouragement and confidence for Asian countries to develop more than the Cardano community, legalizing the use of digital currency. This is an extension and extension of the Cardano Japan PR Initiative (80085) developed to update media stakeholders on the status of Cardano. It was extended to address the amount of material to develop, the higher than usual number of community spokespeople to develop the profile, and the range of story angles from which to approach planning activities, their coordination and implementation.

When the team wants to upgrade the program beyond the media to gradually impact growth and development. The team identified the problem to be solved as the need to develop more material for the media in Japan. Through the implementation of the proposal, the team increased the value of the Cardano ecosystem. I think this can happen but it takes time, it will be done gradually because the nature of media information is contagious to each person, and from there, everyone will understand more about blockchain. Cardano will generate opinions - ideas and actions that impact the Cardano ecosystem. I see this as a very good opportunity to scale the Cardano blockchain in Japan. Through this proposal, a lot of Japanese people will know about the Cardano blockchain, thereby opening up a lot of opportunities to develop the country and, more broadly, develop East Asia and the continent through the application of high technology. I appreciate the impact the proposal offers. I strongly agree about showing this impact to Japan, East Asia,, and Cardano. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am very impressed with the 5 core members of the team, all of whom have extensive experience in management, communication, training, and information technology. These members all have very good expertise with many years of experience in the positions they hold. It would not be an exaggeration to say that some of them have reached the level of experts. This makes the community have a certain confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. However, I am trying to find specific documents that are relevant to the team and related to the proposal, and have not yet found any documents presented in the proposal to publicly prove the identities of the members. Members of the group. I would love to see links to social networks (eg Linkedin, Facebook, etc...) to find out more about members' identities. I advise the team to quickly add these missing documents and personal information to increase the transparency of the proposal and further affirm the community's trust in the team.\nThrough the detailed budget analysis, I found that the budget is divided into reasonable sub-sections with the required goals. The team has applied the calculation of work hours, thereby calculating the required amount for each job. This is a very accurate calculation of work, used in many proposals and many projects around the world. The fact that the budget is divided gives the community more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal. I have one more question, to determine the budget to implement the proposal: If not funded by Catalyst, will the team continue to work on this proposal? Does the team have any other funding sources to secure the implementation of this proposal? (those are funding sources that can come from funding by other organizations)\nThe plan and how to do it have been detailed by the team. I very much agree with the plan that the team has proposed because it proves the professionalism and responsibility when writing the proposal. I wish all proposals in Catalyst had a clear plan and implementation, in the same order as this one.\nIn terms of resources required to perform, I trust four core members with their experience and qualifications. However, I still need to know more about some of the other members behind to support the team in their work, are they enthusiastic collaborators in the Cardano Japanese community, members of the company, or not? of any other organization? In my opinion, the team should be more clear about these support members to increase the feasibility of the community. The fact that no member is working on other proposals at Fund 9 makes it possible for all team members to fully focus their human resources and energy on implementing this proposal. I was pleased to see the team present this in the proposal.\nIn terms of technical aspects, I find that the team's strong point is the ability to propagate images - promote information in a very clear and professional way, this is also the professional work of team members from many countries. this year. Therefore, I strongly believe in the ability to convey information and promote images to the wider Japanese society to attract more attention and attract members of the Cardano Japanese community. If possible, please share about applying high-tech techniques to implement the proposal, does it have much to do with the Cardano blockchain?\nI would like to talk more about the challenges and risks associated with implementation. Has the team taken into account the devaluation of Ada? I'm an example in case this proposal was approved and funded by Catalyst. Currently, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing many fluctuations (downtrend). Therefore, I advise the team to pay attention to the price of Ada in the market, from which to have reasonable calculations to ensure the budget to implement the proposal.\nIn summary, I agree with the feasibility of the proposal. My questions and advice are positive, contributing to a better proposal. I would like to reiterate my advice that the team adds to the disclosure of the identities of the team members. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am very pleased with the team in terms of the milestones the team has shown. It is easy to understand, and presented in chronological order associated with specific months of the year. This creates a great advantage for the PA community when evaluating the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The team also very clearly defines what success looks like through the criteria of documentation, customer relations meetings, number of Ada owners, etc... I agree with this definition of success. However, I regret not seeing the KPIs and key metrics. We all know these two metrics are essential to confirm the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The community also relies on these two indicators to do their audits. One of my tips for the team is that you add enough KPIs and key metrics to improve the transparency and auditability of the proposal. For the rest, the team described the problems very clearly and easily and clearly stated the solutions to overcome those problems. Here are some of my comments on the auditability of the proposal.

This helps the community understand how the funds will be used.
