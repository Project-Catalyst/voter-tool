To contextualize, the proposal states that it\u2019ll need $ 2K for translation, however the majority of translators that I\u2019ve already seen and worked with charges per word, therefore, how many blogs are expected to translate with this value?\n\n3 \u2013 Team: It was provided only one name in this part of the proposal. The link provided does not show how many people the eggworm has nor their field of actuation. Therefore, it\u2019s quite hard to evaluate this part.\n\n4 \u2013 Self fund / scalability: In order to keep this proposal going it needs a perennial source of money, because it\u2019s a continuous work of translating, video editing, creating content etc. However, it does not provide a plan to do that.  Therefore, the continuation of this proposal and, thus, the scalability is at risk.\n\n5 \u2013 Risk management: There was accounted some risks relying the Japanese community characteristics, however it would be good to include some more, such as content to translate selection and the quantity of material. These are considered risks because: a) choosing the wrong proposal might reduce the interest of Japanese participation and western community visualization; and b) if this proposal is a success, the human part will be a bottleneck causing delays and queue to translate content, possibly making the Japanese community tired.\n\nThat being said, there are some points that might cause trouble to the feasibility and success of this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As mentioned before, the roadmap and milestones provided are quite general, making it hard to follow the proposal\u2019s development and progress.

The metrics and KPI provided might include the validation of a western number of views and participation. This way we could measure its success.\n\nAlso, there was not provided a channel to share all the development content and information, allowing us, voters, to follow its progress.

For instance the proposal talks about providing translations for partner blogs and articles, partner videos and photos. Does the proposer intend to partner with other blogs to obtain content?
