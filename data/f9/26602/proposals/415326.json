This, of course, addresses the challenge as it fits well in the challenge definition of success (\"A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem\"). Moreover, this is a continuation from a project funded in F7 and proposer does a good job on presenting the overal numbers for this (38 videos recorded and more than half proposals funded). In this sense, it would be nice to bring also here the perceptions of the voters who did watch the videos and how they thought this helped them on clarifying about the proposal. Risk management is well done with 3 challenge well identified and a proper mitigation strategy in place.\nIn addition to the information provided, it wold be also nice to understand how proposer would select the proposals who want to have their videos recorded in case there's more demand for it than the capacity to execute these recordings.

This can be seen as an indirect method for proposers to introduce and explain the idea they presented in the proposal. Thus, the opportunities of getting more votes for their project to be financed are enhanced. If the proposal is completed effectively, it can absolutely attract more viewers and new users to our community. The interviews will be recorded and edited as well as translated to other languages like Vietnamese, Japanese, etc. It impressed me about the creation and innovation in the mindset. It is obvious to observe the impact of the proposal on most of Cardano\u2019s community in plentiful sides such as linguistics, interaction, and marketing and bring Cardano closer to a lot more people outside of the community. The first benefit it brings to Cardano\u2019s community is that people who are in community but non native English speakers can understand the content of each video that is published via plentiful social media platforms as mentioned above since the content is translated into multi-languages. Thereby, avoiding or minimizing the number of people that cannot reach the meaning due to the lack of English. By the way, this program will be a helpful tool for proposers to build a marketing strategy to spread the reputation as well as the project/proposals of Cardano\u2019s community on other platforms. Therefore, Cardano\u2019s community can enhance its profit as a beneficiary. Catalyst\u2019s value will also be raised, and the brand name \u201cCatalyst\u201d is expected to attract more new proposals in most of the later funds as well as be easier for citizens all over the world to identify.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The possibility of the proposal is appreciated by me. Firstly, since this proposal was successful in being the financed proposal at Fund7 in the past, there is a high commitment on the quality of the proposal.

Hence, I quite believe in the capacity of each member in the team. They already have diversity of experience and I do want to see more innovation this time. The proposer has attached the personal information of each member with such amazed experience in those proposals in a lot of previous Funds before. On the other hand,  the duration and timeline for each item in the worksheet is divided as more specific as possible, guaranteeing to finish before the deadline which is set up at the beginning.

I mean the proposer should provide some spotlight for noticing which items are important in the timeline to measure the successful proportion in 100% total of the proposal. On the contrary, a recommendation here is that we need a particular unit as well as a number to estimate how large the size, or how popular as well as the completing progress. The requirement of asking for a specification might be difficult for the proposer to conduct but he/she can take advantage of the previous data and forecast the targeted numbers based on past success.

Proposal is also a trusted partner for non-English or Japanese-speaking proposal writers to easily introduce English and Japanese-speaking voters to the value their proposal will bring. However, during the interview, I think the author should develop different questions to explore all aspects of the proposal rather than a common set of questions for all proposals. However, I consider this proposal to fully meet the conditions required by the challenge, and a 5-star rating is completely appropriate.

Looking at the author's information on linkedin with English language skills, I think the author will help a lot of teams and proposals in Vietnam overcome the language barrier and reach out to large voters. With what the author has done with the portfolio on linkedin and the content in the proposal that the author will do if sponsored. I have full confidence that what the author has put forth in the proposal can be done successfully.\nRegarding the plan, I see that the author is writing not yet detailed.

However, I have yet to see the author suggest the risks that would be encountered in the implementation of the proposal if the proposal was funded by Catalyst. For example, if the youtube channel is hacked and appropriated, what solution will the author have? Risky themes aim to scam by crafting a perfect proposition to attract voters and then take money and not execute. So how does the author have a solution to avoid cooperating with those topics with fraudulent intentions? Identifying those risks will help avoid costly repairs and delay the implementation process.\nFinally, the author should have a video showing the number of successful funding proposals supported by the Cardano Catalyst TV channel after each Fund. As such, the community will see how the results of this proposal impact the development of Catalyst as well as the Cardano ecosystem.

Firstly, technological knowledge is assumed to be hard to acquire, so conveying information relating to technology through video feels much more effective. This form could be a solution to the problem of how to reduce the time needed for conveying technological experience while also creating attraction. Moreover, the video format offers greater space and allows proponents to express their personality and style in presentation than the traditional ways. Secondly, the direct asking-answering form not only properly meets the criteria for the challenge but also overcomes time-consuming problems and maximises efficiency in dealing with queries, especially when reports or proposals are in the worst scenario. In that case, problem-solving requires total coherence among parties that are related, and the direct asking-answering form can afford that. Thirdly, changing the format from reporting to video or expanding to a TV channel is a trend that many successful platforms have previously applied (YouTube, Tiktok) to provide more comprehensive content. If the idea is successful, it not only helps to optimise the Catalyst process, but it also serves as an efficient tool for future marketing. Finally, there will be more opportunities to conquer such a potential market like East Asia if a plan for diversifying languages is launched. As a result, it is simpler to interact with people in foreign countries because messages or information are more effectively communicated through images, videos, and accurate languages than by employing normal translators. Vietnam and Japan are wise moves in the plan. \nGenerally, I will score this criteria 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The use of video to communicate with connected parties on social networks has proven to be effective, so there is no doubt about the proposal's feasibility. On the one hand, I believe that direct question-and-answer videos on various social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and others are more appropriate than traditional posts and comments. It means that the suggestion will reach a larger number of people. Furthermore, skilled and qualified professionals in the education and media sector are responsible for this project, therefore there is a chance that it would not only help develop the Cardano Ecosystem but also increase the ties of the East Asian community. On the other hand, I realise the proposal is still an incomplete picture. The operational costs calculated in the proposal show that the proposals are directly proportional to the number of workers. As a result, when the proposals expand, it will cost a greater number of workers. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that is not consistent with the purposes of technology due to its unproductivity. In my perspective, directly adding the AMA form to the community through chatting in Telegram groups is a possible approach to boost efficiency. The solution's benefit is that it can keep the interaction going while saving time on video editing. Moreover, there is a huge income for us if proponents hire us to make their videos. When creating videos used to describe ideas becoming a service, we gain more advantages from saving time and manpower as well as increasing competitive advantages. Furthermore, if the videos are in high demand, the service could be expanded to include a question and answer section.\nI will score 4 points for the feasibility. I hope that my suggestions could give you some ideas to improve.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Today, it is normal practice to evaluate using indicators such as views, comments, feelings, popularity, and so on. These indications make a great point in that there are now many methods accessible to measure the effectiveness of videos, as well as support to improve transmission performance, so that we can proactively improve the quality by leveraging available models. However, the phenomena of faked channels and indicators that can be faked and spammed by tools may have an impact on the evaluation of the proposal' effectiveness. I believe that adding more indications will make the plan more thorough. To begin, we must assess the percentages of proposals that are approved and funded successfully while using the form, as well as the performance and time savings compared to proposals using the previous form. Secondly, when monitoring community development, it is suggested that tools be added to detect and assist individuals who do not have a fundamental understanding of Catalyst. This is also a great way to develop a new workforce for the Cardano community. Finally, focusing on enhancing and training new users who do not have a basic understanding of blockchain is more important than focusing on aiding individuals who already have a basic knowledge base. To support this goal, a series explaining terms and definitions will bring benefits for new users to catch up with Catalyst.\nIn conclusion, I decide to give this criteria 4 points.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3368", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10933, "q0": "As the Cardano ecosystem grows, more and more people are attracted to the Cardano community. After each fund is launched, the number of proponents and projects increases rapidly. As a result, voters do not have much time to stop to read each proposal in detail. As a result, voters may miss out on good, vote-worthy suggestions. The Cardano Catalyst TV project responds promptly to a need for the Cardano community, briefly summarizing a proposal with a 5- to 8-minute interview that is 3 to 5 minutes longer than Fund7's duration. The summary time for a recommendation is quite reasonable; it helps the voter quickly grasp the content and highlights of the project. When too many proposals are posted, Catalyst TV is the fastest way to reach viewers; videos with concise content and easy-to-understand presentations help the project get viewers and increase votes. Especially the content of the Videos is then translated into many languages; this is also a way to help many people know about your proposal and an effective advertising plan.
