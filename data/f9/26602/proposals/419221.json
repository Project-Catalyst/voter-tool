Gaining trusted and valid information on a crypto ecosystem can be a nuisance. With multitude of information from trusted and unverified sources can be overwhelming for newcomers. Having an all-in-one information center can be helpful to jumpstart their journey for those who are new to the space.  With proper guidance and right information materials, it will make it easier to educate and bring onboard new members from the East Asian communities. However, the proposer did not mention on how to promote this guide to the newcomers. If I am new to crypto and looking for information on Cardano, how will I find your guide? How do you bring traffic to your website? Do you rely on search engine optimization? Having a great information center alone is not enough when people does not know that your guide exist. Please include information on how you will make your guide visible to the newcomers. Another concern is about the translation. Will this guide be in English or there will there be other languages as well such as Korean, Japan, Mongolia, Chinese etc?

Do you need to hire a professional translator to cover languages outside of your expertise?  Provide information on who will make the translation to other languages and which languages will be available on your guide. \nOn the budget section, the proposing team did not elaborate on how much they are spending on language translation. Since this challenge is focusing on East Asian countries, the team needs to translate the information to East Asian countries languages such as Mongolia, Japan, Korea etc. What will be the cost to hire professional translator? Include the details for better clarification on the matter.  \nNext is the execution plan. Pretty straight forward and easy to understand. Its better to include specifically which language that will be available on your website.

Key outcomes include increasing community engagement and involvement as well as reaching a broad spectrum of people from inside and outside of Cardano, particularly helping to onboard more members from Asian countries.

For instance there are a number of cost elements in the budget which are not explained in the implementation plan. An example is \"Research, translation, synthesis, scripts for high-quality content\". THe plan does not mention that translation and research will be carried out and at what stage this will be done.

The proposer is trying to tackle the lack of onboarding resources for people who are new to Cardano by providing guides in the form of videos. Based on what we\u2019re provided, the videos are going to be in Vietnamese. It means that the proposal fits with the challenge setting because it reaches new users from Vietnam specifically. Based on what I observed, there seems to be a huge spike of interest in Vietnam when it comes to Cardano because the number of proposals coming in has grown significantly this fund. Thus, I believe the timing is good for an onboarding guide to exist for the community. The reason why I didn\u2019t give it a 5 star is because the proposal could be improved in scalability and sustainability aspects. Scalability could be increased by providing those video guides with English subtitles, so they are not only targeted for Vietnamese. I understand that it might increase the cost, but since a significant portion of the budget is allocated for video production already, the subtitle budget is easy to add. Sustainability too could be improved. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the proposer appears to intend to deploy the guide to a new website (the proposer needs to clarify whether they intend to deploy it in the same Tadatek domain or not), and while the proposer has requested a year of maintenance, the current plan is not self-sustaining (the proposer still requires funding next year to keep the guide website accessible). It is obviously not ideal for a community onboarding guide to last just a year. Therefore, I would like to see more initiative on making the site stay working. Perhaps they could bring in ads, so at the very least the website could pay for itself. Any other revenue models would be awesome, as long as they are not dependent on Catalyst funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I am inclined to agree with the current implementation plan. I have looked at their profiles, and while none of them seems to have website development experience, I find that they do have a Tadatek website up and running already (so it's either they don\u2019t list their development skills or they outsource it). Whichever it is, there seems to be no problem with the current team members' capabilities outside of that. The budget they requested is broken down based on the number of videos they would produce and the number of hours they spent on each of them, multiplied by their rate, which is already perfect. The proposer has provided the six topics that are going to be explained in the guide, and they have relevant experience to talk about them. For example, one of the members has experience as a SPO, so it's interesting to see his personal input when it comes to sharing about SPO in the guide. The timeline they provided is reasonable; based on my calculation, on average they spent 5 hours each day working on the videos. The proposer has considered the longevity concerns around the guide and offered to regularly update the contents. However, this neat proposal could still be significantly improved by marketing their guide. The proposer has already stated that they would regularly share their results with the Cardano community, but I would argue that this is not the perfect market for their guide. Based on what I observed, the difficulty level seems to be beginner-intermediate. Which means it is not meant for people who have never heard of the word blockchain, nor is it meant for people who are well versed when it comes to POS, staking, SPOs, etc. This doesn\u2019t mean that their approach right now is invalid; it just needs slight tweaking. Perhaps they should share their work with other non-Cardano communities because they might possess blockchain knowledge but not in the Cardano ecosystem. This is far from the only perfect solution, but I would like to hear more about how the proposer views their market segmentation.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The currently provided information is already sufficient for auditing. We could see their milestones within the three-month implementation. The proposer is determining this proposal\u2019s success by the number of guides they made, the number of videos they completed, and the number of projects that were developed because of the guide. The latter part seems hard to track, though, and while the proposer does mention gathering feedback, how they do it is not well explained in the proposal.

Providing the audience with all necessary documentation videos in 1 repository site so that they can become experts in an on-going technology development of Cardano without having to run around gathering pieces of information seems to be a solution.\n\nThe 6 parts of the repository documentations and manuals as planned in the proposal also show that the team behind this proposal understands the major areas of the Cardano ecosystem and my takes here is that there should be more room for updates which will be coming from different and new areas of improvement, such as DApps, DeFi and the algorithm stable coin that soon will be the main topics of discussion in the ecosystem.\n\nNevertheless, what actually the main issue when we are dealing with growing the ecosystem in East Asia, is the language barrier. If the proposed project will only be a one-stop repository for videos which are mostly in English, then it would be just like making a YouTube channel without having it translated to local language.

If this is to grow the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia, we need to be specific in terms of language being used..\n\nRegarding the budget allocated and the set time horizon, there will be 36 videos going to be made within 3 months to cover 6 major parts of the technology of Cardano, yet the team is not conveying verifiable links to show their capabilities, nor their portfolios of previous works. The team, which consists of 3 persons, is only giving not-so-informed personal credentials with small number of Linkedin connections, an uploaded YouTube video taken from a screen recording explaining on how to install a Yoroi wallet on desktop, and a Telegram channel which by no means provide proof to any of the expertise presented in the proposal.
