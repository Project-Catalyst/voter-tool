But what seems to be an extra attraction, is the rewards and contest system. As always, when there's retribution to join a campaign or do any task, people intend to easily participate. What would be the case for this initiative too.\nThe proposers team is formed by people with less experience around the catalyst project, which may be a challenge for them but that may be overcome as they mentioned on the risks section of the proposal.\nThe budget breakdown is detailed and covers essentials items expenses. What would be better to learn more about is the names of universitie(s) targeted to start with this time around and elaborate more about the expansion strategy to others.\nWhat's not clear too is if the resources information materials around the cardano will be created in English or Vietnamese?

And this draft in front of us is not addressing the challenge's expectations in the most appropriate way. The proposer plans to draw more students onto the catalyst PA/VPA assessments through the help of several social media and reward them for successful registration. The proposer fails to explain how exactly, the students who might not have the required expertise to understand the proposals, be taught about all the concepts and technical details to assess. Without a plan to educate them first regarding Cardano, there is no way they could produce quality reviews. The plan laid out by the proposer lacks this very important aspect. With just videos and documentation, and no one to supervise, the number of sub-standard works is bound to increase. Hence, I feel this proposal is not something that is apt for this challenge but might be apt for a challenge such as \"Challenge & scouted for students\" with necessary changes to the issues mentioned above.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer provides a very elaborate plan to achieve their goals, with clear month-by-month milestones. The proposer also provides the readers with a detailed budget breakdown for the requested funds of $5979, which is commendable. However, there are various other areas that I feel the proposal is lacking. One such area would be the roles of each team member and how the distribution of work is done, considering that they are all students. The major doubt lies in the expertise of the team members to pull this together. There are many areas, where an expert might be required such as teaching the new students about Cardano and about the right way of assessing various proposals, and I personally feel this is where the current team members might need some help. And the other major aspect is what is the end goal of this implementation, if this proposal is only a means to introduce new PAs, then I feel it is not justified to fund this proposal, considering a lot of other proposals in this challenge that are targeting to add much superior value to the Chain.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal despite being sub-par in my personal view, I sure have to appreciate the proposer's groundwork on identifying the valid metrics and KPIs to track their work. Quantifiable metrics such as social media group size, number of user engagements, page visits, and also monthly reports regarding the progress of the project are all viable and dependable metrics the auditors could make use of to keep track of the fund's utilization. Eventually, the number of PA and VPA registrations could be the ultimate success metric to evaluate the proposal's success. The target audience being students could actually draw a lot of traffic onto the chain but one thing that the community has to be wary about is the credibility of these students who registers themselves just for the sake of rewards. The proposal is a fairly new one, and also the team involved.

In addition, in order to advertise their primary Facebook group, they will establish\u00a0accounts on several other social networks, such as YouTube, Instagram, and Tiktok, amongst others. In addition to this, they will develop a website that will provide community members with Catalyst-related material that has been compiled\u00a0by them in order to facilitate a quicker onboarding process for Catalyst. In addition to this, they plan to host online sessions in which they will discuss the lessons they have learned while working on Catalyst (writing PA, writing a proposal).

On the side of Cardano, the platform will have more creative and flexible thinking human resources to contribute to the platform's development. In addition, students will have more opportunities to develop additional skills and expand their knowledge when coming to Catalyst. With Cardano and Catalyst growing, students in Vietnam will be looking for opportunities to work or even start a business.

The author's solution is to set up a Facebook community about Catalyst for Vietnamese students. The purpose is to support, exchange information, help students become Catalyst PAs/proposers, and provide updated knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem. This is the 2nd proposal at Fund 9 by a group of 3 students from the University of Transport (Vietnam). Another of their recommendations is for a sports match ticketing app (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418922). Personally, I think the content of the solution is suitable for the goal of the challenge, but it is not different and really stands out. In fact, in Vietnam, there are also a number of active Cardano Facebook communities, attracting from a few thousand to tens of thousands of members: In which, there are large communities such as: Cardano ADA Vietnam Community, Cardano ADA Vietnam\u2026 Although they are not specialized in Catalyst, the information they provide about Cardano is up-to-date and diverse. On the Telegram and Youtube platforms, some specialized Catalyst communities for Vietnamese are also active. Prominent among them are @The2MinReview, @TIGERViewVN, @StakingADA, Fimi Financial Channel\u2026 Personally, I think Vietnamese students can fully participate in these communities. Because they have a ready-to-use system of information, documentation, and knowledge about Catalyst. This will involve one of the risks of the solution which is competition with other Catalyst community groups in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the authors are students who do not have much experience working with Catalyst to advise the community.

The proposal provides a very complete set of metrics that can measure success for each implementation work. Here we have KPIs to understand if the project is to achieve what it intended. However, some indicators are quite modest in my opinion. For example, the minimum number of members in the Facebook Group is 30 people, 300 views on Youtube and Tiktok, and 120 website visits. I don't know if the number of web visits is calculated by day/week or month. Similarly, video views across platforms are calculated for each video or the total number of channel views. Only 30 members join the Facebook group \u2013 this number in my opinion is quite small compared to the group's potential to reach hundreds of students.

When I read the proposal of Catalyst for Students in Vietnam, I found it to be a perfect fit for the challenge Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano when it solved the problem of the challenge, which is to raise the awareness level of the people in Vietnam and East Asia about the Cardano blockchain and network, thereby creating a community to develop the Cardano ecosystem here.\nAccording to figures based on Finder's crypto adoption index for 2021, for 42,000 people across 27 countries, Vietnam surpasses 26 countries to lead in terms of crypto users. From this information, it can be seen that the cryptocurrency market in Vietnam is being interested by many people, including students. However, with such a large blockchain market and a lot of knowledge, Cardano is still a new field and not many students know about it.\nI found the proposal to emphasize the purpose of creating a community to provide and exchange information about Catalyst on facebook for Vietnamese students. The project goes deep and revolves around Catalyst like (steps to becoming a PA-vPA, how to write and submit proposals to Catalyst, some Cardano knowledge). From here will develop a large living community in Vietnam that loves the Cardano ecosystem.\nI completely agree with the argument, the solution to the challenge in the author's proposal. As someone who is living and working in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, I realize that the current state of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Vietnam is a very developing market, especially in recent years. Recently, the percentage of students who learn about information and participate in the market is increasing. I myself have participated in a few Cardano community groups, but I find the Cardano community for students to be small and limited. I hope, this is a concern that needs to be promoted by the Cardano community for the development of our ecosystem in Vietnam.\nI will give this proposal 4 points because it has solved the challenge posed, the author of the proposal is very young, although knowledge about blockchain, about cardano and about social experience is still limited but with I, this proposal has been presented, planned, fully argued, detailed. I highly commend the author team, this shows that they have put a lot of time, effort, and dedication into the proposal, they have the ambition to develop this proposal to be more extensive and developed.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project has provided the community with a very detailed and specific roadmap and plan.

Whether a project is successful or not, the first thing you should look at is their planning board.\nFrom many years of experience working in the planning and budgeting field at a leading corporation in Vietnam, I see that the proposed funding amount is $5979, accounting for 2.3% of the total budget of the challenge very reasonable number for this project. Similar to the project's plan, the budget allocation is also built very well, the budget has been divided in accordance with each item, the expenses are reasonable and necessary.\nThe proposal also foresees 4 big risks with specific content: many people are not students but still participate in the community, ADA market price fluctuates, not reaching the number of members in the group as set out goals and limited experience of individuals in the group. I find the solutions to deal with these risks that the authors have given to be very clear and necessary.\nThe current group of authors are all 3rd year students but have had a long time involved in researching and researching about Catalyst, I have read their personal information publicly, viewed some of their products to see that they are really good students in our country. I fully believe that if this proposal is funded, they will do well and have ambitions to go further in the next funds of the Cardano ecosystem.\nI will give the feasibility of this proposal 5 points because the information given by the author team has made me very satisfied.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In general, with the analysis and personal comments I mentioned in the previous sections, I see this project as a good audit project.

With 7 indicators to say the success of the project is a number I consider very positive for this project. When this project is successful, I think it will give the student community in Vietnam who love Cardano a new playground, a place to learn and exchange knowledge about catalysts, about the Cardano community and more.\nThis is a new project that has never been participated in before, I hope it will be funded at this fund 9 and the success indicators of the project will increase many times in the report of fund 10.

In the event that you are able to mention such factors, the student community will have a greater degree of trust and support for you. Despite that, I will still award 5 points for this impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Putting together your proposal will take you five months, after which you can still submit an application for funding in the following fund. I believe that the goal that your community will have fifty members after five months is attainable, and I also believe that this is a really reasonable number that is not difficult to achieve. It is clear, based on the preparation and planning that you put into the proposal, that you have given this endeavor a lot of attention and care. Your team is made up of three people, two of whom are students in their third year (which makes you very young), and neither of you has any accomplishments to speak of, nor have you mentioned that you have come to Blockchain with Cardano at any point in time. But that's only a small portion of it; you're still learning, and I suggest that you find someone who has extensive knowledge of the Cardano ecosystem for guidance and follow-up. That's all there is to it. They are soon to be successful and able to gain a lot of insight from those who came before them. The price of $6,500 is a reasonable amount; it's not very much, and I hope that the community will be able to assist you in some way, so that the remaining students will have the opportunity to learn more about Cardano. The feasibility receives four points from me.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You mentioned that the measurement of the project's progress will be aggregated on Github and the Facebook page that you will set up in order to attract students. These two platforms will be used. I concur with you that if the project is successful, then a large number of students will be able to do PA, vPA, and Proposer, and possibly even serve as a standard model for other educational institutions. You mentioned earlier that there will be approximately 50 students participating in the community as a means of measuring the success of your project; however, in my opinion, each month is accompanied by a development path that should be used instead. In order to develop your project, you should compile a list of numbers, such as the following: the number of people who follow the page after one month; the number of people who interact on other channels; the number that is closest to that; the number after two months; the number after three months; the number after four months; and finally, what it will be like. In the end, however, I also sincerely hope that your project will be a success and will receive funding. As a result, I will award this auditability with four points.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3497", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13387, "q0": "The solution to provide and exchange information about Catalyst is not new in Vietnam, but connecting via the Facebook platform is a seemingly simple thing, but this is the first time I see it in this Catalyst, your group includes 3 members are information technology students, so I see that you have boldly written proposals, and this proposal is of course perfectly suitable for the challenge.\nIn Vietnam there is a proverb: \"h\u1ecdc th\u1ea7y kh\u00f4ng t\u00e0y h\u1ecdc b\u1ea1n\" so creating a level playing field between students and you instructing them on participating in Catalyst to act as a proposal evaluator (PA) ), becoming a veteran proposal reviewer (vPA), how to write and submit proposals to Catalyst and share Cardano knowledge is extremely practical contributions to the expansion of the Cardano network in Vietnam and the main goal As enthusiastic young students, I look forward to seeing your project funded.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "You guys have a detailed and specific roadmap for your action plan for more than 4 months, in each month there are specific small jobs, which I see the 2nd month is you creating websites, This shows the seriousness in executing the project.\nI see you write in the proposal to do Front-End and Back-end interface, then I think you are programming to build a Website from a certain language such as PHP and using JavaScrip, HTML, CSS will be very complicated and time-consuming, I have a small suggestion as to why you don't try to build a Website on WordPress platform, I find it very easy to build and develop, I personally have some blogs on this platform, so from my little experience you just need to:\n - Buy a domain name at namesilo, the cost is very cheap, only about $ 10 / domain name\n - Buy hosting to store data at azdigi, this is a company in Vietnam that has a pretty good server service, the cost is also quite attractive.\n - Buy more themes for the web if needed, install SSL and just install other necessary plugins, you have a website running smoothly\nAnd with information technology experience like 3rd-year students, creating a website probably only takes 2-3 days or faster.\nThe costs have been broken down by you and it sounds reasonable with the work items as well as the reward for the members participating in the game", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal of yours is not heavy on technical factors, so there are not many barriers, and the information provided as well as the KPIs is enough to evaluate the success of the proposal.\nI wish you success and increasingly expand your model to all universities in Vietnam if possible, it can be a fresh wave for young people who are passionate about technology and especially blockchain as well as the path that Cardano's Catalyst has led you.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3616", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Our solution is to create a community with one purpose: to provide and exchange information about Catalyst based on Facebook's main platform for Vietnamese students.", "experience": "The team of 3 third-year students, majoring in information technology, at the University of Transport.
