Therefore, it is paramount that language does not deter people from being involved within NFT projects.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 3.666666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3663, "q0": "Voters, this proposal basically consists of offering translation services of CNFT projects from English to Chinese to increase the reach of these contents among Chinese people. The impact of the proposal tends to be great due to the large number of Chinese speakers (1.3 billion) that can be reached by the contents and get to know the crypto world better. This is a great need of this campaign \u2013 to integrate East Asia into the crypto world and Cardano. Proponents understand the challenges involved in the work of translating content, especially when thinking about the particularities of each language and its own jargon. However, they make it clear that they will mitigate these challenges by providing translations that are reliable and that respect the interpretation needs of each language, in addition to reviewing the translations to ensure a high level of quality. Finally, the proposal could be the beginning of an interesting and relevant project for the entire ecosystem, given the potential to scale future challenges and bring knowledge about blockchain and Cardano to more and more people in East Asia.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proponents explain the formation of the team using each member's professional experiences and backgrounds. The team is made up of programmers, marketing specialists, game designers, project coordinators, among others. In addition to these members, the proponents clarify that translators will also be hired to form the team. The team formation makes sense for the type of project that is presented and is proven from the exposed links and experiences. In addition, the team explains the proposal plan clearly, using a quarterly breakdown roadmap to show the milestones it intends to achieve. The budget could have been better explained by showing how much of the requested funding would go to each activity or member. Despite this, in general, the lack of this explanation does not harm the proposal, since the budget is low and will partly depend on the number of proposals that are contracted. Finally, the team states that it will need to apply for future funds and this makes me a little concerned about the sustainability of the project, bringing to the surface an important question: how will the project generate financial resources to continue happening in the medium term? Will the translations be paid for by the people who request them? I believe this point needs a little more attention. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal presents satisfactory metrics and KPIs so that the community and the team can audit the progress and success of this project. In addition, the team also points to the idea of \u200b\u200busing surveys and polls to understand whether users of its services are engaged. These metrics would be exposed to the community quickly or even in real time. The roadmap and milestones presented are clear, understandable and make complete sense for the type of proposal presented. And as stated earlier, the proponents considered the risks and challenges they may encounter throughout this project, especially regarding the difficulties of translations and particularities between languages. In this sense, they also pointed out ways of managing these challenges and mitigating the risks, preventing them from becoming problems for achieving the steps and achieving success. Finally, the definition of success for this proposal is to bring people from the Chinese community to form teams that promote the growth of our ecosystem, which strongly corresponds to the need and objective of this campaign.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2466", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5631, "q0": "I believe the problem described in this proposal is aligned with the challenge. As a person from a Chinese educated background, this is a problem I can identify with as English is the primary language of the CNFT community. This poses a significant obstacle for the Chinese-speaking communities who are keen on participating in  CNFT. Due to the language barrier, they are bound to be discouraged as they find it troubling to engage with the English-dominant CNFT ecosystem. Based on my observation in the space, despite valiant effort from most projects by including Chinese chat channels for Chinese users, such channels are still not sufficient to remedy the supposed language barrier due to low engagement in these channels. \n\nTherefore, the proposal\u2019s suggestion of providing Chinese-English translation would be a great addition to the Cardano ecosystem as it is a step towards greater inclusivity and mass adoption for Cardano in East Asia. \n\nHowever, I think there\u2019s more to be done on top of translation services. Translation services in itself yield solely translated content. They do not constitute marketing channels which primary function for this instance is to expose Chinese users to these content through social media and other mediums. It is worth noting that Chinese users do not share similar beliefs, lifestyles and cultures with its Western counterpart. In the absence of proper marketing catered for Chinese users, these translated content will not be as effective as anticipated. Hence, if the proposal is funded, I recommend the team to provide a more holistic solution consisting of translation and marketing for CNFT projects looking to tap into the Chinese market in East Asia. This is unless the team plans to engage with another party for marketing efforts catered for the Chinese community. Should they plan to do so, it should have been stated in the proposal for clarity.  \n\nI believe this proposal has great potential. Its key metrics and goals are aligned with the outlined challenge settings. However, to truly achieve what it\u2019s set to accomplish, it has to address the marketing aspect of its operations to truly increase East Asian participation in the Cardano ecosystem. \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal outlines each team member\u2019s experience to provide us a glimpse of their expertises. But, what I found to be lacking is how these job experiences can be related to the Cardano ecosystem. What I found confusing is the overall team\u2019s capabilities are more geared towards game development and game art. I am unable to comprehend how experience in game development can aid in translation services. Sure, all-things graphic and game are integral in most CNFTs in their present stage, But, there is a lack of members (only one member) experienced in marketing and translation, especially for the cryptocurrency space. In short, the team suffers from skills mismatch. Given the team does not have any Chinese translator present (as per proposal), more specifics on Chinese translators must be provided. For instance, how many Chinese translators will be hired? What are the criteria of hiring a translator? Considering translation requires the use of proper language and correct terminologies, a professional translator is crucial in determining the accuracy of translated content. This indicates a lack of a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. \n\nAs CNFT Alliance is a brand-new project, there is no evidence of a track record. There is no proof indicating a reliable team. \n\nWith regards to budget, I find it confusing that the requested fund will be 100% allocated for Chinese translation only. Assuming it is a translation service, there is always a need for further operation costs such as payment for other staff, website development/hosting, marketing and more. I would suggest the team to evaluate budget breakdown more thoroughly. \n\nAs the proposal does not possess complicated technical processes, the timeline is fairly direct and achievable. Assuming this proposal does intend to focus on only translation services, it is only appropriate to describe its timeline in terms of acquiring Chinese translators and numbers of translated projects. This indicates a lack of a sensible and conductible plan for implementation. \n\nThe prosper has identified only monetary issues as the challenge preventing a successful implementation. For a translation service, I believe there is always more than monetary issues that prevent successful implementations. From my experience working in a multicultural environment where the use of multiple languages in job documentation is required, factors such as capabilities of translator to translate accurately and in an intended language/form do determine the success of a project. In this respect, the proposer does not account for that. \n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal establishes a very general overview of measurements (KPIs). It does not establish KPIs that can monitor its progress and success objectively. Specifically, there is a lack of quantitative benchmark. What is the targeted number of users of CNFT Alliance\u2019s translation services, number of projects CNFT Alliance serves and targeted number of users CNFT Alliance has helped onboard after mitigating language differences? What\u2019s given is somewhat obvious and vague. As not everyone is familiar with the size of the Chinese community in CNFT and various Crypto ecosystems, these somewhat vague benchmarks prevent auditability by the Catalyst community. Without being able to objectively track the effectiveness of the proposal, we will not be able to ascertain its usefulness to the Cardano community. \n\nThe established benchmarks are fairly direct, so, I agree with the benchmarks being easy to track and obtain through surveys and polls, which makes reporting fairly simple. But, what\u2019s missing from the proposal is frequency of reporting to the Catalyst community. Would it be on a monthly/quarterly/annual basis? What further confuses me is the mention of information that can be obtained quickly and real-time. How will this be done? It is technically impossible to provide information in real-time if metrics are obtained through surveys and polls. \n\nTo conclude, I do not think this proposal is easily auditable due to the lack of quantitative metrics. Besides, there\u2019s no mention of how reporting will be done. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2729", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This assessment appears to be slightly biased. This proposal is focusing on one aspect of the CNFT Alliance, which is to engage more Chinese users to the CNFT community. Hence, the requested amount is intended to be fully applied to the Chinese language services. The other costs, such as staff maintenance, are not within the scope of this proposal. We are focusing on translation for this proposal in order to bring in more members from the Chinese Community, and we didn't cover marketing in this proposal as we would be seeking that out once we have the alliance up and running and the legalities between projects taken care of.\n\nAs for the concern that \"Chinese users do not share similar beliefs, lifestyles and cultures with its Western counterpart\", we have stated clearly in the proposal that we understand the intricacy of language differences that lie beyond literal interpretation. The accessor seems to be assuming that only Western team members will be involved in the translation process, and that the translation services will neglect the subtlety between languages. It is of paramount importance to us that the services provided by us will enhance the understanding and engagement of the CNFT ecosystem for the Chinese community.
