I propose organizing activities to connect, motivate, and support students to participate in Catalyst. A problem-solving challenge Solving one aspect of the challenge is \"How to promote the development of the Cardano community in Vietnam\u2014a country in Asia.\" The proposal can be expanded in terms of audience and region. In the future, the proposal will provide the community with a blockchain knowledge base, creativity, and many ideas to build good proposals to help diversify the Cardano ecosystem. They will organize online events and work on the Cardano and Catalyst projects for students. Specifically, they target information technology students at universities and colleges in Vietnam. It is suggested that students have a lot of good and creative ideas but often face challenges in project writing and mobilization. capital. I agree with their argument because students are knowledgeable in information technology and can easily learn new skills if properly trained and guided. They will contribute to many good projects in the future. Besides, having support from highly qualified lecturers will help complete the projects. This is the sustainable value that this proposal brings. The proposal suggested that they should tackle the challenge of growing the Cardano ecosystem in an inclusive and supportive way and attracted many students to submit ideas to implement the proposals. I agree with their risk management and how they describe the solution. However, this is a proposal to focus on developing the Cardano community in Vietnam, not Asia, so there is no absolute score yet. Hopefully, this will spur the team to continue innovating, optimizing the offer, and expanding across Asia.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "They planned the implementation of the proposal. It is proposed to define a total implementation time of 5 months, with a specific work plan for each timeline. The timeline they give is reasonable; the work is planned specifically and fully. Notable for their objectives: At least 24 events will be held at the university; about 1000 people attended the event; we will conduct at least 06 surveys; at least 20 proposals will be sent to the idea list at the end of the project; 150 students attended seminars and sharing sessions; and there are 40 sessions dedicated to 1-1 support. These are big and smart goals. These KPIs, along with photos and videos of the event and other materials, will be published on the website: cardano2vn.io. At the same time, they will provide monthly reports on GitHub (https://github.com/cardano2vn) to the community. The fundraising budget accounts for more than 13% of the total challenge. Regarding the budget, the budget has a detailed spending plan for the following items: Event Facility Cost; Events Hosting; Guest Fees; Surveys and Reports; Dedicate people to support; Incentives for the student who has submitted a qualified proposal to IdeaScale; Project Management; and Budget for Marketing. However, there is no additional budget option. Besides, it is proposed to organize eight events/universities. But almost all events are held on-site. Instead, it is possible to organize an on-site event for initial marketing, and then organize online events so that all students of the schools can follow together, reducing the cost of event facilities, event hosting, and guest fees and attracting many more, not just students of previous colleges/universities. About the group: The group consists of 5 members. Although there is no assignment of tasks for each member, the experience of the members is consistent with the tasks in the proposed implementation plan. Praise for the proposal because their team has 3/5 members who are computer science researchers, lecturers, and deans of information technology at some prestigious universities in Vietnam. It proves that they are ready to start and operate the project and have a network of connections to universities and colleges in Vietnam. The community can easily verify their identity via LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook and the members all have qualifications. I rate the absolute score for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They defined success. The proposal has indicators of project success, such as: at least 24 events will be held at universities; about 1000 people attended the event; At least 06 surveys; at least 20 proposals will be sent to the idea list at the end of the project; 150 students attended seminars and sharing sessions; and there are 40 sessions dedicated to 1-1 support. The results can be easily checked; they will be publicly announced in terms of quantity (in their monthly report at https://github.com/cardano2vn) and quality (via grant proposals in the future, possibly Fund 10). When the project ended, about 1000 students from 3 universities became aware of the Cardano blockchain, which Catalyst's funding model relies on. At least 20 projects will be submitted to the idea round, many of which will be funded and put into operation. Furthermore, students can join Catalyst in a variety of roles, such as: proponent, PA, vPA, challenge team, and voter. They will experience the new reality of a DAO model. Students are the potential workforce for the Cardano blockchain. They will diversify the ecosystem and ensure the sustainability of the platform. The success of the proposal has a positive impact on Challenge and Cardano. This project will bring knowledge, job opportunities, and opportunities to realize good ideas to help develop the Vietnam Cardano community in particular, the global Cardano community in general, and contribute to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. Thai Cardano This is a follow-up proposal from a previously funded project in Foundation 7: Catalyst Events for Vietnam Students. They had their first project funded and the results were quite successful. However, the website: https://github.com/cardano2vn does not update the project's progress and results as described. This is remarkable. The community highly cares about transparency, but they haven't done it yet.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3950", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 14086, "q0": "We think the idea is very good and necessary, and theoretically fits the purpose of this challenge.\n\nStudents are the right target to support the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal is to hold a face-to-face meeting with Vietnamese students. The aim is to promote Cardano, give lectures on blockchain and its technology, thus enabling them to be interested as students who are directly related to this technology. This proposal also aims to make students active and interested in owning ADA/ Cardano on the blockchain.\n\nIn essence, a proposal like this generates a lot of knowledge about cardano which will eventually give birth to active participants in the catalyst. It will be great to have an impact, as it will see the results in practice (where new members join, people who earn extra income to work at Catalyst, produce technology students who specialize in our most used programming language, developers who learn about smart contracts, etc).\n\nwe can imagine how this event would happen in practice. However, this proposal does not explain how educators will deliver Cardano material, so that these students are lured into participating in the project and staying in class.\n\nwe believe in the potential of this idea. It would be optimal if the explanation was more in-depth.\n\nAs another consideration, this proposal is a continuation of the previously funded project in Fund 7 and a long-term plan has been made, this proposal is the second phase.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no problem with the feasibility of the project. The proposal can still be improved in several aspects, by providing more detailed explanations. Among others are:\n- we can know in general what will be covered in each month of the project, because the proposer explains what will be done in several cycles of the 3-monthly period. However, it would be better if the activities that will be carried out per week are also detailed.\n- the proposal should explain whether the university/student is being charged for participating in the event.\n- Explain the approximate number of students attending each class.\n- More detailed time division. We think it's important to set a detailed schedule with dates.\n- Who will do what and what will be the responsibility (committee structure). It would be better if the tasks/parts of each team at this event were determined (person in charge, chief executive, treasurer, secretary, marketing, publication and documentation, correspondence, proposals, accountability reports, archiving files and so on). The proposer writes that he will add team members, this will be good if it is supported by a sufficient number of teams and must be determined at the beginning because considering this is a continuation of the previously funded project in Fund 7, so that the preparation is more mature than the previous proposal.\n- What topics will be discussed along with the timeline. It is better if the team prepares/sets the curriculum (teaching materials).\n- What kind of publicity/Marketing will be used.\n\nTalking about the budget, the amount demanded is worth the investment compared to how the project will benefit Vietnam and Cardano. This proposal is the second phase of the continuation of the previously funded project in Fund 7.\n\nIn the Fund 7 proposal, the Proponent explains that this student face-to-face event is held at 2 universities with a target number of participants of approximately 500 students with a total of 12 meetings (6 events per university), with the hope that students who take part in the event will submit 12 proposals on the Project Catalyst (Ideascale) as a result of holding the event.\n\nThe proposer plans on Fund9 to expand the coverage from 2 universities to 3 universities and increase the number of events by 8 events per university. So that the total number of events held was 24. According to our calculations, from the estimated target participants this time around 1000 students, it is expected that students / participants will submit 24 proposals on project catalyst (ideascale). It's better if the details of event expenses are more detailed. Other detailed details are:\n- We recommend that the cost of event facilities be detailed in more detail. How much is the room rental fee, transportation costs, material/booklets, zoom licenses, costs for drinking water, all of which are detailed separately, making it easier for us to assess the reasonableness of the fees mentioned. We think banners should be included in the cost of marketing.\n- The cost of organizing the event is also the part that gets the second largest portion of the total cost, because it requires a large amount of money, it is better if the details must be in more detail. For example, how many presenters work and how much is the salary of the presenters, making it easier for us to judge the reasonableness of the fees mentioned. In the budget breakdown in this section, the proposer writes \"\"4 hours for preparation\"\", does it mean that the proposer pays an honorarium for the preparation time for the material giver before presenting the material in class? Shouldn't the presenter only be paid the honorarium for the time given in class when giving the material? It would be better if you reduce a little percentage of costs in this section, then add a percentage in other costs (marketing). Please provide further explanation regarding this.\n- The part of \"\"Cost of survey design and survey data analysis, sharing findings.\"\"is interesting. It should be detailed in more detail per section, and also explain how many people are involved in it. So that we can judge also the reasonableness of the stated costs.\n- Budget employs people to support the proposal, getting the largest portion of the total cost. So get special attention. Why does this proposal only explain 20 proposals that will be submitted to ideascale, while our count should be 24 proposals. It should be explained how much energy is needed to support the proposal, because it should already be seen how much the real amount should be in this section, from the activities that have been funded in fund 7.\n- Incentives for students who have proposals that meet the requirements to achieve IdeaScale, it is explained that there are 20 proposals that students will submit to ideascale. According to our calculations, as explained in the previous point, that the number of proposals submitted from students should be 24. It is better to explain this.\n- Project management costs should be detailed in more detail. What is included in this fee.\n- Detailed breakdown of Marketing / publicity costs. What kind of marketing will be used (for example: stickers, pamphlets, the cost of washing brochures, banner fees, certificates, invitations, social media, etc.) . The percentage of the marketing budget is 6% of the total, if needed it can be added by reducing another percentage of costs, because the idea is to expand cardano. Determine the strategy carefully so that the marketing costs you spend are effective and on target.\n\nWe think need to bring in the professionals hired for this project so that students have more curiosity / interest in Cardano.\n\nAnd in terms of the team, we think this section is very good, they seem to be very qualified people and very involved with Cardano. The proposer attached CV of team members. Relevant skills and experience of team members are provided through LinkedIn profiles.\n\nHowever, we think it would be better if the duties and responsibilities of each team member were explained throughout the project outline.\n\nFor complete eligibility, we suggest that the proposer consider my suggestion and elaborate further on this part of the proposal, considering that this proposal is a continuation of the previous Fund. So if this project is still ongoing, the contents of the next proposal will be more convincing.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal is a continuation of the previously funded project in Fund7 (FP7). We have also confirmed the Fund 7 proposal from the link the proposer has attached to this proposal. Proposal 7 has been funded (phase 1) and the event/activity was already and still ongoing at the time this proposal for Fund9 was submitted. \n\nIn Phase 1 of FP7, the proposer focuses on face-to-face meetings with students to introduce blockchain, learn about the Cardano blockchain platform and Catalyst. The proposer will also support the students to implement their project. In FP7 we can get an idea of \u200b\u200bhow to audit the process, because in Fund 7 proposal, the proposer will provide very detailed information on how this monitoring can be carried out over time. The way they describe audit capabilities, it's as if they've outlined everything so that the Cardano community has sufficient grounding in terms of monitoring activities and processes. The proposer talks about the success scenario, we get numerical indicators to understand if the project achieves what is expected.\n\nIn FP7, the proposer also makes us believe that we will get direct feedback from the students involved in the class. The proposer explained that there would be feedback in the form of 12 project proposals on ideascale from the students involved, however we have not been able to see information about the points we mentioned above.\n\nF7 proposal is already funded and attached to GitHub, but we couldn't find any auditable information.\nThis F9 proposal is still related to the F7 proposal activity/event and has also attached GitHub. However, we again could not find any information to audit. We only found website in Vietnamese only, and the website is not translatable by Google Translate. It would be proper to have reports in English for proposals proposed in English, as the Project Catalyst is global and using the international language.\n\nIn other words, if the F9 and F7 proposals are the same, then F9 has a risk of not being audited.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3899", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10577, "q0": "\u201cCatalyst Events 4 Vietnam Students\u201d is a very good and meaningful idea, it has met the challenge \u201cGrow East Asia, Grow Cardano\u201d. This proposal raises an important problem: \u201cMany Vietnam University students are unaware of Project Catalyst's funding campaigns and the opportunities which are existing.\u201d I agree this proposal. According to Topdev's report, Vietnam will be the destination of many large corporations because of its abundant resources. I completely agree with this opinion because every year Vietnam has thousands of IT graduates, they are all young and creative people who are potential human resources in the future. However, many students today do not have much access to Catalyst because they do not have a guide or orientation. Therefore, this proposal, if implemented, will have a great impact and influence on the community, bringing Project Catalyst closer to everyone. In fact, many IT students want to start a business, they already have an idea but have difficulty in presenting and planning, and in raising capital. Therefore, if this project is implemented, it will bring a lot of benefits, firstly, it will help students to quickly receive funding for their proposals and projects. The second is to help diversify the Cardano ecosystem and increase the influence and popularity of the ecosystem in the community. Here, the proponent has clearly defined his target audience as lecturers and students, and also planned the implementation. They will provide background on the Cardano blockchain, introduce the programming language, and share opportunities in Project Catalyst and how to get involved. They also assist students in project implementation and management. I can see that the proponent is very enthusiastic. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified most of the problems of the challenge. They brought up the current state of affairs to emphasize the impact of the problem. To successfully implement the project, the proponent has also foreseen the risks and they also have a plan to deal with them to limit those risks. I find the proposal very meaningful and necessary. I am new to Project Catalyst and Cardano, after researching, I found this is a very potential ecosystem and has more and more practical applications in life. The access to Project Catalyst and Cardano opened up more opportunities for me, I feel a bit sorry for not being oriented and knowing Cardano sooner. Therefore, This proposal is successful, it will expand the target audience, even more, not only students and lecturers but also new people from other professions and fields.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal has a very clear and specific roadmap. The proponent has divided it into important milestones, namely lasting for 4 months. However, this section is mistaken that the timeline is the First month, 2nd month, Third month, and Fifth month (omission of the 4th month). Each of these stages has clearly defined tasks, goals, and specific action plans. The content is presented in a logical order, including university selection, referrals, and opportunities sharing, followed by survey analysis, assisting newcomers to create their projects, then accompanying them in writing, submitting ideas, and applying for funding on Catalyst. I see a lot of work to be done, but the proponent has also come up with a plan to manage that workload. With careful preparation like this, I find that controlling progress and quality will be very easy and effective. Regarding the project's budget, the proponent also pointed out how to allocate and use each part of the budget very specifically and reasonably. Costs are calculated in detail for each event and per working hour. This detailed planning will help the team easily evaluate the efficiency of capital use and avoid wasting costs. In this part, I only have a small opinion that if possible, the team recommends that a small part be used to set up a risk reserve fund because in order to build and develop a project, despite careful preparation, It is also not possible to avoid unexpected risky situations that require additional costs to offset, which will help the team resolve quickly and flexibly. In case, this risk reserve fund is not needed, it can be used to create a reward fund for individuals who complete tasks or for students with creative projects and ideas, excellent, and useful to the community to encourage and engage their active participation. About the team involved there are 5 members, they are all experienced and accomplished in their field. Their personal information is also presented through such media as LinkedIn, Twitter, Telegram, and Facebook. These are all very popular social networks and are easy to access and search, making it easy for the community to evaluate information and learn about members. In addition, the proponent also recruits more team members at the universities they have chosen, I think this is good and necessary because these people will know and understand the needs and requirements psychology of the students, which is of great help in identifying appropriate and effective solutions to meet those needs.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to measure the progress of the project, the proponent has given criteria. Each of those criteria is expressed through KPIs with very specific data: number of events organized, number of event participants, number of proposals raised to scale ideas from universities,... In addition, these KPIs along with images/videos and documents are published on their website Cardano2vn.io and provide monthly reports on Github https://github.com/cardano2vn. Thereby, the auditability of this project is relatively high. The success of the project is also clearly defined and specifically, by the end of the project, there will be more than 1000 students from 3 universities of their choice known to the Cardano blockchain, there are dozens of projects submitted to IdeaScale, and many projects were funded and put into operation. At the same time, students will have many opportunities to participate in the catalyst. I think this will help students expand their communication relationships, and have more different opportunities to start a business. This proposal is really good and has a positive impact on the development of society. This is a continuation of a project that was funded in Fund 7 and it also involves two other proposals in Fund 9. I find that the experience and resources built up in the previous fund will be a beneficial substitute for this fund, increasing the probability of the project's success.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3190", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11800, "q0": "I find the proposal of Catalyst Events 4 Vietnam Students perfectly suitable for the challenge of Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano when targeting students as the target audience to solve the problems posed by the challenge which is developing the ecosystem Cardano in East Asia in a holistic way by increasing public awareness of the Cardano blockchain and network, providing funding to those who have learned about Cardano to leverage community support to build or use using the Cardano network.\nThe uniqueness and prominence of the proposal when the author team organizes virtual or on-site sharing events about the Cardano and Catalyst projects for students. Connect, motivate and support students participating in Catalyst. I completely agree with the team's solution argument that this proposal is intended to reach out to faculty and students to raise awareness of Cardano and the opportunities in the Catalyst project.\nAs a Vietnamese citizen, I am very proud that my country is currently one of the world's leading countries in the field of blockchain as shared by many Vietnamese experts and technologists at the Binance Blockchain Week event from March 27 to 30, 2022 in Dubai - the city of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). I see that in a country with a rapid development of electronic money, the author's team transmits and spreads more useful and official knowledge and information about blockchain to Vietnamese students is a smart and right choice. In my personal opinion, this age is a golden age to start for new knowledge, experiences and challenges for each person. The current situation in Vietnam is that the number of students knowing and accessing the blockchain market is not much, or knowing the market, but with a lot of unofficial and unclear information. Overall, I find the organization of virtual or on-site events, thereby introducing knowledge about blockchain projects specifically Cardano and Catalyst projects to students, is a concern that needs to be promoted by the Cardano community to support them to become active participants in Catalyst with different roles like proponent, PA, vPA, challenger, voter.\nI give this recommendation a 4 for impact because of my comments I rate it pretty well.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think this proposal takes 5 months to implement is reasonable, the author's team has given the specific time by the month, the corresponding tasks that need to be done are also clear. It is clear that the plan and implementation of the plan have been well laid out by the team members, I can see the seriousness in the high-intensity plan when they have shared with the community how they manage and divide the work for each member.\nIn the estimate table of the proposal I found that the authors did a very detailed and reasonable job. The proposed budget of $33404, represents 13.3% of the total grant budget for the Grow East Asia challenge, Grow Cardano is suitable. Since this is a continuation of the proposal approved at Fund 7 before, I believe that the authors have had a lot of experience in balancing the budget of the proposal at Fund 9 close to reality to optimize the most budget to convince the funding from the Catalyst fund.\nThe risk of the proposal was also foreseen by the authors that they might have to organize more events than planned to attract more students to participate and submit more proposals after having data from the events within 2 months. However, I have not seen a convincing solution from the authors for this risk because I see that after 2 months of organizing the event, if the evaluation results are not good, then the authors need to come up with some recommendations, what specific measures to improve at the next event, avoiding wasted budget and inefficient use of resources.\nThe team that made the proposal are people I see as perfectly capable of doing this project. In Vietnam, they are people with names and voices in certain community groups, they have knowledge, education, expertise, skills, and experience working at reputable agencies and units whose identities can be fully learned through mass media channels. I see a lot of the links their community provides such as youtube, facebook, telegram, email, linkedin or twitter...\nI give this part 4 points because I am not really satisfied in the risk assessment of the proposed group.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Obviously, with the plan and budget given by the proposal team, I fully believe the project can be audited when there is more commitment from the author team to commit to internal transparency and With the community, share all project activities and costs in \"https://github.com/cardano2vn\" when the project is funded. This will help the community to monitor the progress and success of the project continuously and closely. For me, this is very very necessary and important, it needs to be done every month for all projects especially for big budget and long implementation projects. It not only helps the project team understand the progress of the implementation of the plan, the use of the budget, but also helps them to review what has been done and not done, from which to draw lessons, experience to adjust the project in the right direction and achieve the expected results as set out.\nI find the KPI of the project given is very clear with specific targets and milestones that are at least 24 events that will be held at universities, an estimated 1000 event participants, at least 06 surveys, at least 20 proposals will be sent to the idea list at the end of the project, 150 students attend workshops and sharing sessions and 40 dedicated sessions for one-on-one support. I consider these to be promising numbers that bring very successful results to this project. With the success of the project from the previous fund and the proposed plan in this fund 9, I very much hope the project continues to be funded, from which there will be a lot of projects submitted to the idea round and into the market work. Furthermore, students can join the Catalyst ecosystem in a variety of roles, which will diversify the ecosystem and sustainably develop the platform in the future.\nThis is a continuation of a project funded at fund 7 and it has a link to 2 other proposals at this fund 9, the community can see more information about related proposals at the group links The author is below the article.\nI will give this section 5 points because it completely answers the questions I posed for this proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11474, "q0": "Along with the rapid development of information technology in Vietnam, a large number of IT students have been produced.However, your career development options are limited. This proposal provides you with more good options as well as the opportunity to develop your Cardano ideas.The team's proposal is relevant to the students' current needs and meets the challenge's stated criteria in this category.\nHowever, in terms of risk, I think the team needs a solution to demonstrate that Cardano's technology is sound, as there are many fraudulent Blockchain technologies on the market, as well as a lot of bad news today, causing people's trust in Blockchain to dwindle.I think that student acceptance of Cardano technology and the Catalyst project is low, and that it is impossible to attract well-qualified students without a solution that proves the project's credibility.\nWith the team's knowledge and experience, I believe the team has a solution to this risk, but it is not mentioned here, so I will give 4 points in this section.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Through testing, I discovered that the group was made up of people with high skills, IT experience, and excellent pedagogical abilities.In addition, Mr. Tien is involved in the development of Cardano technology in Vietnam.

And I believe if awareness is created , many would be onboarded on the network promoting cardano ecosystem and blockchain technology in East Asia and the  world at large.

This is a proposal that has been funded at Fund 7. The content of the follow-up solution from Fund 7 to Fund 9 is to organize a series of virtual and on-site sharing events about Catalyst for students of universities in Vietnam. The purpose of the solution is still to approach lecturers and students to raise awareness about Cardano, helping students become Catalyst proposers/PAs. At Fund 7, the group successfully organized 16 online and offline sessions to share about Catalyst for 200 students from 2 universities: University of Transport and Nguyen Trai University. The successful results achieved after Fund 7 were detailed and clearly presented by the team, satisfying the previously set KPIs of the group, with attached documents and complete reference links. Following the success of the above series of events, at Fund 9 the group continued to propose to organize similar events and expand the scale with 3 universities.

In our Vietnam, blockchain is creeping into many universities. A number of blockchain research faculties/academies have been established at a number of universities and enterprises in Vietnam such as FPT University, the University of Danang (https://www.udn.vn/tin-tuc/chi-tiet/trung-tam-phat-trien-phan-mem-dai-hoc-da-nang-hop-tac-voi-trung-tam-blockchain-chau-a-thanh-lap-ai-blockchain-lab). Even FPT University - one of the prestigious universities in Vietnam also requires all students to learn blockchain and metaverse (https://genk.vn/chu-tich-truong-gia-binh) -fpt-lam-metaverse-thuc-ao-la-mot-tat-ca-sinh-vien-fpt-deu-phai-hoc-blockchain-va-metaverse-20220410103333009.chn). The Vietnam Blockchain Association was also established in May 2022, demonstrating Vietnam's preference for blockchain technology in the coming years. Therefore, the group's solution aimed at dynamic Vietnamese technology students is completely appropriate. Personally, I have some suggestions for the group to consider to enhance the effectiveness of these activities. Specifically: Firstly, adding training and supporting content on Plutus and Haskell languages to encourage the establishment of groups of programming design students, who are also potential developers on the Cardano ecosystem. Second, establish a Facebook, Telegram group where students can easily participate in exchanges, share and learn about Cardano and Catalyst. Third, at each event at a university, it is advisable to connect with one or several technology lecturers as the regular contact point with the project team. The aim is to help popularize activities and train students on blockchain and Cardano without interruption even after the events have ended. Regarding the risk of the proposal, the team should consider setting aside a part of the reserve fund due to price fluctuations of ADA when the market is in a prolonged bearish phase. Overall, I rate 5 points for the impact of the solution because of its perfect fit in the context that blockchain is increasingly known and interested by Vietnamese students.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I have praise for the team. The roadmap and budget for the implementation of the proposal are presented in a very logical and clear manner by the team. I believe that if approved by the community, the group will continue to successfully carry out a series of events at the 3 universities in Fund 9. In the 11-month process, including 4 expected phases, the group is expected to organize 24 events, attracting 1000 participants. In it, there will be 40 sessions dedicated to 1-1 support. The targets proposed by the group for each item are consistent with the goals set out in the roadmap. Because the team has experience and skills in successfully organizing similar events at Fund 7, I have complete confidence in the ability of the team members. They have proven that they can successfully organize events on a larger and larger scale.

However, at Fund 9 this rate is expected to reach only 2% (20 proposals/1000 students participating in the event).

On the other hand, the first three universities that implemented the project contributed as a kick start to the success by drawing awareness from target audiences. Therefore, the picked university also needs to keep updated with the community and the reason for picking the three. The team could consider online meeting platforms by using Skype, Google meet, and MsTeam as an effective tools for live events. The reason is most of the students in Vietnam don't have a fixed timetable, and also have projects, part-time work, or reasons that could not participate in the events.

It presented a problem in the development of the Cardano community, the proposed problem that is most suitable for the challenge is suitable for developing the capacity of the young generation. Addressing an urgent problem that many Vietnamese university students do not know about Project Catalyst's funding campaigns and the opportunities available. The proposed idea is to organize virtual or on-site sharing events about the Cardano and Catalyst projects for students. Connecting, motivating and supporting students to participate in Catalyst.. With the growing number of proposals from catalytic funds, this helps Vietnamese students easily and quickly find and evaluate proposals or find your own direction.

The specific goal of your proposed product is: reach out to faculty and students to raise awareness about Cardano and the opportunities that exist if they can work as diverse in Project Catalyst. The proposal identified a risk in the implementation process and provided solutions to overcome all of those risks. You have pointed out the risk of reaching fewer students than expected due to poor coverage. The proposed solution could host more events to get more students involved and submit proposals than expected. This action should be taken after having data from events within 2 months. However, I have suggestions for the team on the solution to overcome and limit the risk that you have pointed out. Firstly, at the risk you pointed out, I would like to come up with a more specialized solution such as combining a well-experienced teaching team combined with building trust and cooperation with the faculties in the two schools.

I notice several major impacts on the proposal.Students are a valuable source of intelligence, health, and energy that must be acknowledged. As a reason, students are an excellent beginning point for achieving critical goals. In the future, Cardano will be able to be a main subject instead of supplementary courses. The majority of universities' curriculums still depend on knowledge that has not been updated, so this proposal can increase efficiency and does not have to cost a lot of time for application. Furthermore, education and community development are always major concerns. As a result, favourable conditions for education and community development have been created. The proposal is possible to attract not only the students, professional groups but also investors if the association of Cardano-Catalyst-University can prove its effectiveness. Finally, providing information to students through universities can develop a reputation for trustworthiness for the Cardano project because it is more difficult to convince and develop the community from outside the universities. The public now remains cautious about scams or Ponzi schemes that are usually held in coffee shops, restaurant workshops, hotels,...Thus, universities become a reliable and efficient environment to approach more people, especially students.\nI think the proposal deserves to get 5 points in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Courses, discussion shows, and student activities are some of the most popular ways to develop a proposal. The proposal has several good points, in my perspective. Firstly, there is a good potential that the idea would be expanded to include additional universities. If the project develops in the proper direction, there is a good chance of educating the community and taking advantage of human resources in the future. Furthermore, many traditional organisations have successfully implemented this approach throughout the years, so there is no doubt about its usefulness, and we can put it into practice right away. The process might be shortened if we specifically select students who already have a basic understanding of technology, particularly those majoring in IT, technology, or digital marketing... Moreover, remote working and freelancing, which need high expertise and adequate remuneration, will grow popular in the future. This form of employment may close the gap between students and foreign jobs while also fostering the development of the Cardano Ecosystem, in which the entire community can contribute. However, the idea still has several drawbacks. The first issue is that most of the courses are not part of the university's compulsory curriculum, making it more difficult to convince students to participate. Aside from that, students nowadays lack self-motivation to learn. As a result, rather than a standard education session, I propose that we define clear goals for them, such as career opportunities and adequate remuneration, while enacting policies to support them. Furthermore, we may run online courses in parallel with offline courses and accept students from different institutions without restriction.\nI will score 4 points for the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The indicators described in the proposal essentially satisfy the criteria that may be tracked by an education course. The proposal also included indicators, such as participants, interactions, and attractiveness level which are valuable in evaluating the courses.

When applying this proposal to universities, the team will face some difficulties in obtaining permission from these universities, but I believe the team in charge of this proposal will be able to deal with the problem due to their existing relationships, allowing the proposal to be implemented quickly. Furthermore, there is just a minor difference in expenditure between the online and offline forms of the proposal because the offline version enables us to use university facilities. Additionally, a proper selection of students with a clear aim and basic understanding at the beginning of the course can assist the courses to operate better. However, I believe the idea could include more specific indicators. More specifically, after a certain period of time, we should evaluate the output, such as the number of people who become Cardano programmers, supporters, or project analysts, or at least the number of participants who have a basic understanding of how a transparent community works after attending the courses.\nThe idea of the proposal is great.

The proposed solution can add value to the Cardano ecosystem by bringing more awareness to Cardano itself and also acting as a catalyst for bringing in new talents that can come up with new interesting ideas for Project Catalyst, as well as gaining students more experience working as developers which will grow the Cardano projects and the future adoption of the Cardano ecosystem. Based on the points above, it can be clearly seen how the issue and proposed solution brought up in this proposal is perfectly aligned with the primary objective of the \u201cGrow East Asia, Grow Cardano\u201d challenge setting which is \u201craising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community\u201d", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team working on this proposal is the same team members working on the \u201cCatalyst Events 4 Vietnam Students\u201d project from Fund7.

The 3rd month milestone will be survey analysis and contacting students regarding their ideas for projects.

It talks about hosting virtual or onsite events to share information about Cardano and Catalyst with Vietnamese students in order to connect, motivate and support them to participate in Catalyst Funding. In my opinion, this idea is appropriate in several respects.Start with the fact that the proposer has already notified a very specific target audience. I noticed that many of the proposals are aimed at attracting non-professionals to the crypto world, which is certainly necessary for the growth and popularity of our community.However, it is also necessary to invest in an audience that is already a little more connected with specific aspects of computing, information technology of the host country, and the target audience of this proposal, I think, is doing well in this environment - Vietnamese IT students. I believe that our blockchain has a lot of potential, but it's not yet well known or widely adopted. \nI believe that our blockchain technology has a lot of potential, but it needs to be more widely known and adopted before it can truly take off. In doing so, these activities will help Cardano become more known and possibly used in some projects.Another positive is that these events will take place in Vietnam; We know that in some places like Europe and America blockchain technology is already more known and therefore accepted, however in East Asia Cardano is still in its infancy. In Vietnam, according to the proposers, there are about 55k IT students from 153 universities and institutes, they are the future leaders of the nation and the world, however they haven\u2019t understood about blockchain and its career opportunities.The Vietnamese University students' unawareness slips away the opportunities for reaching the new evolution makes me wonder how it could be if they are helped to unleash their full potential on this innovation. They might be experts who have critical thinking about the blockchain field or experts who have excellent ideas which can improve the blockchain Cardano. Therefore,  the aim is to \u201craise the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community\" starting from Vietnamese IT students. I believe the proposal could create more opportunities and new ideas for building the project from the target students. Their solution is reaching out to lecturers and students to raise the awareness of Cardano and creating more working opportunities which can spread to Vietnamese students and make them potential participants in Project Catalyst (Project as Proposers, Proposal assessors, Referrers, and Challenge team and voters.) The risks they state which occur during the progress is possible. I assume they do serious research about what they are doing. The solution for it is fully described so I have no doubt about the impact it could bring. I just suggest that the unforeseen slippage of ADA can lead to the shortage of budget therefore asking for a reserve fund is worth considering. The other risk is failing to connect with the expected amount of Universities and students so creating a backup list could be useful. In general, I am totally satisfied with this proposal\u2019s solution to solve the challenge, 100% convinced and give it a maximum rate.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is full of rich detail, with a sense of time and understanding the motivations behind the events. The steps involved in the process are outlined in detail, so that everyone involved will know exactly what needs to be done and how. These activities are related to the moment of the meeting and the pre-production, too.I could know when such things would happen, what would be done, in what way and when. The project is scheduled to last for five months, and tasks will be clearly divided: approaching universities, hosting events, collecting data for analysis, motivating students to join in the project, and submitting ideas for funding. However, the script states  there are 5 months of the project but I see no plan for the fourth month. I wonder if this is a mistake or if there is no plan for the fourth month actually. The objectives are described from general to detailed to make the reader easy to imagine fully about the whole process. The way they explain for me about how they manage the workload is convincing, I have no more doubt about their ability on this. Now let\u2019s talk about the budget breakdown. The requested money is $33,040 accounting for more than 13% of the whole challenge. I think this is a big scale project, compared to the majority of other proposals of this challenge. However, it is very fair. Several meetings will be held, it's not just the onsite moment of the event, many things would have to be worked on before and some after just like what they show on the script, this generates a lot of expense. The way they calculate the expense for each is so reasonable and transparent. They list everything that needs to be paid clearly and logically. I just have one observation like this: they state they will hire more HR in the university they have selected but not mention this in the budget so I expect a reserve budget for cost incurred. In general, this part shows me well all about how the money is used in what categories. We continue with the project\u2019s members. They are lecturer, researcher, Cardano members and experienced in Computer science with several years working in technology. We can confidently say that the professionals involved in this project are experienced and knowledgeable in their fields. Their LinkedIn and Facebook profiles are also attached, so you can verify all of the information that is being shared. There is a lot of faith in them,  mainly because they are from the computer, IT, blockchain community, which indicates that they would have a good idea of \u200b\u200bhow to dialogue with the target audience. That is, I believe that the feasibility is exceptional, with only a few points to make it clearer personally. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\nThe proponents give us good indicators on how to audit the proposal, for example: Total number of the events, participants, surveys, proposals submitted to ideascale from universities, proposals assessors, 1 to 1 support sessions.

I just request them to show me how they measure the bove index via what platform or tools. From that, I recommend they research the reach of the university students on social media, additional sharing is requested more and more. One more point that I am impressed by is that this proposal is a continuation of the funded one in Fund 7 which is also related with the other 2 proposals in Fund 9. I found it wonderful as it shows the high commitment of the proponents with the project they are doing.

This idea will organize online/offline sharing events for students, students to connect to support this human resource to contribute to Catalyst. I completely agree that students are an abundant and potential human resource of the Blockchain industry, even Cardano supports creativity and creates a new technology era based on young human resources. (Clearly, Cardano plays a big part.)\n\nHowever, to be honest, there are more than 3 projects with the same idea like this that I have read and evaluated in fund 9, I will not evaluate because it is entirely possible to have the same idea, but maybe a different geographical area. Honestly, I think it's better to choose the proposal with the most potential, but I won't be against the idea of \u200b\u200boverlap here.\n\nParticularly in this proposal, the author said that the fund has been obtained at fund 7 (18,000), and fund 9 (29,360) will be phase 2, I appreciate that this proposal idea has worked very clearly. and transparent through the videos of the students/team conferences updated in the media, of course, I have verified (twitter, youtube, facebook).\n\nThis is really a great idea when there is an abundance of young human resources they invest in research on technology and are supported by Catalyst, for me this proposal is completely suitable for the challenge. Recommendations based on my experience, which universities should the author update, plan an event schedule for students on a social networking app, and update throughout events, plans implemented there so that the proposal reviewers can easily check and track. In short, this is a potential proposal because they are taking it very seriously (through their activities).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this proposal is completely high because the team has performed the activities as they have committed to fund 6 (as evidenced by their activities being public). I fully believe that this team that won at fund 6 can fully rejoin to expand and continue to develop this idea again for better results. With a little personal opinion as I mentioned above, the team should have a forum or fanpage to post all of their activities here, from conferences with students to social events, student ideas or teamwork with school officials, etc., this will make it easier for PAs to evaluate and monitor as well as recognition.

I find this to be a very good suggestion because startup projects of IT students often face challenges in writing projects and raising capital. If these projects can be implemented on Cardano, they will be a perfect combination: Cardano diversify project participants, Students receive project funding which will ensure future sustainability future. You choose information technology students is absolutely correct because every year, about 55,000 IT students graduate from 153 universities and institutes, this is quite a large number.

In my opinion, in the first solution, you must pay attention to compiling the content of documents to ensure quality and should compile in an open manner to regularly update and supplement documents for perfection, choose the organizers of the event. The fact that those who have experience can choose students who have successfully started their businesses will have a wider spread. You need to innovate training methods in the direction of enhancing the design of learning activities through hands-on experiences to form skills for students.

So IT students is potential Human Resources Cardano ecosystem.\nMany students have good ideas and eed budget support to turn ideas into reality. Howerver, it is very difficult for thier idea to get funding, so many good ideas do not implement. If Catalyst fund them then their project will be successful and will contribute well to the Cardano community.\nIn addition, there is a lot of students with difficult circumstances. They have to do manual work (washing dishes, carrying goods, loading goods, etc.) with relatively low remuneration to cover their living expenses and pay tuition fees. Due to a lot of working time, they have little time to study, so their academic results are not good, even they are forced to drop out of their university. If they know Catalyst and can earn money from Catalyst then they will have more time to reseach and create. That is the human value Catalyst brings to society.\nCurrently, the number of students who know about Catalyst is very limited. Your proposed project will be a bridge between IT students and Catalyst because your project will provide background on the Cardano blockchain, introduce programming languages, share opportunities in Project Catalyst and how to get involved; guide IT students to write and submit ideas and apply for funding on Catalyst, advise them in their project implementation and management after their project is funded.\nI rate this project as satisfying the requirements of this challenge. It has a very good spread because of the following two reasons:\nFirstly, the IT students in the Cadarno community that your project will be the one to introduce the Catalyst to other faculty students in the school through clubs (if they have difficulties, you will coordinate suit them to do it).\nSecond, these graduated students will introduce Catalyst to their colleagues.\nMy only concern about your project is that the specific object of the project is information technology students or Vietnamese students in general.

As mentioned in the proposal, Vietnam has abundant human resources and lots of like-minded people.
