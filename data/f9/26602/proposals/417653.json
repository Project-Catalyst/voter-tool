Specifically, creating more developers from Asia (taking an Emurgo academy course and developing enterprise-grade products on the Cardano blockchain). The team has determined that the problem to be solved here is to focus on developing high-quality human resources from Asia, where there is a lot of human potentials. Participating in Emurgo academy courses will indirectly contribute to adding value to the Cardano ecosystem. I think that after this course, there will be a certain human resource in Asia that can meet the requirements of product development businesses with the Cardano blockchain platform. However, in my personal opinion, what is the product of the business developed on the Cardano blockchain platform? Based on that, the community will have a more accurate assessment of the impact. However, I still believe that if this proposal is successfully applied, it can scale up and solve future challenges (which require a lot of time). Because human resources are always the most important factor of all times and countries. With the development based on the Cardano blockchain, I think it will create high-quality products just like the Cardano blockchain has always been one of the best blockchains in the world today. The interesting thing here is: that Enterprise products are built directly on the Cardano blockchain - this is the first time I have seen such a fresh idea proposal. I agree with the enormous impact of this proposal. I vote 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I tried to look in the documentation the team attached, specifically the website: cerp.dev, but couldn't find any clear identities of any of the members. Contact information such as email, social networks, and personal profiles are hidden. We all know that currently with proposals where the team is still hiding information, it is very difficult to implement in reality because the community sees it as not a good proposal/project. Those cover-ups and lack of transparency cause serious damage to the reputation of the team in the community. I sincerely advise the team to add all records related to the personal information of all members to regain the reputation of the community and confirm the feasibility of the proposal (I don't see it at the moment) suggested to state the number of members and the identity of the members - even when searching the web).\nThe detailed budget table provided by the team is quite sketchy, only stating the training course cost and required training time without further analysis so that the community can grasp the details from which to evaluate the effectiveness of the training. feasibility of the proposal. In my opinion, the team should carefully analyze the budget, the budget must be divided into sections and be reasonable with the goal and there must be a specific explanation of the amount of money used for each given job. No one can deny the importance of publicizing the budget and detailing the funds required to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. I see that the team hasn't done this yet.\nThe plan and how to implement it are not clearly stated. I am continuing to search for the implementation team's plan to implement the proposal but can't find it. So my third piece of advice for the team is to quickly complete the plan and implement the full implementation method in the proposal for the community to know. Because a very good thesis cannot lack a specific plan and the implementation method that goes along with that plan.\nThe proposal also failed to demonstrate the resources needed to implement it, it was the result of a very sketchy, pointless presentation. My fourth piece of advice is to quickly add the resources you need to make it happen. Specifically here are human resources (financial resources still need approval and funding from Catalyst). The team must prove its ability through existing personnel to confirm its feasibility. If it has not been funded by Catalyst, does the team intend to continue this proposal?\nThe technical aspect is also not clearly stated, it is sketchy and vague like an unfinished proposal. In my opinion, the team should review all the items mentioned and add to the explanation the technical aspects of the technology along with the language used to make the proposal and put it into practice.\nThe team also does not pose any risks if it receives funding from Catalyst. I advise the team to think more to find the risk. The fact is that there are risks, I would like to give a single risk as an example, which is the devaluation of the Ada, then we have to study more carefully to ask for an appropriate amount if the Ada has slippage in the market. Or if additional funding is needed, the team must come up with a plan that is verifiable by the community.\nHaving analyzed the above aspects, I strongly disagree about the feasibility of the proposal. I have given positive advice for the team to refer to, which is considered a basis for improving the proposal if it is to be accepted by the community.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The team has outlined essential steps to complete the proposal within 6 weeks, however, I have not seen the so-called roadmap. In my opinion, the team should attach the tasks that need to be done with the specific time of the months of the year to make a roadmap according to the specific time of the proposal. From there, the community can easily assess the progress of the work and it is also a way to confirm the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The team has outlined four essential elements in the KPI, but there are no key metrics, which is a pity. Because if there are more key metrics, it will be much better for auditing. The definition of project success is simple as the team considers that all 6 developers have completed the training course of Emurgo academy. This is one of the simplest definitions of success I've read as a PA. Throughout the proposal, a problem was described but it was not completely clear and in some places, there was still a lack of a reasonable solution to the problem.

It is important to note that part of the delivery the author considers the implementation of an ERP project for Cardano. However, this complement to the proposal loses some of its initial objective.\n\nThe proposal ends up not focusing on the scale development of new developers or on the development of the system itself. Given the reduced number of trained developers, future scale gains are limited, in addition to uncertainty in their commitment to executing the project after training.

According to the author, no risks are expected. In this case, I would recommend considering at least the risks related to the success of the training process, meeting deadlines, meeting quality requirements and discontinuing developers on the project.
