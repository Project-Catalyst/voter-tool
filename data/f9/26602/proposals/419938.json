However, I think if we think about Asia in general and the need to bring the technologies of the Cardano ecosystem to different regions and people, I still think that it should be funded. The solution was to organize live sessions and create groups on social media platforms to exchange knowledge about Catalyst, penetrate speculative groups, and share them with risk-free opportunities risk across the Ecosystem. It can be seen that in recent funds, the number and quality of proposals from the Vietnamese community have increased and most of them are from familiar members. Expanding the Catalyst Sponsorship campaign will help more people know about the Cardano ecosystem, thereby increasing the number of members participating in the Catalyst community, and contributing to the development of our ecosystem. The target group of this proposal is also well defined which are talented investors with plenty of time, introduce them to Catalyst, assist with the Getting Started steps e.g. open a .ideascale account, permanent tutorials public consultation (PA), encourage participants to submit ideas in the Catalyst ecosystem, connecting them to online classes on Blockchain knowledge that the developer community in Vietnam is building there are some challenges The challenges and risks are listed and the proponent carefully lays out methods to address those risks, indicating a thorough preparation of the proponent for this project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap of the project is presented quite simply, which can be understood as divided into 2 phases.

And this proposal provides us with KPIs that can easily be measured against what is done on the road map. The ability to check the project is also very transparent, the author will post the progress based on the social networking platforms such as Youtube, Telegram, and Facebook... this makes it easy for the community to follow the project judgment at any time. And finally, the success of the project is very clearly defined, in line with the original goal set out: attracting investors to invest within 50km, having many quality proposals submitted and developed on the ecosystem, and providing Catalyst with at least 5 specialized engineers.

The goal of the proponent is to introduce talented investors to Catalyst, guide account opening, community advisor (PA), and participate in submitting ideas.

Therefore, in terms of the team's experience and capabilities, there's nothing to worry about. It is great that the proponent provided a detailed plan as well as a detailed budget breakdown. However, it is safer to raise the reserve fund level to 7-8% because the cryptocurrency market is a highly volatile market and the native token ADA is no exception.

The successes they bring have been recognized and created a strong foothold in the market today. I believe that with the current development Cardano will continue to grow. However, at present, the knowledge about Cardano is endless, there are many speculators who still do not understand and are having difficulty when there is no one to guide, exchange knowledge and experience about Cardano. With a Catalyst idea for full-time speculators proposed by the topic, I find this to be a very cool and refreshing idea.\n\n    - The problem that the proposed topic raised was very clearly defined that is. There are a lot of speculators and freelancers they have a lot of time, but they don't know about the Catalyst Funding campaign and the huge opportunities in the tech platform.

If the proposal is successful, it is possible to scale up the globalization to help uninformed communities passionate about learning and exchanging knowledge and experiences about the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n   - Here the solutions proposed by the topic are very specific to solve that problem. We will create communities on the most popular social networking platforms, such as Telegram, Youtube, Facebook to discuss and have regular meetings every Monday night organized by us. At the same time, we also organize face-to-face meetings at cafes, to discuss and plan and support each other to find ideas and collaborate on writing ideas. In addition, we will send 2 elite members to focus on learning Haskell / Plutus language, after they complete the course will bring the knowledge back and we will start to come up with in-depth ideas on Protocols and Coherence. smart co.

With a total budget of $11,484 and has been broken down into 4 different expenses. In my opinion, such broken costs are completely reasonable. Most importantly, the team came up with a backup plan for the sudden price drop of ADA. I find that to be very good.\n\n    - With a section that provides detailed information about the people who will work on the project. I see the team that raised the topic is also the founder of the concept team for Cardano and with it there will be an 8 member team that has been linked and co-developed with the proposed theme.

These people mostly have a lot of time but without knowing about these funding campaigns, they have inadvertently missed many opportunities in the very large cryptocurrency market. Once they have more access to Catalyst's sponsorship campaigns, it will help develop the Cardano ecosystem in our community in Vietnam in particular and in East Asia in general.\nI find this proposal very interesting in that it goes to the heart of the matter, directly introducing the community to Catalyst's sponsorship campaigns to give them the opportunity to step-by-step access to and learn new knowledge that they never knew existed. Myself as an example, I have been in the crypto market for more than 2 years but it was not until this fund 9, through a friend's recommendation, that I found out about Catalyst's funding campaign and joined as a member.

Solving the solution is clearly presented in terms of goals and implementation plan, collaborating with team members as well as the advisory board to give those who do not know the opportunities to develop themselves as well as is a profession to earn extra income that simply uses the intelligence of the brain and a computer.\n    The idea that this is a new technology that has not been fully developed throughout Vietnam as well as the whole world, so it is understandable that the understanding is not much, people are still confused that it is What software? how to start? If you can do it, what will you get? whether it takes time and brains to be rewarded? This project is to explain to all those who do not understand how, you have solved those risks.

In the group there have been many members who have joined the Catalyst for a long time who will be responsible for guiding the newcomers. In addition, the team sent two members to attend intensive classes and smart contract protocols. The aim is to guide the community with a lot of useful and in-depth knowledge. I found the solutions that the group proposed to be very reasonable, it is suitable to solve the difficulties in the challenge.\n\n   - Besides, the group also raised the risks that the proposal may face. maybe the community has not paid much attention to the group's referrals, and has joined but not yet trusting Catalyst's reward mechanism. and ADA Price may drop suddenly leading to budget shortfall.

The author has identified the problem of how to let speculators and freelancers know about Catalyst's funding campaign and the great opportunities in the technology platform. These people can have a lot of time, if they spend their spare time focusing on developing the Cardano ecosystem (including Catalyst) it will have a huge impact on East Asia and the entire Cardano ecosystem.

The proposal clearly states that implementing members include the author and several other collaborators. It seems that this team has been working together for a long time (probably working together online because of geographical distance). In the proposal, you have included all relevant documents and videos about yourself and the team working with the public social network. I appreciate the feasibility and believe in the team members. I highly encourage you to do this especially to make the identities of all members public, because the more public the identities, the more visible the number of group members, and the more trust the community has. so much into the team. I read the budget analysis in quite a detail and was convinced by its meticulousness and specificity. Through this, I see that when you are trying to build a small group of people who are mainly investors, entrepreneurs have free time to campaign and pass on conceptual knowledge related to the Cardano blockchain and Catalyst. With a specific implementation plan, I believe the feasibility of this proposal will be appreciated and appreciated by the community. In terms of engineering and technology, I'm glad you applied 100% of the knowledge of the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems (with self-research and learning from IOG, Charles Hoskinson, from Vietnam's Fimi group) to apply to your work (you spend all of your working time digging into Cardano, Catalyst). Along with that is the effort to bring knowledge to the community (friends who are entrepreneurs, and speculators near you with a geographical radius of 50km). I very much welcome these efforts. However, I have a question about the resources required to implement, and specifically the manpower. To introduce knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to the community, besides you, is there any other member who will join you in doing this (organize and directly present at coffee dust meetings in Hai Duong city? )? My advice is to find and select readers who can organize knowledge sessions with you. Doing so will ensure feasibility (proposals are guaranteed to always be implemented), and reduce your workload. As for the risks and challenges of implementing the proposal, you have listed quite accurately the foreseeable risks, I completely agree with this. I particularly welcome the solution you have suggested, it seems satisfactory and hopefully will effectively limit the risks. I would like to ask more that you have a way to attract entrepreneurs, and investors to participate in the Cardano ecosystem strongly and regularly? Because I know the reality that many Vietnamese people have language barriers (English). Anyway, I find this to be a good, necessary idea, that will come to life.

I have a suggestion: If possible, write a clear roadmap for how to do the work to increase the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Perhaps the community will support your proposal if the transparency and accounting are clearer. Accompanied by that is the KPI to evaluate the performance of the job. Maybe some others will think that, when applied in practice, this proposal does not need to use KPIs, but I still think that the presence of KPIs will increase a lot of audit calculations, and help easily evaluate work performance.
