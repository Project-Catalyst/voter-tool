As a lover of green food and playing the role of preparing ingredients and food for my family every day, I was very interested and interested from the title to the content of the proposal on ensuring the quality of the food organic food through the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal has solved the challenge of applying the Cardano ecosystem to everyday life through food traceability.\nI noticed that, not only in Japan but also in my country Vietnam, the use of pesticides and chemicals in agriculture is increasingly popular. Manufacturers are aiming for profit, gradually forgetting about the dangers to human health that these chemicals bring. People now instead of buying products in markets and supermarkets, they prefer to choose clean and natural foods that can be grown by themselves or bought at organic supermarkets. However, as a housewife, when shopping for food, I find that the traceability of these organic foods in Vietnam is still not really guaranteed and reliable.\nThe unique and outstanding feature of the issue in this proposal is that the authors have emphasized the importance of health and the daily consumption habits of people in Japan to build this project. Before the alarming figures of the authorities in Japan about the number of pesticides being used for agriculture, the introduction of an agriculture that activates soil microorganisms without using pesticides and Using the Cardano blockchain to ensure food traceability anywhere, anytime is essential. I completely agree with the author's argument and solution to this reality in Japan and think that this is a concern that needs to be promoted by the Cardano community.\nWith the idea of \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthis proposal, I will give the authors 5 points because the content has satisfied me, satisfying the conditions for a green, sustainable and long-term development for the food industry in Japan in particular and Asia in general, parallel with it is the daily development of the Cardano community here.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has provided very convincing arguments and evidence and a very detailed and clear implementation plan for each month and each task that needs to be done. Obviously, the planning and division of work were done very well by the team members. I also completely agree with the author team when I realize that this is a long-term project and this proposal is only the first stage of applying for funding for the project in the coming years.\nThe project budget of $10 462, accounting for 4.18% of the challenge's budget is a very reasonable number for this proposal. The content of the items to be spent and explained is already there, but for me, it's not really detailed, the authors should add more information, for example, the cost of Hirayama's business trip is 2000$/month (How many trips this month, each trip within a few days, what purpose do you go for, do you spend all of this money every month or does it change in the months?), same for expenditure items other fees. This interpretation will help the community to monitor and evaluate the project in more detail and closeness.\nThe project also identified 3 main risks that will likely prevent the success of the project: not subsidizing new farmers, the project is destroyed by pressure from JA, local banks and other stakeholders, consulting firms cannot cooperate with the project. Although the risks that will be encountered, the author's plan to deal with these risks has not yet convinced me.\nI see members of the team as capable of implementing this proposal, they have the capacity, qualifications, professional experience and have a clear identity. Unfortunately, I can't see a link to LinkedIn, Github, Twitter or any social history to verify. From the above comments, I give the authors 3 points in the feasibility part because -1 point for the budget part is not detailed and -1 point for the part of the plan to deal with the risk is not convinced.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With the roadmap of the project, I find the project completely able to monitor the progress and success. However, for the community to have continuous and close monitoring, it is necessary to add a detailed description of the use of the budget. The author team should also make a monthly progress report on the implementation of the plan and use of the budget in an open and transparent manner to the community through the project's communication channels.\nThe authors have also come up with 4 KPIs to measure the success of the project, which are the number of an online seminars held, the number of jobs organized and the number of participants, the new number of farmers decided to cooperate in the project and successfully applied for the subsidy. In my opinion, these 4 indicators need to be updated by the author with specific quantifiable data to measure and must be updated regularly on a monthly basis during the course of the project and after. If the project is successful, it will be a pioneering step for a series of applications using blockchain technology in daily life in Japan.\nThis is a completely new project and has not been funded before, however, with this project, I see a future clean food technology for human health for sustainable development from Natural farming makes good use of plant and animal manure sources. This technology background is not only in Japan but also in Vietnam, we are also very interested in people and have gradually applied it to life. I find that extracting a clear food origin thanks to the Cardano ecosystem will create people's habit of using the ecosystem, over time this will become a community communication channel with a dizzying spread future.\nI will give the project transparency a score of 4 points because -1 point the authors are not really detailed when providing measurement information for the success of this project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 217, "q0": "It is a proposal for food traceability in Japan, which is very appropriate for the purpose of the category.\n\nThe content of the proposal begins by pointing out the structural problem of Japan's extremely high use of pesticides, and then goes on to the method that will provide a clue to solving the problem, namely, the spread of \"soil microbial activation agriculture\" that does not use pesticides and the use of AtalaPrism to connect farmers and consumers to provide safe foodstuffs. The proposal has a very logical structure, from the problem statement to the solution, and we have the impression that it is highly complete as a proposal.\n\nIn addition, the implementation plan is divided into multiple phases in anticipation of a certain length of time, and the plan also takes into consideration the expansion of sales channels and incentives such as preferential sales to ADA holders, which is both unique and realistic. I feel that there are high expectations for the realization of this plan.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team composition is clear, and I have the impression that it is composed of people with very rich backgrounds, such as agricultural professionals, microbiology researchers, medical doctors, and chefs, who will be able to fully demonstrate their abilities in explaining to new farmers and holding seminars.\n\nHowever, there are no developers in the team for the development of solutions, including AtalaPrism, and there is no mention here of the specific direction of what kind of traceability technology will be installed. Therefore, even if the number of new farmers achieves the target, we have the impression that there is some uncertainty about the viability of the project in terms of ensuring its progress in the future.\n\nThe possibility of the project being abandoned due to pressure from JA, which is mentioned in the proposal, is also a serious risk factor. The proposal explains that the pesticide problem, which is the starting point of this project, is a major structural problem due to JA's involvement. However, if this is the case, it may be necessary to contact and negotiate with JA officials in advance regarding the feasibility and direction of the project. It seems to me that the JA staff may be concerned about these issues and may be reluctant to participate in the project.\n\nHowever, the fact that the proposer did not hide these concerns as risk factors and made them clear is a good sign, and in that sense, I think the structure of the proposal is very impressive.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this phase, the focus is on recruiting new farmers and applying for subsidies, and the number of seminars and workshops required for this purpose, as well as the target number of participants, are set in a simple manner, so in this sense, I think the settings are appropriate.\n\nHowever, if we look at this plan as a roadmap based on performance indicators, we feel that more detailed settings may be necessary.\nFor example, we have scheduled five online seminars at the beginning of the project, but we would like to see the outline of the seminars, including the expected number of participants, the areas where they will be held, and the content of the seminars, as well as the content of the workshops that are planned, and the expected points for each at this stage. I believe that this will enable us to make a qualitative evaluation of the content of implementation and link it to actual participation in the project, in addition to a quantitative evaluation that considers the project accomplished simply by the number of times it is held.\n\nAlso, although this may be an evaluation under the feasibility section, the ratio and amount of travel expenses to the budget appears to be somewhat excessive. \nIt is unclear whether these travel expenses are for holding the workshop or whether they include marketing expenses for recruiting new farmers before the workshop. \nIn any case, we would like to see an external indicator to evaluate the appropriateness of the $8,000 cost for 4 months.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2061", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 6, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3976, "q0": "This proposal aims to create a traceability application for Japanese organic food produce by utilizing Cardano blockchain.

However, the proposer mentioned a few risks and challenges that they might face during the implementation phase. The biggest concern is the intervention by JA. If they intervene, will the proposer abandon the project? Is there anyway to navigate around it? Authorities have the tendency to intervene anything that is against their policy.

To execute the grand plan, there are many moving parts.
