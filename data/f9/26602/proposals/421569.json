This makes a lot of investors in Vietnam not really understand the technology of blockchain and Cardano.", "f6_no_assessments": 18, "f6_rating": 4.092592592592593, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 2026, "q0": "The proposal\u2019s aim is to create blockchain and ADA awareness in Vietnamese people through knowledge. The proposal will tackle this problem by creating YT videos about ADA and blockchain in Vietnamese. \n\nHaving material in popular platforms is important because it creates more opportunities, more chances of this content reach people which would be interested in looking for it or have no idea that this exists.\n\nThat being said, this align with this challenges because the success of this proposal can make the ADA and blockchain technology reach millions of people. The Vietnam have more than 95M people. Therefore, there is a huge growth potential in this country that may be unlocked if there is no language barrier.\n\nThe metrics and goals of this proposals are related with the quantity of viewers and interaction within the videos, which align with the challenge because it will have an impact in East Asian population.\n\nTo scale this proposal is needed to create a very good material, no only by its content but editing is quite important. Unfortunately the proposal does not provide evidence that it\u2019ll be a team with this knowledge. It shows that the proposer have some videos in YT channel, however the competition nowadays is huge and having a professional team to write, film and edit is quite important.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "To evaluate its feasibility we can divide in some important aspects:\n\n1 \u2013 Roadmap:  There was provided a timeline in which the proposer shows the content of the videos and throughout the months. It\u2019ll be created 4 videos/month and it states that each video takes 10hours to be done. Therefore it shows an organization that is quite important to be done.\n\n2 \u2013 Budget: The proposal address this part by cost/video, having no division or further explanation. This was done because the proposer will do everything, therefore it has a hourly price to his work. This is a bit risky because having all the parts of creating a content to just a person is not excellent. Furthermore, it might be good to separate a part of the money to marketing, help its disclosure\n\n3 \u2013 Risk Management: The proposer shows its preoccupation with the views numbers, saying that it will mitigate this by sharing the videos in other community platforms. However, as mentioned before, it might be interesting to allocate part of the money to a marketing specialist. By doing this you could increase significantly the success chances. Another risk that I visualize is that the whole project depends on only one person, therefore if anything happens everything will stop, with no mitigation act.\n\n4 \u2013 Team: I do think that, nowadays, is important to have a team to co-create content. Writing, filming and editing are three important processes that should be managed by professionals in this case. Moreover, having only one team member with no backup to keep the proposal going is quite risky. Furthermore, we might include in the tasks to be done the response to the videos commentaries, which will elevate the engagement.\n\n5 \u2013 Self funding/scalability: The proposal states that it\u2019ll come to other funds in order to keep the project going. However, if the YT videos becomes a success, it\u2019ll have the ability to self-fund and keep going by itself. It should be added this bit in the proposal because it might have a time that the catalyst does not have the necessity to pay for this to keep it going (since the cost evaluation is the proposer\u2019s working hour)\n\nThat being said, I agree that this project has a high probability to be done and accomplished, however I do think that it can reduce the risks and be accomplished in a more professional way.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Since the proposal objective is post educational videos on YT, it has no difficulty to see its results. However, it could be interesting to have a instagram profile in which the proposer upload some stories showing the process and progress. It could be used as a disclosure platform with a huge potential.\n\nThe KPI and metrics are about the number of views and interaction. However other metrics that should be analyzed is the audience profile and best hour to post. This way you can create strategies trying to reach a wider range of audience or having a more specific message to the niche. \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13753, "q0": "Yes, this proposal meets the challenge well.

In a June 2021 report by Cointelegraph, Vietnam ranked 13th in the world in terms of bitcoin investment rate in 2020.\nAccording to another information from global market research firm TechSci Research, there is growing demand for 5G networks from Vietnam's main industries, including healthcare, energy, and transportation and manufacturing, which are also required for smart city development, is expected to drive blockchain market growth in Vietnam over the next 5 years with a predicted double-digit growth rate between 2023-2027.\nThis shows that Vietnam is a very potential market for the flourishing development of blockchain and Cardano in the not too distant future. However, I agree with the authors when it comes to the fact that in Vietnam, there are very few community channels to share videos about blockchain technology knowledge in Vietnamese. This makes a lot of investors in Vietnam not really understand or misunderstand blockchain technology and Cardano. I also see this as a concern that needs to be promoted by the Cardano community to help the community have the right knowledge and view of this market as well as experience, participate in the market and help become members of the Cardano community. They can be PA, VPA, proponent, voter, .... in the future.\nI see the difference of this proposal from other proposals with the same challenge as it specializes in only producing videos of knowledge content about the cryptocurrency market, about the Cardano ecosystem to provide to the community that absolutely do not choose any other form of information transmission. For myself, this is also a good project development orientation because when I need to add knowledge, just add to the available videos to review, it saves me a lot of time and effort instead because I have to gather information from different sources on the internet.\nI will give the impact of this recommendation a score of 4, which to me is a pretty high score on the community rating scale.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I see that the project has come up with a plan with specific and detailed timelines, implementation roadmap for 6 months, week by week in each month. I am very satisfied with this plan because when I read it, I know what amount of knowledge and information I will find when watching these videos, is it the knowledge I am looking for? It is clear that the plan and the coordination of its implementation have been carefully and seriously proposed by the team members.\nThe budget part left me quite disappointed when looking at the information that the author team provided. I have worked for more than 7 years at a television station in Hanoi-Vietnam, also participated in the production and censorship of many clips, videos, and programs broadcast on various platforms. From that practical experience, I have a few suggestions for this part of the budget as follows: First, the budget gives a general overview, not really detailed for each item, second, the division of this budget I find it inappropriate, the expenditure is not really reasonable. I need the author team to clarify what the cost of $ 60 / hour is to use for, to make this 15 minute video how many workers and machines, the unit price and the specific quantity, the spending on such works needs to be explained in detail so that the community can clearly audit the project. Apparently, the asking amount is 14400$, which is 5.7% of the total budget of the challenge, is not a high number, however, the use of that money must be transparent and the results it brings must be worth the money invest.\nThe author team also pointed out that the main risk preventing the success of the project is that the knowledge videos do not receive many views through the video suggestion mechanism of youtube. The remedy for this risk I think makes perfect sense. In addition, I contribute another risk that is the level of competition for the product. Because I know that currently in Vietnam, there are also many communities and individuals who are interested planning to build communication channels to introduce and transmit knowledge about blockchain and Cardano through infrastructures like Youtube, Facebook, TikTok\u2026. This leads to the fact that in order to attract the number of viewers and channel followers, the author team needs to produce videos with really quality content.\nProposers of the project are those who are capable of implementing this proposal. They have made public their identities, experience, education and qualifications. I can see their official information through links on telegram, facebook, on youtube links that they share.\nI would give this 3 points, -1 for the need to add detailed budget usage and -1 for the risky part of the proposal and how to fix it.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In my opinion, the project is completely auditable, the community can monitor the progress and success of the project continuously but may not be closely. The team needed to add a detailed explanation of how the budget was used so that the community could better follow along with the project. Besides, I find this is a project with a rather long implementation period, so every month the author team needs to supplement and update the progress of the project, report the monthly usage budget, and achieve indicators publicly on his personal page.\nKPIs that measure project progress and success are assessed by the proposal team through 3 metrics: views, interactions, and the number of subscribers. In addition to the above 3 indicators, I see that the author group needs to refer to the audience's comments below the video. The recommendation team also expects to reach 1000 subscribers in 9 months, each video will have at least 300 views and 50 interactions such as likes, shares or comments. These indicators are very good, it will help the author team assess whether the viewers' perception of the knowledge from the videos is reasonable to adjust and supplement the channel better and better.\nThis is a new proposal and has not been funded by previous funds, the construction of a youtube channel is still quite young, so it takes a lot of time, effort and enthusiasm of the whole project team to help the channel grow develop and stand firmly in the community. I will give the transparency of this proposal 3 points, -1 because the community can't keep track of the tight control of budget usage and -1 because I expect the success metrics the project delivers will be higher. If get funding at this fund and return to other funds, I will give a higher score recommendation when I can see the results of the project.

The proposal has solved a huge problem that exists in the Vietnamese blockchain community, which is that there are too many information channels and community groups, but mainly to share profitable surfing speculation x10, x100 times in a short period of time. short time. Meanwhile, there is a complete lack of quality, in-depth information channels that help improve the community's knowledge and understanding of blockchain technology and Cardano. Therefore, I fully support the solution proposed by the team to create a channel to share knowledge about Cardano and Blockchain in quality Vietnamese. It is important to address that blockchain knowledge is often confusing and can be boring and difficult to attract an audience. How should this be remedied? Here the solution given by the team is to build a blockchain and Cardano knowledge video series. However, what I expected but did not see the group mention is how to make these videos vivid, easy to understand, accessible to the majority of the community? I suggest that the group should consider adding graphic techniques, easy-to-understand illustrations, integrating lesson stories and investing in knowledge transmission videos. This will make it easier to reach the audience. The community can both learn knowledge and relate to reality, especially in the context that blockchain is increasingly popular in Vietnam. In May 2022, Vietnam we launched the Vietnam Blockchain Association. This demonstrates Vietnam's clear interest in the future of digital currency. In my opinion, it is necessary to diversify forms of content creation, integrate domestic technology news, invest in knowledge lessons, etc. These should be the ways to consider for solutions. achieve the desired effect. This also helps to partly limit the risk that the team poses as \"knowledge videos, so they may not receive many views through Youtube's video suggestion mechanism\". Overall, I still appreciate the seriousness and determination of the team to contribute to the Vietnamese blockchain community. My score is 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The entire process of the proposal implementation plan focuses entirely on the production of the knowledge video. Specifically, the group plans to produce 24 videos in 6 months. Each month, there will be 4 videos (10-15 minutes in duration), corresponding to 4 knowledge topics to be implemented. What I did not find in the proposal process was a marketing plan, community promotion, as well as a plan to receive feedback, continue to improve editing, improve the quality of knowledge Share channel. Personally, I think that one-way knowledge sharing, lack of feedback exchange and continuous innovation will be a big limitation, affecting the effectiveness of the solution. In terms of budget, the team focuses 100% of the cost on the production of 24 videos, with a specific unit price and number of interpretations. However, I suggest the team should spend 10-15% of the budget in the reserve fund for ADA price fluctuations. Due to the project duration of 6 months, the ADA depreciation may affect the project funding budget. About the team, Ms. Hannah was introduced as the administrator of one of the major Cardano communities in Vietnam (https://www.facebook.com/groups/cardanoviet). Personally, I am also currently joining this community. This is a Cardano group operating in the form of a closed group on Facebook with more than 46000 members. However, because the team does not provide individual member Facebook links for verification, it will be difficult to confirm the status of the founder, community administrator as the information provided by the group. Overall, I rate the project as likely to be successful. However, I made the following deduction: -1 point for lack of community marketing plan, -1 point for lack of reference link to verify team member profile information.

The community therefore has a complete basis to be able to evaluate the successful results of the project that can be achieved.

Specifically, the group is expected to have 1000 subscribers in 9 months (each month will have 111 new subscribers), each video has 300 views, 50 interactions. This number is too safe in my opinion. Maybe, because the group does not focus on communication and promotion campaigns to reach the community, these target numbers only stop at this threshold. Therefore, I evaluate the project as having the ability to audit, but the KPIs are not really convincing, commensurate with the effort and budget set by the team. My score is 4 points.

The database usually structures it's data into tables, whereas a blockchain, as its name implies, structures it's data into chunks that are strung together.

And in this respect, has made many people believe that crypto is just a scam.\n\nNevertheless, it is not clear how the solution, i.e. the creation of these series of videos would add value to the Cardano ecosystem. The metrics of success for this activity should not be the viewers, likes, subscribers, and comments, which can easily be manipulated using paid bots, but the amount of new wallets being created and activated as the outcome of watching these videos. So in this respect, the videos should provide the viewers with CTA links to download wallets, and present basic knowledge of the Cardano ecosystem, such as how to create wallets and how to delegate their ADA to a stakepool before jump in to more heavy stuff like Hydra, Liquidity Pool and Oracles as stated in the proposal. We need to make videos that help more people coming in and be part of the ecosystem in an educational yet easy way.\n\nSo, based on what the contents of these videos are going to be like, and by not articulating what specific metrics or KPI will be used, I have doubt this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan for the set of 24 videos is given in detail, which I think makes it  easier to analyze.

The only links given in the proposal are only links to private groups on Facebook and links to local Telegram channels.\n\nAnd the budget breakdown is also not that reasonable of a cost. I can not see why these power-point types of videos will cost $600 for every video to be available on Youtube.\n\nSo, given the plan, the budget outline, and the less verifiable experience of the team behind the project, I would say that this proposal is not going to be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal only uses metrics of views, interactions and subscribers as KPI which can easily be manipulated using paid bots to measure the success.

But Blockchain also has many other applications such as NFTs, logistics, and data storage, ..so it is necessary to have videos in Vietnamese to help Vietnamese people access this technology fully and accurately. And the fact also shows that the number of videos with content about Blockchain Cardano in Vietnamese is also quite small.\n\nThe solution you came up with this proposal is to make videos for Blockchain, and Cardano, and upload them to the Youtube channel for everyone to easily access and watch these video series. This is one of the current popular practices of the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency industry and also gives good results.\n\nThe content which you want to show in the videos are quite basic and necessary for beginners to learn about Blockchain and Cardano such as: What is Blockchain? What is Cardano? How does Cardano's Hydra work? How does the Public Key and Private Key of the blockchain work? Compare 2 consensus mechanisms Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-work?... These knowledge are really necessary and need to be properly understood by everyone to avoid wrong decisions later because this industry has many opportunities but also contains many risks if you do not have solid knowledge.\n\nThe biggest risk you mentioned in the proposal is that YouTube will limit recommendations to users because it is purely academic videos. And your solution is to share these videos to the community of crypto investors in Vietnam, I agree with this option but to be more proactive, you can also spend a little budget to run ads (Facebook ads, Youtube ads,..) for these videos, and if this content is really valuable, the community will actively share and go viral for them.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All the videos that the proposal is proposed to make will take place within 06 months, and in each month you list out what topics you will use in the video.

It has the impact of adding value indirectly to the Cardano ecosystem (via videos). I think this is an idea that is not new, but necessary for the Vietnamese community. Because many Vietnamese people do not know Cardano. The proposal also aims to help East Asia grow and develop. Good idea, easy to apply in real life. This proposal, if applied in practice, will help more Vietnamese people know and understand the Cardano blockchain, thereby having more people participate in the Cardano ecosystem and there will be suggestions to improve the Cardano blockchain to improve the quality of the Cardano blockchain. improve the situation for Vietnam in particular and East Asia in general.

My question is if Catalyst has not provided funds for the team to implement the proposal at Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal? And does the team currently have any other sources of capital so that when it is not funded, it can still implement the proposal? I would like to ask this closely because I want to further determine the feasibility of the proposal. About the implementation plan, the team has stated throughout the proposal. This shows that the team spirit is serious and professional. The team also has all the necessary resources to perform (except for financial resources waiting to be funded), and the remaining human resources are quite adequate. However, I know that some members are also working on other proposals in Fund 9, if so, does the team have enough time and enough people to make this proposal good? With the reputation that the team has built up in the Cardano Vietnam community for a long time, I am confident in the success of the proposal. Regarding the technique used when proposing, I guess that the team will favor the animation technique on each video shown on YouTube, this is a prominent trend used by many YouTubers around the world and attracts a lot of viewers because of its interestingness. Regarding the stated risk that the video may not attract a lot of viewers, I would suggest: trying to focus your efforts on building videos that are engaging in terms of content (still containing the complex knowledge of the Cardano blockchain but still present an interesting and engaging audience). If you can do that, gradually the Vietnamese community will respond and the number of video views will increase very high.
