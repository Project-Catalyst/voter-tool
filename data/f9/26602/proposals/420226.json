I understand this proposal is heavily targeted at the global transportation and mobility industry. The proposal addresses the goal set out in the Challenge of \"East Asia growth, Cardano growth\". I agree with your suggestion that it has identified the problems that need to be solved, and of course, it adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. In terms of the long-term, if the proposal is funded and if it is feasible in practice, it can scale and solve the challenge thanks to AI technology on the Cardano blockchain platform. That is the combination of Artificial Intelligence and blockchain. This combination is quite popular today in the world's high-tech world, it is considered to be the current technology and flourishes in the future. Through the issues you raised, I see the potential for blockchain development and that is the premise for continuing to build a community that promotes Cardano blockchain adoption in East Asia and around the world. However, I still expect the team to be more detailed and clear to help the community better understand the impact when the team has set a goal to penetrate a trillion USD market (a market with a very large scale), instead of showing a somewhat generic impact in the proposal. In summary, I agree with the impact of the proposal. I vote 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Through the presentation on the proposal, I know that you have a lot of experience in project management, blockchain, distribution mechanism, auditing, etc... The experience has been from 22 years of working. But unfortunately, I can't identify you specifically through Linkedin, don't have your portrait, and have nothing more specific to identify the proponent. In addition, if the team members have not been identified (you write as being considered) then I am afraid that the community will have a lot of doubts about the credibility of the team. My advice is that you fully identify yourself and your team members before proposing to further affirm the credibility of the team and confirm the feasibility of the proposal before the public. copper. With such an international proposal, it is impossible not to disclose the number of team members and the identities of all members. Regarding the detailed budget analysis, you have divided it into 2 subsections (1) marketing specification, and (2) specification with respective required amount for each item. But I think the present representation is too sketchy for a proposal asking for $90,000. I recommend restructuring and reallocating in detail the items that need funding and specifying the amount needed to be based on each job in the proposal, not a rough representation as it is now. . If you look at other proposals, you can see that they list very carefully the items related to funding, this is also a way to confirm feasibility with the community. I hope you will do the same to increase the feasibility of your proposal to the Cardano community. One more thing I need you to prove, is that if you don't get funding from Catalyst, will you continue to implement the proposal or not? And do you want to find other sources of funding to maintain the implementation of the proposal? My last question is about budget research, it contributes to confirming the feasibility of your proposal. In terms of resources needed to implement, it is not clear at the moment how many people you plan to mobilize to implement this proposal because the other team members cannot be identified yet. The combination of Cardano blockchain and artificial intelligence technology is difficult, it requires team members to have high expertise and techniques, and to adapt to the current age of blockchain information technology and AI. They have to be as skilled as experts to be able to execute a difficult and continental proposal. I have not seen the team show this. This is the third piece of advice that I give you that is quickly add the necessary human resources to perform. In terms of technical aspects to implementing the proposal if it is funded, as I said above, this is a difficult technology, it is a combination of Cardano blockchain and artificial intelligence, although I have not seen it yet. Get your unambiguous analysis of the field of artificial intelligence. All are presented at a not very thorough, slightly sketchy level. I think this is very important to confirm the feasibility of the project for the community. My fourth piece of advice is that the team quickly deploy details on how to do it, and analyze the technical aspects that need to be applied to confirm its feasibility. The one thing I'm happy about in the feasibility that you didn't present is clearly stating the risks involved in implementing the proposal. Although the risks you mentioned are related to the macro-level (economic market downturn, technological innovation world, schedule risks, etc...) I can temporarily accept this. . In summary, regarding the feasibility of the proposal, I feel that the team needs to add many criteria to further confirm that this proposal can be implemented and applied in practice. Specifically, about the criteria that need to be added, I have clearly stated above. I look forward to the team considering my comments and seeing them as positive. All my comments and questions are only to contribute to the improvement of this proposal. I disagree with the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap for milestones only outlines two phases without specifying the specific time to implement the stages. This does not make the transparency of the proposal clearer and makes it difficult for the community to audit, as well as making it difficult for the community to evaluate the project based on work progress. In my opinion, the team should do a more thorough analysis of the work roadmap and milestones, it is best to attach the tasks in chronological order (associate the tasks that need to be done with the weeks of the month or the tasks that need to be done). work in specific months of the year - eg January, February,...). The measurement of the project is shown through the indicators in a rather sketchy way without specific numbers. Unfortunately, I couldn't find KPIs or key metrics. The lack of these two indicators ((KPI); key metrics) makes the transparency and auditability of the proposal not clearly shown. The definition of project success is also not very thorough, very general, and not clear. So my advice is that you should add more metrics (KPIs) or key metrics and make it clearer what the definition of success looks like through specific numbers. Only in this way can the community recognize the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The positive I noticed here is that the team's problem description is quite clear, with several solutions.

TRYP will be used to exchange to known cryptocurrencies on exchanges. Besides this Dapp, partner will have access to market research and existing transport networks (such as airlines, taxis, self-driving cars). Overall this is good but they are not yet up to the challenge \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\". The content of the challenge is to support proposals that increase the number of proposals originating from East Asia into Catalyst, increasing the engagement of the Cardano and Catalyst communities with East Asian residents. Proposal is not a good idea for these criteria. I think the proposal should be submitted to the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge to receive funding because of the more consistent with this idea.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "As I mentioned in Impact, the proposal is not suitable for the challenge but here are a few criteria that we need to discuss when talking about the viability of the project if submitted to the right challenge:\nThe project has foreseen the risks and challenges involved. From there, prepare plans to reduce this risk. This is the careful preparation of the project in advance to ensure it can be implemented successfully. I agree with this information. However, for the project roadmap, the proposer did not specify the details of the steps to be taken. For example, at the product development stage, I have not seen specifically what time frame the proposed team will build the foundation for the DApp. That is, at what stage will the work including Dapp design, code writing, test run, audit be done? I think it would be more convincing if we could add this information. On the budget side: the proposal requires a total budget of $90,000. $10,000 for Marketing and $80,000 for Blockchain Development. However, I still wonder if $80,000 is reasonable? By jobs like:\n+Project management\n+Development and design\n+ Distribution mechanism\n+Reparation for audit\nThe above jobs have not yet specified how much the cost for each item. From there, a general number can be obtained to assess whether the cost is sufficient to implement or not.

This information is retrieved from the website or Dapp to measure user activity, helping to evaluate the product that has brought value to the customer or not. They are very convincing to me.

There is a timetable with associated milestones record. I think it would be better to divide this schedule by month and provide a document where you can keep track of the budget. A better description could be given of the technical aspects that are crucial for the implementation. It will be returned if another financing round is needed. The proposal has been scaled up in future challenges. it is good that the submitter has divided these into different categories. There are always a few possible options provided to make this run as smoothly as possible. I think that there is currently a little too little information in this proposal about implementation.

The project is divided into 2 phases. I think this is very generally explained. The breakdown of the budget does include the number of weeks per milestone.

(activity, mobility and transport companies are disconnected, services are becoming more expensive, more complex, inefficient, less safe. negative impact on the environment, concerns about safety and security.) The submitter explains what this application will do. I think it's better to tackle 1 problem per fund instead of tackling all of them directly. A number of KPIs are included in the proposal.

The scale of the impact is relatively large, affecting the entire transportation industry around the world, the object of this proposal will be all companies operating in the transport sector and tourists. This proposal meets the challenge of creating a DApp for transportation by combining AI & Blockchain Technology. It's TRYPTO, TRYPTO focuses on developing AI DApp/MaaS developed on Cardano Protocol. Through self-executing smart contracts, TRYP DApp will ensure optimal autonomy, transparency, trust, speed and safety, thus minimizing any risks associated with manipulation.\nAs for the risk presentation, I found the proposer to have argued well and presented it in detail. By assuming and accepting risks, there are three aspects of risk: cost, schedule, and performance. The proponent gave 3 primary risks and 3 secondary risks. From anticipating these risks during project implementation, the team has prepared solutions to minimize those risks.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The route is divided into two specific phases.

I hope the team can provide more information about the token release time and the project's tokenomics.\nThis proposed budget is for the early stages of development. This amount is only 18% of the total budget for Challenge. The team has allocated the budget to two specific expenses, which are marketing costs ($10,000) and blockchain development costs ($80,000).
