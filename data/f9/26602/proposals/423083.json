That way official would easily understand the necessity of adopting it. But just taking it as a stand alone initiative, this proposal may not develop video that will attract interest of the targeted group.\nThe videos to be created, will have what contents, and this will be created by whom?\nThe timeframe is reasonable and a budget with global numbers without much details on expense items. As for the proposers team, they have experience and have been working on other previous proposal funded by the project catalyst, but they haven't revealed their level implication in the cardano ecosystem, catalyst community. This would help people know that the team knows how the grand process works within that community.\nThe proposal appears being feasible to me, but I feel there are some important ides missing. It's full of theory than action oriented, and I would encourage proposers to implement it in a 2nd phase of the other one I've mentioned above.

That\u2019s the problem statement is not well captured to show the existence of a problem. However, we can infer from the solution, what the problem is. What\u2019s the main idea here? The objective of this project is  educate local Japanese government officials on the Cardano blockchain technology. In spite of Cardano presence in Asia, I think the workload in ensuring the growth of the Cardano community in Asia is very enormous, therefore this project presents the opportunity to create more awareness of the potentials and opportunities the cardano ecosystem presents in helping governments devise solutions that meet local expectations. Ultimately,  this presents the opportunity to improve the lives of the aging communities in Japan and to make the world a better place, an objective of the grow Cardano, grow Asia challenge setting.

I think that the impact that this project has on East Asian residents is low because at the high level like a state agency or government apparatus, it will guide the law (for the long term) rather than directly affect the way people live develop a project to develop Japanese residents. In addition, I have not yet realized how well the local government absorbs news because blockchain is only one part of their many concerns about social security as well as national development. Therefore, the information conveyed in the video is not highly impactful as well as creating the urgency to immediately change the policies coming from the local government.

Is there anything more to add?\nTherefore, the feasibility I think is average", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Indicators to measure progress as well as achieved results should be concretized into metrics for ease of audit.

The same can be said for some of the other milestones (i.e. what does programming and talent entails? how many talents will be recruited? how many videos will be made? etc.). The timeline is overall ambiguous on the specific activities that will be done and make it hard to judge the feasibility of the roadmap completion.\n\nThe budget was broken down into identifiable items but it lacks information regarding its cost justification.
