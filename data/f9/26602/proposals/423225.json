Among these lines, the solution stated is also pretty clear and addresses the problem within the challenge setting.

Marketing is one part of the proposal and considers one part of the funds requested but web development is another big part of the project, considering for example that a blog will be made and visual media will be constructed. Should the proposer hire a web developer to do this kind of work, it is something that should be stated in a rather clearer way.

In the proposed solution section, they mention to already have been creating original Cardano content in Japanese, although no examples are provided as reference. What lacks clarity regarding this proposal is how utilizing content from archived proposals of previous iterations will help with Cardano adoption in Japan. One might argue that Japan is already one of the countries with the highest Cardano adoption due to the ICO taking place in this country as well as Emurgo residing there. The idea of re-purposing information of previous proposals is a good one, but perhaps not for the goal of increasing awareness of Cardano to new users, since this new potential users will be more interested in the latest trend or topic in the cryptoverse.

I am a little more generous with this proposal because it\u2019s so low-cost but I would raise some concerns with the details of this proposal if it had requested more funding above the $10k range. First of all, the development of the Japanese Cardano base is relatively new and growing, so I want to be seeing proposals like this that are dedicated to the cause. As a content creator myself, I\u2019m well aware of the benefits of \u201cevergreen\u201d content that can always be returned to for years to come. This time of content helps media streams to secure long-term sustainability, consistent audience growth, and passively proliferating information that remains relevant. I\u2019m also aware of the many impacts of repackaging content such as compounded ROI and reduced labor for growth. In the short bits of information that have been provided here, it does communicate a lot for greater impact. However, from an objective standpoint this proposal should be including a lot more information/justification of the post-proposal world.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I rank this section a 4 because the tasks provided are not at all difficult to accomplish and the proposer has moderately sufficient skills to do so. A repackaging campaign is not difficult to accomplish, so my objective determination of feasibility is that this proposal can make it. Still, I would like to see improvements in every section of this proposal. The roadmap is a little light in what understanding it provides to voters about how much content is being reviewed, how many hours of labor each task requires, and bonus points for what each task would cost. The budget raises some concerns with it\u2019s lack of detail because it includes expenses that are not discussed in any other parts of the proposal. It allocates web development as an expense but the website appears to be already built out and there\u2019s no web developer cited for this job. It also allocates $2k to copywriting, which is confusing if all the content is created and produced solely by the proposer. Overall, this section seems entirely feasible and low-cost/risk but voters will definitely be wanting more detail if they are to vote favorably. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I rank this section a 4 because any features of this proposal that can be measured are being measured in a transparent and public way. I think the identified KPIs are appropriate for this proposal because it thoroughly tracks progress in multiple areas for each media medium. Where this section loses points for me is that it only identifies categories for KPIs and does not include targets. The best Catalyst proposals provide target metrics for the amounts of what they intend to produce, the engagement for what they produce, and the progressive development of what they produce. This proposal has plenty of room to add additional detail to how many blogs/articles will be written in a given period of time, how much new content will be produced at different milestones, and (most importantly) how may views/clicks/engagements each form of media receives. I rank positively for appropriate framing of auditiblity but I would expect voters to respond even more positively to these improvements.

All of this, in my opinion, is in line with the challenge's goal of expanding the ecosystem in East Asia, as well as one of Cardano's main goals of enabling open participation in all regions. The project will have a local impact because its target population is the Japan Cardano community, which was already engaged in the previous funds.

Most importantly, the content that is aimed to be repurposed\u00a0already exists, so the majority of the work will be media editing, that's always easier than starting from scratch. Nick Clarke, the person involved in the project, has a decate long experience with creative work and marketing, indicating that the proposed work is likely to succeed. Furthermore, the timeline is reasonable, as it includes exploration and search of existing Cardano content in Japanese, as well as the writing/editing phase, with the final goal of sharing the created content on their websites and partner channels. While the budget in the proposal is simple, it covers all costs associated with this type of project. The only thing that is missing is how the costs were calculated - how many hours are required at what cost, and so on.
