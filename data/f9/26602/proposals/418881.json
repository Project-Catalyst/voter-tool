By including support for 6 Asian languages (Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese, Japanese and Korean, Thai and Vietnamese), user confidence in East Asia could receive a boost as non-English speaking users would no longer have to rely on Youtube tutorials where to click and how to navigate its front-end. More broadly, local language support for Cardano wallets, which is currently non-existent, could open up an entirely new demographic for DApp adoption, as users currently intimated by \u201cforeign\u201d looking applications could be persuaded more easily to \u201cgive it a go\u201d when combining local-language DApps with local-language wallet support. It is in my opinion easy to underestimate the potential impact this seemingly simple task may have on the number of Cardano wallets and the use of ADA as a whole, given the large size of the target markets (i.e. China, East Asia and Southeast Asia where these 6 languages are widely spoken or understood) and the rapid adoption other technologies provided in local languages have enjoyed - QR code payments in China or trading of in-game items in Korea just as examples. Therefore, I agree strongly that this proposal addresses the challenge setting well and has potentially large impact. It is currently possible to use automatic translation using Google Chrome (right-clicking anywhere inside the in-browser Eternl extension), but the Google translation is quite poor and does not work in other browsers or on all devices.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers are upfront in stating that they do not have any of the language skills required to translate the Eternl wallet into 6 Asian languages.

As the success of this proposal is contingent on the launch of the v2 Update, it would have been helpful to elaborate the timeline and risk factors of this release within the scope of this proposal.\n\nThe Tastenkunst GmbH team behind Eternl have an impressive depth of development know-how and their existing, highly popular live wallet speaks for itself.

I understand that the proposers are highly respectable and have a successful working product, but it would be fairer to new proposers and less well-known teams if the same rules for transparency and auditability applied equally to all teams requesting Catalyst funding.\nSome aspects of milestones are mentioned in the Feasibility category, but are contingent on the successful launch of v2 of the Eternl wallet and should have been matched with suitable performance metrics and a timeline allowing the auditability of the project.\nI am not a \"stickler for rules\" and think that confidence in progress tracking could be instilled by for example providing a Project Stage Diagram anywhere in the proposal, or elaborating where dialogue with the translating community members is taking place and will be formalized, so that curious community members could check on the exchange and gain an understanding of the implementation process.
