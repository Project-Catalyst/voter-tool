Therefore, probably the English language amongst people which have internet access are quite high.\nOther important data is that the cypto ownership in this country is about 6,12% (https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/), meaning that Vietnamese people are willing to adopt this technology. They are very open to crypto and would use crypto as online payment method (https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-vietnam/).\n\nThat being said, there is a huge opportunity to ADA in Vietnam. However, since the English there seems not to be a huge problem, I\u2019m quite thoughtful about this projects impact. It\u2019s clear translating materials match with the challenge and intend to facilitate the penetration of these content in the country and to the people, however it doesn\u2019t seem that it\u2019s mandatory to do it. Therefore, I\u2019ll discount some points in here.\n\nAs the proposer stated, the fund risk is very complex. Since you need to hire translators, it is imperative to have a cash flow in order to continue this project. Therefore, it is mandatory to think of a strategy (I\u2019ve seen that you\u2019ve said that you have these strategies, however you\u2019ve not told us what it is) to monetize it and continue to translate. More than that, maybe the volume of people willing to translate materials is bigger than your capacity to translate. Therefore, you\u2019ll have a huge problem \u2013 a very big queue or a need to select content to translate. These are points that should be sorted out.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal objective is to translate content of its Alliance website (link provided) to Vietnamese and CNFT projects to Vietnamese-English-Vietnamese. The proposal states that to accomplish this they will hire a translator and, that being said, it\u2019s quite feasible.\n\nTranslating content might be tricky \u2013 there are lots of things to consider like cultural meaning variations, technical stuff etc. Therefore, it might be good to hire a certified translator to certify all the translation. And, every contact I ever had with a certified translator they charge by counting word. Therefore, it would be better if the proposal had given its required budget by associating the average length of a CNFT and the length of its website. The way it was given, give us, voters, no clue of how many proposals it means to translate, e.g.\n\nOvercoming the budget issue, there are other two that could be accounted, them both related with the quantity of proposals requiring to be translated (language-english-language). Meaning that this could create long queues and demanding the proposer of this project to choose which submitted proposal should be translated.\n\nBoth of the issues mentioned above could risk this project operation.\n\nSince Vietnamese people are already open to crypto, it could be interesting to separate part of the asked budget to invest in marketing and attract people to use this platform.\n\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "First, KPI seems good.

I agree that language differences is a big problem for projects. Korean people are well known for their adoption of crypto currencies, yet I see a lack of discourse in Korean threads on CNFT social media such as Discord, however, I don't think this proposal will have much impact. They are asking for $7500, but it is unclear how much each translation would cost. The roadmap states it aims to have at least two projects translated by Q1 2023. As someone who lives in Korea and has worked on many translation projects, I estimate each translation would cost no more than $500, so I would expect a much more ambitious roadmap for $7500. They mention becoming self-funded. How might this be achieved?\nI think it would be much better for CNFT projects to reach out to their own communities if they need any translation work. There is no shortage of people who would help with translation if a bounty were offered by the project.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It certainly seems feasibly that the project could successfully translate two CNFT projects and the CNFT Alliance website by Q1 2023.

Or is some of that being used for the team and costs, is so, how much? If the full amount goes to the translator, how many projects will they complete for this sum?

I have learned and updated about the Cardano ecosystem a lot from document translations or videos, so the means of content transmission are also very important for the Korean community to understand.

The number of projects to be translated in Q4 and Q1 is not clear. In the proposal, at least 2 projects should be recorded. Translated projects should have a weekly or monthly implementation plan.

The solution offered by the proposer is to translate fully CNFT Alliance website, and then to offer translation services and aim to have fully translated two NFT projects. The basics for the impact of this proposal lies in the amount of speakers \u2013 claiming that more than 75 mil people speak Korean, which could potentially lead to the onboarding. I think the overall idea is fine, but it would be nice to somehow consider also the fact, that out of these 75 mil people, some can also speak another language, such as eng, thus these language barriers would not be affecting them. Overall, I agree that more translated content we have, more people can eventually participate. Nevertheless, to support the potential impact of the proposal, the proposers could have provided current number of visits of their website, because we do not know whether it is well known, visited, or actually overlooked site, thus, the impact would be 0.

The lack of details is not really providing confidence, when having 3 months dedicated for hiring and translating the website. It Is very unclear how many days you will be hiring, and if you end up having no translator at the end of first quarter, then obviously you will not translate the website on time. Thus, some milestones should have been set, to provide a better overview. At the same time, since the website is already set, you could have outlined how many tabs/text is going to be translated, and how much time you expect it will take to translate. Regarding the translation of the NFT projects, it should have been outlined what type (example) of NFT project you have in mind \u2013 visiting your website, there were also NFT Games, which definitely have more content, than an NFT project where you translate only e.g. attributes of each NFT in the particular series. The budget requested is 7500 USD, but no expected time spent, or hourly rate is disclosed, thus, it is hard to tell whether it will be enough or no. If you plan to have at least 2 projects till the end of Q1 2023, then I would assume the budget is adjusted to that. Saying you do not know the demand is decreasing the feasibility, because you admit it might not be enough. The team is consisting from 10 members (if counting correctly), with vast bio provided + linked in profiles. Besides that, website looks very nice and working (even tough there is not much content I would say), thus I am sure they are capable of having the website running.
