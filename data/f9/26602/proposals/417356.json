As we know, blockchain technology is now frequent headlines, and its knowledge is very vast. In fact, more and more people want to have deep understanding especially about decentralized Cardano blockchain. Due to language barrier, it is not easy for Japanese or Vietnamese community to access official source of knowledge that most terms are related to technical and written in English. To solve this problem, the proposer suggests the idea of building a 2-way interaction website called Vcoincheck Library between posters and viewers which is now in Phrase 2 of development (funded Phrase 1). Besides 2 current products Vcoincheck.io and Cardanolibrary.net, Vcoincheck Quizz will be the third component of Vcoincheck Library which is an integrated solution for users. I think, their solution is suitable for the challenge \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\" because this proposal stores blockchain knowledge, enables Japanese and Vietnamese community access to Cardano, Catalyst, blockchain information faster, and  build a stronger and closer Cardano community, at the same time, promote the development of Cardano ecosystem. However, there are some unexpected risks in delivering this project successfully, in which the proposer states it clearly and gives a quite detailed solution for imitigating these risks. For example, to ensure the quality of writers (both proficient in Japanese with basic knowledge of blockchain), they suggest opening 2 training courses to educate their team from non-knowledgeable to knowledgeable people.  In reality, they already trained their first team and they are translating articles with basic knowledge, with provided link for reference. In short, I would like to give them full marks for this part because this proposal solves an urgent need of knowledge and updates about blockchain in general and Cardano blockchain in particular for Japanese, Vietnamese communities in a very detail way. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is very good. For the plan, it is easy to visualize the development process in practice of this proposal. Their plan will last for 4 months in which the proposer is very specific on exactly what would be done for each month, and these activities would be carried out on a weekly basis. For example, for the first month, I know their flow of work from researching to writing, translating to checking and editing process, how many articles would be written for each topic in both Vietnamese and English, how many articles would be translated into Japanese,..I am more convinced of this project as this is an ongoing project (funded), it means they does not start from scratch at this phrase. Regarding the budget, the total required expense is $28,500 which I think, it is a reasonable for the amount of work delivered and the number of people commited to this proposal. I know exactly how much would be paid per article, how much per translation page, correction fee per page, ... Also, the payment of reward for most valuable comment is also explained very detailed, it is 30 dollars for an article, but not more than 3. So, it is easy for us to understand this part. Finally, in terms of the team, I think these members are qualified and experienced to carry out this project well. Through their profile's introduction, they show a lot of confidence: I know their name, position, expertise and last experience with social media Telegram and Linkedin provided which I could find out more about them intimately.

The content is also well-edited with more concise and knowledge compression to fit more user-centric reading behaviors. The solution is an update of Libraries version 1.0. What makes the proposal more interesting is the quiz session to promote more and more two ways of interaction from the community.

The budget was mostly allocated for the main tasks from original language/translation/editing and other additional features (quiz) It is suggested that the budget should be broken further into project timing within four months of the propsal milestones. These would make the budget release more reliable and transparent for the Catalyst budget allocation and proof of life in the following months. A slippage fee was also carefully added to avoid the price of ADA after receiving funds.\nWhat makes this proposal really stand out is the well-detailed milestones laid out, albeit of 4-month project management.

At the same time, it is creating a place for knowledge exchange between the Japanese Community and the Vietnamese Community, developing a stronger and stronger Cardano Community. In addition, To encourage and encourage the spirit of user contribution in the community, it is expected that there will be rewards (gifts or cash) for users with good opinions, a sense of well built. therefore I firmly believe that this proposal is fully scalable to address future challenges well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "the proponent has provided clear, detailed evidence with attachments about the role, duties, relevant skills and experience required to implement each member's proposal. The proponent determines specifically the type and number of members in each necessary group, including the leading team, the core team, and the expert team (Japanese content team). The proponent provided a reasonable budget that was clearly outlined and broken down into definable and easily verifiable items. Specifically, the proponent requests a Total Budget: of 28500 USD which is broken down into items such as a Writing fee of 4500 USD (Vietnamese), an English translation fee of 2000 USD, a Community Incentive fee of 3000 USD, and a Fee translation of 9100 USD (From Vietnamese to Japanese), Translation correction fee 4900 USD (Japanese), Proposed Administration Fee: 2000 USD, Website Functionality Upgrade (Quizz): 1000 USD, The proponent has applied for additional reserve funds to prevent ADA slippage: $2000 (7% of the proposed budget) I think the provisional budget of 7% of the project's budget is reasonable and suitable. fit The proposal outlines a realistic timetable with a specific, detailed plan to implement the project in 4 months and breaks down the work for each week, and has specific goals for each month. The proponent also considered the risks that prevent the successful implementation of the project and also provided specific measures to address that risks.

Indicators that determine the success of the project are tracked at the source of the database: Vcoincheck.io (website) or Cardanolibrary.net. When this project is successful The users in the community have more income from rewards for their good ideas, and good construction sense. This proposal will create a connection between the East Asian community. The proponent clearly described the problem Knowledge and news about Cardano are mostly in English, difficult to reach the Japanese community, affecting the expansion of Cardano...Knowledge of Cardano and blockchain is very large, and the proponent has also given specific, clear, and understandable solutions to solve the given problem. This proposal is sponsored as a \"Cardano and blockchain library\" proponent in fund 8, which is a plus in terms of the team's credibility.

The articles are written in 3 languages \u200b\u200bEnglish, Vietnamese and Japanese with the aim of reaching Japanese and Vietnamese communities -2 very large and potential communities in Asia.\nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge because of the following reasons. \nFirstly, Japan has a population of more than 120 million people (ranked 11th in the world), Japan also has a lot of young enterprises who want access to blockchain and Cardano projects, besides Japan has a large number of ADA holders. Vietnam has a population of 99 million people (ranked 13th in the world). Vietnam has a young population and an increasing number of young people who are tech-savvy and want to participate in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, meeting information needs about Blockchain and Cardano to these two markets will have a great impact on the expansion of the Cardano community in East Asia in general and in the world in particular.\nSecondly, the solution in this Phase 2 has many new points to increase the 2-way interoperability of the library, for example, users can suggest article topics and users can give reviews and comments on the article.  Users can post their own articles and receive rewards if the article is of high quality. Besides, there is a quiz section for users to challenge and self-assess their knowledge level... These new features will create more interactions with the community, creating a more connected, interactive community.\nThe proposal`s plan for each month is: Searching and inquiring about library content (week 1 - week 2); Writing articles summarizing knowledge (week 2 \u2013 week 4); Translate into Japanese (week 1 - week 4); Check and editing (from week 4~). The target for each month: 30 article posts on the library in Japanese, Vietnamese, and English.  As far as I understand the final step of checking and editing will be done in the 3rd and 4th week of the month and article posting will be done mainly in the last week of the month. This will affect the interactivity of the website. Because for a website, having new posts every day will attract more interaction. Therefore, I recommend that the proposer consider scheduling posting times to ensure that new articles are posted every day. Because of the above analysis, I rate the proposal 5 points in the Impact category.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully because of the following reasons:\nFirst, the project team has 15 people divided into 2 teams: The core team and the Specialist team. The core team consists of 7 members who have deep knowledge of Cryptocurrency investment, blockchain technology, and blockchain projects. The specialist team is the Japanese content team consists of 8 members, most of them are fluent in Vietnamese and Japanese and have experience as translators and interpreters. Besides, the team includes Japanese members and members who have knowledge of Cardano and Blockchain. I have checked the team members' profiles on Linkedin, Facebook links, and Japanese certificates, and I noticed that the team has the right knowledge and experience to implement the proposal.\nSecond, The proposal is planned to be implemented in 4 months with the goal of publishing 100 articles in 3 languages \u200b\u200bEnglish, Vietnamese and Japanese. The plan is broken down for each month, 30 posts per month. Each month, there is a detailed work item plan by week. The plan is very specific and clear. On the other hand, the team has experience in implementing a similar plan in Phase 1, so I think the plan will be implemented successfully.\nThird, The total cost of the proposal is 28500 USD, including the Article writing fee (45USD/article), English Translating fee (20USD/ article), Japanese Translating fee (13 USD/page), Website admin fee (2000USD), Website function upgrade (Quizz): 1000 USD\u2026Most of them ae is clear and reasonable.\nHowever, in the Japanese translation section, they propose a Japanese Translation correction fee of 7 USD/page, while in the English translation section, there is no Translation correction fee. I think the author should give a reason why this section is needed.\nBecause of the above analysis, I rate the project 5 points in the Feasibility category.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposed workflow is clearly divided by week, and the results are summarized by month. The target is  30 article posts per month in 3 languages \u200b\u200bEnglish, Japanese and Vietnamese, consist 10 on the topic of Cardano, 10 on the topic of Catalyst, and 10 on the topic of Blockchain. The articles will be posted on Vcoincheck.io and Cardanolibrary.net websites. Roadmaps with milestones and timelines are clearly laid out. I think people can easily track the progress of the project till the end.\nAlthough the project team has depth knowledge of Cardano, Catalyst, and Blockchain as well as experience in translation, which guarantees the quality of the articles, however, I think the author should consider adding more indicators to evaluate the quality of the article objectively, such as the minimum number of words per article, number of article views, number of good reviews on the article .v.v.\nWith the above analysis, I rate the project 5 points in the category of Auditability. I hope that if the project is funded, my contributions will be considered and implemented.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3494", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 13774, "q0": "The proposal is a project that received funding in the previous period. They talk about adding more knowledge articles to their library, allowing users to contribute to the library, and making library content more diverse. making the content in their library more practical for the reader is a good option for them. It's very clever that readers will quiz on their understanding. This project, which they have done to disseminate information about Cardano, dazzles with its development for users' comments. They will catch a different perspective on supply and demand.In order to enable the Japanese community access Cardano and Catalyst more quickly, reduce the language barrier, and foster development, this proposal creates a location to keep blockchain knowledge and information in a highly reliable manner.Additionally, the website includes a platform for evaluating the quality of cryptocurrency projects. Users can assess and research the necessary pertinent information without consulting other sources.They have a feature that suggests posts that could be improved. Users who have good comments, are kind and helpful to others, and are endorsed by many users will be rewarded and encouraged. In the knowledgeable Fund 8 they funded a proposal to open 2 training courses to train people without knowledge to become people of knowledge.

However, to understand blockchain, it takes a lot of time and effort in researching and memorizing the knowledge related to blockchain. Since the knowledge may be written in English and that is a hard barrier for those who are non-native English speaking. Thus, some users may feel less motivated and their interest in the blockchain would also be reduced. This proposal offers a quite convenient and highly effective solution for this obstacle. The team proposer has explained the possible risks and challenges in their plan and recommended detailed solutions that I think are fruitful a lot. I am quite satisfied with the way they presented the idea and then explain it chronologically. Definitely, this proposal impact would not only on the users\u2019 knowledge but also Cardano\u2019s growth.

Firstly, the budgeted plan is written in detail and explains which costs would be calculated by which formulae and the costs\u2019 role on the sheet. That means we can easily catch how our money is spent. I think $28500 is a reasonable and acceptable amount. On the other hand, with the proposal\u2019s members, I think through the provided information about them like who they are, how long they have worked with this/that field, we can know clearly who we are financing for, and do they reserve our fund. By the way, I am impressed by the experience of Mr. Sang Nguyen. His knowledge is not only about cryptocurrency but also his experience on the stock exchange, as well as the forex. It is such a diversity of knowledge resources.

I think quite easy for people in the community to keep an eye on the progress and then make an evaluation or complain about the achievement of the proposal. The translated content into other languages such as English and Japanese can be easily tracked on the website. By the way, it's easy for us to visit the attached website to keep track of all the posts they published that month. On the other hand, the keyword \u201csuccess\u201d is defined as quite a fascinating viewpoint and illustrates the expectation of the team on this time participation. I am curious about how the audience will rate the quality of the translated document. Therefore, I suggest the team consider whether to provide or not a statistical report about the effectiveness of the proposal by showing the audience\u2019s ratings.
