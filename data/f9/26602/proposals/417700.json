Therefore, a guide that provides a rudimentary introduction and operation of the site would be highly useful.\n\nThe proposer has been actively disseminating information on CNFT for some time and has an excellent track record in many areas, such as holding online events and lecturing at the Blockchain Expo. Based on such experience, we expect that this proposal will lead to further expansion of the community by further broadening the scope and influence of its activities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal clearly outlines the necessary members for the activities, a roadmap divided into three phases of three months, and an implementation plan for each phase, which will enable us to fully understand what this project aims to achieve.\n\nWe are aware that the team will be composed mainly of proposers who have experience in CNFT activities to date and who have connections with each NFT community and who understand Vietnamese to ensure the implementation of the plan. However, I am a little concerned about the fact that there are no personnel who understand Chinese at this time.\n\nThe budget is set out in detail for each activity item, and while it is clear and clear, it seems a little excessive for the amount of funds needed for activities over the next three months. For example, \"Document Preparation\" and \"Writer/Navigator\" are divided and totaled separately, but the necessity of this difference cannot be seen from the proposal. \n\nIn addition, we feel that the cost for document creation is not so much as to require the effort to create new content from scratch, since there are existing references such as blog articles, and $500 for a 4,000-word document seems a bit excessive from a general market perspective. However, an explanation of the reasonableness of such a fee would be more persuasive.\n\nGiven the goal of sustainable operation going forward, we believe that more scrutiny is required from a cost-selective and focused perspective.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think it is excellent that the entire plan is divided into three phases, and that in this proposal the phases are further divided into detailed one-month intervals, with a concrete implementation plan and KPIs for each. \nWhile many proposals simply state, \"We will complete the product,\" I think it is desirable to present deadlines in phases and set target values for each phase, not only for third-party audit visibility, but also for progress management within the proposal team.\n\nIn addition to the number of contents created, we would like to see the proposal include as an outcome measure not only the number of contents created, but also the maturity of the community and the number of new participants, which is what this proposal is essentially aiming for.\n\nWe have evaluated various Catalyst proposals in the past, and found that many proposals were completed after only a set of contents were created, and most of them did not examine the essential contents and effects of the project carefully.\n\n In this proposal, under the item of project success, \"500 Cardano wallets created in 3 months\" is listed, and we assume that this is close to the outcome measure. In addition to this, more specific examples that could be considered include: the number or rate of increase in the number of participants on the discord and Twitter from the start to the end of the phase; the number of people who accessed the CNFT site who viewed the content (as determined by link analysis, etc.); and surveys of satisfaction with the content and events through surveys, etc. Satisfaction surveys, etc. \n\nBy establishing these effectiveness metrics, third-party evaluations can be conducted more fairly, and the team will be able to enhance their activities and motivation.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2061", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 6, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1209, "q0": "Currently, language support projects for countries and regions where English is not spoken are very necessary.

However, only phase one is broken down into distinguishable activities to be executed in each of the three months. Moreover, the budget is sensible, it is broken down into identifiable items and each of them has an adequate estimation.

With the rapidly growing East Asian Community demanding demand for Cardano documents and news but having problems with language differences, this idea is a possible solution. Please present the problem clearly and convincingly. It offered solutions to a problem in the growth of the Cardano community, the growth of the East Asian community. The specific solution of the proposal is that in partnership with Cardano and the artist communities in Japan, China (Chinese-speaking Community), Vietnam, Korea and Africa, we are developing a guide largest Cardano NFT beginner in East Asia, information on CNFT in Africa and the West, and a community for people who want to collaborate internationally through CNFT. The team proposes to give specific examples in the presentation with arguments with numbers, a detailed survey report that is feasible and highly effective. It shows that the proposed group has studied very carefully and in detail the needs of the East Asian community to answer the question: How can East Asians learn CNFT community information without being hindered by language barriers?.

In the first risk, There is a lot of translation work to provide large amounts of CNFT information to non-English speaking countries but manpower is limited. This requires a lot of human resources, and your solution is to increase staffing costs for the staff, but you can develop an automatic translation tool in the future that will use it. to reduce labor costs. On the second risk is the issue of needing employees to create videos on how to create CNFTs and use cases, employees to follow Discord and employees to open Twitter Spaces, and more. then the team proposed to come up with a solution that would allocate staffing costs to ease the burden on employees with long working hours. The last risk you mentioned is the difficulty of gathering and disseminating information from overseas communities and how you would address this risk would be to recruit EU and US CNFT members for your project itself. Through it, you create a collaborative space between Western CNFT projects and East Asian CNFT projects and will also ask Western members to help you widely promote the exported CNFT projects. from East Asia.

The authors point out that Japan, Vietnam, and Chinese-speaking countries are extremely potential markets where many individuals and companies want to participate in the NFT market but they have difficulty accessing information sources and data in English. They also show data on the English proficiency of the people of these countries. There are not many people who can speak English well in Asian countries such as Japan, China, and Vietnam. I agree with the above analysis and I think that there is a great demand for access to information about CNFT and Cardano in the native language in Asian countries. If this is met, it will have a great impact on the rapid growth of the Asian CNFT community.\nAs a Vietnamese native speaker, I have searched for the contents that the proposal aims to implement such as \u201cWhat is Cardano and CNFT, How to buy ADA and make the Wallet for Cardano Native taken, How to mint CNFTs\u2026\u201d in Vietnamese on the Internet and a lot of results were offered. It proves that basic information like this has already been translated and shared. If they want to share this information again, they need to do it in newer, more attractive, and easier-to-understand ways. \nThe authors also offer other ways to share information such as: sharing important information quickly by tweeting on Twitter accounts, and holding seminars on Twitter to promote interaction between Western and Eastern communities\u2026I think this will be a good and effective way to share information.\nBased on the above analysis and adjustments I rate the Impact category 4 points.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is planned to be divided into 3 phases, this proposal serves for phase 1. Phase 1 lasts for 3 months (2022 October, November, and December) with a budget of 31.500 USD. The goal of phase 1 is to create CNFT resources for 3 languages: Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese. The resources are 6 videos and 6 documents on basic content such as: What is Cardano and CNFT, How to buy ADA and make the Wallet for Cardano Native taken, How to mint CNFTs\u2026; seminars on Twitter twice a month, sharing important information by document once a week, updating quick information daily on Twitter account.\nIn my opinion, the proposal has a very clear, specific plan. The allocation of funds is quite detailed and reasonable.\nThe core team consists of many members with experience in blockchain research, Cardano, NFT projects as well as experience in translation. There are members who are fluent in English, Japanese, and Vietnamese, but there are no members from Chinese-speaking countries. Of course, when implementing the proposal, they can hire translators, but if there is a member who speaks native Chinese and has a background in CNFT, the team will have a deeper understanding of the local market and information needs of the Chinese-speaking community.\nWith the above analysis, I rate the Feasibility category 4 points.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a clear plan for each month, KPIs that define the target of each month.

I love detailed action plans like yours.\nYour budget for this proposal is $31,500 clearly outlined and broken down into categories that can be identified and estimated by the community.\nI have one more suggestion, why don't you build a Website channel, and the Website now also has a multilingual function and users can switch between languages \u200b\u200bwith just 1 click. WordPress is a good platform to build a Website, easy to build and operate.\nIn addition, creating a Website can also create menus for users to find the desired links more quickly, You can also save documents on it with files like .Pdf, .Docx, .xlsx, video MP4, Postcat.... so that users can easily download, and if there is more website, it is necessary to add a few items in the plan and ask for more funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The problem description and the metrics to evaluate are clear, the solution and proposal fit the challenge, the roadmap is well-directed, and your project can be trusted.\nIndicators and KPIs have been clearly stated with specific target numbers, which are obviously good indicators of project success, as the selected outputs will clearly indicate it. the number of wallets Cardano created in the given time period, and the number of videos to educate the Asian community.\nAnd if successful after the next 3 stages, I hope that the group will recruit more experienced members in countries like Indonesia, and Bangladesh because these Asian countries also have a large young population to expand the scope.

Thus, this proposal tends to build a community of CNFT in East Asia that provides guidance for beginners from those East Asia countries and information on CNFT. Since the proposer realizes that the Japanese market as well as the markets from East Asia are becoming one of the most potential ones that have a large number of developers, users that are concerned about blockchain but they are not good at using English. Therefore, if this proposal is successful, it can contribute to the growth and diversity of our Cardano community and inhabitants by creating opportunities to access CNFT projects from the Western for those non-native English speakers as I mentioned above. I think this proposal is really suitable with those criterions that are offered in the challenge of \"Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano\". Obviously, the targeted market of this proposal is in East Asia. Moreover, the proposal will be a tremendous marketing strategy for CNFT projects so that the cooperating relationship among East Asia community and Western community through the Soudan NFT bridge to conduct this goal.

Furthermore, in each phase, there are descriptions about assigned tasks and the KPI setting for those phases in detail. It assists not only people in the community to keep track but also the teammate to avoid the confusing chronological tasks of work. Thereby guaranteeing the working progress and the final result in each phase as well as in final. On the other hand, the costs which are included in the budget plan are described obviously. We can understand how those amounts are computed and the use of them toward the proposal. For example, in the cost of creating videos, there is the payable wage for making 2 videos in 3 months and the payable wage for the editor in those 3 months. I have a compliment on this section due to its specificity. Moreover, for the human resource, I have no comment or questions for this part since every information is given in such a detailed description.
