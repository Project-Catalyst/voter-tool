The proposer seeks to solve the problem by providing official Cardano documentation translated into videos in Burmese to educate their community in Sri Lanka about Cardano and the ecosystem. This proposal addressed the challenge by stating that they will prepare a group of people who are willing to contribute to the ecosystem. Proposer stated that the project will bring information to people in their local language that would attract more developers, which is part of the goals of Cardano in Fund9 to bring in more developers into the ecosystem. The project fits within the challenge because it seeks to bring people of Myanmar into the Cardano community, thus the project seeks to add value to the ecosystem by bringing in new community in India. \nMention is made of key metrics and goals as the number of subscribers to the LanCardano Youtube channel, the number of average views per video, number of comments per video and number of watching hours to be measured. All these mentioned key metrics fit into the challenge well. \nThe project also fits into the challenge by taking into consideration how it will scale to address future challenges by bringing in more content. The proposal meets Fund9 objectives because the project will enable more people to become empowered to contribute to the ecosystem and participate because they would have understood Cardano through the project work.\nThe proposer mentioned the risks associated with this proposal and how to mitigate the risks in detail, mentioning a few here as incidence of COVID variant causing lockdowns and absence of Master Translators due to illness. Mitigating factors were mentioned; among others is that they will have many Translators so that in case of illness they will have a replacement easily. \nWith all these factors, the challenge has been effectively addressed by this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposer has laid out a comprehensive plan for the project. Mention is made of launching LanCardano Youtube Channel with 6 videos daily and a total of 10-20 videos at end of 3 months. They aim to bring out one translated video every 3 days, which is quite comprehensive. Proposer mentioned that the original videos will have a pace of 140 words per minute and that around 2 hours of content will be published per month. The timeline is quite reasonable. The proposer mentioned that in case of an emergency fund, they will request in Fund10 which is good for planning. The plan is detailed and clear by the facts provided.\nThe budget total of $11150 is reasonable and it is broken down comprehensively showing detailed cost for transcription, dubbing, editing, publishing, social media campaign, contingency fee and fees for Translators. The highest cost is allotted to Translators fees of $6650 which is more than 50% of the total budget and it is reasonable because translation content forms larger part of the work.\nThe team that is going to implement the project is made up of four experienced members with skills in marketing, translation, creative writing, entrepreneurship, etc. They are also Cardano community members who are CA/PAs, vPAs, Voters and active members in Town Halls, Circle and Challenge team. Linkedin references of the team members have been provided by the proposal for further referencing. The team is likely to implement the project successfully. The proposer mentioned that they are likely to ask for more support from Catalyst in future proposals, and the team has other proposals in other challenges as well.\nWith all the facts above, this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has provided a clear roadmap for the project. Mention was made of clear solutions to the project. This proposal mentioned that they will measure the progress of work by the number of followers to the LanCardano Youtube Channel, the number of average views per video, the number of watching hours, the number of comments, the number of shares and number of downloads. All these will make tracking of progress successful and lead to successful auditing. \nThe project's success will be seen in the awareness created in Cardano in the Burmese speaking community and thereby bringing in more new members into the ecosystem. Mention was made that they will continue to build the channel in future funds and grow the ecosystem. All these ensured that the objectives are clear and can be audited easily. \nThe proposal is new and SDG rating provided fit the proposal. \nThe information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal.

To address this problem the proposer will translate official ADA content, creating dubbed videos.\n\n\nBy diminishing the language barriers, it adds value to ADA ecosystem because it will reach a part of the world population that had no entries in it. Therefore, since ADA aims to be the world used blockchain, it must have content in every language, promoting knowledge and encouraging people to use it. Therefore, the proposal align with this challenge. \n\nA point that should be mentioned is that this proposal\u2019s bottleneck is the quantity of translating material that the translators can manage. Therefore, in order to scale it is good to have lots of translators involved in this proposal in the future.\n\n\nThe goal of this proposal is reach every Burmese speaker, which also aligns with the aim of reaching the maximum people as possible of ADA.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately the proposal roadmap is confuse. It does not have a exact quantity of videos per month, therefore it makes hard to evaluate the possibility of being done or what to expect.\n\n\nThe budget is clear, reveling the experience that the team have. It gives clue of how much they can produce and the time length of the content proposed.\n\n\nThe risks are well defined and the mitigation is also explained. However, there is a huge risk that must be taken into account which is the choice of the content. Since the team will be responsible to choose the videos, it might happen a poor choice. Therefore, maybe creating a more interactive profile and make the viewers choose the content might mitigate this risk and have the possibility of creating more engagement in the Channel \u2013 which creates more awareness and monetization possibility. Another possibility is add a hashtag for specifics content and then measure which is the winner.\n\n\nIt was provided the team LinkedIn links exposing the experience. However, there is not a specific marketing member, which would be good to include since the aim is having lots of viewers.\n\n\nAs mentioned, the bottleneck of this proposal is the quantity of content managed by the translators, therefore, in order to scale and add more platforms to diffuse content, it\u2019ll need to hire more translators (since it\u2019s a mechanical project)\n\nThat being said, the proposal has a high probability of being done and, if managed the raised risks there is a high probability of success.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\nIt is quite easy to know if the video was uploaded in YT, however this proposal is missing a method to verify the in between implementation.

Due to the Cardano Project's lack of official Burmese material. Therefore, Burmese speakers are unable to learn in their own language.

The problem presented is well explained along with the solution by providing burmese language to attract more cardano blockchain users which hopefully there will also be a new cardano developer and community, not only from sri lanka but also all Burmese-speaking people around the world. In the explanation of the main risks and their mitigation, improvements still need to be made, for example by inviting more people who can speak Burmese and teaching them about cardano in general so that they can help create dubbing content in Burmese or find contact with friends in Myanmar / Burma so they can collaborate better. We can also take advantage of automatic translation from YouTube to Burmese. And regarding the conversion of ADA to fiat, I think it would be better to pay in ADA instead of exchanging it on p2p binance, so that contributors can adapt to ADA and its ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project work process is described in detail with a time schedule of 3 months along with the budget and work team.

But the team will of course coordinate the general work of the project and collaborate with all who can accomplish the goal of content in Burmese. It would be nice if in this session the topics that would be used as dubbing content were explained, starting from the introduction of cardano to the target for all those who speak Burmese to be able to adapt to cardano.

Through the translation of documentation and the production of content videos geared toward Burmese speakers, the proposal will make it easier for the Burmese-speaking population to have access to Cardano-related material.
