Furthermore, the proposer and co-workers are students who are still learning IT, and this is a fantastic opportunity for them to have open incentivized participation in the Cardano ecosystem, that is one of Cardano's main pillars. Furthermore, as stated in the proposal, if the app development is successful, there is a possibility of expanding the app to other regions in southern Asia and possibly to other sports as well. The proposal is also very much in line with the challenge as\u00a0it is aiming to introduce Cardano and create Catalyst community among students in Vietnam who are the most likely to adopt novel technologies such as blockchain. The described impact is local, with a focus on developing apps for local stadiums, sports venues, and so on.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project, in my opinion, has a good chance of success (with some issues) for the following reasons: 1) The timetable is very specific, outlining the detailed steps required to refine the team and the idea, build the app and the platform, and leave enough room for testing in the community. 2) While the team is made up entirely of students, the proposal includes a searchable list of team members, as well as a github repository (but\u00a0with little recent\u00a0activity and content). The roles in this project are assigned to team members in advance, which makes the project more feasible. 3) The budget is appropriate and relatively low, reflecting the low costs of services in Vietnam, and the almost all of the costs are meaningful; however, it would be preferable to specify more\u00a0the costs for Backed programming and so on in the same way as the\u00a0\"idea building and development\"\u00a0are - how many people/hours of work/at what rate is required. 5) I see the team's lack of prior experience with Cardano projects as a potential risk, but everyone needs a starting point, and the team appears to be motivated, as they state they will return to Catalyst for further funding in the future.

While this end product described is not immediately addressing the needs of the challenge, it is the journey of the team, and also for the future users of their upcoming app, that will educate the community on blockchain and cardano, in line with the setting of this challenge. This is how i derive the impact alignment of this project, though, it was not very clearly stated in the proposal, perhaps because it was translated from another language. The proposal can be further improved in the future by writing a problem statement in line with the challenge setting, not \"Blockchain application for buying and selling sports tickets\", leading voters and assessors to think that the problem at hand for the project was to fix ticketing secondary market. the same can be said for their narrative throughout the remaining impact section of the proposal - to phrase it in alignment to the challenge setting, not for voters and assessors to guess and justify the alignment.\n\nThe solution proposed is simple and understandable, and at their budget, is the simplest way to conduct market validation - via interviews and through social networks. The proposers demonstrate clarity as well, detailing their evaluation criteria for the outcome of the survey (as part of their market research), and down to the level of app details and features to develop including method of payment as part of the whole customer journey. They also are clear about their method of reaching out, where exactly will be their first 2 spots of target venue, and the sport in focus itself, which is football. This helps narrow down the scope alot and shows the team of 3 can focus. Additionally, they demonstrated that scalability was part of their consideration, where they intend to expand to other southeast asia countries later in 2024, giving a long horizon for the project.\n\nTheir risks identified is valid, and i see no need to complicate a simple project like this further. they mentioned things like price fluctuations, lack of reach, limited experience of the team as students. As an assessor, and i hope for voters as well, i appreciate that they kept it concise.

I'm no developer myself, but i imagine these developments to be more complex than not, and usually this would rack up the cost of the project, unless this student project team somehow has the knowledge and ability between themselves to do this. However, i may be wrong, and am open to be corrected. \n\nthe profiles shared of the proposing team is also limited in information - just to facebook pages. however, as a past student myself, i understand there is not much of a track record to shout for at that stage in life, thus - acceptable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "this section is simple and clear, along with the nature of this project proposal.

The purpose is to apply blockchain technology to create convenience, and authentication, avoid manipulation of ticket factions and help spectators enjoy sports moments fairly. Personally, I think this is a good idea, but the legal issue and the protection of public ticketing transactions is an important content that is not discussed by the authors. In Vietnam, the issuance of tickets for sports matches will be in charge of the Organizing Committee of the tournaments. I'm not sure how the team plans to work with the Tournament Organizers to legalize ticket sales through the app. This is not mentioned in the proposal. The purchaser is given a QR code to use in queuing to watch the matches. However, who will be responsible for checking and verifying the QR code? Who will be in charge of the financial management of all the money to buy and sell tickets? This involves a number of possible risks that have not been taken into account by the team. Specifically, one is a legal risk because there is no agency to cooperate and sponsor ticket sales. Second, the financial risk in the management of revenue and expenditure due to the lack of accountants participating in the project (project personnel is currently information technology students of the University of Transport, Vietnam).

Personally, I think this route is quite detailed. However, I suggest that the team consider adding to the plan of contact activities with the Organizing Committee of sports tournaments in Vietnam and carry out the procedures for applying for a license from the competent authority. The goal is for ticket sales through the app to be sponsored and recognized by the ticketing authority. Regarding the budget, the group has a division of costs for each component item. However, some items need to clarify the unit price. For example, the cost of marketing and introducing the product $900 should be explained in detail (cost of banners, Facebook ads, etc.) with unit price * quantity. About the team, the team consists of 3 members who are all 3rd-year students.
