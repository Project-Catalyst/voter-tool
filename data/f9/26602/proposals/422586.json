For example it will increase that local income by 15-20% after successful adoption of Cardano blockchain technology, or create more # number of new jobs.

While it seems future-oriented, and aims to set up and lay the groundwork for Cardano adoption down the line, I do not foresee immediate results; rather, a better, lasting impact on expanding Cardano. \n\nTo be clear, this project absolutely shows strong impact, just more long-term. This is valuable for future scalability of the project! \nIt sets up for, as the Proposal explains, helping revitalize depopulated areas and/or serving aging communities in Japan. This partnership would therefore be phenomenal for meeting the Challenge Setting goals, of increasing participation in Catalyst, Cardano wallet activity, and stake pool operation. \n\nThis project may very well open doors and begin a partnership with the Japanese government and Cardano as valuable as the established Ethiopian partnership, therefore this proposal seems quite promising and valuable, and Impact is strong. \n\nThe reason I give this a 4 of 5 rating, is for not having much immediate utility/impact, as well as that I do not see a well-defined and clearly-articulated way in which the discussions for marketing Cardano and setting up the partnership will more directly revitalize those depopulated areas and serve the aging communities.
