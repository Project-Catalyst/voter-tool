It is about promoting a series of actions to \u201cbring voters, proponents and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them.\u201d The problem raised is the lack of understanding and trust of Asian voters in relation to the entire voting process. The proponents (the eastern towhall team) argue that a survey was carried out in which the Japanese community pointed out the lack of (linguistic) support as the main problem in the voting process, that is, many of them did not fully understand the content being presented and therefore voted randomly; there was also some wear and tear due to fraud and misaligned processes in relation to incentives (it would be interesting for the proponents to provide some example of such a situation, so that we could understand more solidly, through cases). Therefore, to solve this situation, many activities would be developed, carried out by the already very active group of the Municipality of the East. Group members are already quite active in the community in order to interact, share ideas and carry out actions, such as biweekly meetings that are directly linked to the General City Hall. With this proposal they want to effectively distribute translation content in a timely manner (it would be important to also clarify the sharing process, what strategies they would use to make this happen as planned). In general, they intend to reach the Asian audience of 3 languages \u200b\u200b(ID, JP and VN - it would be positive if instead of the acronyms they write the name of the languages \u200b\u200bthemselves, I believe it is Indonesian, Japanese and Vietnamese, but it would be better if we had this information in full). This would be done by some activities, such as \u201ccontent production to help ADA holders understand the importance of voting\u201d (it would be very interesting if we had some example of content, if it would be in video format, written, etc.) . \u201cEastern Hemisphere language-specific events focused on voter education and discussion\u201d \u2013 would be online events, most likely, so details like the frequency of events and how the audience would be attracted could also be included. \u201dA proposal to create a language translation pipeline to help bidders reach the wider East Asian community\u201d - what would a pipeline be? They also claim that they will carry out an intense social media campaign to publicize the content that would be created, so that the maximum number of voters could have access to what was being done, and all the communication channels already used would be boosted. In general, I think that the proposal serves very well the objective of bringing the public from East Asia closer to Cardano and Catalyst, but it would be interesting if the activities themselves were a little more detailed, I know that there are many ideas and the proponents already they did a good job of listing them, I really believe that the proposal deserves the maximum score in impact, this is just a suggestion for it to improve even more.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal script is not very adequate because the proposers repeat the same information in month 1 and 2, even though the work to be carried out is the same, it would be interesting if we had more details on how the activities would be carried out and who would be in charge of each part (they claim that roles are not defined, but I think it would be important to have a little of this notion, to understand how the process would take place). How would voter education videos be produced? What topics would be included in this part, what topics would be covered in month 1 and month 2? How would you partner with the Catalyst AIM group, how would explanatory videos about the proposals be created, how would some proposals be selected to be presented? What electoral content would be translated, relevant to Catalyst? How would you bridge the gap with East Asian voters? Maybe through the channels of communication with the community, such as Telegram, Discord, Youtube and etc\u2026 It would be very positive if we had more details about what materials would be created and widely disseminated in these channels. That is, although there is a description of the activities that will be carried out here and a good temporal notion of when each would be carried out (in which month and in what order), it would be important that more details had been provided about each one. Regarding the budget, the amount requested is 15 thousand dollars, which in my view is a very fair amount for the amount of activities that will be developed here. The value is properly divided into several parts, such as video production, marketing and communication, project management, website maintenance, etc. Interestingly, in addition to explaining how much each part would cost, the bidders provide specific details on each: for example, to perform site maintenance, would be the activities of \u201cmaintaining and updating the easterntownhall.com site to accommodate the following communities; Indonesian, New Zealand/East Africa/English, Singapore/Korean and Japanese\u201d; to manage the projects, would include the activities of \u201ccoordination with partners (building bridges, realizing synergies) + controlling the schedule (meeting KPIs, submitting proposals, etc.) + controlling project costs\u201d. So in relation to this part, I think that the information is provided in a very satisfactory way, we would have an even better understanding of the whole if the activities of the script itself were more unraveled, but from the way expenses are scored here, it is quite clear how the 15 thousand dollars would be used. About the team, as I already mentioned, they say that \u201cthere are no roles, no leaders. Instead, people establish themselves over time through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm [ 2 ] and Catalyst School [ 3 ] and other community groups across Asia\u201d; I agree that it is not necessary to have leaders, but a division of roles in my opinion would make the proposal's readers better understand how the whole works. The other groups in Asia, which they collaborate with, could also have been mentioned. Talking about the team members themselves, we have a lot of people involved, all presented in a very appropriate way and it's a group that's really involved with Cardano in a practical way, quite experienced, so it gives a lot of trust. I believe that the proposal is very viable, with only a few adjustments being necessary (mainly in the script).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It would be very positive if the proponents could better detail what the research they will carry out would be. What will be asked, how will the target audience be approached? How many people are we thinking of contacting, and what will their origins be? Several KPIs are said to be expected to measure partial success, such as \u201cincreasing Eastern Hemisphere voter turnout by 25% over the previous Fund,\nincrease Eastern Hemisphere participation in Catalyst by 25% over the previous Fund through various channels of community advisor engagement, veteran community advisor engagement, submission of proposals, etc.\u201d The topic \u201cUncertainty around Catalyst and voting down 25% from previous Fund\u201d gets a little confusing for me: how could this uncertainty be measured? As there are several activities being carried out, I believe that it is very necessary for a member of the team to collect general information at the end of each month and be able to pass it on to the Cardano community, we know that the focus would be on community members from East Asia , but the whole community needs to be aware of the improvements and activities that would be developed here. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative data must be gathered, so that we can understand well about everything that has been developed so far. Talking about success, I believe that this part is very well assured, as many metrics on success are plotted: \u201caverage fortnightly Easter City Council numbers increase 25% for each Fund + Catalyst proposals available in three languages \u200b\u200b(ID, JP, VN) increase 25% for each Fund + Eastern Hemisphere proposals are widely voted on and receive funding with a 25% growth over the previous Fund + poll results show a 25% increase in voter engagement over the previous Fund, etc\". So I think the only thing that still needed to be clearer would be how this information would reach our community members. It would be necessary that all this data, which in short demonstrates whether the proposal had indeed had a palpable impact for Cardano, reaching the objectives of the challenge, would be presented, for example, during a Town Hall. That said, I think the information on auditability is quite valid, varied and detailed, it would just be necessary for the proponents to make it clearer that all of this would be presented to the members in our ecosystem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 10, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1838, "q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge by having inclusivity with the Eastern Hemisphere to participate in Catalyst proposals and voting.

The proposer intends to translate into Japanese, Indonesian & Vietnamese language for their community to understand and vote better in future Catalyst voting.

Therefore I don't have any doubts about their performance.\nSecond: the cost of implementation in my opinion is extremely reasonable. We have expenses that include video production, marketing, website maintenance, project management. Each expense category is clearly listed for what they are used for. I think that with the current bear market situation, it is possible to consider adding an additional cost of provisioning for ADA slippage, such as 3-5%/total budget.\nThird: The implementation roadmap has clearly stated each milestone and specific work to be done.

It fulfills the requirements of the challenge by supplying places and translations of papers to particularly assist Asian communities all the way through the voting and proposing process, in addition to supplying a community base for specific language groups. Individuals who in the past may have had feelings of exclusion from the catalytic community will be more likely to join and participate as a result of this change. In addition to that, they have effectively demonstrated the work that they have done, which demonstrates that the project needs the support of the community in order to be successful. In my opinion, this idea will have a significant effect on the Catalyst as well as the greater Cardano community since it will make it possible for non-English speaking communities to participate.
