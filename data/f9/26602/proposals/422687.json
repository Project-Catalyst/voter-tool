It identifies the problem that needs to be solved to create a Vietnamese - English dictionary of blockchain & Cardano. I think this is a very good idea because currently, Vietnam does not have a dictionary like this. It is not only great for busy people but also good for everyone who wants to learn about blockchain and Cardano cryptocurrency. This proposal certainly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. In terms of overall benefits, it helps to increase the knowledge of the Cardano blockchain, which is good for the intellectuals. However, I am thinking what is the long-term direction of the dictionary during the existence and development of the Cardano blockchain? The purpose is that this dictionary can be used for a long time in both the existence and development of the Cardano blockchain, provided that it is always added, edited, and updated with new information. To do so, the team needs to have regular attention and a long-term roadmap with the product (dictionary) for many years, so that the dictionary can always be used even when the size of the Cardano ecosystem grows. That is, it will always remain impactful with the Cardano ecosystem despite scaling and challenges. I see the word \"Japanese\" appear in the Problem Statement as \"so difficult for Japanese for access\". Are you confused when the topic is writing about electronic money dictionary for Vietnamese people but has \"Japanese\"? Maybe this is a typo - you should fix it. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has experience in the field of real crypto, Cardano blockchain, educational training, project accumulation, finance, and banking. These are very favorable for the implementation of the proposal. The members of the team are all knowledgeable people, belonging to the intellectual class in society. What I like very much about this is the disclosure of the identities of all members on social networks. This increases the feasibility of the proposal and makes the community more confidence in the team. About the budget way seems quite reasonable with the goal set, the details are broken down into sections. If funding from Catalyst has not been received, will the team continue to work on this proposal? The team had a plan and a specific way to implement it. I read the content and realized that this proposal requires a huge amount of knowledge to be able to form a dictionary. I understand the team is working on a dictionary on the web, do you think they will develop the dictionary into an app that can be used on mobile devices in the future? This is also my suggestion on the technical side of things. The resources needed for implementation are already in place. However, I have a question some members of your team have also implemented other proposals in Fund 9, will there be any impact on the quality of work done in this proposal? Anyway, I still believe that with the existing staff, the team can completely do this, with the support from the community. The challenges and risks associated with the team raised are reasonable. In short, the transparency of the proposal is quite clear. I completely agree - vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think the milestone roadmap of the proposal has been outlined very clearly and in a certain chronological order. But it would be much better if the team detailed the work done within specific months in a year. That would further clarify the transparency and auditability of the proposal. It makes it easier for the community to audit - based on the standard months of the year. The demonstration of \"what the success of this project looks like\" speaks to the certain research interest of the team in the proposal. However, I don't see any number of KPIs or key metrics appearing, perhaps you should think more and supplement it fully. At the same time, thereby increasing the auditability of this proposal. Do you think it is advisable to conduct an online survey before and after the release of the dictionary to consult with the community about the need for the dictionary and the user's preferences after the dictionary is completed? From there, draw experiences and collect more comments from the community to complete the best dictionary product.

Being a software development engineer with already 3 years of experience (Graduate in design and programming at ISIG/GOMA: www.isig.ac.cd), I find, for example, that $1000 is an insufficient sum for the realization of a quality site that can support all the flows that will be processed by this proposal. And also paying employees and administering a site for $500/month is less than enough money considering the frequency of usage that this proposal shows.

However, before going into the positive impact of the project on the Vietnamese community, I think the proposer should change the Problem statement a bit because, in reality, there are not too many busy Vietnamese people. This proposal and 2min English-Japanse Crypto Dict seem to be from the same big project by the team. Just like in Japan in Vietnam, the number of people who want to learn about crypto is huge because of the strong growth of bitcoin and other coins in the past couple of years. Helping many people get rich quickly and in general, has made crypto and blockchain extremely attractive to Vietnamese people. But they face a language barrier, specifically English when they want to learn about crypto because almost all official and reputable documents are in English. Therefore, it will take time and effort to find out when they have to find and translate documents that sometimes their translation tools are not really accurate. Moreover, not many people have the habit of reading and studying specialized academic documents because they are very difficult to translate or understand. Therefore, creating a quick and concise dictionary of crypto for Vietnamese people is a very good and practical idea. Help them save time but still get the right knowledge and easy to understand.

Finally, I can say that the proposer has provided an intelligible description of the target problem as well as a clear solution. These factors have given me a lot of confidence that this project can be audited. This exudes entire assurance in their capacity to carry out the project successfully. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with this. Every aspect is perfect.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2916", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6282, "q0": "The purpose of this proposal is to provide concise and simplified articles on blockchain in both english and vietnamese for people in the vietnamese community, to encourage them to read and improve their knowledge in this area.  The proposal fits well into this challenge in the sense that it will raise the level of awareness of people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network. Proposers have clearly identified the problem which is the fact that knowledge on blockchain is limited, is mainly in english and is usually long and very academic which discourages people from acquiring knowledge and they are therefore very susceptible to scams. \n\nThe proposal will clearly provide a solution to this problem as well as have a positive impact on the Cardano community by increasing knowledge and interest in Cardano so that people can make meaningful contributions to the Cardano community in various capacities. Furthermore, the project is expected to continue into the future with membership increasing over time. The proposal is expected to have a huge impact when implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has a team of 7 members who appear to have the experience to carry it out, because they have provided a description of who they are, as well as their contacts on social networks. In addition, they had a project that was funded in fund 7 therefore they have a track record which is easily verifiable. The project is expected to be completed within four months and proposers have provided a roadmap with clear tasks and targets for each month. I would however suggest that proposers clearly link their detailed plan to the budget to improve the coherence between the two and help in understanding better what they intend to do. For instance the budget makes provision for community incentive fee based on the submission of 70 articles from the community however, the plan did not make mention of incentivising the community although it mentions getting 100 new users from the community, with at least 10 users who post and at least 15 users participating in evaluation and comments on articles. There is the need to clarify who are benefitting from the incentives. Is it the 100 new users or the 10 and 15 who are actually posting articles and evaluating them? Some clarity would be helpful.  \n\nProposers have identified risks and proposed workable mitigation measures however, they make mention of a phase 2 of the project during which users can contribute to the website. The plan however does not mention project phases. Proposers may want to clarify that aspect of the plan to aid better understanding.\n\nThe budget is clearly outlined and identifiable based on the four month project period and the activities to be undertaken per month. For example based on a unit price of $50 per article, the fee for the total number of 170 articles for the 4 month period is easy to determine as $8,500. The timeline for completion of the project is realistic with an anticipated 50 articles posted in both english and vietnamese each month. Given that the project team has 7 members, this is very achievable.

But when I read your entire proposal, it's exactly the English - Vietnamese library.\n\nEnglish is not the main language in Vietnam, so this is a barrier for those who want to access new knowledge and information like Blockchain and Cardano because most of them are written in English. Therefore, there is a need for information resources in Vietnamese for the community of crypto investors or those interested in this field.\n\nMore specifically, the idea of \u200b\u200byour group is to shorten the amount of information especially technical knowledge, in an article so that it is only 02 minutes to read, which saves a lot of time for readers, especially those whose Cryptocurrency investing is just their part-time job so they have very little free time to get new technology knowledge like full-time people in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAnother part I appreciate is your implementation when you want to have the community's participation to evaluate and rate the content so that everyone can know what content the team has produced is high quality and suitable for the needs of the majority of readers.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is expected to be implemented within 04 months with the details of the work described in each month and accompanied by the results achieved for each month (from there you use is the number of articles) with main tasks are summarized and translated with 03 main content areas: Cardano articles, Blockchain articles and Finance articles. This plan is quite detailed and clear, I agree with the way you proposed.\n\nRegarding the project budget, please apply for this fund9 is $ 17150, in which the cost of translation labor accounts for the majority of the budget, and you will specify each item and the accompanying costs. This cost, in my opinion, is reasonable for the number of 170 articles summarized, translated, and posted on the website.\n\nAbout the team involved in this project, it is quite large with 07 people, described as having a lot of experience in the field of Blockchain and Finance and especially with the advisory of Master Do Manh Hung, a quite is famous and influential in the Blockchain Cardano community in Vietnam, so I am confident that the team will complete the work items as stated in the proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The performance metrics you give are quite detailed for each month based on the number of translated articles. This criterion is too obvious for a proposal related to content creation through translation.\n\nIn addition to the above index, you also add a number of other metrics to measure the impact of the proposal such as the number of new users or the number of views of the article. These indicators are reasonable.\n\nIn addition, I also suggested to your team that you should assess whether the length of the article is 2 minutes to read is enough or not through small surveys. Maybe readers need it to be longer or shorter. At the same time, it is also necessary to have a method to assess the knowledge taken away from the articles by small quizzes after each article to make the 02 minutes read is more interesting and useful.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2678", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9579, "q0": "\"Blockchain is a new and complex technology.

I appreciate your suggestion to synthesize Blockchain and Cardano-related topics in a concise form suitable for newbies, especially Vietnamese who are afraid to read.

With an open website for people to actively interact and post, poor quality information from users will inevitably be inevitable. The solution to the risk is satisfactory when you try to incentivize users to have quality articles with rewards and incentives. However, it is also necessary to increase censorship resources to fully address this risk. The second risk is about translating academic language into a common user language.
