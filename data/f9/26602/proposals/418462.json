And how is the popular method of blockchain for teachers up there? These are two very important things for the project to achieve long-term results and guide the children's thinking.\nIn terms of risks, the project has outlined methods to reduce risks from the weather. However, about the risk of price escalation due to inflation, I recommend increasing it (compared to $1,000) because inflation is escalating very quickly and shows no sign of stopping.

Being a Vietnamese myself, I appreciate the humanity of this solution for giving the opportunity to access blockchain potential for upland children in my country. However, I have not really appreciated the impact and ability to raise awareness about Cardano to the community of this solution. The reason is that in Vietnam, children in upland areas are especially difficult in terms of physical living conditions (diet, poor nutrition, poor housing, etc.), difficulties in accessing 4.0 technology. Specifically, lack of online teaching technology equipment, many schools do not have internet coverage (https://baophapluat.vn/tre-vung-cao-vung-xa-va-giac-mo-tiep-can-4-0-post414471.html). Therefore, bringing the concept of blockchain to children when they themselves have little or no access to the internet is very difficult, even impossible. In addition, the construction of a school, a library only affects children in a specific area, does not have much impact on identifying and solving difficulties for many other highlands in Vietnam. Meanwhile, according to data from the Ministry of Education and Training, Vietnam currently has 12/63 highland provinces, accounting for 19% of the country's provinces (https://moet.gov.vn/giaoducquocdan/giao-duc-dan-toc/Pages/tin-tuc.aspx?ItemID=4724).

However, the drawback is that this event only has an impact at the time the school is first launched. While, to increase awareness of the community, we need more than a continuous, long-term, persistent communication campaign to increase memory and awareness about Cardano. The authors also propose building a Cardano Library at the new school, helping children read books every day, including some books about blockchain. However, I did not find content related to introducing and teaching about blockchain for children in the proposal. At a young age, it will be difficult or impossible to read and understand basic blockchain concepts on their own without an instructor. Especially in the situation that children have little or no access to technology like children in big cities. This concerns the risks of the solution that the team has not mentioned: the risk of children accessing blockchain technology concepts (they do not understand what Cardano is, what blockchain looks like), the risk of the solution's limited impact (because only one school, one library, one Cardano billboard can be built in one area)... For these reasons, I rate 3 points in impact of the proposal, deducting -1 point for the scope of the solution's impact, -1 point for unforeseen risks.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the solution, the team refers to a 3-phase roadmap, conducted over 4 months. In which, there is 1 month for survey and design; 2 months to build the school and the last month to complete and promote the Cardano brand. I suggest that the group should add information about the planned survey locations and the estimated time to start the project (if the proposal is approved). This helps the community to understand why the Cardano billboard is located at the specific location identified and when the project can be completed. The project's budget is divided into 3 corresponding phases, with costs for each  item. However, here I would like to ask the team to clarify some cost items. For example, the cost of $2000 for furniture should be explained in more detail (specifically, how much $ is needed to buy furniture, lights, equipment in the classroom, for how many layers\u2026 Similarly, the cost of placing billboards Cardano advertising $800 at the school, the community needs to understand: what is the estimated size of the billboard? Advertising depending on the material (corrugated iron, corrugated board thickness, Hiflex canvas, corrugated sheet, etc.) will have a unit price per m2 from $10-$25/m2. Communication costs are similarly understood, depending on the brand. Newspapers, number of readers, print or electronic newspapers, appearance of homepage or subpages... the cost of advertising will be different. The team needs to clearly the communication objective, so that the community understands how the advertising costs are used. Regarding the team, the group consists of 4 members who are lecturers and entrepreneurs. However, the profiles of 2 out of 4 members do not have a reference link, making the community not have enough information to understand their experience and capacity. I rate 3 points for feasibility due to minus -1 point for lack of budget statement explanation, -1 point for lack of link to team member profile.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of auditability, the team has given specific KPIs on the success targets to be achieved. Personally, I think that this project can be completely audited by the community because the team has provided sufficient auditable data during the implementation process. However, I suggest that the team consider adding some more detailed evaluation criteria. For example: how many children is a school built for? How many readers is expected to reach the newspaper reportage?... This will help the community understand exactly what the project's value and success means to children in the uplands and its impact how to the Vietnamese blockchain community. For this reason, I rate the project's auditability 4 points.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3279", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12679, "q0": "The problem in the challenge that needs to be solved here is that upland children do not have the concept of coin investment or blockchain profession, bringing this concept to them helps them have the ambition to develop themselves and the community where they live.  the Proposal presents how it will add value to the cardano ecosystem as follows: build a school and a library called Cardano Library for upland children, and promote Cardano in the media and press. The proponent offers a solution to the problem: build a new school to help children learn better. set up a big billboard to show that Cardano sponsors this. Besides, set up a small library called \"Cardano Libary\" in this school so kids can read books every day and put some books about blockchain there. put the school's opening event in newspapers to promote Cardano to make the Cardano brand more familiar in Vietnam.

The promotion and guidance of young people in the highlands from a young age so that they can then orient their careers in the future is a noble gesture, but it is still too far away. What the highland children really need is a school with full facilities, a training environment with highly qualified teachers, and most of all, children's meals. Upland areas need more nutrition, which is really a concern for someone in the lowlands like me. And that problem really needs the support and contribution of the entire community, to be able to develop the highland into a place that is not too lagging behind the plains. Your ideas can be said to be a noble gesture.

There are some issues that I still have questions and need your answers: In which locality will the construction of the school and library take place?, exactly the commune, district, and province.

However, there is one issue that I would like to point out to the team: even though we are in the second and third month of working on the project, I believe that it is still unfinished, and you should add more. For instance, you will construct a school with a floor space of one hundred square meters, during which you will specify the number of classrooms, the level of students who will attend the school, and whether or not you will also construct a place for yourself to sleep far away (upland areas will often have other schools). (dormitory-style education) Regarding the cost, as you pointed out, I completely agree with you that it is reasonable because of the high price of raw materials and the difficulty of transportation.

However, I did not see where this particular highland area? As for the main potential risks, besides the risks of weather and price increases, I did not see an extremely important issue addressed, which is the health and safety of workers during construction.
