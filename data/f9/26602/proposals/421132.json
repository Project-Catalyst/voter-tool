But the future of funding and expanding this project is unknown, perhaps due to the requirement to evaluate success in this early stage before adapting and re-strategizing.\n\nJustification: I agree that this proposal relatively aligns with the challenge as presented, although geographic distance from that market could be a factor in limited in-person community building activities that the team are able to execute.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Team Skill Relevance: There is a large and diverse team involved in this proposal that has both history working with Catalyst and a cross functional plan that is suitable to execute art/community-building projects like this one.\n\nTeam Appropriateness: The team seems appropriate, as presented, although the geographic location is one of the major concerns that prevented me from strongly supporting this proposal, since they are located in France and not East Asia.\n\nBudget Outline/Reasonableness: The budget is reasonable as presented in terms of rates and timeline required, however I was unclear why they packaged \"Developer / NFT minting fees\" into one line item.  Those 2 costs are quite different, with NFT minting on cardano being very very low cost and low complexity.  Developers, on the other hand, are normally an hourly cost, and not required to mint NFTs on most major marketplaces these days.\n\nImplementation Plan: The 3 phase implementation plan along with workload management strategy and relevant KPI evaluation is detailed and sufficient to build confidence in a high likelihood of project delivery if funded.\n\nResource Plan: The team has done a sufficient job of resource planning, including onboarding strategic partners, employing ambassadors, even items like travel plans and contingency.\n\nRisk Mitigation: There is a detailed risk mitigation section.  I especially appreciated the depth of consideration for legal environment and cultural barriers, as I believe these will be 2 most important factors, especially considering the geographic and cultural concerns of the team vs relevant market.\n\nJustification:  Overall support feasibility for this project as presented by the team, but not strongly due to minor notes above regarding team relevance, budget, etc.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Clear Roadmap/Milestones:  The roadmap and milestones for this project as presented in a 3 phase / 6 month timeline including the flexibility to build on success based on pre-defined KPIs should offer good insight into progress by community onlookers.\n\nDefined Metrics/KPIs: KPIs and metrics for success are well defined, however some of them are a bit subjective, but they have mitigated that subjectiveness with ideas for measuring their success such as surveys, as well as more objective measurements like new proposals delivered, new wallets, and other metrics that are highly measurable and in alignment with the Grow East Asia Grow Cardano Challenge\n\nMeasurable Problem/Solution Impact: The impact vs the problem/solution fit is not a 100% hit in my opinion, but the KPIs presented offer, perhaps, a strong way to provide an objective approach to measuring success in this kind of effort.\n\nPublic Update Channels: The team offers a variety of public channels, including social media (Twitter), channels which will be used to measure success on delivery of this proposal.  Their participation in 4 previous Catalyst rounds also reveal that they understand and embrace the open source mentality, and aim to continue coming back for future funds with the goal of also generating additional proposals from within the targeted growth demographics.\n\nJustification: I think this proposal has all the right elements to allow for auditability, at least as far as it is capable of providing.

In response to your statement \" I believe this proposal presents more of an opportunity than a \"problem,\" - I think if you give our proposal a thorough and complete read, and attempt to remove any bias as far as possible, you will see that it is a problem for Asia, the most populated continent in the world, to be left behind or excluded from the development and design of Cardano's open source protocol, and social and financial infrastructure. With Charles' vision, it is designed to solve problems such as banking the unbanked and underbanked, and issues around land ownership, and tackling corruption and ensuring society has the skills to tap into the digital economy and for people to have the skills to access a job market that is growing and will be the part of the future. For businesses and stakeholders to understand this early rather than later, they need the support. So yes it is an opportunity, but it is also a problem once you speak to people and businesses who have little to no knowledge on what Cardano is and how it can help empower them to solve their local problems, and global issues. Furthermore in response to your statement that \" this proposal does not ORIGINATE from East Asia...geographic distance from that market could be a factor in limited in-person community building activities that the team are able to execute.\" - Although some core team members are based in France, you will see upon a thorough reading of the entire proposal that in fact we have a global team with advisors who are based in Asia.

We even have included travel costs in our budget to support any necessary in-person meetings. So we have considered these angles."}, {"id": 4407, "q0": "I feel that this proposal can solve the goal set in the Challenge which is \"Grow East Asian, Grow Cardano\". The reason I say this is because the team has clearly defined the problem that needs to be solved here, which is to bring NFT owners and NFT users closer and accompany the Asian business community to create legally compliant Cardano products and services. It is also a way to increase Cardano's presence and exposure to Cardano NFTs, making it commensurate with the world's highest NFT ownership rates in several Asian countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia. This proposal certainly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem, because its object is NFT on top of the Cardano blockchain. In the promising future of being able to scale to address challenges, I believe in future scaling because the world's technology development trend is making steady strides regarding blockchain, but for blockchain, NFT is an indispensable component. Therefore, I believe in the powerful impact of the proposal in the present and the future for East Asia and Cardano. Specifically, the benefits the proposal offers to holders, NFT users, and businesses. I completely agree with the impact of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to the proposal, you have full experience in different fields: educator, researcher, entrepreneur, accountant, business development, etc... Especially, you are PA - vPA of Catalyst. These experiences are extremely valuable, not everyone has them. It is very suitable for making proposals - especially those related to blockchain, NFT, and business. In addition, your team has core members - called Cardojo founders from different continents of the world. When they all have experience and qualifications in the field they are in charge of. The team has fully presented documents related to the proponent and the number of team members, along with some members with attached social networking links to publicize their identities (not all members). All members present social networking links). I've also noticed that some members' profiles don't have their real-life portraits in the proposal, but instead a cartoon-like image of the NFT. This makes me and the community feel a little suspicious about the members' identities publicly. My advice to the team is: The team should add full social networking links (Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, etc...) for some missing team members, and replace the active image. painted with real-life portraits. This has the effect of increasing the feasibility of the proposal and affirming the community's trust in the team. Here is my sincere advice to help the team increase the feasibility of this proposal.\nI read the team's budget breakdown, and found that it was broken down into sections, presented quite detailed, and logically aligned with the goal. Through this, I highly appreciate the professionalism in the work of the team. I have a question: If we haven't been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9, will the team continue to plan to implement this proposal? Does the team have any other funding sources to secure the implementation of this proposal? (those are funding sources that can come from funding by other organizations). My two questions above are to clarify the budget situation.\nRegarding the plan and how to implement the proposal, the team has outlined a fairly detailed plan, it reflects the seasoned experience of the team members and it shows the seriousness when implementing the project. export. Through this, the community will have more confidence in the feasibility of the proposal when implemented.\nIn terms of resources needed to execute, in addition to the financial resources waiting to be funded, I know the team is full of members from different continents with expertise and rich experience that can perform. This proposal does well. However, when reading the proposal, I noticed that some members are working on other proposals in Fund 9. Will this affect the implementation of this proposal? As the proposals are made in parallel, I am afraid that all members cannot fully concentrate on making this proposal well. So can you explain more about this so that the community can have more confidence in its feasibility?\nIn terms of technical aspects, technology and language used. I noticed that the team is using all they can to describe in the most specific way NFT (on the Cardano blockchain platform). This is very reasonable. But I still want the team to spend more time analyzing the technology applied in this proposal to show the community the adequacy of the size of the team when applying technology widely. into a proposal as large as this one (continental scale - and scalable if executed well later). My last opinion is completely meaningful to contribute positively, I want the team to firmly confirm its feasibility for the community.\nThe challenges and risks associated with implementation were the part that I was most satisfied with about the team's presentation. The team has fully outlined the possible risks such as the legality of the country, or the slide in the price of the digital market, specifically here Ada. Accompanied by solutions to prevent risks and remedies for it are quite convincing. I am very pleased with this aspect of the proposal. In summary, I agree with the feasibility of the proposal, and I would like the team to carefully consider my questions and advice to further refine this proposal. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the milestones that the team shows, it makes me very satisfied. It is clear and easy to understand, and presented in chronological order associated with the specific month of the year (September to December). This is very convenient for the community to evaluate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Furthermore, I completely agree with the KPI criteria of the proposal (legal compliance guidelines, NFT project concepts, featured articles, resource usage...within Asia). However, I regret not seeing key metrics. We all know key metrics are essential to confirm the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Therefore, in my opinion, the team should fully add key metrics to improve the transparency and auditability of this proposal. The problems were described very clearly and easily with satisfactory solutions. Finally, I agree with how a team defines success. The team has based on the performance results, and the impact spread to the countries, taking that as the criterion to define success.

In response to your questions and some of your statements. Under Feasability - We are open to alternative funding sources but as of now for this proposal, we are seeking funding from Catalyst. In terms of the identity of team members. You will perhaps have noticed that there are established NFT projects out there that have certain  team members/creators identity undisclosed for various reasons. This has not prevented said projects from succeeding so long as other mechanisms are in place. In addition we believe that given the community approach of vouching for each other and trusting others that are trusted by those we trust, this helps to reinforce and respect the wishes of those who don't want their identity known to the public at certain stages or ever.
