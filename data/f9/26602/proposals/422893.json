They do it by conducting a survey of more than 100 entrepreneurs in Asia regarding their needs, for example, improving traceability and supply chain management, and delivering 3 workshops for participating companies who are interested and selected to join. Those companies would then be introduced to Project Catalyst to unlock funding opportunities.

Their global network and establishment, with their presence already rooted in east asia, is in clear synergy with the idea being proposed, aligned to the challenge it's submitted under Grow East Asia, and i can clearly visualize their idea (if successful) to align with the Fund 9 goal #3 of building real world solutions based on the cardano blockchain.\n\nThe credibility of the proposer is undoubted, having years of track record to show for on their websites provided. the approach to the problem statement is clear, and commendable seeing as they start off with a survey for problem sensing, and not just diving right in with the idea execution itself. It is clear that the team has thought this out thoroughly, down to the partnerships they wish to establish for different areas of expertise. \n\nAll in all, an examplary proposal for this IMPACT section that i think deserves the best rating, and if successful, will bring immense value to the cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project roadmap is as clear as a new project can get, on a monthly estimation basis, though something more granular would be appreciated.

", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal falls a little short in terms of providing clarity for measuring the success of the project. The metrics they mentioned to be used to measure success in this AUDITABILITY section were:\n1. # of Asian companies surveyed to understand their needs for Cardano-based solutions\n2. # of Asian companies introduced to blockchain and Cardano\n3. # of use cases developed with Asian companies for solutions on the Cardano blockchain \n4. # of audience reached in a communications campaign in project locations\nand i fully agree with all 4 of these chosen metric, particularly metric #3. However, it is confusing as they mentioned an exactly same statement in the IMPACT section earlier, which only contains metric 1,2, and 4. For whatever reason that the consistency was not maintained in the proposal, i hope to see all 4 metrics being implemented for tracking.\n\nadditionaly, there was no mention of the interval/frequency of updates for all the metrics, and neither the medium of communication. progress tracking monthly on the cardano funding google sheet would not be sufficient. they target for 80 survey responses, and this will be conducted in the Oct-Nov timeframe. this means that the community will only likely get 2 updates, probably one at the end of each month. If the team misses numbers on the Oct numbers showing a very low response rate, there would not be sufficient time or resources for remediation and the project will run the risk of delays. would suggest for a weekly update of progress through a suitable medium, and for the team to prepare a more concrete contingency plan if survey is not well received by the public. \n\nOn that note of a contingency plan for the survey - it is acknowledged that the proposers addressed this concern under project risks under IMPACT, but am not convinced of steps like \"framing the survey as a first step to being invited into a series of workshops and an opportunity to join Project Catalyst\" - this may be insufficient - and \"benefit of local Impact Hubs\u2019 ongoing relationships\" - the website and proposal does not disclose the number of existing relationships they have. if the proposers had provided these details, we can then as assessors work backwards on a funnel of success rate to estimate the possiible number of successful survey respondents\n\ndue to the ambiguity, will only rate this as 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3270", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Connect with impact entrepreneurs in Asia to understand\u00a0their knowledge and\u00a0needs, and offer them\u00a0intro workshops on blockchain and Cardano,\u00a0and the potential of participation in Project Catalyst.", "experience": "Impact Hub is a global network of 24,250 people driving change \u2013 4,000+ of whom are spread across 12 locations in Asia-Pacific.
