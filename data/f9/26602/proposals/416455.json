This is a good idea and a perfect piece for the development of the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia in general and in Japan as well as in Vietnam in particular. From there, the proposal will contribute to raising the awareness level of people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network in order to solve the problems that the challenge has posed.\nI consider this project to be outstanding, unique and the perfect match in the challenge because it will open up a market providing translation services in non-English speaking communities such as Japan and Vietnam. This place will gather people with all the necessary skills and experience in translation at a reasonable cost to support Proposers and PAs to realize their projects on the Cardano ecosystem and the market blockchain market.\nI completely agree with the solution argument that the author team made for the proposal. It is known that this is a follow-up to the success of the proposal at fund 8, which shows that the proposal at the previous fund is very successful and that the current situation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is in great need of centers. providing translation services in the market. I see this as an ambitious project and in the future when the blockchain market grows, this project will have more and more coverage, so it needs the attention and promotion of the Catalyst community because the project does not just stop in simply providing translation services, which expands to many other necessary services for the community such as knowledge training services, logistics consulting services for projects...etc. My own use of English is a limitation, so when translating documents into English, especially highly specialized documents such as the electronic money market, I do not trust non-professional online translation services specialized translation. For me, this project will be the right choice for me to trust and submit my proposal at the center.\nI will give this author's proposal 5 points, a perfect score for this idea because I see it as different from the other proposals at the challenge. Additionally, this project will come to fruition very helpful for individuals with limited language skills like me.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project took place within 6 months, I am very satisfied and feel the thoroughness and professionalism when the author team wrote this proposal, it is clear that the planning and implementation of the plan have been completed very well put forward by the team members. I like the transparent way of working, clear details for each month, there is a mixture of professional implementation and marketing for the project to promote more widely the services to the market. Above all there is an evaluation, comment and learn to adjust to make the following months better than the previous month of the author's team.\nThe budget section of the proposal I rate well because the team has clarified the costs to be used for this proposal. The budget is clearly divided for each item and these expenses are reasonable, it has been calculated in detail for each unit price/word. With a proposed budget of $24150, which is 9.6% of the total budget of the East Asia development challenge, developing Cardano at fund 9 makes perfect sense.\nI highly commend when the proposal team has identified 3 main risks that can limit or prevent a successful project, that is, it can be difficult to manage the quality of the service that the provider provides during the time in the beginning, payment methods for professionals and service providers can be difficult due to the laws where they live and the high volatility of the ADA coin. I find the risk mitigation measures very convincing, but I would like to add one more comment to the risky part of the proposal, which is the risk of legal copyright issues for translations. The project must ensure that the content of the translations is not leaked to the 3rd party during the translation process to ensure the confidentiality of the project of the proposers and PAs.\nAs initially stated, this is an ambitious project with future coverage, so when I look at the project team, I see the scale of the people and the amount of knowledge and experience that they have. They are fully capable of developing this proposal, moreover, with their qualifications and education, they will help this project go far in the future. Each person's personal information is public and easy to find on links such as telegram, Facebook\u2026or the website https://proskills39.com/ provided by the author team.\nI will give the feasibility of the project a score of 4, the score is not perfect but very high on the rating scale because I think it is necessary to add a commitment to information security for customers in the process of translating documents whether.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is clear from previous analysis, I think the project can be easily audited on progress and success. It is also easy for the community to monitor the project continuously and closely. With a very detailed plan and a clear budget, if this proposal is approved at this fund 9, I am very much looking forward to the monthly results report of the author team for the proposal with the following criteria: the work has been, is and will be implemented, the budget has been, is and will be used to count down until the end of the project's time.\nI see that the project's KPIs are given with 6 very clear indicators, specifically, these numbers are reasonable and I believe this goal can be achieved by the project team as complete as the foundation service market with 3 languages: English, Japanese and Vietnamese, complete translation of the content of 100 services into Japanese, complete translation of the content of 100 services into Vietnamese, implementation of 18 chapters marketing program for 6 months, attracted more than 200 professionals to sign up for an account to post services/projects on the Services Marketplace platform, attracted more than 500 customers (Proposer, PA, others) to book services on the Service Market platform. From those successes, the project will also bring to the community good results such as attracting more proposers and PAs from the Japanese community and the Vietnamese community to participate in Catalyst because there are no longer language or skill barriers that they lack, supporting Japanese and Vietnamese proposers and PAs to make funding projects more convenient and cost-effective, contributing to an increase in the number of blockchain and Cardano application projects thanks to the center's language support experienced service center, helping professionals and skilled people increase their income by utilizing their free time and skills. This is also the result that the challenge posed for each proposal to achieve.\nThis is a follow-up to a previously funded project in Catalyst, the funded project is in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of October 2022. Follow the progress of the old project at the link provided by the author team at the end of this proposal.\nI will give 5 points, an absolute score for the project's auditability because for me, the team did a great job in developing this proposal at fund 9. I am looking forward to this proposal being approved sponsored at fund 9 and also returning to participate in the following funds in Catalyst's sponsorship campaigns.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3607, "q0": "Proposing a reasonable solution to the challenge.

There are also more specialized services on blockchain: training in knowledge related to catalysts, blockchain.\nAll these services are essential for both boclchain experts and non-specialists, language barrier will no longer be an issue.\nI think this project will be welcomed by the professional and non-cardano community. The proposal will help the Cadano community in the East Asian market become more known and grow.\nI understand the 3 risks that are very proposed and very reasonable, as the basis of service delivery, the quality of service must be paid attention to. When cryptocurrency has not been recognized as an official means of payment, this payment will face obstacles and risks when the coin market is unstable.\nThe solution to convert to usdt will be better and more acceptable than the option of converting into stablecoin after the Luna crash.\nOverall this project is very useful, I support the project development", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget is allocated to personnel in charge of 3 main jobs: content and platform translation, marketing, and management.

The team consists of Vietnamese and Japanese personnel specializing in interpretation, translation, and marketing with full information and experience for the community to authenticate.\nOne thing I wonder about the project is the application for funding from Catalyst continues to be successful, the project continues to develop, will these services collect fees from service users?.

Assistance Marketplace provides support, Creates a platform to connect competent people with inexperienced Proposers and Protectors in non-English speaking communities, primarily in Japan and Vietnam. Although the project's risk is that it is difficult to handle the quality of the service, in the beginning, the project has applied many methods to overcome this limitation: they have applied importance scoring and service quality scores for customers ( proposer, PA...) to evaluate after using the service. At that time, underrated suppliers will be warned by them, and at the same time, they will help providers improve service quality; if the status of suppliers is still underestimated, the project side will restrict that provider's service.\u201d\n\n\u201cService Marketplace is set up with English as the direct language for immediate use by proponents and PAs in English-speaking countries. In this proposal, the project pursues funding to expand the market of Proskill39 Service Marketplace to Japan and Vietnam. The proposal obviously describes objectivity and subjectivity, and they propose to provide new additions such as Services for Proposer, Services for PA, Logistics services for the funds project, and Other services.\u201d\n\nThe proposed solution is planned to facilitate easy payments for countries and suppliers that are difficult due to the laws of their country of living. The project will use the Paypal payment gateway for their transactions. Moreover, the project will use ADA for payment; in the future, ADA will be the primary payment gateway for suppliers worldwide.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "FEASIBILITY  Rating of 5 (I strongly agree)\n\nFirst of all, Service Marketplace for Japan, Viet Nam is already a project in complete development; Service Marketplace has been set up in the early stages with the necessary basic features of a supplier\nconnection platform. Service providers and service users. The brand name of this Catalyst-sponsored Services Marketplace is Proskills39. With some work completed before receiving funding from Catalyst Fund 8, this indicates a reliable and efficient team.\n\n\u201cThe information about the team clarified in the proposal is detailed, and the connected experiences and the work done to show that the team is fully qualified for developing this work. The budget breakdown describes 7 items, and it is very detailed and rigorous. The cost of platform translation into Japanese and Vietnamese is very reasonable in the Vietnamese market, Nhat Ban, and some other countries because it prices very well for suppliers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe project has clear funding, the roadmap has been prepared very carefully, clarity on time, goals/timelines to be implemented over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plan has no considerable technical complexity or hurdles, as the idea focuses on Creating a Platform to connect well-skilled people with inexperienced Proponents and PAs in non-English speaking communities, especially in Japan and Vietnam.

If we are likely to achieve all service targets, the proposal will help the current process be more optimized. Moreover, it may bring many benefits to PA and proposers during the entire Catalyst. I myself found it difficult to access Catalyst from my earliest days due to a lack of language, skills, and knowledge, although I started out as a researcher. Thus, I think these services are necessary for people who want to access Catalyst.\nDiscrete classes and meetings are not what we aim for when developing the community. Creating a complete service to become a consistent supporting tool will be our goal instead. Vietnam and Japan are potential markets that we need to conquer in the first move of the plan. The positive aspect of the service is that it has more specific standards and values than basic communication classes. When using the service, it also shows the seriousness of the person in need of support and the enthusiasm of the support person, thereby avoiding the waste of time of many parties and controlling the quality from the initial stage. Furthermore, the proposal is able to create higher value and employment for experienced individuals who participated in the early days of community formation and contributed to the development of future generations to assist the community in moving faster and more unitedly.\nAdditionally, there is intercultural connection and engagement between the Vietnamese and Japanese communities through labor export. Japanese is the second most popular foreign language in Vietnam after English, which enhances the possibility of community growth in both the markets for which the service is targeted.\nIn terms of impact, I give the above advantages 5 points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to the fact that the proposal already has an English version, this version can provide an impetus for developing Vietnamese and Japanese versions along with the marketing goals of Facebook, Telegram, and Youtube. Therefore, I assume that the proposal has a detailed development plan for the next 6 months.\nFirstly, since the team already has experience in developing communities on social networking platforms, I believe that the service will operate smoothly. It was a wise decision to prioritize language expansion in Japan and Vietnam; both countries are increasingly interested in blockchain, in particular, and Cardano, in general, but very few individuals have access to official supporting tools. The vast majority are just self-study via fragmented sources with little quality control.\nSecondly, the supporting services verified by Cardano and its community will provide the community with a guarantee of credibility and quality of the content, so it is likely to attract new users to join the ecosystem methodically while still ensuring transparency. Users can overcome language barriers with the service, but another issue arises for those who have ideas but lack the professional skills to develop them. In that case, the service will act as more of a mentor than a translator. As a result, the proposal should include more services that may assist those who are complete beginners with no experience of Catalyst in becoming experts, as well as PAs and proposers. These services are often aimed at students or working people, and they require a significant amount of time and effort. However, the potential for exploitation will be much greater. When the proposal is finished, it will be a long-term and stable service with excellent values, despite requiring more effort than other supporting and evaluating services.\nDue to its advantages, 4 points would be reasonable for this criteria.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has mentioned the service metrics that are improved in the Vietnamese and Japanese versions in detail. Additionally, the proposal also included the marketing program and the goals of attracting PAs and proposers using the service to connect with the experienced members. In my opinion, this is a transparent proposal for which you can safely track the working progress and the previous funding. The experiences gained when using a website can partly prove the proposal's capacity and commitment to work.\nFurthermore, the current development team has a lot of experience in community development and using tools based on popular social platforms, so I expect we do not have to spend much time tracking project progress. Besides that, the proposal recognizes the significance of determining how many PAs and proposers will be successful in the future, which can be a critical metric.\nOn top of that, the plan to exploit the Japanese and Vietnamese markets can complement each other. For instance, the Vietnamese community in Japan is popular with well-qualified overseas students and labor exports. Therefore, the most efficient way to quickly expand the project is to make use of overseas students who already have basic knowledge and are living in both Vietnam and Japan.\nDue to these positive competitive advantages, 5 points is a reasonable result for the auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3368", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11768, "q0": "The \u201cService Marketplace for Japan, VN\u201d solution is perfectly aligned with the goal of the challenge. I commend the authors for a very succinct, clear and informative proposal. This is exactly what we're looking for in this challenge. The solution content is to create a platform to connect people with good skills (translation skills, writing proposals, creating videos...) with non-English speaking PAs/proposers, supporting two languages: Japanese and Vietnam. In fact, this solution received a funding amount of $7,400 at Fund 8. The result of the funding was the birth of Service Marketplace Proskills39 (https://proskills39.com/) \u2013 a service marketplace offering over 100 services Catalyst related services (services for PAs, services for proponents\u2026) in English, connecting service providers with PAs/Proposers in English-speaking countries. Therefore, this proposal is a continuation and expansion of the team solution that was funded at Fund 8, with additional support for 2 more languages: Japanese and Vietnamese. I noticed, in the new proposal at Fund 9, the list of service items provided on Proskills39 is kept by the team, unchanged. There are two differences in the content proposed at Fund 9, namely: First, the team integrates 2 new languages into Proskills39 to expand service provision to 2 markets Japan - Vietnam. Second, the team strengthens Facebook, Telegram, and Youtube marketing campaigns every month to attract more Japanese and Vietnamese experts to participate in Proskills39. The indicated risks show that the group has had a very thorough analysis and study, along with remedial measures to limit the effects. Since this is a phase 2 implementation project, it is my expectation that the team should have a brief report attached on the successful results achieved in phase 1, compared to the group success KPIs presented in Fund 8. A number of indicators the community would like to assess, before deciding whether to continue to support this proposal or not. Specifically: number of customers/service providers participating in Proskills39 (in which, how many people operate regularly and generate monthly revenue), number of successful orders through Proskills39, traffic volume Web access daily/weekly/monthly\u2026 Overall, I believe and appreciate the impact of the solution.

The authors explain perfectly what will be done, very detailed and clear. Each month, 3 marketing campaigns will be carried out, along with the translation of service content into Japanese and Vietnamese. The budget of the proposal in Fund 9 is almost 3 times the budget at Fund 8. I have done the statistics, the marketing cost is $10800 (44.7% of the budget), the translation cost is $10350 (42.8% of the budget), management cost $3000 (12.4%). The cost structure in my opinion is reasonable for the solution to continue to develop and expand in phase 2. However, I don't see the team providing a reserve fund due to the price fluctuation of ADA coin (as mentioned above risk assessment section). I suggest that the team consider giving 10-15% of the total budget to this fund. Also, regarding marketing costs, I wish the team had a better explanation. Specifically: what are the marketing activities that will be implemented, detailed unit prices of attached items. Here, the marketing costs described ($300 * 3 times * 6 months) are not clear to me. Since the team is expected to do marketing on 3 platforms: Facebook, Telegram, Youtube, the marketing costs on each platform should be divided clearly. This helps the community better understand how much money is used for each work item. Regarding the team, the members have cooperated at the proposal to be funded at Fund 8 so I fully believe that the team will have enough experience and capacity to successfully implement the solution at Fund 9.

If possible, in addition to the existing indicators, I would like the team to consider some other important conversion indicators of Proskills39. For example: the number of successful orders on this platform in 6 months, the number of suppliers that operate regularly and generate monthly revenue, the number of customers who have returned to the service (more than 1 time) on the platform. In my opinion, these are important indicators of the quality of the platform to aim for, instead of the initial approach numbers. Overall, I think the project is completely auditable.

Have you ever thought about the risk that the current human resources and after hiring more experts still do not have enough to meet the needs of the large market? In summary, I agree with the feasibility of the proposal that the team stated. Please refer to my questions and positive comments to further improve the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of transparency and auditability, the milestone roadmap given by the team is quite reasonable. However, I would like to comment that the team should attach the milestone roadmap with specific dates and months of the year so that the community can more easily monitor and evaluate. This also increases the transparency and auditability of the proposal significantly. Through the definition of project success presented in the proposal, I see the great benefit of this idea when applied in practice. It directly and positively affects the lives of the participants in the proposal and also those who provide and use the service. It's a pity that I don't see KPIs and key metrics. These are two quite important criteria to evaluate the auditability and transparency of the proposal. I hope the team will add more soon to make transparency and auditing more visible to the community. Throughout the proposal, the problem was clearly described with a solution. This is something I am very satisfied with and confirm that not every team can do that. I wish the team every success.

The proposal seeks to create a platform to connect people with good skills but inexperienced proposers and proposal assessors in non-speaking English community, especially Japan and Vietnam.\nThe team had funding in previous project called 'Service Marketplace  Proskills39 set up in English. \nIn addressing the challenge, as indicated, this proposal will help to connect skilled people with proposals, unskilled and experienced PAs in the Japanese and Vietnamese communities; improve the quality of proposal; new members who want to become Proposers, PAs , etc. will be more enthusiastic to participate with support from PAs etc. and skilled experts on Proskills39 Service Marketplace; attract more people to perform their roles in Catalyst will lead to growth in the Cardano ecosystem which is the goal of the challenge.\nThe proposal outlined a few risks associated with the project and mitigating strategy provided. To mention one, the proposer has written that it may be difficult to manage the quality of the service that comes from the provider in the beginning, but the strategy to mitigate this risk is to apply reputation scoring for customers to evaluate service providers after using their service. \nThis proposer has done a good work here and deserves 5 star rating for addressing the challenge effectively.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal plans to execute this project in 6 months and has given detailed schedule, dividing into first month to sixth month of work with specific activities.\nThey seek to translate 100 services into Japanese and Vietnamese, and attract users from the Japanese and Vietnamese communities.\nIn detailed summary, in the first month, they will translate basic content on Service Marketplace into Japanese; implement 3 marketing campaigns on Facebook, telegram and YouTube and evaluate and improve activities. All these activities will be replicated for the second month to the sixth month.\nThe budget total requested is $24150 for the 6 months project, broken down comprehensively. The highest amount of $5400 each is allocated to cost of marketing in the Japanese and Vietnamese communities. The budget total and breakdown costs are reasonable. \nThe team is made up of 13 experts, broken down into roles as marketplace administration team - 1 person; team marketing - 3 people; Translation team - 7 and technical support team- 2.\nThey all have various relevant skills listed as business finance solution experts, software engineering experts, blockchain technology experts, translation and management experts whose LinkedIn profile links have been provided for further checks on the team. \nThe team, I believe, is capable of implementing the project successfully. \nThe proposer mentioned that in the future, they plan to issue tokens for better payment so they will seek further support from Catalyst. \nIt is also mentioned that they are participating in other proposals in other challenges in this Fund9, and are also working on proposals from previous funds.\nAll the facts above point to the conclusion that it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

However, the expected expenditure for stage 2 is $24,000 which is used for translation and marketing in 2 small markets like Vietnam and Japan whilst never running a trial test in bigger oceans, this strategy seems to be inappropriate.
