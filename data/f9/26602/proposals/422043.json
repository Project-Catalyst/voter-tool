Is there any other way to automate this? As an active investor in the space, similar services are already available such as https://coinmarketcal.com/en/ or https://www.cnftcalendar.com/ for Cardano NFTs - which I am sure the proposer can collaborate more with them (such as API services?)

The East Asian user community has a large amount of interest in new projects on the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal aims to build a feature that provides public sales information, ISPO running schedule, NFT mint schedule, .etc, to serve this large number of users. I object to this reviewer's discriminatory view of users by geography in East Asia and other parts of the world, for which this recommendation is inappropriate. This is a narrow view, and discrimination is no different from racism.\nI have experience building websites since 2010 and am an ADA investor researching and evaluating blockchain projects from 2017 to the present. I have attached the admin management, events, and website display to prove I am building this feature. I have built and managed cardanoproject.org myself, and a real online presence has proved it. I have already started working on the feature of this proposal, so I can be confident that, with or without funding, the feature of this proposal will be completed; I prove it with my work, not a blueprint with vague numbers. I also mentioned the ability to develop a feature for project owners to post and manage their events, making this project entirely scalable.\nIn this proposal, two weeks after the feature and appearance of this proposal have been completed, upcoming events begin to be posted. This proposal is under construction; I have attached pictures to demonstrate it. Alternatively, you can now visit the link: https://cardanoprojects.org/wp-admin login with user/pass: demo-admin/De&Ad123456789& to check the authenticity. The features of this proposal I am working on, so progress will not depend on whether the proposal is funded or not. In the case of a funded project, two weeks is when the initial budget has not been received, but this project has been completed. Why do you say there is no KPI, no goal? After two weeks, you can check the number of events posted. The goals and times I give are completely testable as everything is visible to the community for verification. The number of events posted to the platform will also be reported monthly, aligning with the following budget receipt process for the above reasons. I object to your comments.

This feature is likely to be a prompter to alert users of the availability of any project on the cardanoprojefts.org.

Apart from that, the budget side presents concise outlook with detailed provision of amount allocation to each item. However, the budget lacks some relevant items such as miscellaneous expenses, administrative cost and possibly team fee. These could be included in a revised version of the proposal. Aside that, I am not too satisfied with the roadmap, too vague. The information presented  on roadmap gives an indication of what to expect within weeks after funding.

In respect of that, the proposer cites, the increase in the number of events on the platform as one of the main indicators presented to measure the progress and success of the project. In my view, indicators like a percentage increase in page visit could also provide an accurate measurement of the performance of the project.

Through the project, the Cardano community does not have to spend much time searching for information and scheduling events on other channels such as Twitter, Telegram, or Discord each project. This project in the future also plans to update more features for project owners to post and manage their events actively. This project meets the high demand for the Cardano community and contributes to the promotion of projects in the Cardano ecosystem.

The project allows the Cardano community to continuously update the event calendar and not miss important events, meeting the practical needs of the Cardano community. The proponent has pre-designed his own website, which is thoughtful preparation. The proponent is an ADA investor with experience in web design and experience in researching and evaluating Blockchain projects, and I appreciate that. The team of members involved in the project is only Garry, and I hope you will have more members to develop the project better in the future. The project is built to provide an event calendar two weeks after being funded. Then the events will be updated continuously, meeting the needs for fast, timely, and accurate information for the Cardano community. This is a project with a quick construction and development time, meeting the immediate information needs of the Cardano ecosystem. One challenge is whether the proponent can update the entire project calendar in time for the Cardano community? The amount of information about projects in the ecosystem is growing and increasing. The proponent proposed a solution to the challenge of developing a team dedicated to posting daily events and developing additional features for project owners to post events on the platform automatically. The proponent offered a very relevant and reasonable solution to the challenge. The project has a clear and practical cost division for the items. The project has a rapid development roadmap, meeting the needs of providing information and event calendars for the Cardano ecosystem.

I found the budget for the project to be appropriate, the budget divided into categories, and transparent. I think the proponent should have a plan to help the community know more about this portal and calendar of events to expand and bring comprehensive benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. The project brings convenience to the Cardano community in the process of tracking Cardano events, helping participants access and capture events quickly and on time.

It is important to also explain that from the second until sixth month, the proposer will hire new people to design and create content to achieved the proposal's goals. The risk that the proposer need to address is about the website traffic. The proposer need to answer his strategy to get known and used by many people. If the platform is great, but no one know about it, it will be useless. The proposer need to make collaboration with KOLs and crypto influencer to promote this website. With this marketing strategy, the proposer will need additional budget to propose too. Last thing, the proposer need to add his Linkedln so that the voters and PA can check the proposer background.
