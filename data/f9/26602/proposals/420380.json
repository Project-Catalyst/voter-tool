In this time of economic crisis in Sri Lanka - where the country's economy is on the brink of collapsing - is this what Sri Lanka people look for a solution? The proposer mentioned several time about 25 million Sinhala speakers, but how many are they that has an interest in blockchain space? \n\nAs an assessor, I would suggest the proposer shares at least a few supporting data why choosing Sinhala-Srilanka for this project, a simple search through google trends or the latest research articles about \"blockchain in Srilanka\" maybe can help to justify the sense of urgency and help the voters on later stage", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer shares detailed references regarding the team members, experience, and skills needed to make this project successful. Dimitri as the project leaders also have experience in Srilanka for several years during his career.\n\nThe budget was broken down in detail and is reasonable for unit $$, but the proposer does not share where is 15K words calculation coming from. \n\nThe timetable seems realistic with 3 months in length and with detailed milestones shared in the proposal. But considering the economic crisis happening in Sri Lanka, the risk mitigation should be calculated very carefully, as the proposer mentioned in the proposal the volatility value of ADA in the bear market PLUS the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, may very difficult to keep the costs covered - Sri Lanka already on 60%+ inflation. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer shares a detailed milestone with KPI metrics that is easy to understand and monitor, but unfortunately, there are no exact numbers yet to be measured. I would suggest starting with a rough number and % growth of those metrics. So the community will have an idea or a tangible number to follow.

To answer the asessors question. yes there is and has been demand for education on the blockchain. Reputable and accurate information is a must since currently various shitcoins are circulating which are in form of pyramid schemes which would bring disrepute to crypto in general and blockchain as a whiole. The masses do not understand English. The English documentation and videos are not geared anyway for a non technical user. Therefore we have to simplify information since we are catering to a mass people group. Not just coders, not just techies and developers. Simplifying matters is vital.  There is no Sri Lanka Cardano community other than a handful of crypto traders. Even the stakepool in existence has a tiny amount of ADA in it. Its at an infant stage.  He asks if at the time of economuc crisis is this what people would want  as a solution?  Well first and foremost they would want fuel.  But since Cardano is not in the business of providing fuel, the next best thing they would want is a  way to get out of this mess. In their case and in mine, it is by understanding Cardano and Catalyst enough so that I/they can make income by doing projects in/for Catalyst. In doing assessments. Therefore for people to learn about Catdano is of vital importance and as an answer to the question, this is absolutely what they would want. To be taught how to fish so to speak. How we came on 15k words has been clearly stated \n\nSri Lankas inflation has no bearing on the risk. The risk is if ADA depreciates beyond what we budget for.  If the rupee depreciates it wont affect the project since i would be paying less ADA than initially planned if rupee depreciates further. The risk right along has been ADA depreciating against the dollar or rupee value not vice versa\n\nIm not sure what he means in Auditability of starting with a rough number. Metrics cannot be rough. They have to be accurate and easily measurable. The metrics proposed are easily measurable.\n\n"}, {"id": 2023, "q0": "The proposal states that there are not enough content in Sinhala, which has 25M speakers around the world. To address this problem the proposal will provide translated content taken in the official cardano platforms, dubbing videos and posting in YT.\n\n\nThe impact of this proposal relies in diminishing the currently existent language barriers of ADA and blockchain to communities other than English speakers. More than that, since the built team has several years of experience in translation market, it has the potential to grow and start to translate content to several other languages. Therefore, it scalable capability is huge.\n\n\nReducing the language barriers and making people more comfortable to learn a new and complex content is important if we want to make the Cardano a blockchain of choice.\n\n\nThat being said, this align with this challenges because the success of this proposal can make the ADA and blockchain technology reach millions of people. \n\n\nThe metrics and goals of this proposal is measuring the quantity of viewers and engagement. Therefore, it also is correlated with the challenge objective since these values will allow us to know the spread ness of the ada content in this community.\n\n\nThis proposal is also able to scale. However, to make it happen, the content choice and dubbing quality must be impeccable.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\nTo analyze its feasibility potential, we have some points to evaluate:\n\n1 \u2013 Roadmap:  The roadmap could be more detailed. The whole project will be done in three months, however there is not well defined. Even the quantity of videos is not well defined. Therefore it is hard to know exactly what will be done.\n\n2 \u2013 Budget: It is clear and well defined. It gives notion of how long will be the videos and what can be done with the budget asked.\n\n3 \u2013 Risk Management: The risks are well addressed. However it could take into consideration to include the content choice. Since the team will choose the content to be translated, it might happen a choice that will have little or no engagement. Therefore, the team could include a marketing strategy to reach people and having a plan to make the community say and ask what should be translated \u2013 this will increase the community participation and will reduce the risk of a poor choice.\n\n4 \u2013 Team: Good team with a lot of experience. It was also provided the member\u2019s linkedin. It might be interesting to add a marketing specialist team member to help with the disclosure.\n\n5 \u2013 Self funding/scalability: It\u2019s quite probable that if this proposal be successful, having a good engagement, it\u2019ll be self funded. Also, due to the teams experience and market knowledge, they know lots of translators which could also join and translate the content to other languages. Therefore, this proposal has a huge potential to scale to other languages and engage people.\n\nTherefore, if the \u2018choice risk\u2019 be managed correctly and the roadmap be improved, there is no good reason for this project not be done.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The YT channel is a good way to verify if the videos was done. However, since the roadmap is not well defined with a certain quantity of videos and not having a previous content selection, it\u2019s hard to know if the proposal is being correctly and on-time implemented.\n\nThe KPIs provided are related with the quantity of interactivity, therefore measuring the view number, commentaries, shares etc. It might be good to include a survey asking which type of content they want to be translated and also verify the profile of the viewers, meaning that you can create content specifically to your viewers.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "There are some points which indicate the assessor is not that clear, because he says our roadmap is not clearly laid out but it has been given in detail.

This is strategic initiative that would show the inclusiveness of Cardano in making the world a better place by helping communities explore the various opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. From what we see in this project, the proposer intends to make available Cardano resources in a language understood by the Sinhala community. In respect of this, I see an opportunity to not just create awareness via the educational lessons but also create the opportunity to onboard the community into the Cardano community. Ideally, this should foster the scaling up of the growth of Cardano in Asia. I wish the proposer specify how he intend creating awareness about this project to attract enough target audience?

Aside that, all relevant links have been attached to support their credentials. The proposer  also presents a detailed roadmap with a clear description of what their activities would entail. There is also a well defined timelines to guide the implementation of the project. In my opinion, the roadmap is well designed to complement the effort of team in carrying out the project.

As many of the people might not know English and would be familiar in their local language can also get the knowledge of blockchain and Cardano by this proposal. As there are 25 million Sinhala speaking people globally they will be educated about Cardano through this translation which will in-turn get more users to cardano system and will increase its value and credibility.

The idea will also allow many new people to join the community who have a wide variety of viewpoints.\nWhile the proposal does provide demographic information about Sinhala speakers, I think it would be beneficial to learn more about how well Sinhala speakers understand blockchain technology. More information and analysis of the target market and how it would effect the challenge, particularly how it will provide value to the Cardano ecosystem, would have been beneficial.
