In that respect, I anticipate that by the proposed incentive model here, the people\u2019s livelihood would be improved to enable them feel comfortable even with their deprived environment. The value proposition here to the Cardano community is that, this would engineer people into the Cardano ecosystem as developers since the main highlights of this project is to shape the talent and skills of the people via education, onboard more people into the community and project the image of Cardano as a more inclusive community. Worth noting here is the careful consideration to the specific areas of study for this project. Ideally, the educational content shouldn\u2019t be a random selection of courses but this project provides a more thoughtful approach to the learning platform. The more important observation here is the proposer\u2019s  detailed understanding of the risk that confronts the project : literacy, Internet and computer access and course retention. The proposer also offers a clear strategy to navigate these risks. Finally, I am also satisfied with the team\u2019s long term strategy.

In all, the proposer presents a 4 phase framework of the project spanning for a year. More important to the roadmap, is the time horizons assigned to the set of activities within each phase of the project. Secondly, we\u2019re presented with a 4 team member for the project. Would their skills, experience and expertise be relevant to the project? From their profile, I recognized that the team basically have an expertise within the teaching field and a few have established a working relationship with other international organizations that put them in the best position to implement this project.

In view of this, I see a clear alignment of the KPIs with the objective of the project and can also provide accurate measurement of the performance of the project.

All of these difficulties give rise to\u00a0inability to legally obtain formal access to employment, healthcare, and education. The proposal proposes a solution in which the Cardano Blockchain could be used on multiple levels to address all of the preceding issues, including: 1) A blockchain solution for storing identities, with use cases\u00a0such as when communicating with non-governmental organizations or claiming access to an educational platform. 2) Creating a virtual social and learning platform for language, digital, and technical education with respect cultural uniqueness of the Rohingya people. 3) Introducing a native token as a refugee incentive, with the option to exchange it for services.

Furthermore, there are already news related to R-coin, R-ID, and other proposed ideas on the website, indicating that work is already underway independently of the current funding.The timetable is not stated in the corresponding section, but there is a general plan mentioned in the \"impact section\" that anticipates enrollment of students, some of whom will become registered teachers (via virtual education), and enrollment of 100-300 Rohingya people in the R-ID and slightly less in the R-Academy program during the second year. There are no issues with the team members; all of them are searchable on their websites, their background and experience are clearly related to the execution of the proposed solution, and their roles in the project are defined. Another issue that is slightly disconcerting to me is the lack of specificity in the budget. For example, the cost of \"Online training, reward, and certification\" is not broken down and it is not explained what the cost is for or how it was calculated. As a result, determining whether the total budget is appropriate is difficult. We would have a better idea of how appropriate the costs are if we knew how much an FTE per month for a teacher is and how many months are required. On the other hand, it is clear that the program will continue to operate regardless of funding, and I would expect the project to succeed based on the results of the previous successful pilot.
