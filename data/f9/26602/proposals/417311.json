Proposer provides statistics on the number of Tamil speakers, but in my opinion, the proposer should also provide more analysis on the level of blockchain understanding of Tamil speakers. If blockchain understanding is low, then creating basic blockchain videos should be prioritized first, before creating content about the Cardano ecosystem. Thus attracting more audience.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The information provided in the proposal are clear and understandable. I do think that the proposal has the potential to be successful since Proposer is (maybe) a Sri Lankan, also Proposer and the other team members have a lot of experience.

An extensive analysis has been made about the challenges and the risks. An implementation plan is available. Last but not least, the budgets breakdown of the cost is thought out very well and very well-explained. Those breakdown helped me understand how they will use their requested funds.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has a 3 months implementation schedule, those 3 months work contents are fully listed and measurable with 120 minutes of translated video with subtitles and voiceovers.

There is limited content about the Cardano ecosystem in their language for these people. Due to a lack of Tamil content, these speakers are unable to learn in their native language. The petitioner's solution is to get official Tamil documentation, translated and made into videos in Tamil. This will educate these people about the Cardano ecosystem. This proposal offers a clear solution to the language problem. This project will have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem by bringing in a new community. As a result, 75 million people will have the opportunity to gain easier access to the cardano ecosystem. The main statistics and goals of the proposal are included. (number of subscribers to the Youtube channel, average video views, comments per video, viewing hours) These recorded metrics fall within the challenges setting outlined. It is clearly stated why the proposal meets the objective of Fund 9. These are well described how they will be approached. The biggest challenge included is when a translator falls ill. The submitter has assured that there are enough other translators who can continue working on the project. The petitioner has ensured that he has an emergency solution for the unforeseen circumstances. It is also good to include an emergency fund of 10 percent on top of the total costs to be added.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills and experience to implement the proposal.

It is good that a budget is provided to finance social campaigns. It is also good that there is an amount for unforeseen costs. More money is needed to develop more content. The videos will not be monetized until there are 1000 subscribers. A realistic timetable has been included to complete the work.

The proposal describes a clear description of the intended problem. A language barrier can prevent you from getting the chance to learn things in your own native language, which means you often don't understand some things. By translating content across the Cardano ecosystem, you gain a new community. Currently, there are almost no people from this population group who have access to this ecosystem.

Over 75\u00a0million native Tamil speakers exist, according to the proposal's author. Facilitating access to Cardano resources for the Tamil-speaking community through the translation of documents and the production of content films for Tamil speakers is a primary goal of this proposal. Furthermore, the idea will allow a huge number of new people with diverse perspectives to join the community.\nThe proposal provides data on the number of Tamil speakers; however, I think it would be beneficial to additionally include information on how well Tamil speakers understand blockchain technology. Spreading awareness through making documentaries about it might be as\u00a0important as providing\u00a0information about the Cardano ecosystem. This will have a larger and more positive impact on the neighborhood.\nThe project's goals are reasonable given the complexity of the work to be done. It's a scalable project with worldwide potential for Cardano's benefit.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan\u00a0provides a comprehensive schedule and output, down to the number of translated videos to be released each month.\nThe proponents have more than three decades of experience interpreting official documents for the Ministry of Languages, and they also have worked for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.

These references give me confidence that the applicants can translate documents and create videos with appropriate material for the Tamil-speaking community. Also, the budget is set down extremely well, including fees for each activity.\nHowever, I think certain details are missing and would benefit from being filled up. First, I'd like to learn more about the content of each video\u00a0so that we can gauge the extent to which our viewers have a clear understanding of the Cardano ecosystem. The second issue is that not enough information is publicly available about the marketing campaign's success or failure.\nMore specific information will increase the plan's likelihood of success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To aid in more precise tracking of progress, proposer presents a thorough roadmap outlining the monthly milestones that need to be achieved.\nThere are certain broad measurements that\u00a0have been presented but\u00a0I would suggest some\u00a0few more\u00a0examples,\u00a0including\u00a0the weekly trend of view rate and the ratio of favorable to negative comments and feedback from the audience.\n\u00a0I would encourage the proposer to consider adding more specific and quantitative KPIs in the future such as: an increase of one thousand members in the Tamil-speaking Cardano community; ten proposals submitted by the Khmer community;... \u00a0 As a result, Cardano community will know whether or not the initiative was successful.\nMoreover, is there a means to monitor the project's development outside from the YouTube channel's analytics?

The target figures given are very detailed and reasonable. The budget is paid by the team for translation and communication, which I find quite reasonable. What I'm wondering here is that the team did not present a source of the $2000 contingency cost.

Moreover, it will takes 3 days or more time if they translate technology video contents.

The proposal is aiming to provide translated content in Tamil. The material is taken from the official Cardano documentation and the content will be translated and made into a Tamil video. Tamil is India's eleventh largest state in terms of area and sixth most populous (75 million people). Proposal description is clear and rich. Content translated and turned into video is a good way to convey information and easily reach the community. Information about the Cardano ecosystem will be quickly transmitted, making it possible for many people to perceive, learn and access the ecosystem, as well as Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. One positive thing is that the proponent has laid out the indicators right from the proposal's impact section. This proves that the proponent has a lot of knowledge and ability to carry out the project. Know the goal to be achieved and how to do it. In addition, the proponent also recognizes the main risks and has active solutions to minimize the risks that may occur when the project is implemented.

Detailed schedule of jobs in each month. However, in my opinion. The roadmap can be more detailed, for example providing a parallel timetable for each specific task. That helps the proponent to more clearly define the progress of the project. The budget requires $11,150. In my opinion the required budget is reasonable for the work and time to be done in the project. Budget details are presented clearly and reasonably.

The proposer states that there is 75 mil people around the globe that speaks this language, which creates the assumption of the impact of the proposal. The proposer also states, that having such videos will provide education to those who speak Tamil, and can bring more India people to the ecosystem, because as stated in proposal \u2013 there are \u201calmost no Indians in the ecosystem, as well as Blockchain technology and crypto currencies\u201d \u2013 well, maybe it has something to do with crypto ban in India? Or, at the same time, 75 mil Tamil speakers does not mean they speak exclusively Tamil. Overall, I agree with the problem statement \u2013 to have more content in different language in order to bring more people to ecosystem. Nevertheless, I am lacking more supporting data of the solution, because we can not determine whether having Tamil content will automatically lead to the solution. (since I remember that such proposals were already set in the previous fund \u2013 different translations \u2013 proposer could have provided these data to support the estimated impact. Key metrics stated in the proposal such as number of views and likes are aligned to the solution of the proposal and we will be able to evaluate the impact retrospectively. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The time plan is set to 3 months, whilst the proposer plan to have 10-20 videos at the end. I find this range  - 10-20 large. We are talking 100% diff. If the goal would be 18-20 it would seem more reasonable. Despite this large deviation, it does not decrease the feasibility to have at least 10 videos, but I find it incorrect set. The videos will be taken from official IOHK channels, so the source of videos is clear. The budget is set to 11 150 USD, whereas it is divided into 2 250/ month for videos, and when respecting 10 videos after 3 months, it is 750 USD/video. The proposer states, that the rate for word is 0,15 USD, but since the content of the videos is already pre-determined (taken from IOHK channels) this part could have been more detailed e.g. video 1, duration 10 min, 400 usd\u2026.etc. I know it would require more thorough analysis, but since there were many proposals as such from the same proposer, assuming translating similar content in different languages, having one analysis could have been performed. Another part of budget is 2 500 for social media campaign and 2 000 contingency fee. To be honest, I completely disagree with contingency based on market volatility. As far as I know, the ADA received could be transferred to a stable coin in case of need, or even for fiat currencies on any exchange, which would lead to preserving the amount. Maybe I am overlooking something, but it does not seem \u201cneeded\u201d. The team is composed from 4 members, with vast bio provided and linked in profiles. I find these somewhat less relevant, since it is mentioned that master translators will be still hired. These profiles could have been disclosed instead (or just a representative). Even tough Muttiah Duraiswamy is having tamil as language, it was not mentioned specifically that he will be master translator. To conclude, because some parts of the proposal I find slightly misleading, overextended or not explained fully, I am decreasing one star down.

Regarding the success of the proposal, we can count interactions of these videos, but unfortunately, it will not tell us how many was on boarded due to this content, so audit of the success of the proposal is not fully possible, since it is mentioned many times that it will bring new people to the community, and there are no metrics to verify it.
