This proposal raised an issue that is quite concerned right now, that is: \u201cCardano users in Vietnam are looking forward to more talk shows so they can stay up to date with the news and get their questions answered about Cardano.\u201d In recent years, the number of Vietnamese people using cryptocurrencies has increased. However, most people participate in the form of speculation, surfing rather than long-term investment, maybe part of the reason is that they do not have enough background knowledge and do not know the practical applications that the ecosystem has to offer Cardano brings. I am new to this ecosystem and have only been in crypto for 6 months. In the process of researching and learning more, I realized that for long-term development in this field, it is necessary to have a lot of knowledge, understanding, and a solid foundation to achieve the expected results. However, my limitation as well as many newbies often encounter is that I don't know where to start, or where to find the answers to questions, especially the biggest barrier is the language problem. I see that there are many problems if searching in Vietnamese will not work or the results will not be as expected. Searching in a common language like English will be much easier and more efficient. Therefore, language and time issues are difficult for us. Our difficulty is a matter of language and time. So creating weekly talk shows in the evenings to encourage people who want to dig deep into Cardano and then present it to the community to make it easier for busy people and newbies to access information about Cardano, is very meaningful and necessary. Besides, monitoring and absorbing information through talk shows, in addition to increasing knowledge and understanding, also help people to expand their relationships and meet and interact with more people. That will help a lot for newbies like me, instead of having to read and learn through dry, boring introductions or articles. With such positive effects, I think it makes sense to reward good and excellent presentations. The solution proposed by the proponent I find is also very clear and specific, through that solution, I can see the impact of the problem on FIMI community members, Vietnam, and the whole community of Cardano. To successfully implement the project, the proponent has also foreseen risks, that as Slippage of ADA price or because too many topics were requested from the community members. However, those risks are all prepared by the proponent to reduce risks. That helps the proponent to always proactively face difficulties. However, for talk shows to be attractive and interesting, in addition to excellent presenters, knowing how to attract listeners through how to lead the story, and knowing how to emphasize ideas for viewers to grasp ideas, the interaction between the presenter and the audience is also important. In my opinion, the proponent should have more exchange programs between the hours and the end of each talk show. Those exchanges can be decoding questions of which answers are keywords related to the talk show's content, or a minigame using 3-5 keywords to emphasize the main content just discussed through the talkshow. For those with good questions or excellent answers, there are rewards for them to encourage, and to let everyone capture the content without getting bored.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal has developed a relatively detailed and complete plan of implementation roadmap and budget. The proponent has divided the roadmap according to 2 main timelines: The first month after approval and after the first month, the process will be repeated weekly after 6 months after approval. Each milestone is defined with specific and clear tasks to help the community easily track information and progress. Regarding the project's budget, the proponent has also planned the estimated cost for 6 months. Here they presented a very suitable way of allocating and using capital. However, according to the opinion that I have presented above, if possible, the proponent can deduct a small part of the budget to set up a reward fund for participants of the exchanges with excellent results. The gift can be an item with the group's logo or brand on it. This also has the effect of introducing and communicating widely to the outside. Project participants include Mr. Do Manh Hung and the FIMI community, Mr. Hung is a person with a lot of experience and a relatively large influence on the community. With the teacher's strengths in all aspects, the project has a much higher probability of success.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to measure the progress of the project, the proponent provided specific and detailed KPIs, including the Number of attendees to the meeting Zoom every week, the number of topics being presented and discussed, the number of questions during the meeting, the Number of views for the talk's video that uploaded on the Youtube. However, in my personal opinion, if possible, the team should add specific data for the above KPIs, which will help monitor and evaluate the completion of the project judgment. The project's success is also presented by the proponent through specific results such as Cardano Vietnam community has one more reliable, fast, and timely information channel; Community presenters get an extra income from the rewards for their presentation, the Youtube channel reached the milestone of 100,000 subscribers. Over the past 6 years, the channel has achieved remarkable results such as more than 150 Cardano and Blockchain videos have been published, more than 15,800 subscribers, more than 635,000 views, and more than 148,000 watch hours. This is a follow-up to the previously funded proposal. With experience and resources available from the previous proposals, I think that's an advantage for this proposal.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3190", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 8, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 11790, "q0": "I am a Vietnamese so I fully support the Cardano talk for Vietnamese proposal in the Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano challenge. When I read the proposal, I found it sought to solve the problem of creating a community where Vietnamese people could stay up to date with news and have their questions answered about Cardano through the organization of weekly talkshows week.\nThis is a challenge that has submitted a proposal at fund 8 but has not yet been funded, coming back to this fund 9, the authors have chosen to change the challenge to submit the project. I saw two significant changes to the proposal in the problem solving and funding sections of the proposal. If in fund 8, the authors still have shortcomings when they have not included solutions to solve challenges in the proposal, in fund 9 these problems have been fully supplemented and detailed from the author team, for the development of the Cardano community in East Asia in particular and the Cardano community in general. In the budget section, the change can be clearly seen as the amount applied for funding has been reduced by a third from 45 000$ in fund 8 to 15,000$ in fund 9. This shows me, in fund 9, the authors have made an overall recalculation for the proposal, added more content to make it easier for the community to understand the project, and adjusted the budget to apply for funding appropriately. \nI completely agree with the solution argument that the author team makes in the proposal. I myself have known Cardano for 2 years, it took me a lot of time to search for information about an problem online so more than anyone else, I really need a place with a lot of knowledge and information Cardano standards. It will save me a lot of time and effort for this job, and I also know that in Vietnam we, the Cardano community, although not yet accounted for the highest proportion, is still growing in popularity 2022 and beyond. They are all Cardano lovers and are very loyal to the ecosystem, in addition to that, a large number of people who are learning and ready to join the community show a need to find and exchange information the news about Cardano is huge. Both exchanging information and receiving rewards will give members more motivation, encourage them to actively seek, cultivate, refine information, participate and share their knowledge multiply them for the community. Because the impact of the proposal is so great, I will give the proposal 5 points in the hope that it will be funded at this 9 fund.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has given a specific timeline and I find it reasonable. Creating a weekly schedule to exchange talk shows is also a moderate time, not too thick to absorb a lot of new knowledge.\nI see the budget of the proposal is 15 000$, which is 6% of the total project budget. The budget has been divided according to each major item, but not enough details, the amount used is not clear and specific. Some items I find lack content to know what it spends on, this makes it impossible for the community to follow the project closely. In my opinion, the author team should clarify this part of the budget, for example, in 6 months of running the project, the amount of $ 2500 training for the new core team each month needs how many people, unit price for each person, how will this amount change each month ..etc. and similarly for other expenses. The more detailed, clear and transparent the budget is given, the better. \nIn order to anticipate the risks, the proposed team has also mentioned two risks that limit the success of the project, which are the price fluctuations of ADA and too many topics raised from the community, along with it is the solution to reduce these 2 risks. I also completely agree with the author's way of taking risks.\nAbout the project's proposer, I got to know Mr. Do Manh Hung and the FIMI community through some of my friends. Although I have not had the opportunity to become his student, I know that he is a person with a lot of experience in the financial field, he has many years of experience in teaching and imparting knowledge about finance in general, about blockchain Cardano in particular for the community. In Vietnam, many young people know Cardano through his financial lessons. Moreover, he already has a certain number of members in the FiMi community he founded and this number is still growing in the future.\nI will give feasibility 4 points because I am not satisfied with the interpretation in the use of budget by the author team.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is a project where the community can completely monitor the implementation progress and success. The roadmap and implementation content by week and month have been outlined by the author group, which is easy to understand and detailed. In my opinion, if the authors edit and interpret the budget content more clearly and fully, the community will be able to monitor the project progress more continuously and closely.\nThe success of the project is measured by 4 indicators such as the number of spectators attending the Zoom meeting by week, the number of topics presented and discussed, the number of questions in the meeting and the number of video views uploaded meeting. I think these 4 indicators are relatively complete, but the authors should update the data for the 4 indicators every month to help the community easily monitor the progress of the project better.\nI know that Mr. Do Manh Hung and the FIMI community have been studying Cardano since 2017 so they have a lot of experience in this field. Furthermore, this proposal is a continuation of the previously funded proposal at fund 7 which is \"Reward for Community Translators\", the community can refer to more at the author group link below the proposal. They are gradually proving their success when their youtube channel has more than 150 published Cardano and Blockchain videos, more than 15,800 subscribers, more than 635,000 views and more than 148,000 hours of watch time. This number will increase when the author's youtube channel reaches 100,000 subscribers.\nI really hope at this fund 9, the project will be funded and known to many people. The project will develop an in-depth knowledge channel about Cardano in Vietnam to spread and attract community members who love the ecosystem in the near future. I will give the proposal transparency a score of 4, a high score on this recommendation's rating scale.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 12065, "q0": "The proposal \"CardanoTalk for Vietnamese people\" has identified a problem in the challenge and that problem has a great impact on the development of the Vietnamese community.

With the rapid development and more Vietnamese people interested in cryptocurrencies, Cardano needs to have an additional reliable, fast and timely information channel that responds to timely and in-depth news about cryptocurrency. Cardano from IOHK. Please present the problem clearly and convincingly. It offered solutions to a problem in the growth of the Cardano community, which is the growth of the Vietnamese community. The specific solution of the proposal is to build a youtube channel with in-depth content about ADA and the website of a professional team on Blockchain - Cardano: Fimi. Therefore, based on the recommendation engine, the human community will shorten the search time and collect quality information sources, thereby contributing to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. The team proposes to give specific examples in the presentation with arguments with specific, feasible, and highly effective numbers.

The proposal identified a number of risks in the implementation process and proposed solutions to overcome all those risks. You have pointed out two risks in the process of doing work and have solutions to overcome and limit those risks. In the first risk, the proposed team points out the risk of ADA Slippage. Sometimes ADA price drops suddenly, we can't sell ADA for USD or VND in time. This may leave you with insufficient budget to reward presenters and stakeholders. Leading to the disincentive of participants' interests and the success of the proposal and its solution is the request for additional funding ($2,000) to reserve this. In the second risk, the proposed team took a risk because the community members requested too many topics and overcome by selecting only some of the most important topics.. However, I have suggestions for the group. about the solution to overcome and limit the risk that you have pointed out. In the second risk, I want you to solve the problem in more detail, develop criteria to choose the most important topic, this will help you convince the community to trust the project team more, besides knowing how to filter information when receiving.

This proposers solution is simple, well laid out and addresses that need by organizing weekly video meetings presenting new up-to-date information on Cardano for the Vietnamese community. The presentations will be created by different teams of community members, who will be rewarded for their research and involvement. The video meetings will be recorded and uploaded to the FIMI YouTube channel, which already has over 15K subscribers and currently contains over 200 videos of translated and subtitled informational videos.\n\nDo Manh Hung, the proposer, who has been running the FIMI YouTube channel for the past two years, has identified the need for more easily accessible presentations in Vietnamese. Although he has already translated many informational videos into Vietnamese he knows that it can be tedious for many members to read subtitles on technical matters for long periods of time. People learn in different ways, some learn by reading, some by listening and some by watching & participating and he is aiming to provide a more engaging way to pass on condensed information about the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe project includes the involvement of teams of 10 to 20 members, who are already interested in Cardano, its blockchain and ecosystem, and who will be taking turns making the presentations once a month in an inclusive manner allowing for the communicative sharing of information. Basically, members of the community are creating Cardano focused educational content for other members of the community, thus connecting and supporting each other. \n\nThis proposal meets the challenge's goal very well: helping the Cardano ecosystem grow in focused initiatives in East Asia.

This project have several interesting aspects that could help cardano's development in vietnam. First, the technical educational content in vietnamese will help both cardano-newbies and cardano-veterans contribute to the ecosystem in a more meaningful way, as their technical knowledge will be better. Secondly, this project has high potential to atract newcomers because of its interactive nature. Having 4 teams compete and be rewarded to present a project every week will push each team to do better and produce higher quality content. Having the community pick topics will ensure the topics stay relevant and about a topic that interests the users, making them more interested in learning. A disadvantage that I see in this project is how it is a telegram and youtube based community. There exists many well-respected telegram-youtube communities for vietnamese cardano users.

There is a budget to \"\"support community members\"\", this is very vague and not elaborated upon in the proposal. What exactly does it entail? Secondly, how will the project sustain itself after initial funding? The authors indicate that this funding will allow 6 months of operation, but with no plan for self-sustainability. Does this mean the project needs to be refunded every 6 months? There is also no mention of marketing, and no marketing budget.

This is an interesting and interesting area because Vietnam is currently one of the countries that can be said to be very open to blockchain and crypto, even very responsive information sources, precisely because The Cardano ecosystem is completely suitable for the Vietnamese community. In addition to creating Cardano update programs, the author will also build a reward mechanism to encourage members to learn Cardano news and documents, then introduce them to the community, this is an idea. good idea, attract users with rewards then give them access to knowledge.\n\nThis is an idea that perfectly fits the purpose of the challenge, which is to grow the community. I appreciate the fact that Fimi always regularly makes videos about the Cardano ecosystem, but I see that the channel has been built for a long time but has not yet attracted many users to exchange (or maybe as the author said, via Zoom) and the video is recorded and upload on youtube). And I also find the information provided by the author is very complete.\n\nHowever, there is a small problem like this, this team has got the proposal of Fund 7, I have checked this information, and the budget of fund 7 is $18,000 with a roadmap of nearly 12 months, then between fund 7 and fund 9 is there any connection or difference? Fund 7 is a Reward for Community Translators, the budget plan for fund 7 is quite similar, it just differs in terms of the wording. I think the author should clarify this point.

I appreciate your solution. Also, appreciate what you have done from previous funds through the channel systems that you have done. Prove that you have invested time and effort and are running this project with great enthusiasm and seriousness. And this solution is suitable in that the Cardano community in Vietnam or the blockchain community in Vietnam is very young and highly developed in Southeast Asia. Therefore, this is a market that should receive more attention and development. However, in the Vietnamese market in particular and the world market in general, investors are still having problems with the coins being inflated in price, causing the price to fluctuate quite a lot. Meanwhile, Cardano is a system that does everything with real quality and comes to life. Therefore, there is a need for Cardano's official information channels in Vietnam to be able to disseminate more information and investors to have more confidence to keep and continue to support the project. Help bring investors and developers of other projects to participate in Cardano's project more. Therefore, the impact of this project is very good, so it is rated 5 points. Now the solution of this project is also fine because some work have already been implemented and done very well. At the same time, you are doing very well with what they are saying. Therefore, the solution here is considered to be very good. It would be better if they added in the risk section, that there are other risks, for example, related to the accuracy of information. Because this part they will assign to Core team groups and some individuals to learn and present to the community, there should be an additional mechanism for content moderation before presenting to the community.

This is a factor I appreciate because it is quite easy for the community to track and update the progress of their project implementation. Next, what the project's success looks like, they evaluate giving clear factors. It would be even better if you could add numbers to make it easier for the community to see and evaluate the effectiveness of the current project. There is also a specific time, how long it will take for you to reach the milestone of 100 thousand subscribers compared to the current number of 16 thousand people. And another point that appreciates the suitability of this project, is that they have provided very clear data on how they have used the budget from previous funds. And I appreciate how they use the budget and very effectively deploy the funds that have been funded from fund 7, in a very public and efficient way.

I think the problem is articulated very clear and the key metrics and goals aligned with the outlined challenge settings. This project will surely add value to the Cardano ecosystem. One thing that I concern is about the risk section, I think the risk for this project isn't about slippage and too many topics, but the biggest risk is the frequency of the presentations (every week) and the credibility of the presentation. It is important to make sure that the shared material are correct and checked. With weekly presentation, it could be hard to check their accuracy of the material that they shared. It is important to collaborate with Cardano Vietnam Youtube channel. It is good to have this presentation at the official channel. I observed the channel too and I found that the video with the Vietnam language has way more views than English translated videos. I think it is better if the channel could have videos from local language.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As I see the budget, I think it is important to give community who attends the presentation to get some rewards from their attandance too. So it is not only the presentator who could get reward but also the people who join and listen to the presentation. I think the presentation could have less reward, let's say $100 and there is $100 for 10 people who can ask good questions during the presentation. The learning proses can be more interesting if it could go two ways, rather than one way. It is also help the presentator to be accountable to the community and be more prepared before giving their presentation. I think $200 is a lil bit too much for one presentation. It can be shared some for the member of the community who attends the presentation. I disagree with the slippage budget too. With the fluctuation of the $ADA price, it is better to give the reward in USD.

This proposal has not been funded at Fund 8. In Fund 9, there are 2 notable innovations of the proposal. First, the authors add an assessment of the impact of the Fimi Cardano talk show on three target groups: Fimi community members, on this challenge, and on the Cardano community. Second, the project budget is adjusted down from $45000 to $15000. I appreciate the team's effort to update and refresh the information. Here, the solution offered is to build a reward mechanism to incentivize elite members of the community to delve into Cardano. These members will then present to the community to make it easier for busy people and newbies to grasp new information about Cardano. The solution to create a Cardano Talk weekly is honestly not new. In fact, some Vietnamese community groups are also conducting weekly talk shows analyzing and discussing the potential of blockchain ecosystems. However, in the context of the crypto market's recent decline and accumulation, the Vietnamese community tends to invest more time in understanding potential ecosystems for a 2-3 year investment cycle. next. Therefore, I personally evaluate this moment, this is a necessary and timely solution. As a Vietnamese who has been involved in the blockchain industry for 2 years now, I agree and clearly feel the barriers that prevent Cardano from reaching the Vietnamese community that the team raised in the proposal. According to Chainalysis, Vietnam is a country with a special interest in blockchain, especially young people under the age of 30. In 2021, Vietnam ranks highest among 154 countries worldwide on the Crypto Acceptance Index (https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index/) . The potential from the community is huge, still increasing, but we currently lack adequate, official, Vietnameseized resources to disseminate knowledge to a large number of people who love blockchain technology by Cardano. Although, nowadays there are a lot of information channels on the internet, small communities about Cardano also appear a lot on Facebook, Telegram\u2026 However, most of the information only focuses on short ADA trading opportunities. term. We lack in-depth, methodical, comprehensive information and analysis on the potential of the Cardano ecosystem. As a result, the community is not fully aware of the long-term investment opportunities with Cardano. This is why I agree with the authors' suggestions. The solution is generally useful for busy commuters. The risks outlined are exhaustive. So I rate 5 points on the impact of the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation process of the proposal is 12 months, through the organization of periodic online meetings and presentations in the evening time frame, duration of 2 hours. However, I recommend that authors add event marketing activities within the first month after the proposal is approved. For example, schedule a countdown, summarize the attractive content to be presented, propagate the presentation every week via Facebook, Twitter, website... to spread and attract the community to know and care about the event. This communication activity will create a habit for the community every week. I also suggest that the authors add two-way interactions between the presenter and the community at each online meeting. For example, minigames give rewards on the spot to people who have good questions about Cardano, reward lucky people who interact (comment, like, share\u2026) to the event. This activity will add to the appeal of the presentation. An important point that I am wondering about is the topic of each presentation. The authors introduce \"we currently have 4 core groups\", that is, each week only 4 priority topics are selected for each group to find information and analyze. Then, they will choose a topic that is best prepared for presentation. I would like to ask, in case there are too many topics from community members, maybe 10, 20 topics or more, so what are the criteria for the authors to choose 4 priority topics for distribution work for 4 groups? I suggest the authors need to clarify the flow of this problem. For example, every week they need to statistic the number of topics requested by the community, categorize topics (market news, technical topics, etc.), and make a public vote on the top 4 favorite community topics. (voting takes place on website, telegram). Why do I suggest this? Because I want to make sure that the topic presented at each meeting is also the most engaging topic, most loved by the Cardano community in Vietnam. In Fund 9, the proposed budget reduction is only 1/3 of the total funding applied at Fund 8. In which, the biggest reduction is the cost for community members to be reduced to $3000 (the old level was $18000). Cause, due to the reduction from 3 supporters per month to 1 supporter per month. The remaining expenditure items are kept the same name, but all costs are reduced from -40% to -200%. As for the reward section, I suggest that the authors build a more flexible reward mechanism for the presenter. Here, the authors propose a fixed $200 per week bonus for presenters. I suggest building three levels of rewards: excellent, good, and bad. The community will be the one to vote for the award. Excellent will get $300, good $50. Excellent presenters will deserve higher rewards. This will encourage the presenter to be more creative, more interested, and more engaged with the project.

Communities need metrics to be as specific as possible. From there, it is possible to measure the success of the proposal through the success metrics that grow every week: the number of views followed, the amount of interaction at each zoom session...

Millions of Vietnamese people who every class are holding or trading crypto now including ADA and will there be millions of potential ones who want to jump into crypto in the next few years. However, the number of people who have a good understanding and awareness of cryptocurrency is very few. They just follow the trend and put their money on something they don\u2019t know or even never heard of. Cardano is huge and in the top 10 cryptocurrencies but there are not so many Vietnamese who are well understanding it because Vietnam is not an English-speaking country so it is very hard for people knowledge and access it. Furthermore, there are tons of fake projects silking and scamming people. The key objective of this challenge is to help to grow East Asia and ADA community in East Asia. So this proposal is to give people a new reliable channel, and an easy way to get to know exactly about Cardano. It is kind of a trusted ADA information hub for Vietnamese to keep up to date and better understand the advantages of the Cardano blockchain.

It states that more talk shows are requested by the Vietnamese community as it has so many questions about Cardano and needs it to be solved. Therefore the initiative of building a reward mechanism to attract contributors has come up. To be honest, one of the obstacles in developing the project with our blockchain is the lack of quality resources. In other words, I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t  know how the project can benefit them therefore they hesitate joining it. This states a problem for the pioneers of how to make contributing for the Cardano ecosystem interesting and at the same time creates more value for the community. I think that having research that makes it clear and proven how to proceed in these situations will be extremely useful for Cardano and will certainly develop for a future. Now let\u2019s talk deeper to the impact. According to the proponents, the fast increase in the community size demands the in-time Cardano documents presented in an understandable way. Besides, there is much news about Cardano published everyday and it contains technical terms which are hard to understand without interaction with others. Because of that, it causes a high demand for full-time translators who can verbally present the news and explain the technical words in an interesting way. With what the proposers have outlined, I find those are solid and well-founded arguments with quantitative data to prove that if solved, there may be an impact on not just the FIMI Vietnamese community but also the (East Asia) Cardano community due to its practicality. Not just so, based on what they mention I assume that Cardano's awareness will be expanded leading to more people contributing ideas for the Catalyst Fund and diversifying the creation in Cardano ecosystem. During reading the solution and risks they might face, it is generally described with easy-to-understand terms and thanks to that, I have an overall image of the way they deal with difficulties. I believe it is a signal to show that they have a deep understanding about the project they are doing and will have a plan for any cases happening. For such  strong and logical arguments, I am convinced and rate high for the impact part of this proposal. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Let's look into the script. I think the information that is given is extremely rich and explains in an extensive and detailed way what would happen during the project development process. There are milestones highlighted for example: their first month after being funded will be recruitment; The project lasts for 6m, weekly meeting for 6m. They state in a very specific manner what targets are included in every month which are divided into small tasks repeated every month. I understand that there will be topics requested by the community. After that, the core teams will take over it and start researching. The best research then is presented in weekly meetings and has time for Q&A from the members. So I think the script gives me a full comprehension of the work for example what would be done and how, making me feel like I am joining their talk show at the moment. Let\u2019s move to the budget of this proposal. The requested fund is $15.000 which accounts up to 6% of the whole challenge. However, this amount is reasonable compared to the complexity of the work. There are expenses needed to pay for example the recruitment fee, training fee, editing videos, supporting fee and so on. The budget plan is distributed into 6 categories of work with specific spending for each category and comprehensively outlined therefore I understand how much money is used for what task. We continue with the project members. There are 1 project leader and 3 core teams clearly stated. They have full confidence in them because we are aware of their professional backgrounds. The project manager is a Master with over 10 years of expertise in finance and investments, as well as over 6 years in technological and blockchain (Cardano) areas. Additionally, he is the direct instructor for more than 15k members' blockchain classes. He provides quantitative data on his accomplishments, which are simple to verify on his Youtube account and Telegram. His coreteam demonstrated to me that they had extensive knowledge of both translation and blockchain technology, particularly Cardano. I believe it is simpler to manage the available resources and the produced goods when the tasks are explicitly assigned to each team member. I learned from my investigation that Fund 7 previously provided funding for this FIMI project cince a very long time ago, they have had more concepts and projects in the works. As an illustration, they run their own website, have thousands of members in their Telegram groups, and have a YouTube channel with over 15,000 subscribers. If there are other suggestions and projects of similar such, I just wonder if they could elaborate a little more on how they would handle their workload. The other thing I hope would be made obvious is how the project manager may select the best presentation to give.

I think the community will believe when they see the team working according to their passion for so long.

I heard that some members of Fimi are also applying for funding for another proposal in Fund 9, if all proposals are funded by Catalyst, will the team have enough human resources to implement this proposal? How to make the knowledge-rich and confusing Cardano videos receptive to everyone? I know Fimi is keen to make information more interesting and engaging. My advice is that the team should promote more communication activities so that more and more people know about Fimi's videos. This is also consistent with the forte of some members specializing in communication. To increase the attractiveness, Fimi can consult more experts. It is very important to contact and learn from experts because they are the best in their field. My questions are suggestive. I would like to contribute positively to the proposal.

This is one of the important issues in order to create people with knowledge about cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, because of many reasons that electronic money in Vietnam has not yet been widely developed and popularized. This proposal creates a knowledge base about Cardano and will have real effects in the development of Cardano in Vietnam.\nTwo talk shows a week on topics around Cardano, while topics are prepared each session by the core team of the project.
