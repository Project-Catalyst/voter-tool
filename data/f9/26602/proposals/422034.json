It would attract more people from Asia and other countries to the community.\n\nThe proposer claims that he has been developing websites since 2010 but did not attach any link of his profile with education and previous professional experience information. \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I find this proposal not difficult to audit. As key metrics to measure the progress three criterias are given: completed proposal features, amount of educational content and  number of people accessing the portal monthly.

The number of people participating in the market to buy and sell tokens is increasing, but they only experience and think it is a quick and easy way to make money. Because there is not enough knowledge about blockchain, participants often think that this is a virtual market, unreliable, making money as forms of betting, speculation... In the Cardano ecosystem, The stronger and more sustainable it is to maintain and develop, the more we need to provide knowledge about the Cardano blockchain system fully, systematically, and officially. That helps participants have a higher understanding of the Cardano ecosystem and trust. In my opinion, the Educational Hub by CardanoProjects project is a great project. It is a portal to meet the needs of providing educational information about the Cardano ecosystem from basic to advanced for newcomers market participants and longtime participants. This is official sustainability information and knowledge platform, helping the Cardano ecosystem to grow and expand. Through the project, participants confidently hold more ADA and help the Cardano ecosystem come to life quickly. The projects of the Cardano ecosystem will bring many benefits to society and people and meet the goals Cardano wants to achieve. The project helps participants have the right and complete knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem, letting them understand that ADA is not a virtual currency, a fire island, only speculation. The future Cardano blockchain will develop long-term and sustainably to help improve lives, people, and society.

The project construction team is a bit thin, with only one person; I think it will be better if they add more personnel to build the project. The proponent has designed and prepared a very thoughtful and beautiful website, which shows that the proponent has embarked on this project, so it makes sense to build this project with only one person. The project has a reasonable and transparent budget, and the budget is divided into clear and appropriate categories. The proponent provided clear success metrics with reasonable metrics. When the project is successful, the Cardano community has a new educational portal, meeting the needs of each person to learn and learn. One risk is that the content provided by the partner may not be appropriate and accurate, so the proponent suggested the option of self-censoring the content before posting. Since this project aims to provide the most valuable knowledge to the Cardano community, the content provided should be carefully moderated before posting to help readers avoid misunderstandings.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project has a thoughtful and reasonable web link attached, a suitable development roadmap within two months, a transparently allocated budget for items, and clear success metrics.

I realize that this project will develop more new features in the future to meet the growing needs of the Cardano community. The project, in addition to basic educational knowledge, also provides advanced knowledge and experience in participating and investing in Cardano, including content, images, and videos for readers to understand. I think if the project can build groups with sessions to exchange, share, and engage the Cardano community, the project will grow stronger. With the project construction time starting in 2 months is very reasonable and fast, it helps to quickly respond to the needs of learning and providing information for the Cardano community. Proposers need to provide more details of the project's category hierarchies and features, and the project will be appreciated.

But i don't think the proposal features will be completed in two weeks because their is a lot of projects to be added a lot of content to add. One man is not enough in my opinion. But their is a high possibility that this work can be done in given time because when i saw the website , I don't believe myself how one person can do all the work like interface design, category hierarchy, education content and partnering with major brands.
