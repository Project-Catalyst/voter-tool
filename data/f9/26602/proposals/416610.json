Stating the umbrella term east asia is fine, but the region does not even have a strong unifying language as a base to begin with. If they were to create the DAO for the east asia community, what would be the first country to tackled, why the country, and what would be the language used? An artist from Thailand would not be able to understand a DAO in vietnamese.

The idea of \u200b\u200bcreating an arts grants program that specifically supports East Asian artists with grants (financial, technical, or physical) to mint NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, through a dapp called Tangent. I was pleased that the proponent presented his reasons for developing East Asian art and extremely pleased that the proponent had a very candid view of the success of the artists. Here, I have analysis like this, I agree is an app for East Asian artists, but what kind of art will it focus on (e.g. music, pictures, traditional art) system...).\n\nIt makes sense to propose a funding system for new East Asian artists with sufficient resources (capital/tools/...) Good for both Tangent and the artist and our Cardano ecosystem, it will help more artists know about Cardano, and also increase the number of users learning about the application. However, I think the proponent should add a list of artists that will initially receive an endorsement from Tangent, and what Tangent will plan to do to make that artist's NFT more popular. How can we present the artist's NFT to the audience? I think it will be very interesting if Tangent has early media activities and media to attract emerging artists and educate them about the Cardano ecosystem, in this way, I believe that the proposal will add more value to all 3 parties (Cardano, Tangent, artist). Increase the number of artists who know about Tangent, and increase the number of users who know Cardano, the artist who is supported by the community.\n\nHowever, I would like to make a counterpoint: According to Tangent's share on Meidum (from the project website), Tangent focuses on the development of NFT and the application of art and finance, combining Defi farming with NFT in the modern digital art gallery experience, how exactly would this be done? How will the artist's NFT be displayed? What NFTs will be on display and why are those NFTs, where will the audience go to art galleries to see these NFTs? Beyond this point, I honestly think the project has a lot of potentials and can have a good impact on the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author provides a very detailed roadmap and team information. However, I think some tasks need more explanation and a detailed plan, for example, \"Deploy application testnet and invite testers\" - who will be invited to test the application? How many people can test? What are the criteria for them to be selected as testers? Who will re-evaluate the tester's opinions and views? The proponent did a great job on this part, but adding a few elements makes it even better.\n\nIn the roadmap, I still don't fully understand what the proponent meant, \"Recruitment campaign launch across social media targeting the East Asian community push 1\" - What is this recruitment campaign for, recruiting to target community? I don't understand this point. On the other hand, as in proposal Q4 2022, there will be a voting period for sponsored candidates, which ones? What art do they do? do they already have a small fanbase?... I think it's a good idea to have this list so that CAs can also review and evaluate it, this will help even the proponent can filter potential candidates. The roadmap part is pretty clear too, but I wonder where the application phase is completed, other than that the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is an app with a tokenomic of its own (obviously built on top of the Cardano ecosystem ) - however I see no mention in the proposal. But fortunately, the proponent provided links to information about the project idea (https://tangent.art/) so I have a resource to read about tokenomic. I see that there is a presale route on the website, but I also see that it has not been mentioned in the proposal, the above is information that I think the proponent should clarify in more detail.\n\nThe budget section is quite reasonable and well explained. The budget for a dapp project is not too much, but it is also necessary to let the CAs know exactly what part of the fund will be used for each item, what the experts in the team will do, and how many hours per day for the project,... Calculations are made specifically so that we have a solid idea of \u200b\u200bthe possible outcomes of action if this proposal is approved.

Here they say the first key metric that will measure success is the number of East Asian artists applying for sponsorship, meaning the data is about the number of artists or is it from a successful artist metric will link with other data like number of fans, number of successful NFTs sold, number of users voting for artists, etc. Many successful talented artists will contribute to Cardano's ecosystem, more specifically, what will they contribute? I think it is possible to audit and clarify metrics from parties, end-users (fans/artists), apps - number of users, how this apps provide and present information on UX, and how many artists will be released when the application is complete. With the above suggestions, it is possible to track how the project will be completed at the right time and in the right way, always re-measured.\n\nWe can establish a bridge with the community, team and test evaluators, maybe have meetings, or AMA to announce the results of each stage through social networks, so we know see where the project is going, so the project will also have an initial community that loves the project idea for themselves.

The artistic grant program aims to be somewhat similar to a DAO (decentralised and community-owned) through the creation of a Dapp. In other words, its vision is akin to allowing the community to determine which artists to fund. However, I think the proposal would greatly benefit from providing extra information on what the funded artists will be doing with the funds. As an example, are sponsored artists allowed to use the fund to mint their own collection, independent of Tangent (the proposer)?; or the certain collection/s from sponsored artists are under Tangent\u2019s NFT launchpad (refer page 11/24)?   \n\nI believe the solution can add immense value to the Cardano ecosystem through the onboarding of East Asians to Cardano, providing assistance to East Asian artists and giving artists greater access to Cardano\u2019s global community. Ultimately, this will bring about a more inclusive, global Cardano ecosystem.  \n\nThe key metrics and goals proposed are closely aligned with the challenge for it brings about East Asian artists to the Cardano Ecosystem. \n\nWith regards to future sustainability, I have difficulty grasping the sustainability of the proposal. On the bright side, it states their confidence in maintaining the grant program for a long time. This brings me to the next question, if it were to be a dApp, how can the project sustain their operation in the future without funding? To my understanding, Tangent will have a fundraising event in Q3 2022. Would the fundraising be the primary source of revenue? \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The information available about the team working on this project is highly detailed, consisting of their roles within Tangent and their professional background. I think this is a highly capable team as the team covers project management, business development / marketing, technical development (some are enrolled in Cardano programs), legal compliance and artists. But, as this proposal aims to fund East Asian artists, I think it lacks experts or art enthusiasts well-versed in traditional and NFT art. Such a role is crucial in identifying the most deserving artists who provide quality work and are able to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. Although there is no East Asian member, the team has acknowledged this and shows thoughtfulness by being confident in this not being a long-term obstacle due to the wide demographic of East Asian. \n\nAlthough there is no working product as evidence of track record for the time being, I think the team has demonstrated sufficient effort to pivot this proposal further. It has a well-designed website, a well-thought out Whitepaper, an upcoming fundraising program, and articles in Medium. To the very least, this showcases a reliable team.  \n\nThe budget breakdown describes three items, but the items are described very vaguely. I think the proposal should address budget breakdown in more detail to allow the Catalyst community to evaluate what the fund requested would be used for. In addition, there is a an excess of $5,000 between the requested fund and what\u2019s listed under budget breakdown. There might be a miscalculation in the proposal. However, given the ambition of this proposal, I think the requested fund is justifiable.\n\nRegarding the timeline, the team has presented a well-described timeline which covers in detail what they set out to deliver and achieve every quarter for a total duration of one year.  \n\nThe team has also addressed challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation in detail. But, given the proposal\u2019s final product is a community-owned grant program, I think the proposal should address potential exploitation by influential members / whales within Tangent\u2019s ecosystem as part of the risk. This is a huge risk inseparable from any community-owned projects that could determine the success and failure of a project. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is well-designed, it details technical development, marketing initiative, recruitment, grant application, DAO development (from inception to a Permissionless DAO).

The proposed solution is to create an exclusive arts grant program. from artist to NFT on Cardano blockchain and the artist earns extra income from NFT there. However, the author should first consider running demo creation tests from artists so that the community can assess if the art NFTs are potentially profitable? The profile of invited artists also indicates whether they are financially viable.

We can also pay attention to the fact that one of these professionals, Benjamin Grabow, has a special affinity with the NFT's market, a fundamental characteristic for the scope of this proposal. Another positive point about the feasibility plan is the temporal organization of the activities to be carried out, the action plan schedule indicates steps that are gradually more complex, demonstrating that the team understands what must be done at each moment. Furthermore, a strong feature of the project is that artists can be subsidized to focus on artistic production without financial worries; therefore, it is essential that such artistic productions have enough visibility so that the chances of commercialization are increased.

Therefore, they propose using the NFT tech minting in Cardano blockchain to create an artistic grant exclusively to East Asian artists.\n\nThat being said, this proposal is quite interesting because of two points:\n1 \u2013 It\u2019s known that the artist\u2019s begin is quite hard. Lots of the artists sometimes give up of their dreams because they need to work in a traditional job in order to help family and they don\u2019t have the opportunity to wait until that first piece of art that shines brighter and people start to buy it;\n2 \u2013 It\u2019s having a big shift in the art world. Early 2000 the art center were located majorly in US and UK. However, nowadays the gravity is moving towards Asia (East Asia \u2013 China/Hong Kong) (https://news.artnet.com/market/asia-rising-morgan-stanley-artnet-2030273).\n\nThat being said, the market opportunity now is huge.

The moment is perfect.\nTherefore, since this proposal has a huge growth potential and the onboarding of new artists will make them to learn a bit about the ADA world and blockchain, this proposal fits with the challenge \u201c[\u2026] raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network [\u2026]\u201d and it focus on East Asia.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The major idea of the proposal is to aid/support, not only financially, artists allowing them to focus in their art and create unique things.

Many of my friends are passionate about drawing and painting they made thousands of pictures on the wall and paper which are very beautiful and qualified. Although, some could not keep their passion because of lacking money for their living. As I know, In East Asia there are millions of street artists in the same situation as my friends. When you walk down the streets in Asia your eyes can easily be caught up by some paints on the wall or some street guys doing artwork for customers. Unluckily, they can not afford their cost of livings by making that kind of job. They are putting their hands into a bunch of stuff to earn money to bring up their artwork passion or they will be left in the dust. Therefore, the idea of creating a grant for artists like all the ones mentioned above is very very necessary and meaningful to the community.
