Yoroi wallet is really complicated and difficult to use without specific documentation.\nNext, in Fund9 I first came across Blockfrost and while learning about it, I found Blockfrost very useful for developing applications on Cardano.\nAs the author mentioned the EndubisTestWalletBot wallet is developing on blockfrost. I don't know what it is and what it means. I find it essential to learn how to use a new wallet like EndubisTestWalletBot if it's not easy to use.\nI think the author needs to add an explanation of the meaning of EndubisTestWalletBot wallet so that voters can better understand. Why do users need this wallet? That way, they will better understand why a video on how to use the EndubisTestWalletBot wallet is needed.\nIn the risk assessment, I think it is necessary to add one more risk. Those are video tutorials for using EndubisTestWalletBot wallet old version and old interface.

Even if they want to record themselves most laptops already have a built-in webcam (and even if they want to buy a webcam it would not cost USD 500).

So the proposer can certainly re-check the posted link, and fix it accordingly as needed.\n\nThis proposal is 1 man team, posted a link of LinkedIn profile without any other explanations on relevant experience. Following the link we can see clearly that there is nothing in LinkedIn profile that show his expertise on Blockfrost or anything programming. The proposer should be able to explain about the relevancy of his experience or skill. He can explain that while professionally he is a Hostel Owner, International Relations Officer or anything that is not related to Blockfrost or programming, he has working knowledge/interest in programming.

This to me is not a timeline, it is not broken down to smaller chunk that we can monitor on the progress. It does not matter if the proposer can do it only in 1 month, but he can surely say in smaller time slot, lets say a week, what is targeted to be done.\n\nBudget is also another problem to this proposal.

Unfortunately I doubt that making a tutorial on Blockfrost for a wallet development is going to achieve that objective and I don't see any value being added to that objective with this proposal. \nIf they really want to create educational content to help people understand and use Blockfrost and help build Applications on top of it, it has to be much more comprehensive. A good Proposal would be to create a series of tutorials explaining all the aspects of Blockfrost from general concept to the technical aspects of using it.
