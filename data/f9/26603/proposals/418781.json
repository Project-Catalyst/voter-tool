Unfortunately, this proposal is too succinct and does not explain in more detail how it will be done. In other words, the proposer has identified an aspect that could be potentially improved in the Blockfrost ecosystem but has not explained clearly how it will operate both from a user perspective and from a developing perspective. That is, the proposer could have articulated better how the solution will add value to the Cardano environment. The only metrics provided are number of users and requests. Even though they align with the challenge goals I would also add a metric related to the acquisition of users (it could be done through a small survey launched in the UI to understand if the users are new to Blockfrost and Cardano).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer claims to have experience in front end development but has not provided a LinkedIn profile or any similar source to back that up. He does provide a GitHub link but the number of contributions so far is very limited. It is a simple project and thus will only require one person. My suggestion would be for the proposer to add a description of his skills and past experiences in the feasibility section. The section is entitled \"Please provide details of the people who will work on the project\" which was not given. Even though there is information in the general section about his experiences it is better to err on the side of redundancy than of lack of information and transparency. The total amount requested is reasonable but again, further explanation could have been given to enhance the clarity of the proposal. It is not written down where the USD 100 per month will be directed to. I assume it would go to the developer but it could have been explicitly stated as well as the number of months and the total amount for this item. Additionally, the timetable is realistic but as the proposer has left the second deliverable as optional, I don't think it should have been included in the budget. Finally, regarding risks they have claimed time constraints is the only risk and have placed the second deliverable as an optional one to mitigate that risk. I believe this is not a real solution to the problem and other risks could have been discussed as well such as the risk of low adoption of the product developed or finding out the amount of work required is way bigger than expected, for example.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap provided is quite poor. Given the second deliverable is optional, the only information we have is it will take 3 months to conclude the front-end work. The proposer could have broken that down into midway milestones stating at which point in the development he believes the project will be at one month and at two months, for example. The KPIs provided are ok but others could have been added to improve auditability. For instance, number of new users (new to Blockfrost and Cardano environment) and number of contributors could have been defined.

Currently, you have to know what you are looking for with Blockfrost. This tool will allow people to explore and interact with the blockchain with no previous experience. It will be attractive to generalist web developers who are thinking about getting into blockchain, as well as experienced blockchain developers who want to explore Cardano with virtually no commitment to learn new tooling. \n\nThis also takes some of the weight of education off of Blockfrost.
