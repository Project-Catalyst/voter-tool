This is a barrier to adoption.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.6, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 14045, "q0": "The team makes it very clear that the goal of this project is to lower the \"barrier to entry\" for developing in the Cardano ecosystem using the Blockfrost API. This clearly aligns with the goal of creating a thriving developer ecosystem around Blockfrost. Doing this via a WordPress plugin makes sense because of the vast number of users that are already on WordPress who could then easily incorporate the Cardano blockchain into projects that are already in development.\n\nAdditionally, WordPress is open-source, and CardanoPress has its source code hosted on GitHub as well which aligns with the stated goals of the campaign. It is worth noting that as of now, CardanoPress does rely on some closed-source and heavily centralized dependencies (such as Google ReCAPTCHA), but I believe this is a failing of internet development at large and not this project. This could be remedied in the future when suitably secure, open-source alternatives become available. \n\nThe one real downside I see, is that the proposers make it clear in a comment that documentation is not part of the scope of this proposal, and that a separate proposal will be made for documentation purposes. I think that this somewhat undermines some of the impact this project could have. That said, I'm not deducting from the rating as every project needs a reasonable scope, and this one is rather large even without documentation, which can be massive.\n\nEase of use like this brings all the advantages of a blockchain system such as Cardano to the easily approachable masses. I am not a web developer, but with some WordPress experience, I was able to install the beta release on a WordPress site in an hour or so.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The existing beta release of the project provides a clear grasp of the technical side of this project, as well as proof of necessary skills. Additionally, considering that there is already a beta release for this project, and at a few sites with fairly mature implementation, I think the team has proven that this project is likely to be successful. \n\nI do think that there is a lot of work to be done in only 80hrs of work, but the team has laid out an easy-to-follow plan with comprehensive budget. They have identified two possible pain points in the area of approvals from WordPress (which they have addressed well) and approval from Blockfrost (for which the solution is somewhat nebulous). The team does not provide any road map for what happens if timing goes over or the budget is expended.\n\nTo see 5 stars in this category I would have liked to see the proposal have more explanation for why Blockfrost may stop the plugin from utilizing the API, and a less nebulous solution for how to get this approved. Additionally, I think it would've been prudent to discuss what happens if an unforeseeable circumstance pushes the time table back and the team runs out of money. The team's experience mitigates these concerns, but it would have prudent to address them.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This project struggles to provide a clear view of what auditability will look like. The team states that \".... having the stable version, v1.0.0, will be the final goal for the proposal.\" But there are no metrics given to say what qualifies as \"stable.\" It would have been prudent to give something measurable such as \"inclusion of V1.0.0 in the WordPress plugin directory,\" but while this is mentioned as something that will happen, it's not stated as a goal. This means that, in theory, the team could be rejected from the directory, but still call the project \"stable\" and therefore a success.\n\nAdditionally, the team says \"Progressive milestones can be measured as we progress through the stages....\" but they fail to mention any official channels, frequency of updates, how often GitHub will be updated, etc. I think that it is easy to infer what this could look like, but it would have been easy to state where updates would be posted and how often this would happen.\n\nThe team has made it easy to infer what success looks like, and their experience lends confidence in the project, but from a standpoint of the proposal alone (which is what I\u2019m assessing), metrics should have been more clearly stated.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3878", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 885, "q0": "This proposal offers a plug and play solution to help wordpress sites integrate with blockfrost and cardano.

As someone familiar with the ease of using wordpress plugins, I'm excited by the possibilities this offers to accelerate mainstream use and adoption of cardano wallets for ecommerce. I also have some experience building dapps, and enabling wallet connections was a major challenge. Allowing devs to unlock that capability with a configurable plugin is massively powerful.    ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As someone with experience managing delivery of complex technical projects, the timeline seems overly optimistic.

Projects that want to build on Cardano for their NTF collection, NFT minting, ISPO, Stake Pools or online e-commerce sites will be able to install the plugin, configure it to Blockfrost and be integrated with a wallet DApp connector within minutes. \nAddressing the challenge, this proposal has said that CardanoPress relies 100% on the Blockfrost API, and that every project that uses and implements the CardanoPress plugin on its website must sign up to Blockfrost to use it. Thus, there will be more projects choosing Cardano and CardanoPress, meaning more sign-ups and usage of the Blockfrost API, and this is exactly what the challenge is all about.\nEmphasis has been made in the proposal about just a little risk associated with the project.\nThe information provided by the proposer has effectively addressed the challenge.

CardanoPress already has a beta version and it fits extremely well in this challenge. The whole idea of the project is to facilitate the life of the user by removing the lack of knowledge of APIs and Cardano wallet integration barrier. That is done through a plugin heavily based on Blockfrost. This way the Cardano dApp development creation process gets smoother than ever. The metrics chosen are related to the usage of the plugin which in turn translates into the use of Blockfrost. In other words, it helps create an active ecosystem around Blockfrost. Finally, the proposer acknowledges that currently the project cannot sustain itself without external funding and suggests they may need to return to Catalyst for further funding.

Within the budget breakdown they clearly point which type of skills will be needed to implement the activities of the project (software development, testing and UI/UX design, for example). They also state how much is requested for each task. The hours of work that will be necessary seems reasonable but the average hourly rate of USD 150 sounds a bit overpriced. The timetable is realistic and well organized. There seems to be enough time both for development and for testing. As there is already a beta version, they have considered the risks low. Nevertheless, two of them were raised, not having the plugin accepted into the directory and not being able to use Blockfrost for some reason. For the first one they provided a nice solution of reaching key people from the WordPress community. In the extreme case of that strategy not working out they could migrate to a different platform.

They could also use the number of requests made to Blockfrost and number of acquired developers from the Crypto space as KPIs.
