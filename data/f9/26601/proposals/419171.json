I didn\u2019t know they wrote Catalyst registration SDK and were involved in the creation of the both the original Catalyst registration CIP along with its recent update for dRep support.

Therefore I have no doubts in the success and quality of this proposal.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The sccess will be the release of the SDK and hopefully soon we\u2019ll see the dRep support for future Catalyst rounds and also proper integration in wallets, not only in Flint, but in Yoroi, Lace, Eternl and others.

However, the SDK will also be made publicly available to any project interested in adding Catalyst registration support and dRep registration. This is a very important aspect of the proposal, most important because there are several wallets popular across the community, not just one. As such, the exposure of the community to the dRep onboarding will increase exponentially if other wallet and project developers will follow suit.\nAs someone deeply invested in the Cardano ecosystem, I think this proposal is very appropriate, not just for this challenge but also for the overall upcoming changes within the Cardano Ecosystem, as without wallet integration, the dRep onboarding process would take longer to start. The work presented in this proposal will speed up development, and help the ecosystem be ready right from the start.\nAs such, I view this proposal as having great potential and can prove to be highly impactful. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Now, as much as I appreciate the solution offered in this proposal and the entire work of the dcSpark team with Milkomeda, CIP editing and everything else, as the list would be too long to include in a proposal assessment, the lack of interest in providing a reasonable amount of information in the feasibility section is to me, slightly worrying. \nHow would it look from the outside of the Cardano community, to see that the most funded project doesn\u2019t even bother to write complete proposals but continues to get funded regardless? To an outsider, it wouldn\u2019t matter what the proposer has already built for the community, it would only matter that the system looks corrupt and will refuse to further engage with the entire ecosystem as a result of that.\nWhile I understand the dcSpark team might be too busy building things to finish up writing proposals, I would suggest hiring a dedicated person for this task, thus ensuring the continuation of correctness in the experiment called Project Catalyst, the precursor of the governance module. What kind of governance will we be building?\nI hope that if someone from the dcSpark team will be reading these assessments, they can see that this opinion is coming from an involved member in the ecosystem who has a deep appreciation for what they have been doing.\nConsidering the lack of details in the entire feasibility section, from the detailed plan and budget to the team description, I find it hard to decide on a fair rate for it. While judging only on the information provided, the maximum I would assess it would be a 2. But considering the fact that I am familiar with the work dcSpark has been doing, that goes way beyond a 5.

The Cardano community would be able to assess the progress of the project by looking at the number of NPM downloads or the number of references for other implementations. Unfortunately, I have found no specification of where these metrics would be provided in a public, open manner. Would they be visible in the wallet itself, on the dcSpark website etc.?\nRegarding the vision of success, the description provided is realistic and feasible, I foresee this integration being implemented by a lot of projects in the ecosystem.\nConsidering the fact that the questions have somewhat been answered, I will rate this section with a 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4194, "q0": "The \"Catalyst SDK dRep support\" proposal addresses the dRep improvement and onboarding challenge by updating Catalyst registration SDK to support dRep registration, adding dRep indexing to Carp, and implement dRep support inside Flint wallet.

Also by adding the support inside the Flint wallet will help in vote delegation and voting rewards.  The proposal outcome is not limited to only dRep but also can be used by any other projects that require Catalyst registration support or need indexing the Catalyst registration information making this proposal very impactful towards Catalyst and Cardano.

The risk discussion is slightly superficial and could have centered more on the evolving dRep role, lack of funding for \"Rust SDK fix critical CBOR encoding\" proposal in Fund-9 Developer Ecosystem challenge. \nThe proposers usually keep their proposals brief and could provide more details, but then again have a very well documented audit trail on Github and communicate regularly with the community via Youtube, Discord, Twitter and other channels.\nImplementation is highly likely to be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Successful delivery of the stated solution is not really my understanding of auditable performance metrics and milestones, but I agree that it will be easy enough to establish whether the goal has been achieved or not. Given the large portfolio of proposals and high workload of this team, I suggest that an audit of their entire portfolio should be considered, instead of going proposal by proposal, to keep interference in their work and workload of the challenge teams or auditors manageable. At the same time, to keep the Catalyst process fair, the same yardstick needs to be applied to well established teams, so there could possibly be improvements in the working relationship between Catalyst and well established, serial proposers, like a central reporting function or liaison.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5173, "q0": "The proposal tries to update the existing Catalyst registration SDK to support dRep registration, add dRep indexing to Carp, and implement dRep support inside Flint Wallet.

In the budget section, the proposal only stated \u2018All funds are put for developer cost\u2019, without giving any breakdown. Even if the budget is only used for developer remuneration, the proposal still needs to give information on the hours needed to complete the project and their respective cost per hour/day. This information is important to determine if the requested budget is reasonable or not. The proposal only gives two roles involved in the project, rust engineer and project lead.
