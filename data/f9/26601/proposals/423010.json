I have not submitted an application for it, as such, I am not part of the conversations and workshops surrounding this subject and I\u2019m only making statements based on what is being publicly announced. Obviously, I have my own doubts regarding it, but, first of all, I\u2019m curious to see how it evolves and if it will actually benefit the Cardano community. Why start this process with the assumption that it will be cheated and taken advantage of and set up rules and conditions based on speculations solely?\nBesides the more general idea behind the proposal, I have some doubts regarding some specific statements. A first example would be: \u201cBased on this, we will build a more balanced model of the Cardano ecosystem, which does not allow to ignore the subjects of voting\u201d. Missing any additional guidance, I\u2019m not sure what is even implied here, is it that every Cardano holder would be forced to vote or is it something else? If that is the case, how can one force the holders to vote and what effect would that even have and how would it fit in the promise of web3?\nAnother example would be: \u201cAs stated in the challenge, Cardano has a big problem with the correctness of the evaluation of proposals.\u201d I have read the challenge brief and nowhere is there a statement like this. The closest I could find was \u201c(3) It is difficult for Catalyst users who are not necessarily skilled in technology and English to judge nearly 1,000 proposals.\u201d The word correctness was not used, as such, I find that the statement has been distorted and paints a completely different picture of the state of the Cardano ecosystem. \nAnd the last example that I find unclear is \u201cWe need to consider alternative options, such as being able to swap auditors and proposers on a regular basis, giving them commensurate resources.\u201d This statement has not been further developed, as such, I\u2019m unclear on how proposers should be swapped on a regular basis, as that role cannot be taken away from a community member, just like the voter role couldn\u2019t be. Therefore, there can be no rules regarding who can participate in that role or not.\nOverall, I find myself disagreeing with this proposal on too many levels and ideas and consider that at the moment, developing a system that the proposers are describing would be to the detriment of the experiment called Catalyst and to the rest of our free Cardano community.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "As a PA I check not only on what I understand from a proposal but also what voters might understand. For example, if any tools, models or research is being referenced in a proposal that the whole project is based on I think it\u2019s completely necessary to have a short description of what it entails and why it\u2019s important.\nI'm not familiar with the Eliott Jaques model being referenced in this section, and I imagine that some of the voters reading this proposal will not be as well. Therefore, I think it would have been helpful to have at least a couple of sentences explaining what the model is about and why has it been decided that it will be used for this project.\nFurthermore, I am also unclear on what kind of simulations will be made using AnyLogic, as the proposers haven\u2019t provided any description of the tool and its importance. From what I was able to gather from the company\u2019s website, is that this tool can provide \u201cA synthetic population of simulated agents can be used to forecast  the urbanization of an area or study the effectiveness of healthcare policy proposals based on real-world data\u201d. By reading this, I can go back to my statement from the impact section, where I wrote that we are too early and don\u2019t have \u201creal-world data\u201d regarding dReps, but only speculation, as such, this tool cannot be properly utilised at the moment.\nI found the budget to be lacking any metrics describing the number of hours needed for each task and the hourly rate asked. The phases and roles placed in the table have no explanation attached, as such, I found it impossible to find any similar data.\nThe team description is also very short, we have been provided with two names, but without any further explanation of what their roles would be in the project. By looking at the website attached, I was able to gather some more details about the entire team of more than a dozen individuals, but the majority have no LinkedIn profiles attached to their photos, thus I was not able to verify if the pictured persons and their skills are real or not.\nAlthough the team has answered Yes to the question of having submitted other Catalyst proposals in this fund, they have not provided any further details or links about it, as was required in the submission form.\nDue to all these factors, I conclude that the lack of sufficient information keeps me from assessing the successful implementation of the project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While some of the statements in the auditability section do have a point, the proposers haven\u2019t answered the simple question about how the progress of this proposal will be measured.

I disagree with this statement, as the proposers are insinuating that the growth of the Catalyst ecosystem will be determined by the success of this proposal, which cannot be correlated and considering the fact that the ecosystem has been constantly growing for some time, would make it unfair to discredit the efforts done by the community to get where we are.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 7, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2601, "q0": "The proponent raised the issue that reflects the current situation of the voting system in Catalyst.

The Proponents say they will address the issue by conducting a formal study describing how the role distribution of platform participants and their interrelationships affects the fund's work. I don't understand how this research will make it easier to diversify and more dReps to participate or integrate voters. I recommend the proponent analyze this clearly. Furthermore, to address the problem presented by the proposal, Catalyst provided the solution as dRep who will read the proposals, evaluate them, and vote on behalf of the authorized voters. and this challenge aims to improve dRep and introduce.

Therefore, I think that this proposal by non-Cardano web3 enthusiasts at YourJustice.life may very well benefit Catalyst tremendously, but does not do a great job in addressing the challenge setting. It would have been very interesting to see this framed as a Cross Chain collaboration with slightly modified direction and scope, or even under Dapps/Products/Integrations under the \"Many others\" subcategory - in a way Catalyst is a Cardano product and crucial in shaping not just governance but also development through the efficiency of Catalyst voting and choosing the right proposals.\nI agree that this proposal has potential for great impact for Catalyst, but penalize the scoring slightly for asking for almost a quarter of dRep onboarding funds that it does relatively little to address intrinsically.

Not enough has been done to assure the voter that the proposers are serious about bringing their craft to Cardano, and that this is not simply a single team member quickly filling in the request for funding on behalf of the team without the proper buy-in and commitment. Catalyst has many flaws that this project's proposed research may be able to address and correct, but its strength is in the community role and feedback mechanisms.

However, the proposer failed to provide a detailed solution that shows how it addresses the problem. In short, there is a disconnect between the problem and the solution. In my opinion, the proposed solution is a more generic approach  towards addressing the challenges in the voting process. Per the feedback from the catalyst community on the voting process, we all admit that there is consensus on the challenges in the voting process, hence the introduction of the drep role. I appreciate the idea  behind this project; the  focus per the script is to, \u201c\u2026 carry out a full-fledged research work describing how the distribution of the roles of platform participants and the connections between them affect the work of funds\u201d. Aside that, the proposer per the script, intends to \u201cbuild a more balanced model of the Cardano ecosystem, which does not allow to ignore the subjects of voting\u201d. Ultimately by focusing on this, the intended success per the script is to achieve a \u201c\u2026balanced and actively growing Cardano Catalyst system\u2026\u201d . The main questions here are , does this lead to many people being dReps? Does this lead to a high delegation participation rate? Does it lead to appropriate selection of dReps for delegation? Clearly, the proposer's description and success per the script doesn\u2019t lead to achieving any of the above metric set for the success  of the drep improvement challenge setting.

Which activity would start first? Would the activities be done in sequence as listed here or randomly or be done simultaneously? Additionally, when does the team expect the project to end? Ideally, a well-defined plan provides a clear work structured, specifying the start and end of a project. The absence of the roadmap makes it difficult to determine whether the project is progressing or stagnant. From the information of the team experience, it difficult to ascertain the extent of experience and expertise possessed by the team. I wish the team had provided a profile link in the absence of a detailed team experience.

Apart from that, I think the budget is the only positive side of the feasibility section. A clear allocation is provide to each identifiable item.
