An organized debate can be one medium. Elaborating on the problem itself before jumping directly into the proposed solution would have been a plus. A non-bias common platform where the community can easily follow via social media for getting-to-know their drep candidates would certainly encourage people to participate than tediously doing their own research \u2013 I myself is guilty of this. This fits the challenge as it would increase the voter\u2019s experience and ease. \n\nI like that it is a two-part program. This allows participation from both dreps candidates and viewers. One solely for debating between dreps and one\nAgainst community queries. \n\nWhat would have made this go up another level is to have the full debate format laid out so the community can pitch in for improvements. \nI have questions such as the following: \n\n\u2022\tMinutes/Seconds provided for dReps initial statements?\n\u2022\tNumber of topics to be discussed?\n\u2022\tMinutes/seconds provided for rebuttals?  \n \nWith this we can roughly estimate how long a debate with 10 candidates may last? I\u2019m concerned as not everyone has an attention span to sit thru a n-hour debate. Your ability to spice things up during the event would also be a good indicator that people will stay on their sits as well. \n\nIt\u2019s good to hear that you can leverage your team\u2019s strong connections with the cardano community to raise participation.  And I agree that doing this would raise awareness hence enticing more candidates \u2013 I can say this because as I myself joined as a PA only because I saw a Catalyst School program. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I have confidence on the team as they have been contributing in the Cardano ecosystem for quite a while now. It is indeed a combination for people from different walks of life. No question on the team\u2019s skillset their previous projects and contributions listed in the proposal is testament of this,  although I would have wanted to see more details on the \u201cHOW\u201d this will be executed? Like what\u2019s the method of sourcing debate topics or categories? Would you run polls thru social media or have a mailbox for the voting populous to provide their thoughts? As for the Dreps participation, is it going to be via invitation only or open to anyone. \n\nBudget entails what\u2019s required to conduct the event. Host for $200 each makes sense for a single event but is this dependent on the program\u2019s runtime? I like the fact that you included a portion for rewarding participants as well this provides dreps additional reason not to miss the debate and for their efforts to be incentivized. Lastly, a 2000$ expense in two-month event organizer is rather vague for me perhaps it makes sense if the organizer will do most of the leg work from engaging in marketing, inviting dreps, basically pre-event activities? Would be nice to have clarity on this. \n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It\u2019s clear that the team has experience hosting virtual social events in the past as shown with the metrics they\u2019re measuring to gauge success. Also, I appreciate that you have listed the platforms on which you will be proving progress updates, but for the benefit of those that are not familiar with your work \u2013 it might be essential to include the links as well. This help newcomers to easily track your progress. \n\nHaving concrete GOALS is also a good indication of your trajectory. But I feel that they\u2019re quite conservative numbers.

So the big question here is how to know: which dRep is really capable?\nAnd propose to find a solution to that problem by creating a meeting to help dReps argue with each other. I see this model as the debate model of US presidents. This will help qualified candidates demonstrate the skills and knowledge they possess. The same is true in the case of dReps, who will showcase their talents through debates.\nI find one debate session per quarter to be too little. I think the author should divide these debates into sessions with different time periods so that voters can follow all these debates to find the right dRep that they love instead of focusing debates into different rooms at the same time.\nIn each argument, I think it is advisable to limit the time to a specific amount of time so that the argument does not become too long, boring or worse, it can turn into an argument.\nFinally, I think the author needs to add conditions and restrictions to the argument. For example, use healthy words, don't use obscene words, don't use words to offend opponents... I think there will be many other criteria that the author needs to think about to add to help the debate become friendly than.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Information about the author's implementation plan needs to be made more detailed.

This I have not seen the author clearly stated: Who will do this task?\nIn terms of funding, I don't quite understand the reward budget of the participants: who are they? How many people? Why do you need to do so?\nProviding the above information will help me understand if the cost of this award is reasonable?\nNext, I think the author should add advertising costs to get more dRep and voters involved in debates like this so that debates like this become more useful to the Catalyst community.\nAs for the team members, I found it very informative and looking at each of their individual profiles on Linkedin can see that their experience and skills would complete this recommendation well.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In the information the author provided, I just wanted to add some information in the KPI section and what the successful outcome of the project looks like.

Objective: to gauge voters' interest in these debates.\nOn project success: Authors can add the number of voters who supported dReps participating in the debates organized by the proposal. The purpose was to assess the impact of these debates on voter support for dRep.\nThat alone, I find all other information provided by the author and the team to be sufficient for me to judge the success of the proposal, and I believe they will provide for the success of the proposal they have submitted. to send. to send. write. . 5 stars is well deserved.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3702", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14986, "q0": "In theory the idea is good but I'm not really sure about the need to create a new event, a new space that will need to attract people to talk about the most pertinent subjects that say about dReps, I don't think this expense is necessary. In my view, it is indeed important to promote an open debate on topics relevant to the community, but I don't think it is necessary to have rewards for participants (dReps, I believe), since they will already be paid for their work, and that would also be something that would benefit the community as a whole. We already have several spaces for debate, not only on discord and telegram channels, but also in Townhall, After Townhall rooms (breakout rooms) and so on; in other words, why should we invest more money to create one more space when so many others already exist and work? In addition, some expenses could be better explained, as I will comment on feasibility.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The action plan is unfortunately not detailed, we know that the first month would be for the preparation of the event, that is, the organizations, schedules, etc., and the second month would be the actual execution of these events.

The amount requested is small compared to most proposals, being $7700. Even so, we could understand more in depth what some parts would be like \u2013 for example the issue of disclosure that would cost us 2 thousand dollars. Speaking of the people involved, more detail should have been provided on some. For example with Mauro Andreoli and Juanita Jaramillo, we don't know data beyond their linkedin profiles.

It is presented as being an open environment, with debates between dReps, followed by Q&As from participants and ending in a closing speech of each representative.\nThis type of events, where discussion of different topics is encouraged between several members of the community can have a lot of positive changes on the dReps system. Humans usually need to see a face to help them gain trust in an unknown entity or process. Having these live events recorded for anyone to view at their leisure will perhaps increase participation in the Project Catalyst process and even create a better sense of cohesion in the community.\nAs such, I find the proposal to fit the challenge brief well and to positively impact the Catalyst and Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team describes their plan as being straightforward as a means to justify the very short description provided.

Especially considering the fact that the proposers have been previously funded in Project Catalyst and are very active members of the community, they should have known the importance of providing a detailed description of their proposal. Several questions arise from this part of the feasibility section. How will the event be promoted? What does the planification stage entail?\nThese questions are not being answered in the budget section either. The line for event promotion mentions the requirement of $2000 but does not offer any additional information. We have a number of hosts provided, but we do not have a number of days. What will the event organiser do exactly? All these omissions question the viability of the proposal. \nAs mentioned, the team consists of people who are very active in the Catalyst space and have the passion and knowledge to organise this event, but although they have the knowledge on how to do it, it hasn\u2019t been well transmitted to us, the PAs, vPAs and voters.\nAs a consequence, I will rate this section a 3, because of the lack of details in the plan and budget.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Considering the scope of this proposal I find the project progress to be sufficiently detailed and contain indicators the community would be able to follow, such as social media communications, the activities logged in the community\u2019s Gitbook, the number of attendees, dReps and YouTube views etc.\nThe success definition is also well written and contains clear values that we can follow and objectively assess if the proposal is on a positive, impactful path or not.

There are already spaces for open debate in the community. The Cardano community frequently discusses via Twitter Spaces and in community call sessions via Zoom or YouTube. The problem is the coordination of these debates and not the absence of spaces for debates. However, the proposal makes it clear that the objective is also coordination and organization, so my recommendation is just to make the concept clearer in the problem statement.\n\nOne of the concepts of dRepss is to increase voter engagement and participation on Catalyst, for that to happen, voters need to communicate with dReps and dReps need to understand voters' thinking and needs, so this proposal helps to fill this gap.\n\nThere is no clear mention of how long this debate is expected to last. I know it's difficult to set the duration accurately as there is no way to know how many people will participate, but the team could at least have established a minimum period.\n\nConsidering the projected KPIs of at least 60 Attendees and 10 dRepps I see that there can be relevant impact to this challenge, but the KPI of 100(at least) views on YouTube is not an encouraging indicator to indicate impact.\n\nIf we want dReps to guide the community, it is expected that they will be able to reach a relatively large number of people in the Cardano community. Weekly Town Halls YouTube videos reach over 1000 views.\n\nConsidering that the team will allocate $2,000 USD to promote the event I would expect a higher KPI as an output from this proposal.\n\nHow long do you expect 100 views to be reached? The longer the verification time, the less relevant the KPI becomes, since the goal is for the community to watch the debates to make decisions about votes.\n\nAs vote delegation is not yet a reality, we have to hope that the influence of dreps is enough to generate more engagement and votes from the community members.\n\nIn case of success of the event, the team intends to continue to organize them in the next Funds and indicated that they will request funding from Catayst again.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has extensive expertise to deliver this proposal. The team members are already veterans of the Cardano and Catalyst communities, regularly participate in the organization of events and have a variety of skills to be critical hosts of debates, after all, a host of this type of debate needs to understand enough about blockchain technology and Catalyst to be able to facilitate the event.\n\nThe proposal contains links that allow verification of experiences, so the community can attest to the qualifications of the team members.\n\nThe plan is relatively simple, organize and promote the event, the community will decide the topics to be discussed by voting, depending on the number of participating dRepps different rooms can be created to organize the discussion. There will be a question and answer part. I missed an event duration estimate, the team could have included expected, minimum and maximum duration estimates to serve as a reference. After all I suppose some kind of calculation was used to set the budget.\n\nThere is a budget breakdown, but the items need further clarification, such as the allocation of $1,000 USD to reward participants. Would this amount be distributed equally among everyone present in the debate? Hosts already receive remuneration for facilitating the debate, would they also earn a part of this amount? It may seem like a silly question, but it's important to make this clear.\n\nThere is mention of $2,000 USD to promote the event and $2,000 USD to organize the event, but there are no details in the plan on how these activities will be carried out.\n\nI don't think these activities need an overly detailed description, but at least an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat will be done to promote the event, in which social media the team intends to promote the event and stages of the organization.\n\nThere is no detail on what the content creator will create, so there is no way to tell if the orcamene is suitable or not. Host compensation seems reasonable, but without a time estimate of the event there is no way to tell if the hourly rate is adequate or not.\n\nThe team considered the risk of low participation of people in the debate, but considering the team's connections with various sectors of the Cardano community, I believe that this risk is mitigated.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is a short-term roadmap and the activities to be carried out were included in the first and second months. Due to the low complexity of this proposal, I believe that the roadmap is sufficient to follow the development, however I recommend providing more information about the organization's planning and promotion of the event.\n\nThe proposal includes adequate metrics to verify the established definition of success and also for the proposal to be audited. I would recommend including a time frame to measure metrics as the intent of debates is for the community to vote consciously and more participatively, so metrics need to be verified prior to the voting stage.
