The proposal calls for a week-long guided visit in Paris, with some workshops related to Cardano. The proposal would be improved by explaining the connection to the challenge brief. Perhaps the workshops will focus on the delegation process or perhaps the invitee list will focus on diverse dReps from other parts of the world. Additionally, the potential speakers listed are deeply involved in stake pools and the Cardano community, but it would be helpful to understand how they are participating, or intend to participate, in the dRep process. A more detailed description of how the broader Cardano community would benefit from the conference and workshop activities would also be helpful. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The detailed plan focuses more on the agenda for the conference itself. Given the proposer\u2019s experience with event planning, it would be helpful to see a bit more detail regarding how the planning process work. I would be interested to know the proposer\u2019s strategy for booking accommodations, venues, and excursions without knowing how many people will attend. It would be useful to get a sense of the target size of this conference and whether the proposer is envisioning that 10 people will attend or 1,000. In the absence of that target number, it is hard to assess whether the budget is feasible. Additionally, the proposal would be strengthened by devoting more attention to the sign-up process. The proposer has the laudable goal of providing equal opportunities for all. It would be helpful to understand how the accommodations will be provided if too many people sign up. Or alternatively, if everyone can\u2019t be accommodated, it would be helpful to understand what the selection criteria would be. This information would give us useful information not only about whether or not the proposal is feasible, but also about the impact the community can expect from the potential investment of funds into this event. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal would benefit from concrete and quantifiable KPIs, such as the target number of attendees (as mentioned above). Ideally, those metrics would relate to the drep challenge brief, and help the community measure how the funding of this event would improve drep diversity and facilitate vote delegation, as defined in the challenge brief. Additionally, the only answer to the question regarding what success for this project looks like is, \u201cHard to measure. TBD.\u201d The proposal would be strengthened by articulating how the Cardano community will realize a return on intention from funding this event. The PA guide calls for an accessible public channel for delivering regular updates to the community for auditing progress. The proposal would benefit from a discussion of how the community will learn about the planning process for the event, particularly given the lack of detail regarding the sign-up process. And additional transparency would be helpful to understand how the community can assess whether or not the event was a success. The proposer intends to create a small production video about the trip, which would serve as a kind of ad. While this would certainly help to understand what had occurred at the event, it would be useful for the proposer to explain what differentiates this video, which is the only measure listed in the auditability section, from the close-out report video that all funded proposers must create.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2030", "no_vca": 27, "ne": 11, "ng": 15, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2548, "q0": "This project has the potential of a great local impact on France and other neighboring countries i.e Germany, Spain, Portugal, UK.\nSuch gatherings will definitely strengthen relations between community members and create many opportunities for collaboration and also learning. The structure of the events presented would also encourage newbies to participate since it has a friendly and not too techy vibe. The ability to scale on the other hand remains limited but still possible if the events are made in multiple countries simultaneously. This would imitate the swarm concept but in real life.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal presented includes a detailed day-by-day breakdown of the event and the planning necessary to make it happen. The proposer also claims to have extensive experience with organizing various types of events. The team specifies the need for a venue and further funding for different types of activities throughout a couple of days the event is being held. There is no specific time for the event but a specific timeline of the event is provided for 5 days. Risk is said to be limited by the team and they mention that perhaps only travel hick-ups would make the event impossible to make which is understandable. If an experienced team takes responsibility for the event, there wouldn't be many limitations since the logistics are taken into consideration.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For starters, the community can audit the project by checking on the event and getting feedback from attendees on whether the expectation from the proposal was met or not. Furthermore, we already have some PAs from France that would probably attend such an event and would let the community know. The roadmap of the project is presented as a daily breakdown of the activities provided by the event, I wish a clearer view for future growth would have been provided, especially when it comes to logistics if the events become very big. Some KPIs are provided in form of the activities the event will include which will help the community keep the project accountable. Finally, the delivery dates are lacking but it's understandable since giving a specific date before funding would make the logistical issue larger than what it needs to be. The event seems promising and its DAO structure when it comes to access to funding gives an extra layer of transparency and comfort when it comes to the suitability of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2317", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2713, "q0": "I'm struggling to see how this proposal - which appears to be aiming at anyone in Cardano - has any particular relevance to the dReps challenge as such - unless perhaps you argue that anyone in Catalyst is a potential dRep. But if this is the thinking, I see a danger of it creating a meetup of either a random group of people who have no synergy and no interest in the dRep role; or alternatively, a clique of people who are rich enough (in both time and money) to take time out for a meetup. And unfortunately, the proposer does not argue at all for how this would not happen, or how the  proposal does address the challenge, since the section on how the proposal fits the challenge does not reference the challenge's goals at all. I think potentially, this proposal could even be detrimental to the challenge's goals -  the challlenge clearly references the need for greater inclusivity and diversity in who becomes a dRep, but the idea of a several days long meetup in Paris is something that is quite out of reach for many potential dReps, either because of money, or time, or the length of the journey, so this would actually entrench barriers rather than removing them. The proposer doesn\u2019t say how many people are expected, but it seems not to be many, judging by the budget - however, in order to achieve any impact and be worth doing, I think it would need to be rather more people than the proposal is allowing for. Overall, I don't think this proposal addresses the challenge at all well.", "q0r": 1, "q1": " I feel unsure what \"feasible\" would mean in the context of this proposal, as the proposer doesn't give much detail on what goals they are trying to achieve in terms of numbers attending, or results in qualitative terms (whether people enjoyed it, or whether new connections formed, or crucially, whether anyone was encouraged in the role of dRep). I also don't see any information on how it will be promoted and publicised, so I don't feel anyone will be reached, beyond the proposer's own existing contacts. The budget is clear enough, but I think important elements (notably pubicity and documentation) are missing from it - and without those, the event is in danger of just being a holiday. The time-plan also could say more about what the \"workshops\" will consist of, what they are trying to achieve, or how they will have the effect of \"speed[ing] up relationships and community collaborations\", so we can assess what the proposer is trying to deliver and how feasible it looks. I also think it's an issue that the proposal is fuzzy about which \"community\" it is aiming to reach - it says it's the whole of Cardano, but people in very widely divergent parts of Cardano don't really have any cause to collaborate, so it would need quite a skilled workshop facilitator with a lot of insight into the ecosystem to be able to get \"community collaborations\" out of such a meeting. In short, yes it is feasible for this proposer to set up a meetup and a wine-tasting and a tour of Paris; but it doesn't seem very feasible that anyone from Catalyst will attend it, or that any of the purposes that the proposer mentions, or any of the goals of the challenge, would be met.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Making a short advert does not count as auditability. There is little here that the community can audit. It would be nice to see a link to the tool that is mentioned, to be used for collating insights and collaborations.

This is a good initiative; however I think this initiative could best suit different challenge setting. From my analysis, I found it difficult to identify how this project fit the drep improvement challenge setting. Per the objective of th drep improvement challenge, this project would not lead to an increase in dReps participation, it doesn\u2019t also lead to a high delegation participation rate, neither does it lead to appropriate selection of dReps for delegation. Clearly, the proposed solution detailed here doesn\u2019t lead to achieving the end goal of the drep challenge. Ideally, any idea within the drep improvement challenge setting should be centered around the Drep role, however this project is a deviation from the primary objective of the challenge setting.

However, does the information on the team experience, roadmap and budget make this  project feasible? Other than the deviation of the project from the main objective of the drep improvement challenge setting, the team have presented a well structured roadmap and budget for this project. The roadmap looks more concise and structured with time horizons that details activities for each day after funding. Additionally, per the design of the project, the budget is within the reasonable amount and fairly moderate.

On the KPIs, the proposer indicates that they \u201c\u2026will document any ideas, innovations, collaborations and insights from the Workshop\u201d. Even though this is unclear, my inference from this is that, the number of ideas, the number of innovations, number of collaborations and insights are the KPIs for this project. Based on these inference, I think the KPIs suit the objective of the project but lacks clarity and specific milestones.
