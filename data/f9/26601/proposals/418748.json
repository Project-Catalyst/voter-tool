His role will be as an extended guardian of the protocol taking informed decisions in the place of the voters who entrust him with their voting power. I think the word \u201cinformed\u201d is more appropriate in this context than \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d, as those can be subjective and altered.\nThat is why I believe a dRep should be reading as many proposals as he/she is comfortable with, in the domains is informed in and judge based on facts what the voting action will be.\nOtherwise, I do agree that both tools that he mentioned could be improved, and some of the suggestions he has presented do make a valid point and could potentially improve the experience of dReps, PAs and voters. That is why I cannot determine whether I agree if the impact of this proposal could be positive, as it might make it too tempting, as the proposer put it, to \u201csaves a lot of time and can quickly search for good and potential proposals to vote on\u201d.\nPerhaps if the proposer were to reconsider the purpose of the tool, that instead would help dReps make more informed judgements on all the proposals, then I think that would make for a very valuable tool.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the detailed plan offers extensive information regarding the development process, the detailed budget section and team descriptions are labeled as \u201cComing soon\u201d.

The website will have a user friendly interface for ease of us by all participants.\n\nThis proposal is very well presented. It clearly states the current problem and the suggested solution.

The proposer has provided a range of criteria for rating the proposal. I think these criteria are sufficient to be able to filter out the best proposals. no doubt with filters like these the proponents will need to develop more and research the project more carefully so that their proposals are not rejected too soon. this is positive for Catalyst. the only thing I wonder about is that there will be new people joining as proposal writers, they are people with good ideas that can bring a lot of benefit to us, but have no writing experience or not well-presented ideas then tools like this how not to eliminate such projects.

The proponent should include this information. about the implementation plan, he listed the project that will be implemented in 6 months divided into 2 phases of 3 months each, he also provided a list of contents to be done, with the content of work as listed tell that he understands what he is doing and knows how to do it.

In addition, he needs to provide specific definitions of project success and key indicators that can be accurately measured with quantitative numbers as well as qualitative information.
