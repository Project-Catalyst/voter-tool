According to the proposers, the non-native dReps face difficulties in reading and understanding documents about our Cardano ecosystem therefore I have an opinion and I guess the proposers have too that it would affect the quality as well as the diversification of them in the Cardano dReps community. For the previous statement, the problem totally fits with the 1 question of the challenge which is \u201cdiverse and many dRep participants\u201d to make the Cardano more decentralized. In fact, the solution proposed is practical and necessary which is to translate into Japanese and Vietnamese documents, information and announcements then share with the dRep community and attract more new dRep. Because I believe the obstacles in developing our community is the lack of solid understanding of the situation which is partly caused by the language barrier. When we are able to break through the difficulty,  it would make the Vietnamese and Japanese dREep community understand the information of the ecosystem and find it more interesting. Based on that fundamental and under the word of mouth effect there will be more dRep attracted to and our community will be scaled up. Not just so, I believe that gaining more knowledge for dRep would strengthen the community to be a more qualified one and diversify the global dRep. I also highlight that the initiative is extendable to other more languages or in the other word, the scale of this project could be grown. To research deep into the solution itself, the proponents listed about 8 categories of documents needed to be shared as a reference for seminar, on/off meetings in Japan and Vietnam. After being translated, the document will be uploaded via social media as well as community groups there, which I believe will attract a lot more new dRep.  They also have proof by quantitative data referenced from reputable organizations to show the reason they choose Japanese and Vietnamese. I think that having research that makes it clear and proven the argument will be extremely useful for PAs and other related roles to evaluate the impact of the idea. Not just so, the deep research gives them a particular view on the risk they might face. According to the proposers\u2019 opinions, there are 2 risks underlied which are about the deadline for translating and the ADA fluctuation. Having given out the risks, they also have reasonable solutions to solve. This is also a consequence of deep understanding of their own ideas. I just suggest one thing that quality moderation is one thing to consider as it affects the outcome and the dRep\u2019s satisfaction therefore creating a moderators team to audit the translation quality can be a solution. On the other hand punctuation management is inquired due to the high demand of in-time information. I suggest we include a fund for reward and punishment regulation to encourage team members. With the solid argument above, I would give this part the maximum rate.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the detailed plan, I think the information that is given is extremely rich and explains in an extensive and precise way what would happen during the project development process. One observation I would like to clarify is: \u201cstretching up to Fund 10&11\u201d. According to my knowledge, there will be spare time after being funded from Fund 9 ended and Fund 10 started. Does the proposers mean  they will come back asking for more in Fund 10 & 11 or the timeline of proposal at Fund 9 will exceed to Fund 10 & 11? The other point I want to be clearer is the  general activities of 5 phases, are they overlapped? Anyway, I believe it could help me (and other readers) understand more about the feasibility. Speaking now of the activities explained, in fact this part is perfect, I know that they would be divided into each week and tasks for each week are fully included. Each of them is explained with extreme care, so that we have a full understanding of what would be done and how. The requested budget of 14 500 dollars, in my opinion, is a very fair value for the dimension and complexity of this proposal, I think it will really generate great results for Cardano and deserves this funding. The explanations about the money are extremely satisfactory with pages/words/$, I found it totally satisfying in terms of making us understand how the money will be used. Before speaking to the team members, I just wonder that proposers mentioned hiring additional interpreters (if necessary) but I see none budget for more resources, let\u2019s make it clearer in this point if possible. About the team members themselves, I can see that there are 7 experts in English-Japanese-Vietnamese with at least +5 in translating and language. Some are experts in blockchain and Cardano ecosystem for years. Total confidence in the trio is conveyed, as we know their professional attributions (levels of education and current area), a small curriculum and also links to pages such as linkedin, Facebook, where we can see in practice what they have done so far and we have proof as well as the information provided. years. One point worth mentioning here is the ask for the fund under the name a a project called  Proskills39 which has been funded in Fund 8 and under construction right now. This raises their higher commitment to the whole project they\u2019re working on and I am impressed by that. In summary, the auditability of the project is very high. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Progress measurement is impeccable, proponents state ways in which this project will be monitored during its development process, these being the establishment of a set of KPIs: 100 pages translated/m, 500pages/5m; involvement with Marketing to share various of content with the groups of up to 50000 members. They also state that there will be processes to assess project deliverables and also involvement with a Catalyst community consultant review and audit, which is monthly reported and attached a link to where the translations are stored. The successful scenario is described thoroughly through this excerpt \u201cAdding multilingual resources (Japanese, Vietnamese) for the Japanese and Vietnamese dRep community; Attract new dRep to join the dRep program by breaking down the language barrier; Make it easier for dRep to access information from Catalyst, improving voting representation.\u201d With the successful image they have stated, I believe it could gain more benefit for our Cardano ecosystem in general.

From that situation, the Proposal team came up with the idea: Create Japanese and Vietnamese versions of dRep documents, information and announcements and share them with the community to support the existing dRep and attract new dRep. So your idea is in line with the requirements and criteria of the Challenge, which is how to achieve diversity and have many dRep participate. The problem not only solves 1 question of the Challenge, but it also aims to promote harmonious and efficient societies for sustainable development, creating opportunities for equity and justice for all. and building effective institutions, it contributes to expanding and enhancing the participation of developing countries in global governance institutions. Therefore, the Proposal has the ability to scale up in the future to help the world develop sustainably. your idea is to come up with a solution Support the currently participating dRep while also attracting new dRep from the Communityd to ensure that the Challenge requirements are diverse and have lots of dRep. The proposal is made by: Translating and sharing documents about dRep to the Cardano community in Japan and Vietnam. I find that you have chosen a very suitable audience for the current situation, Japan is the place with the largest number of people investing in the Cardano platform and holding ADA, and Vietnam is a developing country. development, there is huge potential for the expansion of the Cardano and dREP communities. Your solution also solved the problem of language barrier for the Cardano community in Japan and Vietnam. Specifically, the work you have done is: Create a mother tongue document to help dRep of the Japanese and Vietnamese communities easily access and better understand dRep in order to increase efficiency and quality. of the dRep program. It is the sharing of dRep documents in Japanese and Vietnamese that has helped increase the number of new dRep from the Japanese and Vietnamese communities. The group's proposal provides an argument with a theoretical and practical basis in line with the Challenge presented. In the process of implementation, you have also foreseen 03 risks that you may encounter: (1) The dRep community requires more and faster time to translate dRep documents than Catalyst documents and (2) Variables big movement of ADA coin. This is very real. And I agree with the solution you give to overcome those risks: (1) Make sure to complete the translation at least 1 week from the time you announce the number and start time to receive the document translation according to the requirements. request from the dRep community. (2) Create a reserve fund for the fluctuation of ADA value, convert ADA to Stablecoin or USD.

I am very impressed with the clearly quantified goal: Get 10 more dRep from the Japanese community and 10 dRep from the Vietnamese community to join Catalyst. Impressive numbers if achieved, given Catalyst's ambition to have more than 200 dRep from more than 100 countries. For that number to come true, the team has come up with a specific plan: The completed documents are shared on Facebook and Telegram groups with many Cardano and Catalyst members in Japan and Vietnam. This is the traditional and very effective way in these two countries. But I still want more, for example, to expand to social networking channels like Zalo, Google Sheet ... then the number of interactions will reach a record number. To realize their idea, the proposal team came up with a Fundraising Budget of $14500, which is less than 5% of the Challenge. A number in my opinion is appropriate. That is clearly and transparently shown by the group in the reasonable budget spending plan. And the proposal also has an additional contingency plan of $1000 to prevent risks. The proposed group has an abundant number of members with 7 people. Team members have been assigned specific tasks and the members' experiences match their duties.

This will make it possible for dReps from Vietnam and Japan to view documents in sequence. It makes it easier for dRep to read information step-by-step instead of handing them a bunch of documents.\nImagine if you were a dRep and someone threw you a bucket of documents where everything was a mess. You will have to spend a lot of time reading and then putting it in order. That was really bad.\nWhat I want to say to the author is to put the document somewhere where you can organize it in an organized and scientific way so that people new to dReps can easily read and learn.\nIt's my feedback to further refine the author's suggestion. Hope this comment will help the author.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author and team members are members with extensive experience in the field of translation.

I just wanted to add a comment about the need to add more information about the profile on the Linkedin site so that we as PAs can easily assess the real capacity of our team members.\nBecause you provide us the picture of the certificate in Japanese. We did not understand anything when looking at these papers and how it affects the quality of the capacity assessment of protected areas.\nIt's a small addition that I think the author and team will draw a lot of experience for the Foundation later.\nThe presentation plan is very detailed and complete, no need to add more.\nThat is all.

I would like to suggest one more risk that the author and the research team need to watch out for.\nThat's the risk of technical jargon. Cardano is a very interesting ecosystem but a lot of technical jargon is confusing. I don't know how long the author and team have been with Cardano, how much time has been spent researching Cardano.\nCardano has a lot of confusing jargon such as eUTXO, state channel, hydra, etc. There will be many more specialized words if you do not participate in the Crypto market, Cardano and study deeply about it, it will be difficult to translate. for others to understand.\nThis is a risk that you should be aware of. This will increase the difficulty and time to translate a document. If you ignore that, it will probably lead to the reader not understanding the document.\nI think this suggestion will help you. In each document, if there are specialized words, additional comments should be added under the document or source for readers to understand more about that specialized word.

I am confident that this proposal will be successful. Even though, English may be the most popular language, it is relative viewpoint not the absolute one as each individual each hobby and talented on languages. They might be not good at English but good at other languages, this is understandable. However, for the viewpoint English maybe the most popular language, so that many document or book with interesting knowledge about blockchain, or programming, etc. are written in English. The high demand on those books to be translated causes some mistake since it is difficult to figure out a 100% similar word to the terms of this field that are mentioned in the books or document. Because of this reason, it proposed to translate all the dRep\u2019s document into Vietnamese as well as Japanese and then deliver them to many Telegram groups, or Facebook (Meta). Therefore, it would be a terrific solution for the barriers that most users who are passion on Cardano inhabitant but not able to use English.

On the other aspects, the range of costs that will be expensed is quite in an acceptable amount as I analyzed above. This amount is approximate to the general price of a translated page in Viet Nam. Moreover, every challenge and risk are also in plan with corresponding solution and approach to limit/reduce those risk as much as possible. Obviously, the proposer team really expect to its proposal and work so hard for it. I appreciate their effort, also. Moreover, the reliability of the proposal is enhanced a lot by the showing information of members in the team. They are experts in linguistic for 5-year experience and above in translating, so that there is no doubt about the quality of the document/books that will be translated by this team.

Because it helps the proposer to come up with more better marketing approaches. Furthermore, although there is KPI for the proposal, I just have a little recommendation that the proposal would be more reliable if they can add more specific number like the number of new users, or the accessing time to those translated documents/books. Therefore, it would be more visualized for voters to verify and evaluate the successful possibility of the process.
