These are lacking resources to provide active engagement contribution.", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.041666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1603, "q0": "In terms of alignment with the challenge, the proposal is theoretically perfect, acting mainly on these two specific objectives: dReps must be diverse and there must be many dReps. The problem is that the content about dReps is mostly (if not all) in English. In fact, basically everything about Cardano is available in English, even though IOG has gone to great lengths to break down these language barriers, as we have already had a specific challenge for multilinguals in past funds, this issue is still quite urgent. Let alone a subject as new and specific as dReps: the existence of people selected to vote on Catalyst proposals is a very current project, and very necessary, but which is still very restricted to English speakers, either as a native language. or through studies. So, what the proponents suggest is that a series of translations be made into other languages, so that there are resources and continuous updates on the content that talks about dReps. Proponents claim that existing hubs will be used, in 14 languages, which is very positive, as efforts here would not be starting from scratch. Some people who already meet and work towards Cardano's technologies would have another delegated role in their hubs. Proponents are also quite right when they comment on the need to be careful about translating very specific terms, which do not have a literal translation into other languages, and plan to work with simple and relevant explanations so that even lay people can understand what would be said. In other words, in theory, the proposal is perfect. However, I have some observations to make. First, it would be important for proponents to make it clearer what content would be translated, and how often this work would be carried out. What is the official means of communication that we would follow in English so that what is available can be translated? I think there was a lack of clarity on this issue. Another observation would be that, I would like the 14 languages \u200b\u200bmentioned to be specified, which languages \u200b\u200bare we speaking? Ideally, bidders should provide links to the pre-existing hubs that they cite they will work with, so that we have knowledge and a better observation of which hubs are, how many people participate in each, the languages \u200b\u200bspoken, how they are organized and etc. Some discord site or channel could be made available for each, for example. Speaking of discord, the Swahili language channel is available, but when I tried to enter it said that it was not possible to do that, that the invitation was invalid, so it would be interesting that this permission was given to us, so that we could at least have a palpable demonstration about the hubs that are mentioned. Finally, regarding the website that is available (educationment), I note that even if we select different languages \u200b\u200b(as happens with German and Portuguese, for example), the content itself remains in English. Maybe the site is still under construction, but it would be interesting to get that back. Therefore, I believe that the proposal is very good in terms of impact, but some issues should be better established.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The activities of the script are proposed in a superficial way. For example, in the first month, a team of linguistic ambassadors would be assembled - I believe 1 representative for each mentioned hub. It would be important for this selection process to be defined, for us to know which criteria would be used, so that we could be sure that this choice would be made as consciously as possible. The activities of the other months should also have been explained in more detail. In months 2 and 3, \u201cthe creation of the website and holding of online and offline meetings, discussions to publicize the resources and provide updates shared by IOG on dRep in several languages\u201d would be done. But within these activities, what would happen in month 2 and month 3? Regarding online and offline meetings, it would be important for us to know how often they would take place, in which locations (in the case of face-to-face meetings - I think it should be in each of the 14 language countries, but it would be interesting for a feasibility study to be carried out, so that the meetings had as many participants as possible and were better used). The online meetings could also be better defined - would there be 1 meeting every time some content is published in English? In the 6th month the project would be finished, in my view it would be interesting for this proposal to be renewed, because probably the contents about dReps continued to be released after that deadline. But thinking about now: how will the feedbacks be collected? Will a satisfaction survey be carried out with the members of the 14 communities in question? In general, from the way this information is passed, we only know in a basic way what would happen, and greater specificity should be reported for when and how these actions would develop. Speaking of budget issues, the same situation occurs: information is passed on in a basic way, without so many explanations by minors. The total cost of the project is 20 thousand dollars, which in my opinion is a value compatible with what will be developed, but it would be necessary for each part to be better argued. For example, $7,000 would be set aside to \u201cassist highly motivated people who are in precarious situations, especially from low-income countries overall\u201d. How many people would be helped? How often would they receive the allowance, and what would be the dollar amount of that allowance, for each? In \u201cresource to pay for materials that each hub needs to function efficiently\u201d: what materials would be needed? From what I understand, the hubs would be organized mostly online, with only a few face-to-face meetings, so it would be important for us to know how this part of the money would be used (perhaps to pay for internet, rent the places where the face-to-face meetings would take place, etc.?) . And finally, analyzing the team, confidence is transmitted in the 3 people who are the permanent members of the project, as we know necessary information about each one (it would be positive, however, if a more detailed curriculum were provided about them); what I think creates a considerable lack here is that we don't know who the linguistic ambassadors would be. I understand that this would be defined after funding, but in my perception if we already had this information, the proposal would go up a lot. In my view, the team presentation part is good, but the others need real improvement.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the project is average. Regarding the monitoring of progress, many KPIs are raised, such as \u201cnumber of online dRep meetings recorded in different languages, number of hubs formed, size of each hub, amount of content shared, number of people on board\u201d and so on. These metrics are good ways to track the partial results that would be being generated, but they are not effective ways to monitor the work that is behind it. It would be important for linguistic ambassadors to update us at the end of each month on how the translations into the language of their hubs have been carried out, if the works were happening with the planned frequency, being delivered within the deadlines, if the translated content was being disseminated properly within the hub (whether people speaking that language would be aware of such documents, for example). That is, what would be behind the amount of content shared; I think that as important as knowing the numbers is understanding whether the translations were being done and reaching people in the planned way. Regarding the number of people assisted in precarious situations, it would be positive for the proponents to specify in what way, more precisely, these people would be being helped. Would they be receiving help in relation to the internet, or would it be in more basic issues, such as food, health and etc? Thinking about end results, unfortunately the proponents tell us in a very abstract way what success would be: \u201call fourteen hubs are running a low-cost, self-sustaining portal for dRep education, information, collaboration and support\u201d. In fact, this is our main goal, but in addition to understanding whether the main objective has been achieved, it is necessary to have more knowledge about the consequences that this would generate for each of the 14 communities that comprise the project. Could it be that, from the translated documents, more community members are applying to be dReps? Is the level of understanding about this project really growing? How can you understand how the translations impacted each of these hubs? Things like: the frequency of meetings that address the subject could be monitored, the level of participation in these meetings, the amount of readings of the translated documents, the amount of dReps in each hub, etc. In other words, in my view, the auditability is not bad, but it needs more depth, especially in relation to the second parts, of the final results.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 10, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 595, "q0": "The main goal of this proposal is quite straightforward: to translate dReps content to other languages other than English. Considering that the dReps are going to be a key role in the future of Cardano\u2019s governance, making this kind of content accessible to all is fundamental to guarantee equal opportunities for participation in Cardano\u2019s governance. It is mentioned that the content will be translated to a total of 14 different languages, although the list of languages is not provided. This information is important to understand how big are the communities that are going to be affected by this proposal and therefore to evaluate its impact. The translation of dReps material will be done in parallel with the creation of local hubs that will run both online and offline session about the topic. The sessions will cover different time zones, trying to provide the opportunity to participate on them for people who live outside the EU and US time zones, which is inclusive and aligned with the goal of including different communities. Considering that the proposal asks for a total of $20k, the average cost per language would be $1428. It is a good cost-benefit for the community. This proposal tackles many of the mentioned points, for example, \u2018dReps must be diverse\u2019, \u2018There should be many dReps\u2019, and regarding the diversity of dReps, \u2018(Diversity of dReps) Did it lead to the onboarding of diverse dReps with different languages, national origins, occupations, genders, ages, religions, etc.?\u2019. Also, it will help to increase the number of onboarded dReps overall. Therefore, the alignment of this proposal with the challenge is very good. The main risk mentioned in the proposal is the problem with translating some terms from English to other languages, that there might be a direct translation and some explanation might be necessary. Although, I believe that there is a risk related to the execution, since coordinating 14 different hubs won\u2019t be an easy task, and the budget seems to be very tight, is things don\u2019t go according to the plan, there might be some execution delays and maybe it wouldn\u2019t be feasible to create all 14 hubs.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The execution of this proposal is going to take 6 months in total. The first month will be dedicated to gather the group of people that\u2019s going to be responsible for the translations. The following 4 months will be used to create a website, run the meetups, and translate the content provided by IOG about dReps. The last month will be used to gather feedback and lessons learned before closing out the project. The timeline for execution seems to be ok, although I believe 1 month might not be enough to gather 14 teams and to put everything in place to create the hubs, even if they are only online. It would be good to know as well at least an estimate of the amount of content that would be translated and the number of meetups that will take place. The proposal\u2019s budget seems to be ok, but some points are not clear. For example, \u201cProvide socio-economic incentive to develop meaningful connections and drive collaboration.\u201d and \u201cAssist highly motivated people that are in precarious situations, especially from countries with low general income.\u201d seem to be the same things in this context, even if they are slightly different. There\u2019s a budget for resources to each hub as well, but it is not clear what it is, for e.g., hardware, software, services, etc. In general, I believe that the budget is quite short to create a total of 14 hubs and translate these materials and might not be enough to attract interested people to participate in this project. But since the languages and countries were not specified, it\u2019s difficult to assess if the budget is appropriate or not. The proposing team, composed by Evans and Regina, seems to have a good knowledge about Catalyst and blockchain in general and might be able to support the translating teams with anything that\u2019s necessary. As they are going to gather a team to work with them, they don\u2019t need to be translators themselves, although depending on external people to execute the proposal increases the risk of successfully delivering the proposal, besides the previously mentioned risk of the difficulty of managing such a big group of people at the same time. The team will probably return to ask for more funding in the future to continue the project, what makes since given the nature of the proposal. They are also working on other proposal from previous funds and have other proposals submitted in this fund, which might be ok since they are not directly going to execute the current proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided in the auditability section of this proposal to keep track of the progress is appropriate, although there are some KPIs missing in my opinion. For example, there\u2019s nothing there mentioning how to keep track of the offline meetups. Some of the KPIs presented are also related to success of the proposal, for example number of people onboarded, size of each hub, more than related to the execution of the proposal itself. It would be good to have defined goals for each month for the number of meetups, amount of content translated. To measure the success of the proposal, some of the KPIs presented in the progress tracking session could be used as mentioned, but also it would be interesting to measure the number of new dReps submissions due to this initiative, since this is, after all, the main goal of the current proposal. Overall, the auditability of this proposal by the community is going to be easy to do, and I don\u2019t see many risks related to auditability. It is also mentioned that this is a continuation of a previously funded proposal, but in my opinion the scope is so different that it could be considered a completely new proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 6, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1931, "q0": "dReps are an important aspect of the future of Cardano since they can help to unify and guide community members that are interested in Cardano ecospace, but may lack the time or knowledge currently.

This would go a long way to achieve the stated challenge goal of dReps with diverse backgrounds and from as many countries as possible, boosting decentralization.
