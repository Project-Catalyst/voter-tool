How can Cardano educate Seniors to take part of the DRepp process either as a team or solo DRep?", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.0, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1694, "q0": "The idea is very interesting and fits fully with the specific objectives of the challenge, meeting exactly the 4 topics present in the challenge description, both in relation to the diversity of dReps, and for the integration of new dReps, contributing to the number of them that were delegated , in addition to building very useful content to facilitate dReps activities. The proposal is, in short, an extension of the Cardano for Seniors project, in which the contents related to Cardano are provided in a language specifically designed for the elderly. Proponents argue how important it is that we make this investment, firstly because the current elderly population is about 2 billion, which represents a significant portion of the world's total amount; also because the elderly are precious to our community, since they represent retired professionals from different areas, and full of knowledge to be shared. Precisely because the cryptographic universe is something new and that can often be predatory in the eyes of the elderly, it is important that we make an adaptation so that the knowledge is designed precisely for that portion of the population, and since the advent of dReps is new in the ecosystem , it is also necessary that documents and teachings on the subject are specifically designed for them. It is positive that this team has already been funded before, having started work in this area. They already have a platform where they make calls with the elderly, so that, through oral debates, various knowledge related to Cardano can be shared. Here, they intend to create a video that will talk about being dRep can represent an alternative of extra income for the retirement of the elderly, and this video would be made through the \u201cSenior Learning style\u201d: it would be very positive and important for understanding of the proposal, in general, that this method be more detailed. What is the difference in practice for the approach to Cardano, and its other developments, from the young to the elderly? I wish they had made available some content that was already created using this line of learning, so that we could understand the methods well. Another plus point is that they will translate the video into different languages \u200b\u200bin order to reach a maximum number of people. I would also like to know how they selected the languages \u200b\u200bin which the translations will be made. Finally, another very positive point of the proposal is that the proponents already tell us how the video would be disseminated: they have already established a survey that pointed out how the ROI is better when working with social networks and that the most used by the target audience is facebook, so they probably already have a marketing campaign aimed precisely at this communication channel. Therefore, I believe that this proposal is of high value and deserves top marks in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is generally viable. But some details could have been included in some parts, to increase the level of specificity. One of those parts is the script; in fact, this is the part that needs the most adjustments to make it ideal, as the description of what would be done is quite superficial. We have an entire quarter dedicated to making drafts: how would this process take place? How could we better understand the daily work of the professionals involved? How would the contents be transmitted in audiovisual language, what are the techniques discussed here? Maybe slides, illustrations, or recordings of people talking? It would be interesting to better understand the concept, in addition to the educational strategies that would be addressed. The coming months are also explained very succinctly, for example, in one of the months the delegated activity is recording the videos in the five languages \u200b\u200band editing them. It would be important for us to understand well this process of how the recordings would be made, how the process would be to edit them and so on. And finally, in the publicity part, I would like the marketing process to be explained better, in general. When it comes to funding, in my opinion this is the best part of the topic as we have a very satisfactory breakdown of how the requested money would be spent. The total amount is divided into a few parts, and we know well how they will be executed. For example, in the drafting and conceptualization part, we know that the time allotted for this is 4 hours (and the hourly price is always 50 dollars). We also know how much time would be delegated to other parts of the project's development, such as translating the drafts, recording the videos themselves, etc. Only the administration interface part was a little confusing, in my view. What would that be? Overall, the budget explanation allows us to have a solid understanding of funding. Finally, talking about the team, I believe this part is ok but it could be better if there was more detail about each of the members involved. For example, we know that \u201cKevinfrey1987 is the youngest member of C4S and keeps the team informed. He is also our oracle for all things new to help reach out to our community.\u201d But what would your area of \u200b\u200bexpertise be? Would he contribute to the technical part of the proposal in some way? Gustavo is an artist and will help with the translations, but how does he relate to the Cardano ecosystem? I believe it would be beneficial if we had a slightly longer and richer description of the professionals involved here. As I opened the topic saying, the proposal is indeed viable, as we have a general understanding of what would be done, how the requested funding would be used and who are the people involved, only a few improvements can be provided.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In my view, the proponents have a very solid notion about how they will audit the process; they divide the whole into 3 steps (preparation - the first step will be preparation, script writing and recording and editing + promotion and publishing stage + DReps integration). In addition to informing us about these steps, they also clarify how each of them could be monitored. Regarding the preparation of the material, I believe it would be easier for the community to audit this if we had a roadmap that would better detail the activities being carried out by professionals in these parts, such as how ideas will be discussed and become a draft, and so on. It is said that there will be spreadsheets, so it would be appropriate for 1) these documents to be available to all members of the Cardano community; 2) in case they prefer that the access is restricted to the team, it would be necessary that an overview of the information was made, in order to periodically update the community. Regarding disclosure, this, in my view, is the simplest part to be audited, as social media, such as Facebook and Linkedin, already have engagement tracking tools (how many people viewed the content, number of likes, interactions and etc). And regarding the integration of dReps and the elderly, it is said that this is a little more difficult to measure and that integration in social networks would still be analyzed for this data. I believe that perhaps it would be more interesting that a direct survey with the elderly be carried out, so that we could understand this integration. This directly relates to the ultimate success, which here is conceptualized as \u201ca community of new DReps Onboarding of C4S efforts. Many of these seniors will be multilingual because of our reach.\u201d It is precisely necessary that a more direct study be carried out, so that we can understand the referred context and make it palpable for our community, in addition to understanding how many elderly people became dReps, in what way they would be performing their work and how this project was a differential in their trajectories within our community. That said, I think auditability is better on the part of progress than success, it is still necessary that more studies are done so that we can better understand the consequences of the project, and such information should be available to all members of our community . So some improvements are needed, even though the auditability is good, it's still not perfect.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 8, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 907, "q0": "Senior citizens often have a hard time getting used to and familiarizing themselves with new technologies. For Cardano to grow in adoption and represent all aspects of societies, it needs to be the go-to choice for all people, and that includes seniors. This proposal tries to educate senior population in the Cardano blockchain and onboard them into the cadre of dReps. This would directly increase both the number and diversity of dReps, therefore it directly provides a solution for the problems outlined in this challenge.\n\nThe way the team at \u201cCardano4Seniors\u201d will go about this is by creating a YouTube video explaining the concept of dReps and the possibility of earning income by becoming one (dRep). This video will be translated into 5 languages, which means that a wide audience will have access to it. Regarding scalability, there\u2019s no specific mention on this matter, and perhaps the team should focus on translating the video in more languages, so that it has a world-wide audience, but the starting point is good to begin with.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding relevant skills and experience, the proposal provides usernames of the people who will be working on the project, as well as a brief background for each of them. In this matter, links that can help the voter verify this information would be needed for full transparency. Besides, only providing a username is not a great way to identify the team, since there\u2019s no mention to the social media which hosts these usernames or where to locate them.\n\nWhen it comes to the budget, the team provides an overview as well as a break-down of each specific element. It is important to mention that most of the budget will go to social media advertisement. This makes sense, even though the quality of the final product is very important, it\u2019s also crucial that as much people watch it as possible. Targeting publicity to the senior audience is a great way of accomplishing that goal. When it comes to the amount being asked, it\u2019s hard to determine if it\u2019s reasonable or not. On one hand we\u2019ve got the money that will be spent on advertising the video, on the other hand we\u2019ve got a 1/3 of the budget that will go towards what the proposers call \u201ctalent\u201d. This basically comprises everything that is needed to create the video. It\u2019s hard to say if it\u2019s reasonable or not for two reasons: foremost it\u2019s not stated who will work on each specific task, therefore there\u2019s no reference to look at for guidance. Second, the tasks making up this category of the budget, such as draft conceptualization and writing can vary a lot (in terms of costs) depending on the project, which makes the price discretional. It would be great if the team could provide more information in this department to make this matter more clear.\n\nRegarding the timeline, there\u2019s a clear roadmap and specific milestones are set for each phase, which basically encompasses the last part of the current year.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As already mentioned, there are milestones established and a clear roadmap. The metrics that will be utilized to track the progress are also determined and make sense, however, there\u2019s no mention of a way by which the voters can follow this progress.\n\nFinally, success for this project means having a community of dReps from C4S onboard Project Catalyst. The explanation given in the proposal seems a bit vague, and information on how they will measure this would give it more substance.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2151", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 3, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2511, "q0": "This challenge addresses the new concept of DReps which are soon to be implemented on Catalyst. The lower turnout of voters for Catalyst (around 30% of total holders) was a concern for all involved and hence this concept of decentralized representatives was thought of. But the main concern with the DReps is not enough people being interested in enrolling for it. It is necessary to create some awareness about the benefits of DReps to motivate people to participate in it.\n\nThe proposal is trying to achieve this by motivating and helping Senior citizens in the Cardano community, referred to as Seniors in the proposal, to use their experience and probably free time to utilize and in process get some additional income and also help Cardano in Decentralized Governance. The team is already running Cardano4seniors initiative and will be building a community platform to onboard seniors and educate them about the process and requirements to participate in this initiative. The team will write different scripts and make videos for educating these people and the content will be made available in Italian, Spanish, Papiamento & Dutch other than English. This will help people form these regions who are not efficient in English to also take part in the process and hence make it a success with large scale participation. In this way the proposal perfectly aligns with the objectives of the challenge and will help bootstrap this initiative.\n\nOnly concern I see is regarding their focus on a specific demographic that is Seniors. Now although this category of people might be perfect for the job given their experience and time available with them, but given their age, it will be hard to find many seniors who are well versed with the concept of Blockchain technology and ethos of the Cardano. In case the proposal is not successful to secure funding in this round, I would request them to address this concern by preparing a groundwork about how many people they expect to enrol from their previous experience of working with seniors.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project is divided into 3 stages and runs upto Q1 of 2023. The first stage of preparation includes writing scripts for educational content, creating videos and translating them to different languages. 2nd stage is about promotion and publication and will include conducting extensive social media ad campaigns. The final stage concerns onboarding the DReps. The team consists of 4 members and they possess required skills like developer, multi-linguistic, community manager and content creator which are required to complete this project.\n\nThe team is requesting for funds of $7500  to complete this proposal and major chunk of this of $5000 will go into the advertising which is important to create the awareness about both the DReps and also about this proposal concerning seniors.\nOn both these fronts, the proposal is feasible and simple in design. The only concern would be of not finding enough Seniors to ultimately enrol them for becoming DReps. The solution would be to present some data from their prior experience about working with seniors and presenting the facts about what number of DReps they are expecting to onboard which will justify the funds spent on the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The first stage of the project can be monitored from the volumn of content being created and uploaded by the team concerning education and awareness about DReps. The second stage can be monitored through the number of hits being received by these social media ads on different platforms. The project will share these details with the community on regular basis. But monitoring and auditing the final stage of the proposal which is onboarding of the Seniors as DReps is tricky as there is no way to know how many People have enrolled to this initiatives through the efforts of this proposal. But I think that is not the purpose of this proposal anyway. The main purpose is to educate the Seniors and motivate them to join the Catalyst by becoming DReps. This aspect can be easily verified from the number of users who view their content and also the number of hits their ads get. So the Auditability might be a bit difficult in this case and the measurement of success of the peoposal might be  subjective but I am of the opinion that these tasks can be achieved eventually.\n\nIn the end I would like to say that the proposal is a well needed effort in the direction of making DRep initiative successfully.

Many senior citizens around the world virtually have nothing doing or some are forced to take the contracts to make sure their senior years are comfortable financially. If participating in Project catalyst as dReps assures them of some income then many will be willing to onboard. Talking about quality, many senior citizens have great deal of experience to work with.
