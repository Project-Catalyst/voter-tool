This would require dReps who are not currently well known and not yet well-connected to the community to step forward and gain a following by their unique profiles and diverse opinions and backgrounds. A video channel that centers around interviews of dReps does very little in that respect in my opinion. It is quite likely to give a platform to those who are already outspoken and fluent in English, well-connected and experienced, with knowledge about the channel and contacts to its creators. I see the risk of using a \"media circus\" similar to failed political campaigning in legacy governance. This would foster a \"winner takes all\" process and concentration of vote delegation to those bold and eloquent enough to being interviewed on the proposed channel. Outside the community of Vietnam and Eastern Townhall, English-speaking Telegram and Youtube channels, impact is not highly likely, but we need inroads in Africa, South America, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union states if we are to hit the 100 countries dRep number.\nThis concern aside, I think that the proposed program of the interview channel which focuses mainly on the first cohort(s) and existing dReps might encourage watching would-be dReps to step forward and apply. This is of course a possible channel of recruitment, but might not be very cost effective as it reaches a similar viewer base as existing Catalyst media channels who will without doubt take notice as dRep voting goes underway and the public discourse will react accordingly.\nIn summary, this is a decent proposal with moderate impact probability, that I think does a good job of filling a need, but may have been designed with more consideration of how this channel could change its format and marketing approach. The goal could have been how to reach new viewers and have some innovative approach to overcome the halo and stage fright effects surrounding the \"celebrity culture\" of Youtube interviews.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The two proposers have a strong research and technical/blockchain background, but not a lot of media, video editing and presentation experience and partner up with the VietCore Youtube channel creators. This is a Vietnamese-only channel with moderate reach and production quality, that should be able to do a good job, but most likely not to the same quality standard as IOHK's Cardano360, or previous Catalyst participants from LearnCardano or Kaizen Crypto. \nThe budget and business plan are sound and should result in a good production quality.\nIn summary, I have no doubts that this proposal can be carried out effectively given the information provided, but is unlikely to \"jump off the page\" unless the team partners up with some more experienced, more diverse content creators - the budget should allow this.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The targeted performance metrics and links to profiles and social media channels are clear and it should be possible for the auditors and community to keep in touch with the team and learn about the progress and success of the proposal. The goals however are in my opinion not ambitious enough given the scope of the targeted challenge setting objectives and percentage of budget requested. 100 views per video as a key metric will not be anywhere near the required viewing to \"move the needle\" on getting to dReps from 100 countries onboarded. Therefore, I think although auditability and clarity are there, more could have been done to set out ambitious but reachable goals and KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We really appreciate your assessment for our proposal. But we have a few explanations to share with you\n\n1. Catalyst aims to have a lot of dRep coming from different countries. I agree with you on this. But to become dRep those people need to have basic English ability to be able to read and understand the proposals to evaluate and make voting decisions. Therefore, our English videos are completely accessible to many dRep from many different countries around the world.\n2. Our resources are available and the goal of this proposal is not to help people over 100 participating countries become dRep. We just want to grow the number of dRep who can speak English and Vietnamese. In addition, dReps who do not know Vietnamese can still reach Vietnamese delegators through our videos.\n3. The dReps that we selected to interview are those who have registered to become dRep on Catalyst's system. We will randomly select dRep to interview. Besides, we don't think this proposal can create the negative effects as you say. Because we are also a channel for dReps to share themselves with delegators. And ADA holders also have more information about which dReps to choose from.\n4. The video interviews that we do are very difficult to be \"media circus\" as you mentioned. We only create opportunities for dRep to share and connect with ADA holders. ADA holders can also interact and be in closer contact with dReps. The connection between ADA holder and dRep through video will bring greater efficiency than dRep's information on Catalyst's system.\n5. We do not intend and cannot be a force that can change and manipulate Catalyst's dRep mechanism to increase the centralization of the voting process."}, {"id": 4930, "q0": "As dReps are a new development that has not yet come to fruition, there is a need to create awareness and incentivize information channels that can appeal to the average ADA holder.

Basically the idea is to build a Youtube channel to interview people who want to become dRep. In this interview, dRep will share their experiences (could be their experience in community management, their experience in project evaluation, their understanding of the blockchain space) to build credibility mandate from the voter to the voter entrusts the vote to the dRep. On the part of voters, through this Youtube channel, they will be able to grasp which dRep they trust, and choose the right dRep to entrust them with. In each video posted on Youtube, the proposer will also translate it into two languages: Vietnamese and English, thereby connecting English-speaking voters with the Vietnamese community and vice versa.
