The solution detailed in the proposal: \"easy-to-build visualizations and quantifiable metrics to supplement/replace most of the text of a proposal\" does not adequately answer the challenge to improve Catalyst dRep or voter delegation agenda. If the intent somehow is to tangentially benefit affect the dRep cohort or help voters delegate to a dRep, the proposal does not make a strong connection. \n\nIn response to how the proposal addresses the challenge, the author writes \"We believe that much of the information conveyed by a proposal can be represented by visualizations and metrics...\" again, not seeing the connection to dReps or helping with voter delegating their votes. \n\nPerhaps the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" would have been a better fit.  ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal states that the \"The project will be hosted on the Vrooli application.\" as detail to provide a detailed plan, timeline and key milestone. Accessing the feasibility is challenging because the proposal does not make it clear if it is asking for funding to build out the \"Vrooli application\" or to build something on top of Vrooli to help improve dRep processes or voter delegation. \n\nPerhaps consider spelling out to the voter how the various milestone contribute to specific asks from the challenge brief. \n\nThe budget is pretty simple and straightforward and the one person team has a background in ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal has three goals it intend to track but doesn't give details about \"how\" these goals will be measured or how the community will be able to follow along.

The team at \"Vrooli\" come up with a novel approach regarding the way voters can do research for the different proposals on each fund. They propose introducing visuals and metrics as a simpler and better way to have a look at each specific proposal. Regarding this specific challenge (dRep improvement and onboarding), maybe more specific information about how this solution could incentivize a more diverse dRep participation would be informative, but the fact that it helps to get more people to vote, also translates to more vote delegation in dReps. As a voter in previous funds, the experience of reading all the proposals can be very time-consuming, and this would without a doubt make the voting process faster and more accessible for the masses.\n\nRegarding scalability, a general explanation on this topic is provided in the whitepaper from \u201cVrooli\u201d (information on resources necessary as well as technical aspects is also contained in this whitepaper), the platform in charge of carrying out this proposal. Perhaps a mention on future sustainability would make the proposal more complete, but overall the information provided is detailed, and the voter can gain an understanding of the problem trying to be solved and the approach to the solution.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has the skills and experience necessary for a successful implementation of the proposal. The person in charge is a full-stack developer with 10 of experience, which is exactly what is needed for the tasks required to develop the proposal. The fact that he was also part of the first cohort of Plutus pioneers, demonstrates technical knowledge and know-how of the Cardano ecosystem. The evidence provided comes in the form of a personal page with links to social media and GitHub, and all the information can be verified.\n\nThe proposal states who will work on the project (the founder of Vrooli) and describes the different tasks that will be worked on.\n\nRegarding the budget, it\u2019s divided into sections, with each of them breaking down the different items where the money will be spent. Most of the money will go to pay the developer, and considering the amount being asked, which is $45 x hour, the budget is reasonable to achieve the objectives (the average salary of a full stack developer in the US normally stands in the range of $40-$55).\nWhen it comes to the timetable, the roadmap established consists of 16 weeks, with objectives to be accomplished every 2 weeks.\n\nAt last, the only possible risk mentioned is the time other projects of \"Vootril\" could take to be implemented, and which are complementary to this proposal. If that were to happen, this project could be delayed some time, but in my opinion this doesn\u2019t seem too much of a problem since the team at \"Vootril\" have planned ahead.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned earlier, a roadmap and milestones are established. The KPIs chosen also seem logical and will be efficient at tracking the progress of this specific proposal. For example, one of them will track the creation of 50 proposals in Project Catalyst before the end of fund11. These indicators will be accessible at any time by the voters, which is a good thing for keeping auditability transparent at all times.\n\nThe proposal also defines what success looks like, such as the reduction of time for proposal evaluation. Perhaps some information on exactly how this will be measured could help the voters have more detailed information, but nonetheless success is defined and will be measured.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2151", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 4, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1049, "q0": "By interacting with the website after analysing the proposal\u2019s goal, I find the platform developed to be an interesting working concept for some type of businesses. From what I gathered from the website, there are a number of questions that a user would have to answer in regards to his project/proposal, starting with \u201cHash out your new business idea\u201d and \u201cDevelop a roadmap for your new business\u201d to \u201cDefine your company's structure\u201d or \u201dDefine a plan to scale your business\u201d. Based on these questions and the answer a user would be providing, the website would produce a flowchart with text and metrics. The proposer considers this kind of visualisation to be superior to the \u201cwalls of text that most people don\u2019t want to read\u201d i.e Catalyst proposals.\nI have two main arguments regarding this aspect:\n1. For a lot of the proposals this kind of questions are not applicable. A lot of the projects deal with open-source code, and they are not meant to become a scaling business, or they deal with community events that don\u2019t need a roadmap and so on. I do not view the scope of Project Catalyst as helping finance businesses only, but any kind of experiment the community sees fit. As such, a method that might be detrimental to even a small percentage of the proposals, cannot be considered viable.\n2. Since the challenge the proposal has been submitted in is meant for dRep onboarding, I would add that the role of a dRep is to get familiar with any number of proposals he feels comfortable with and decide if they will be upvoted or downvoted. If someone signs up to be a dRep, then that person will most probably not be avoiding walls of text.\nConsidering these aspects, I find that such a rigid method could potentially be jeopardising a lot of the proposals. For now, voters, PAs and dReps will have to deal with reading text that occasionally is accompanied by visual attachments in the form of Miro boards, images, videos and so on. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I find the detailed plan to be containing a good measure of both technical and non-technical terms, that with just a bit of technical knowledge can be easily understood by everyone. From the details provided, I feel like the proposer has a lot of knowledge and a clear path to implementing this project. The timeline provided is extensive, it\u2019s spread over 16 weeks, starting with the design plan and ending with the product launch.\nThe budget asked for is simple, but complete. Since it will be a one-man team, the majority of the funds will be spent on his development work. For full-stack development, he will be asking for $45/h, which I find to be a reasonable amount. The total development time will be 20hours a week over a period of 16 weeks, for the full development of the service. Considering the condition the website is in now, I find the allotted time to be sufficient.\nBesides the development budget, there are some server costs, Github and potentially other developer fees included.  The $10 champagne is a nice touch to be incorporated at the end. \nThe proposer/developer of the project has provided all the information one might need to be able to assess his skill, desire and potential. He has included a link to a sort of Linktree, one possibly built by himself, I am not in the position to analyse that. The Linktree includes all the professional and social media accounts, the Vrooli website, discord of the Vrooli website and his Project Catalyst profile.\nThe proposer has mentioned something about having other Catalyst proposals but hasn\u2019t written a description or provided links, although he has also answered Yes to the question about having other proposals.\nBut, overall, I find the feasibility section satisfying and I feel like I am left with no unanswered questions or doubts about the proposal being successfully implemented. The only drawback is the missing info regarding his other Catalyst proposals, as such, I will rate it a 4/5.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability section is also very straightforward. The proposer has delivered a series of achievable KPIs. The proposer mentions that these metrics could potentially be tracked automatically and in real-time. However, it doesn\u2019t specify where and how that will happen. That is an important detail to consider\nThe success vision offered makes a lot of sense and has the potential to be implementable without difficulty.\nIn conclusion, I find the auditability section to be powerful enough to get a score of 5.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 9, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2577, "q0": "Proposers offer solutions to replace written proposals through visuals and quantitative indicators to help readers evaluate proposals faster and easier. It is clear that this is an interesting solution that will certainly make it easier for voters to integrate. The proponent created the Vrooli platform. this platform allows quick creation of diagrams by drag and drop interface this is the working platform. This proposal aims to upgrade Vrooli so that it maximizes prototyping utility. so the proposal is perfectly suited to the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent provided a fairly specific work plan for every 2 weeks. however I don't know what year the project will launch, I recommend the proponent include it. the work content should also define it a little more specifically eg: what types of metrics should be added, and what kind of recommendations can be shown for improvement,... although I figure it out. Its content is quite difficult, but the more clearly the content of the work needs to be done, the less likely it is that situations will arise that cause delays or possibly deviations in the direction of development. In terms of budget it's clearly listed in 3 sub-categories, at $45 for an hour of developer work I would rate it as reasonable. However, as mentioned above, if the work content is clarified, it will be assessed whether the reasonableness of 20 hours x 16 working weeks is reasonable or not. About the person who made the proposal as mentioned in terms of feasibility, he is the developer of the Vrooli platform, so he is fully capable and experienced in successfully implementing the proposal. In summary, export is feasible, but additional information about work content and budget is required to achieve the maximum score.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As described in the feasibility, the proposal provides weekly project progress but does not provide definite timelines. however, to measure the progress of the project, the proponent has provided quantitative numbers to track. he said that it is possible to track results daily, weekly, and monthly but I don't see where he provides this result. and for example with 200 monthly active users tracking how many people will need to reach daily to show project progress. This proposal describes a clear goal of success that is easy to understand, and it meets the goal of the challenge.

Allowing Catalyst proposals to be easily understood in diagrams and visualizations is a good way to reach more voters and also reduce the translation and tedious reading work of dReps who are not native English speakers. In that regard, this proposal fits the challenge quite well, although it is more suitable for voters in particular, who do not get remunerated as well as dReps will, unless they are whales. The current Vrooli website looks good, but does not yet have the standard that would really allow complex, blockchain-development or community projects to be shared via its diagrams, flowcharts and visualizations, and it may make sense to prototype this idea first with a more limited scope. To cater to the extremely broad and deep background and diversity of proposals, some of them mainly using external links or videos to explain already, could be a very tall order without testing the ideas first in a less ambitious setting.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This project is an indirect extension of F6: DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox: Community-Made Interactive Guides and it would have been useful to know whether this project has been closed-out successfully and what the take-aways for this project might be.\nThe budget is mainly for the proposer's own work at a very reasonable hourly rate of $45 for 20 hours per week and over 16 weeks. I do not recommend working on a task like this alone. Not that it cannot be done, but it would help tremendously to tap into the higher creativity and unexpected directions that human collaboration will produce, and visualization of IdeaScale proposals will be such a fiendishly difficult task that needs all the Eureka moments you can get. The milestones itself look realistic, but a lot more time might have to be spent on research and ideation to make the finished product satisfactory for the high and exacting standards of the ever-growing community. \nThe proposer is a full-stack developer but some more information about the tools used and work experience would have been welcome.\nOtherwise, this proposal is sufficiently wordy and does not use a lot of visualizations which may have been a fun way to attract more eyeballs and make a more convincing case for the uniqueness and quality of the product.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Vrooli platform allows tracking of its users so performance metrics should be easy to get. It would have been nice to disentangle the dReps users from other users of the platform, which I guess should also be easy. Just nice to get this mentioned specifically.

This is clear enough, but more could have been presented in terms of measuring the quality and user satisfaction of the end result, like a survey or likes, shares, stars, It will be difficult to establish a baseline as the dReps project is brand new and there will likely no be enough data to compare it to previous rounds or users who do not use the tool.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2687", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Introduce easy-to-build visualizations and quantifiable metrics to supplement/replace most of the text of a proposal.", "experience": "I'm a full-stack software developer with ten years of experience, and also a 1st cohort Plutus Pioneer."}
