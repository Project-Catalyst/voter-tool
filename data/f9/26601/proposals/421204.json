I find this proposal to be very well within the challenge parameters as well as have a positive impact on the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem. As probably the participation in the voting process is quite low, especially due to the English barrier, having these events and workshops would engage a larger number of community members to delegate their voting power. Probably a large percentage of holders would participate more if they were to have the time, the language and technical knowledge to analyse proposals and vote for them.\nFor a better impact, I think the team should have been more specific when mentioning \u201cThe proposal seeks to host online and physical events to create awareness\u201d, as the African continent is too large to not clearly define the location and the language of these physical events will be held in.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team has devised a solid plan for the implementation of the proposal.

There is adequate information about every member of the team, and each has provided a Linkedin account profile. From what I could gather, they seem to be very competent, and as such, I have no doubts about their capability to implement the proposal.\nAnother missing piece of information that should have been answered, as required and detailed in the submission form, was some details regarding the proposer\u2019s other submitted proposals in Fund 9, as they provided a positive answer to the specified question.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs offered for tracking the progress look reasonable to me.

What I most like in this section, is one of the sentences describing the vision of success \u201cas the number of people understanding and participating in dRep and contributing to quality decision-making and increased awareness of dReps\u201d. To me, that shows that the team understands the importance of dReps and doesn\u2019t want to only achieve high numbers to have another item checked on a list, but they intend to build quality relations with passionate people, for the betterment of the community.

The proposal was successful, however, I would like to have some suggestions with the solutions presented below, please refer to the proposed group for further reference,\n  * the first letter of the group has not yet provided documents on how to obtain summary statistics of the results of qualified proposals and PA assessments, this is to serve the conditions of selecting proposals for election , and also increase the dReps reputation of the founding group, and create a premise for the community to trust it,\n   * second the group needs to be more explicit about this statement: \"Recommend finding ways to organize online and physical events to create awareness.\"\" for example: how the group can invite them members communities in Africa attend the events the group proposes to organize, and more the team needs to provide for this proposal with statistics on where Africa would rank in terms of the number of members owning ADA , this is the basic condition to be able to vote.\n  internet connection risk, has been thoroughly rectified by the team, but I still see there could be a possible risk: if your dReps hasn't gained reputation recognition in the short term then Why, because I see that the group has not had a specific plan for what will most effectively attract trust from the African community. the above are all my suggestions hope the proposed team welcomes it.\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"This is community development, so I think the team can proactively do the initial communication before starting to do it, but don't have to wait until it is funded to start doing it, if the group takes the initiative first.

In that regard, this initiative is best fit to address the drep improvement challenge. In view of the huge community base of the Cardano ecosystem, it is obvious this platform could greatly help to demystify any misperception and misrepresentation associated with the role. Ultimately, the drep improvement challenge setting seeks to increase the participation in the drep role from the community. Therefore, I am confident in the value proposition this initiative offers in helping scale up the participation in this role. This initiative is specially designed not only to create awareness but to also galvanize community support that ensure the onboarding of community members into the Cardano ecosystem. My overall impression here is that, the community can anticipate better decisions on proposals based on the effort of initiative like this. However, because the team is not coming back for funds, it presumes that this is a one time event? If not, what\u2019s the long term plan of this project? Ideally, the team could have presented more details here. Again, how would the team attract its audience? I suggest the team adopt social media platforms to reach out to voters within the community for such event.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proponent presents a team profile with attached links that supports the expertise and experience of the team. From the profile, we see a detailed information of the team\u2019s experience in both the traditional work field and the Cardano ecosystem. Certainly, the nature of this project requires the experience and expertise of long standing members of the Cardano ecosystem. More importantly, the proponent has assigned roles to each team member which could ease the implementation of the project. Hence the team is well positioned to execute the project. Aside that, I think the roadmap Is well framed to complement the effort of the team. The roadmap details specific timelines for each event outlined within the roadmap. This tells us how the project would proceed along the line to implementation. Finally, on the budget allocation, I think the proposer provides a clear budget breakdown that details how much each identifiable item would cost. My only problem here is that, the amount allocated for venue and online subscription is on the high side. I suggest the team readjust that part of the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Taking into account the overall view of the project, I think the project description and the feasibility shows a clear approach to achieve the end goal of this project.

These parameters include the number of dreps participation, the number of people educated on drep and a few others. In my opinion, these are relevant and accurate parameters to monitor the performance of the project. But, how do the community get access to the information on these parameters?

This would undoubtedly be helpful because it would provide the less active voter an opportunity to continue being heard, albeit across a wider range of proposals than they could individually read and assess. These dReps will cast votes on the vast majority of Project Catalyst proposals, which will improve the caliber of decisions made inside each Fund. It is great news for the entire Cardano community that the Cardano ecosystem is still growing. However, exponential expansion poses a challenge. The community's obligation to scrutinize and decide on proposals grows along with the number of them. The development of dReps and raising voter knowledge in Africa are necessary to maintain sustainability and address the issue of the low participation rate in catalyst voting. This will help ensure that all proposals receive the attention they deserve and will facilitate continuing growth.\nThis project is without a doubt incredibly important and promising, thus it meets the criteria set forth in this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears to be very competent, and they are undoubtedly qualified to complete the project successfully.

This I think is directive and inline with the general objectives of the challenge. I would say that the proposal therefore identifies a problem within the challenge which needs to be solved because, the successful implementation of the proposal will  help for quality decision-making during voting and reduce if not totally alleviate the low level of awareness in Africa. This would help to vote for quality and good proposals as well as provide a better pool for a reward and to breakdown the comprehension of individuals to enable increased participation. This is an evidence that the proposal  clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and address future challenges as well. However my only concern is that,per the little knowledge I have about voters, one cannot automatically register as a voter unless they have a minimum amount of about $500 in thier wallet,lest,the individual would have to first register as a CA and kick start from there untill they are rewarded in ASSESSMENT participation which will help them move to become a voter. I'm saying this because ,a novice in the ecosystem may not have any idea about this and may wander how the project will be beneficial to them and for the community.

I think the budget allocation can be further broken down a bit and the budget itself reduced slightly. $11000 for a project like this is a bit limited in comparison to the exchange rate available in the country.Also there is a good consideration in the risk and  challenges that may be encountered  and a substantive remedy has been provided to curb it.

I will suggest that the team makes an effort to make such information easily accessible in so that, their transparency would be clearly considered. My suggestion is that ,they can do this by providing the data collected in the form of a PowerPoint presentation,word documwmt,etc and presented to any of the communication channels in the community.

In my view, this proposal positively will help give the Cardano ecosystem by helping to bring as many people unto the dRep scheme which in effect will help raise the participation rate in the Catalyst voting.
