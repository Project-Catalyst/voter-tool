Similarly, the proposal intends to measure the accuracy of delegate decisions and would be improved by explaining the metrics and process to achieve this goal. The proposals\u2019 objectives would certainly add value to the ecosystem as the community would benefit from a realization of these goals.

The references to the Swarm activities also serve as a useful template or model of how this proposal intents to operate.  The budget is broken into a number of different line items, and represents 13% of the challenge budget. The only reason to rate this section as 4-stars rather than 5-stars was due to the lack of information regarding the mentioned bounty incentivization system.

In this respect they have provided a sufficient answer to the requirement from the PA guide for an accessible public channel used to deliver regular updates.  The contribution tracker and KPIs seem to be well thought out. The only thing missing from the metric, and causing the loss of one star, is that the metrics don\u2019t relate to the challenge brief.

As a result, many proposals have missed financing because they were unable to provide convincing proof in writing. The author suggests removing this obstacle by giving proposers a portal where they may post regular updates and video footage attempting to explain to the community and voters what they intend to achieve. We can observe that teams with a track record of success are given priority, whereas newcomers are losing interest as a result of numerous failed investment rounds. Perhaps a solution like this guild will provide them an equal opportunity to present their thoughts. The adoption of Cardano will undoubtedly increase if newcomers have help from the start. The community may use this service to check on the status of initiatives that have previously received funding. The community might standardize the application and mandate that projects submit frequent updates. Nevertheless, the concept in its current form alone might have a significant impact on the ecosystem, regardless of future capabilities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is supported by a succinct action plan. The project proposer gives the community a general notion of what to expect as the project is implemented. However, the strategy is self-explanatory because each phase has specific milestones and deliverables. However, the sought funding is quite substantial, and the proposal's credibility is not being aided by the breakdown's guesstimation; perhaps a much more thorough breakdown would have been helpful. The principal developer, Peter Wolcott, is the only person mentioned by the author; the rest of the team's members are not mentioned at all. As a result, I find it a little challenging to draw any conclusions about the proposal's viability based on the few data that are available. However, it can be seen that the SWARM team has seen some degree of success in earlier rounds and is still engaged in the development of a few new ones this time around, making them reliable and trustworthy. Therefore, granting the benefit of the doubt, I would like to tentatively concur with that at this time.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed measurements are very closely in line with the specifications of the challenge. The most useful metric for measuring success is undoubtedly the level of notoriety the tool generates for itself. The level of contributor engagement measured by meetings and group calls is another measurable bonus. The auditors can use the trustworthy GitHub repository, documentation, and contribution tracker to monitor the development of the proposal. Weekend 24-Hour Stream of Choice Catalyst The proposal's content will ultimately reveal whether it was successful and whether users liked it. I believe the auditing procedure should be simpler and the community would be able to produce sufficient evidence regarding the proposal's success because the team has generated money for their endeavors in the past. Although SWARM is a well-established community, I believe the proposer could have differentiated their proposal from others by offering the community a few more distinctive success measures.
