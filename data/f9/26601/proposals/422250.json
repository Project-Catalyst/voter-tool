C4C is a large and diverse community, so there is a lot of room for disagreement on what to vote for - and although using \"sociocratic principles of consent\", and seeking consensus within a range of tolerance, is a sound approach if there is already a degree of alignment amongst the people involved, it is less effective where there is not already some alignment. Of course, the group are aligned on climate issues specifically - but as there are unlikely to be that many directly climate-related proposals in a fund, the group will inevitably find itself needing to work with issues outside of climate, on which there could be a wide divergence of views, and it might be difficult to reach agreement without silencing minority voices. This is often what happens when a single-issue pressure group begins to try to align outside of its core issue of concern, and many political and campaigning movements have been split or disrupted this way; so, as a longtime activist who has observed this often, I see this issue of \"what if people can't reach agreement\" as a bigger risk than the proposal's risk-assessment seems to. \n\nNevertheless, the proposal's impact is basically solid. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget is simple, but it is probably well enough broken down for a simple and low-budget proposal such as this. However, projects like this do need quite a lot of facilitation and project management, and I think the budget for these elements is a little underestimated at \u00a31,000 per month.  \n\nThe project plan itself is a little vague, and short on targets - for example, in Q4, how many community members does the project aim to involve? Without some idea of what the team is aiming for, it's hard to know for sure how feasible it is - although they do mention under \"auditability\" the target of 60 proposals being voted on, which is helpful to get a sense of the intended scope of the project. 60 does seem like a lot of proposals for a large and diverse group to discuss in a meaningful way - it's a lot even for a small core group, when you consider that currently, many PAs spend a day reviewing proposals and only get through 2 or 3 in an entire day, and that without the additional time needed to discuss with anyone else. So this could mean upwards of 30 meetings to cover 60 proposals, which is quite a lot of engagement to sustain. I'd be interested to know if the intention is for the community members to drop in and out, or to have a more sustained engagement over the length of the project, as the approach to this would affect how feasible I think the work is. (For example, a constantly-changing group can be slower, as new people catch up and learn - but a more fixed group will often get a bit tired of it all after 25 or 30 sessions, and engagement will often dwindle). \n\nI'd also like to see a little more information about what sort of tasks the team envisage being incentivised using Dework bounties; because while the Dework approach does inevitably tend towards breaking something up into small, piecemeal tasks, much of the the work here seems quite hard to atomise and doesn't feel like it would lend itself to Dework's \"piece-work\" approach. It feels like it could end up with community members incentivised for attending meetings, but all the real decisions being made by a small core team. This is probably not the aim, but I am not clear from the plan whether there is a process to encourage people to move from merely showing up at meetings, to actually being part of the core team. \n\nIt also raises the issue of who is delivering the project - in the \"who is your team\" section, the whole C4C community is described, but in practice, this project will be delivered by the core team which will be developed at the start; so without knowing anything about who they will be, it is hard to fully assess feasibility. \n\nHowever, all these things are fairly minor, and the project does look basically feasible - and it's great that what happens will be documented so that as a community we can learn from it.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It looks like some of the \"auditability\" metrics have accidentally been put in the \"will you return for further funding?\" section - so I'm assuming those bullet points are part of the auditability of the proposal. Together with the other information given in the auditability section, the propsal is very trackable and easy to audit. For all that I'm unconvinced about Dework bounties as a means of real community engagement, they are certainly very trackable and transparent; and it's great that C4C already has all the tracking mechanisms that they want to use, including GitHub, already set up and working. I would perhaps like to have seen a link to \"Littlefish Foundation's process of Actions\" which is mentioned, or a little more explanation of what that is - but even without it, there are enough possibilities to measure and audit what the project is achieving.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2343", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2860, "q0": "\"hey proposal team, your idea is great. with this approach you are perfectly suited to the required challenge, and your solutions, though simple, can have a big impact attracting many more. dReps, however I have a few suggestions for how the proposed solution below looks like:\n\n  the group wanted to create Cardano4Climate with over 250 existing members to become a dReps, organize the community to recruit more members, discuss related content, propose recommendations, and PA reviews to serve community outcome service, however, the group can provide additional conditions of the community you have, do they own ADA, if so, they can participate in trusting you to vote, and the purpose The main goal of the current proposal group is to have relevant knowledge about dReps, like this, I will show the group a way to optimize the time to find and synthesize related documents: the way of I will introduce you to another group of proposals that will provide documentation related to dReps, in addition they will have aggregate statistics on proposals with a summary of the topic of the proposal. , and PA assessments, you can rely on those documents to refer to and choose for your community's votes. moreover, your community mentioned will come from many different countries so they will also provide some native languages \u200b\u200bof those countries, so that proposed group will fully meet the requirements. what you're looking for, and here's the link to it: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414969 , good luck.\n     \n   there are a lot of risks seen by the team mostly because of the fear of not accepting this idea and they have not considered the importance of dReps, but the team has measures to optimize them. other than that, this proposal is focused on growing the awareness community about dReps, and has nothing to do with technology so there's not much of a risk to worry about,\" he said.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"This is a community development work, so there will be very few difficulties in the progress of the work, but in the budget part, what will the project management part include and the community incentives are What incentives have not been mentioned by the group in the solutions presented in the presentation, in addition, the technical reserve fund will be related to what development technology and if during the implementation of the proposal, without What will the group use this reserve fund for, it is very necessary to explain the above issues to ensure financial transparency with the community, in general, in my condition, this is really feasible.
