This proposal will encourage participants to take the Harvard Implicit Association Test to provide their awareness of their personal level of bias. They will later share and reflect on this unique experience to practice and reinforce the lessons learned. These training resources will be available (at will) for the whole community and encouraged for elected dReps. Upon completion, members will have a verfied CNFT ad DID verified credential. The proposal fits the dRep improvement and Onboarding challenge quite well as it helps to encourage deligation participation rate and the tool might aid dRep to vote without biasness. The team does not explain why the Harvard Implicit Association Test is selected for participants in their program and it is unclear how this test will help to promote the equity and empathy. There is no link provided for the test but this Harvard Implicit Association Test is the way to realize unconscious bias. There is no proof of the test benefit and among many resources in the community, it might be a challenge for ones to take the test and to go through the exercise. However, the team explains the possible ways to sort out the issues in case of low participation.

The detailed budget breakdown covers the equity/unconscious bias experts however, the role of experts are not included in their detailed plan but the pay rate for these experts are at $200/hour. It leaves me the question as to which phase they are involved with this project in the timeline.

They will know that they are successful in their mission with % of catalyst voting population is more informed in combating bias.

As the proposal objective should be focusing on dRep improvement and onboarding but the metrics for this project is from the pool of active users (both dReps and non-dReps). The proposer team might need to inform back to the community after launching the dRep equity resource hub, how many participants are joining the hub and how many are active users of the platform for their bias training. Those might be more relevant metrics than the pool of active users as claimed by this proposal.

Just a small component meant to reveal (often surprisingly) one\u2019s own biases, the Harvard Implicit Association test will be incorporated to a much larger implementation of knowledge and reflection that the assessor may not realize.   \n\nBased on the comment: \u201cThe detailed budget breakdown covers the equity/unconscious bias experts however, the role of experts are not included in their detailed plan but the pay rate for these experts are at $200/hour.

The assessor may be making an assumption that the heristic team would not participate in the entire project, despite co-authoring and writing this proposal, and expects to deliver on it as project managers at every step. \n\nThe assessor may not have understood that communications campaigns described in the risk assessment portion of the proposal would include metrics such as \u201c\u201chow many participants are joining the hub and how many are active users of the platform for their bias training,\u201d delineating adoption of users, both dRep specifically and the larger community. \n"}, {"id": 5692, "q0": "The objective of achieving diversity of Dreps remain far from been achieved as far as I know. However, per my review of this project, I consider this project, a more inclusive and well structured approach towards addressing the challenge of diversity of Dreps. \u201cThe goal of the Equity Resource Hub will be to educate members of Catalyst on the topics of bias and equity; and to provide additional tools, activities, and resources to grow one\u2019s knowledge of cognitive fallacies.\u201d In respect of that, the team intends to engage and empower members on inclusiveness, so as to reduce biases by using workshops and virtual learning with the assistance of tools, activities, and resources to grow one\u2019s awareness of cognitive biases. What\u2019s the value addition to the Cardano ecosystem? Obviously, this initiative is aligned with the objective of the dRep improvement challenge setting of ensuring drep diversity. Again, this creates an avenue for knowledge acquisition to any individual new to the catalyst community and to the drep role. However, since the emphasis here is on preventing biases, what\u2019s  the team\u2019s strategy to make the platform  more language friendly, considering the biases to the English language? I suggest the team addresses this to enhance the overall framework of the project. Again, is there a marketing strategy? Well, it is a great attempt by the team to recognize or anticipate possible lack of interest as a risk and therefore outlines a clear marketing strategy to address it. However, aside the acquisition of certificates after each training,\n I prefer the team consider monetary learning incentive to attract more people to the project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Certainly, it is likely that this project would be implemented successfully considering the  available information provided on the roadmap, the team and budget of the project. From my analysis of the team experience, I see a comprehensive team composition of diverse people with backgrounds in various field of expertise. Clearly, this is a solid team with expertise and experience that would be relevant to the project. To confirm their transparency and professionalism towards achieving the goals set out for this project, the team supports their profile with all the appropriate links for any verification on their competence and expertise. Again, to complement the team experience, the proponent presents a detailed breakdown of activities to be undertaken along the roadmap to project completion. This comes with specific timeframes that demarcates when each activity would be done. At least per the structure, we know which activity start and which ends. More importantly, the proposer presents a  comprehensive and precise budget breakdown with specific allocation to each individual item. Are these prices accurate and moderate? Per my understanding of the market value of these items, I think the items are consistent with the prevailing market prices.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As part of confirming their transparency and the accountability to the Cardano community , the proponent has I indicated the team\u2019s readiness to make all report and feedback available to the community via town hall meetings and SWARM. Per the script, the  proposer has made available all relevant information for auditing. The detailed description of what the proposer intend to achieve with this project alongside its roadmap, shows a clear alignment with the overall objective and the KPIs provided. On how to measure the performance of the project, the proposer suggest indicators such as \u201cthe number of active users who have engaged with the Equity Resource Hub, whether instances of conversation around equity are on the rise and whether people are open to sharing their experiences\u201d. With these parameters, we see a mixture of both quality and quantitative metrics which provides a clear mechanism  for monitoring and assessing the progress of the project. More especially, the proponents has assigned a 20% milestone to the quantitative KPI, just to simplify the assessment of the performance of the project. My only issue is, how would the proposer get the data on the metrics for measuring the progress and success of the project?

In theory this would increase the quality of the dReps' work, and would meet the challenge's objectives. But I think there is a lack of detail regarding what would be done in practice, it is said that the dReps would be subjected to a survey that would make it clear that everyone suffers from prejudice and from that work would be done with workshops, virtual training, etc. But we don't know exactly what content is present in the resources, for example in \"we can beg members for the exercises necessary to take control of unconscious programming and create deeper empathy\". What would these exercises look like? I think the idea is in line with the challenge, but it could be explained more deeply.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script of the proposal is not bad, but it could improve in some points. Mainly in terms of temporality, the phases have very different durations: the first from 6 to 8 weeks and the second from 3 to 4 months. It would be better if we knew what would happen each month specifically. The budget is explained ok, the parts could be more detailed \u2013 for example the amount of 15 thousand dollars requested especially for content creation. It's a high value that should be more clear. Also in \u201cvarious tools\u201d. What would they be? The team part is the best part of feasibility, we know who the team members are in great detail, and we see that for example Frank Albanese already has experience with the cryptographic world. Despite this it is not clear if anyone already has experience with Cardano itself, with our blockchain this is also important.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is auditable, in terms of progress we have good assurance that the Cardano community will have constant updates on what is being done: it is said that online meetings will be held after the town halls at least once a month. We also have partial success metrics, that is, we know what would be debated in those moments. Speaking of ultimate success, we know what is expected: \u201cclarifying prejudice to influence harm reduction for those traditionally marginalized by prejudice\u201d. But how can we be sure that the community has absorbed the project well and is making a correct and effective use of this knowledge? In my view, one more observation was in order, a further research with quantitative and qualitative data to prove the practical effects of this initiative. In general we have clear ways of monitoring the project, although some improvements are interesting.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15180, "q0": "The team wants to design and implement an Equity Resource Hub for dReps to educate and raise awareness regarding unintentional bias when serving a diverse community.
