If we want to migrate more projects to Cardano, this should be the first step, always educate people and keep them informed.

Also the number of people engaged with their media channel would be a good point of view to see the success of the proposal.\n\nOne minor thing lacking in the proposal is that, I don't see how the team reaching out Ethereum community, as one needs to understand the drawbacks of EVM-based blockchain to make valid and precise caricatures, therefore both side of the community, EVM-based and Cardano should be reached out, and survey their own members' opinions.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2362", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4928, "q0": "This proposal is a creative, out-of-the-box approach to onboarding developers, building on past work already developed in the Cardano cartoon sphere.

For future iterations, perhaps a minimum threshold of quantifiable success metrics (ie aiming for minimum 500 retweets of each cartoon, 100 engagements, 1000 likes, etc., aiming specifically for twitter profiles of the Ethereum/EVM-compatible chain communities) would be interesting to compare success against.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2636", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5093, "q0": "This is a $10,500 proposal to design Caricatures in part brainstormed from After Town Hall meetings and publicize them for three months in an effort to draw folks from other EVM chains to Cardano.

The artist Shlomo is not just addressing the individuals but also the projects. His Success Statement demonstrates he is focusing on projects (one of the key targets of the Challenge) with- What does success look like? \"Projects who were either planning to or did launch on an EVM-based blockchain deploy in the Cardano ecosystem and can do so easily\".\n------------------------------------------------\nAt first my impression was that the use of his Caricatures and public relations thrust would only reach out to individuals which is not what the Challenge is asking for. Doing some research and reading on the use of Caricatures in political campaigns and during wars (when typically, there are great migrations) I was impressed by how powerful a properly constructed public relation campaign can be. \n--------------------------------------------------\nAfter assessing this proposal for the potential Impact and whether it effectively addresses the challenge I rate this a 4 (agree) star for doing so.\n\n ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility assessment for the quality of Shlomos art and the examples of his Caricatures was an easy proposition.

To convey information through caricatures will not be easy for those who are not familiar with blockchain that will not attract many people, but the Ethereum community will need more information to highlight the advantages of Cardano. . what concepts, topics, or areas (basic, complex) will be featured in the cartoon other than the information provided by the proponent (topics may include gas fees, carbon emissions, the community has purpose and unit).

The script is an integral part of understanding the whole thing because through it the idea is to visualize the process, the filming plan includes what will be filmed, the shots, the locations, and the actors. , audiovisual experts, etc...). The proposed budget is broken down by the tasks to be done in 3 months, and some expenses need to be more detailed because I think it is not enough to do it (ex: Weekly Cartoon x 12 weeks x x) 500 USD = 6000 USD) as I mentioned above, when there is a clear script, it will know the tasks and human time needed to perform, then calculate the reasonable cost to create a quality cartoon.

Marketing should be simple and anyone should be able to understand the merits of Cardano which is inline with the vision by the proposer of creating content that can be easily digested and understood by end users. \n\nHowever, the current focus for the great migration would be on the developer and builders. Builders have a different appetite and consume more in-depth long form content. In order to convert them we would require more in-depth content - research pieces, analytics and code documentation.

The marketing budget of $125 per post seems to be on the lower end, which is inline with less focus on marketing. The sustainability of the project is also questionable, old content that hits the market will lose popularity and will no longer be useful, we would need to keep presenting new content for it to make an impact.

The second big obstacle would be tracking if the audience is Ethereum based or cardano, it is highly possible to reach 1M views but it remains in the cardano community primarily instead of Ethereum.\n\nThe goal of the campaign has to be more clearly defined as spreading awareness or onboarding users to Cardano. If it\u2019s the latter, we would need to track engagement based KPIs such as Likes, RT, website visits etc. The best course of action would to market it as reach based campaign and maximise reach, however that would not be in the scope of the Great Migration grant.\n\nThe project can be easily audited with key KPI numbers taken from twitter analytics or google analytics on a weekly basis, this can be presented with Benchmark numbers from other Cardano based projects.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3875", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "A weekly caricature showing the advantages & relevancy of Cardano over Ethereum, to reach out the Ethereum community in a fun & creative way", "experience": "40 years of experience making daily political cartoons for newspapers, in the largest/most read newspaper in Israel (Israel Hayom) , won multiple awards, NFT designer\nFunded proposer for Fund 8 on similar proposals :\nCARICATOR ADA\u00a0\nUnited Caricature"}
