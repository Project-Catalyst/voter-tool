As a result, I believe that integrating to form a common wallet is critical to allowing ETH blockchain users to easily perform transactions on the Cardano blockchain. Along with that comes the option of remaining on the currently unstable ETH blockchain or migrating to a more stable blockchain like Cardano, which has resulted in a large number of developers wanting to migrate from ETH to Cardano.\nThis proposal, in my opinion, is primarily aimed at non-technical users.

The process involves creating several wallets, creating wallet connections using bridges, and a certain degree of technical know-how. The project wants to address this problem by slimming down the process to one multi-chain wallet and one connecting bridge. This will make the process of transferring assets from Ethereum to Cardano much more user-friendly and simple. NuFi wants to automate the whole process, the user enters an existing Ethereum wallet into NuFi and right after that the Milkomeda and Cardano wallets are automatically created, along with a bridge that connects the whole process. The value for the user is that they have the history of all transactions in one place, they have an overview, and the process is not difficult for them, so even a less tech-savvy user can work in this environment. The user also saves a lot of time and energy by having the processes do the steps automatically for him. The added value for the Cardano ecosystem is that the transfer from Ethereum will be easier, more secure and faster. The proponent also states that this process can be applied to other blockchains and thus this project is scalable.  The proponent recognizes that unless the processes are easy and intuitive, there is a risk of user churn and based on this argument, this proposal is built. The team realizes that this is a big project and could go over budget but at the same time honestly adds that NuFi has its own resources and is willing to provide funding for this project in order to make it successful even. Alongside this, it is implicit in the design that customer support is always available should a problem arise. My overall impression of this project is that Cardano can benefit greatly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is spread over 4 months of support, with the first month addressing the ERC-20 converter, the second month the Ethereum dapp connectors and Metamask, the third month Milkomeda relative to the previous ones, and the fourth month UX and support for assets other than ERC-20. The budget is very detailed and comprehensive, it makes it clear how much an hour of time of a certain activity costs, how much time is needed to implement a specific function of a specific process. Although the project asks for $97,600 but the value Cardano will receive is in my opinion greater than this amount. The team is made up of people who have successfully completed projects related to AdaLite, Yoroi, Ledger, Vault and others within Cardano development. From this it is obvious that this is a reliable and experienced team. The proposal contains enough information about the work history of the team members which we can see on Linked-in.

Both Cardano and Ethereum have completely different underlying technology architect. Cardano uses Haskell programming language for coding whereas Ethereum code is build using Solidity. Ethereum uses account based model to process and record transaction whereas Cardano on the other hand uses extended UTXO model. Due to the differences in the underlying architect used by both of these networks, they require totally different kind of technical skill to develop dApps or supporting infrastructure like wallets for these two networks. If an Ethereum based project migrates to Cardano, it becomes difficult for its user to also migrate to Cardano due to the complexity involved in migrating assets from Ethereum to Cardano blockchain. Not only that, they also have to install multiple wallets as no single wallet supports both these chains. \n\nTo address this challenge, the proposal is trying to develop a multichain wallet called NuFI which can be used to access all 3 blockchains viz Ethereum, Milkomeda and Cardano. Using this wallet, users can easily transfer their assets from Ethereum to Cardano in just 2 clicks. They are also planning to reduce this to just one click once the advanced features for cross chain compatibility being developed by Lagon bridge are complete. Moreover the wallet will allow users to access dApps on both Cardano and Ethereum so they don\u2019t have to switch between different wallets.\n\nThis wallet can be game changer in respect of attracting new users from Ethereum to Cardano. With the plans of the team to extend this support to other EVM compatible chains in the coming future, it might be able to migrate users from other EVM compatible as well as Ethereum L2 chains to our ecosystem.

This solution can overcome so many barriers that (I am strongly convinced) are actually stopping people to migrate. The icing on the cake is of course the possible future integrations of another chains.
