The final goal is to have 8 projects migrate, or at least created the ETH-ADA interoperability, by Q1 2024. If this really happens, it would be a great achievement for this proposal. Even though the proposers don\u2019t set any kind of requirements for these projects, for e.g. monthly revenue, so we could measure the impact of this migration, it is still valuable. The description of the solution is good and clear, although I\u2019d like to see more details there, but at the same time I can see this working as a taylor made solution to each one of the selected projects, so a high-level explanation is good enough. The proposal is very well aligned with the challenge since it\u2019s goal is just what the challenge asks for: migrate projects from Ethereum to Cardano. If properly executed and good projects accept to participate on it, then it will bring a lot of value to the Cardano ecosystem. The KPIs provided to measure the success of the project are good and appropriate, since they are not only going to measure the amount of project but also the value related to the FTs and NFTs included in this process. I don\u2019t see this proposal as easily scalable, since the solution depends on the CNFT Alliance team and this is not their main commitment, what could be solved with the creation of a specific group focused on this.

Even though only names are provided in the proposal itself, in the CNFT Alliance website it is possible to find the LinkedIn of all members. The proposal doesn\u2019t state clearly who is going to work on this proposal but is quantifies the time required by each task. The budget description is good enough, because it would be very difficult to come up with a very detailed budget in this case where the implementation will depend a lot on which projects participated on this proposal. They added 400 hours of programming hours, and if they want to migrate 8 projects, that\u2019s 50h per project, which is approximately one week of work fulltime. From my perspective, that might not be enough to migrate some projects depending on their complexity but might work for most of them. There\u2019s no detailed roadmap, just milestones for the next quarters, which is ok, but it would be even better to have some more details about the tasks they want to execute with every project, some kind of template or blueprint.

The KPIs for the success of the proposals are clear, and they might be a good way to measure to progress of the execution of the proposal itself as well if they approach one project at a time.

Their experience compliments each other immensely pleasingly in regards to their goal. \n\nTheir team plans to migrate other projects from ETH to Cardano through 3 phases, these phases are time-oriented; Q3 of 2022, Q4 of 2022, and Q1 of 2023. In the first phase the team plans to complete the onboarding of the team, start their marketing to Ethereum projects, and initiate migration through ERC-20 converters or other means. As for their second phase, the team hopes that they would have successfully migrated 2 projects to Cardano at the very least, persist with their marketing, and initiate marketing to other EVM-compatible Blockchains. Finally, in phase 3, the team plans to continue with their marketing to EVM-compatible blockchain projects, standardized methodologies for migration, and have 8 projects migrated to Cardano. The team has a decent plan for marketing and as stated they have a strong team that can assist with the onboarding and migration. The main concern would be their marketing strength, all will be futile if they fail to attract new projects to the Cardano ecosystem. It is suggested they put a heavy emphasis on marketing and have various times of marketing, social media, AMAs, education videos, and many more. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In regards to the audit of the progress, the team has provided that the main mean of progress would be the number of projects that they have in process of migration or that have successfully migrated and the amount of value (ADA, ETH, or USD) that has been migrated onto the Cardano chain. All these are decent means to audit the progress, however, the team can also have a signup sheet given to the community that illustrates the number of projects that are interested in the migration. \n\nIn regards to the audit of the success of said proposal, the team stated that this can be audited though their timeline milestone. As the team expected 2 and 8 fully migrated projects over to Cardano by Q4 of 2022 and Q1 of 2023, respectively. This approach includes assessing the success of the proposal as those are the target set by the team and if said targets are reached then the team would have succeeded in their proposal.

They have the skill, and the know how to help transfer existing projects or up and coming projects over to the Cardano blockchain. \n\nOn the other hand, this will also be a challenging goal of the project. Funding will help tremendously in their efforts, but reaching out to projects on Ethereum and other blockchains may present a serious obstacle in getting people to migrate over. \n\nIn the end, I believe, based on this proposal, that they can be very successful in addressing migration in due time, but that it will indeed take time.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has laid out an outstanding roadmap (milestones) in this proposal. The proposer has also laid out who is on the team (with plans to onboard more team members) and provided linkedin links to every current member of the team and there is some great information on each one of the team members letting us all know that they have the knowledge base and education to make this proposal successful. \n\nThe only issue I see in this proposal is how challenging it will be to get current projects on other chains to make the decision to move over to our Cardano blockchain. I do see in their milestones where they do plan to do marketing and outreach, and I do believe they will be successful in time, but I would like to have seen a bit more information around marketing and reaching out to other projects on other blockchains.\n\nFinally, I think it would be fairly easy and straightforward to get projects that are just getting started in the planning stages to easily consider swapping to Cardano before they every get started on another blockchain. This is one area I would like the team in this proposal to consider heavily. \n\nHow might you go about locating, finding, and contacting projects that are up and coming and get in touch with them before they get going on a blockchain regardless of what chain they are thinking about using.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The easiest way to track the progress of this proposal will be by how many projects they actually get to migrate over!

I would have liked for the proposer to have a least mentioned how they plan to present these metrics to the public, or if these would be privately held by Fluxus. My assumption is the would make these available to the public, and if that is the case, it would have been wonderful for the proposer to list where and how they would make these metrics available.\n\nNevertheless, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.

The Pluxus NFT team is committed to using \u201cknowledge, time, and ability\u201d to provide specialized attention and resources\u201d to facilitate the smooth migration of NFT projects from the Ethereum blockchain to Cardano through via their Plusus NFT gateway. I agree with the author's argument. Currently, our Cardano ecosystem lacks a dedicated team that is willing to provide specific methodology, technical resources, and support tools to promote the interoperability of the NFT ecosystem between the Cardano blockchain and Ethereum. This not only helps to remove specific transition barriers in terms of resources, costs, technology, etc., but also helps project owners increase their motivation and feel more comfortable when making the decision to move change. Here, the authors also foresee some risks associated with the success of the proposal. That is, the funding source and readiness of the Ethereum project to migrate. Personally, I think, the real bottleneck of this problem lies in reducing the psychological barriers of NFT project owners when making the decision to move, rather than technical difficulties, finance of the migration process. We have Catalyst to provide capital funding for projects wishing to migrate to Cardano, partially solving the financial barrier. However, we really need an in-depth support team, searching for potential NFT transformation projects, comprehensive support throughout the decision-making process of the project owner, until the actual conversion. successful happening. Of course, this is not easy. Therefore, the community expects people with enthusiasm, experience, method and ability, ready to take on the task. I appreciate the value and impact of the solution. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility assessment, the proposal's author provided a fairly detailed plan, with specific progress and milestones to be achieved. Specifically, there are 3 important milestones of the proposal, briefly: 3rd quarter of 2022 to establish a team and to market and approach NFT projects on Etherum, 4th quarter of 2022 to migrate at least 2 projects to Cardano, In the first quarter of 2023, there were 8 projects moving from Etherum. I like clear target numbers like this. This is what we the Cardano community expect when a proposal is put up for a funding vote. However, I would expect the author to be able to add data on the migration value in USD, the number of users transferred into the Cardano ecosystem through Pluxus over the above quarterly timeline. The budget of the proposal is divided into 3 categories: coding, marketing/outreach, project management. The unit price is divided by the hour. Particularly for the marketing section, the approach lacks the unit price * the quantity included. Also, I wonder if the authors have really taken into account the slide in ADA's price due to bear market volatility, when Catalyst-issued capital is allocated using ADA. Not to mention, the authors did not mention clearly, how many employees are needed for each item? What is the average allocation cost for each calculated migration project? These parameters will help the community better assess whether the budget is reasonable and adequate. Regarding the team, I consulted the link that team provided (https://cnftalliance.org/) and linked to 9 personnel profiles in the team. The team has launched game products in the Cardano space such as: PlayerMint, AdaQuest, Flooftopia\u2026 I think the team has enough skilled and experienced personnel in the field of NFT and Gaming to complete the tasks of the team well offer.
