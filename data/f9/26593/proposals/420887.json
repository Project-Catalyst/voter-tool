In the proposal, there is a trailer provided, where we can see the mechanics of the game, such as match-3, deck building, boss fights, crafting or different challenges. The game itself is trying to distinguish from the model \u201cPlay to Earn\u201d and defines itself as \u201cPlay and Earn\u201d whilst claiming that P2E is not sustainable due to inflated supply, and they plan to solve this issue by rewarding only the top players of the game. At the same time, the number of telegram users for their international channel is approx. 14k people, which is not a small audience. Another statement in the proposal is that once Metarrior migrate to Cardano, the number of gamers and games will increase. I can relate to the number of gamers, but it is not explained how the number of games will be affected by this transition. At the same time, NFT gaming is in a downtrend for approximately 6 months, thus it would be nice to have some supporting data about their users/members, whether the impact will be as expected. Regarding the risks, the proposers state that the main risk will be to teach community to adapt to cardano fees instead of BNB fees, which I dare to disagree, and I do not really consider that as a risk. The risk will be whether they will maintain or increase the traction and inflow of users, to meet the challenge goal \u2013 migrate users. Right now, only the design of the game and its mechanics is posted, but the traction is not explained very well, therefore the impact is questionable. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposed roadmap is set to 4 months, and for each month, there is a list of deliverables/key activities to be met. I am lacking an explanation on how they actually plan to migrate from BSC to Cardano, since the game is already being developed, how much time consuming it will be, what tools, features, bridges or compilers will be used. (basically any technical specification). During the first month, it is planned that test-web-browser and test-desktop version will be released, which I find very time consuming, but what is also unclear-  is the current state \u2013 how much is already developed? What is left to be done? Next, there is a number of pictures displaying game features, NFTs, MEWA token distribution and tokenomics, how to earn, game eco system or marketing strategy \u2013 so from these points, it is obvious that the team spent a lot of time designing the game itself, and it is feasible to  develop the game. Regarding the last picture, which is displaying the flow between metarrior and gaming center \u2013 it is not clear what is meant by the gamin center, as well as DreambitCity. Although it displays nice figures, and promises a lot of traction, this could have been elaborated better. Regarding the budget, the requested amount is 80 000 USD, and this amount is divided between Community manager + marketer, Game designers, Game developers, Blockchain developers, and Web developers. For all of these, there is also a job description provided, the number of people on each job and the expected time spend. I find the detail of the budget description reasonable and it provides a good overview of where the funds go.

Regarding the KPIs, the successful launch of Metarrior is definitely a characteristic to audit the success, and their aim is to bring 3000 users to Cardano. Another metrics that are stated e.g. more people from Cardano playing Metawarrior, or successful IDO/INO are related to the success of the game itself, but the aim of the proposal is to migrate people to cardano, and these are not really auditing whether this goal was met.
