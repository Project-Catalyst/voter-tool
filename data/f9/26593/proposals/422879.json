I am withdrawing one star as the proposal in my opinion does not fall into The Great Migration (from Ethereum) but into either Developer Ecosystem or Dapps, Products and Integrations as it is a superstructure or second layer for CIP and therefore better integration and communication of Cardano and is not about improving or increasing the transfer of users or developers from Ethereum. The benefit for Cardano is indisputable as the proponent is already doing this work and the results are traceable on GitHub.  It is true that the time required to edit the CIP is increasing due to growth, while the teams that provided the editing remain the same number of members. The short-term goal is to ensure that editors are steadily rewarded for the work they do, and the long-term goal is to create a team of people dedicated purely to CIP editing and that meets the requirements of scaling of this proposal.  If it happens that the work that is declared in this proposal is not done, payment for it would not be done either, thus the risk of not delivering value is low. If for some reason the proposer is unable to continue editing, I believe that compensation can be done by finding someone, who will continue, because it\u2019s paid as a regular job. Since this is not a job that can pay for itself with other buyers, additional funding from Cardano is necessary. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The work is scheduled to be done in weeks, specifically 8 hours per week, with one hour costing $50. The budget is for one year of work, 48 weeks to be exact, paid by the month, at $1,600 per month. The work due to the CIP will be impactful at times, which assumes a higher time burden for the proposer, meaning he will be working more than 8 hours per week. Based on experience, the work is divided into normal tasks and special tasks. Normal tasks include GitHub responses, emails, communication, and CIP document code review. Specials include moderating discussions on the Cardano forums, managing communication between Cardano and mutual funds and developers, and more. The petitioner states that he is referring to a previously approved proposal from another editor who received a similar amount, declaring only 2 hours of work per week. From the experience of the proposer described in the proposal, he spends roughly an hour a day editing CIP matters, and thus, 8 hours a week seems well justified. The proposal includes relevant sources of the proposer's work history, which can be seen on GitHub, Twitter, Cardano forums, and the proposer's own website.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The work will be measured against a list of meeting attendees, taking into account comments, then against metrics when the editor is directly involved in CIP pull requests and issues. Results will be posted on the Cardano forum, CIP category, on Discord, in the CIP editors meeting category, in the community chat, on GitHub. They will make monthly reports that will be publicly available on the proposer's repository not just on GitHub, among other places. Success, according to the proponent, looks like building a solid, representative team of editors where every aspect of open standards in Cardan matches someone on the team. If successful, this project is then expected to create attraction with the Ethereum community and bring them to Cardana. This aspect is, in my opinion, highly speculative as it does not depend solely on the success of this project. It is more of a wish.

The aim of the proposal is to provide a budget for a full time editor (a person who will be documenting these processes), currently performed by the proposer. The proposer is also stating, that cardano vs eth is having approx. 10 times smaller (42 vs 458) number of proposals, which can imply a worse starting position for those who would like to start developing on Cardano. Regarding the benefits of the proposal, and to highlight some \u2013 increased adoption is expected, and also it will support decentralization.

But what can be taken from this description is that the proposer is highly competent to perform the job, and it is based on the following points. 1. He is already doing it for a while, and I have checked linked CIPs which I find in required quality both by language, and format. 2. The description of processes is even increasing the proposers competence, whilst a lot of details are provided. 3. Regarding his capabilities and skills, there is a huge amount of information such as links to his memberships, authorships, relevant experience is stated and also an old-fashioned Resume, which I find very attractive. Regarding the budget, the total amount is 19 200 USD requested, by 50 USD per hour, with approx. 1 hour per day which I find reasonable (not overstated).

For another metrics, the features of GitHub will be used such as pull requests, merges, comments, new CIPs with authorship and the proposer also plan to post monthly reports in the dedicated github.

These proposals are a main part of what makes and keeps Cardanao and other projects -Open Source. In very non-tech speak: Proposals are submitted for tweaks to the system, e.g. Github repository; someone needs to look at it, talk about it with colleagues, write it up, code it perhaps, kick it around, discuss some more and write it up for final consideration for a change to the system.  A lot of kicking the can, and a lot of responsibility, volunteer or paid.  My understanding is Robert Phair has been pretty much involved since the beginning and is one of the few early guys with the ability to access the Github.

Prior to CIPs 25 and 27 there was not a lot of quality or volume of NFTs on the Cardano block. Community members ( early fans) recognized some issues and put in some suggestions. The CIP team members ( I think all volunteers then) wrote up these two Proposals, kicked the can, sat around the coffee table, discussing and ruminating and finally something emerged that kick started an onslaught of NFT commerce.
