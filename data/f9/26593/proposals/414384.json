As described, the rehab process would be something fun that would make people interested to participate and therefore to learn how the issues that they don\u2019t know they have in Ethereum and present the solutions that Cardano already has. I believe this is a very interesting concept and might work well. Cardano is currently known for being a difficult language, without many resources, and if the proposing team can create a fun way for people get into the Cardano ecosystem, for sure this proposal would bring value to the community. The goal of the proposal is very well aligned with the challenge. Even though the focus of the proposal is on Ethereum developers and not projects or their public specifically, by bringing the developers to Cardano, projects will naturally migrate, and their public as well. Some more details about the implementation of the proposal are missing, in my opinion, since it gives some examples of what the 12 steps would look like, but without knowing exactly what\u2019s going to be included there, it\u2019s not easy to evaluate if the content provided is going to be enough to convince Ethereum developers to migrate do Cardano. Some more information about it would be desarible. Also, I\u2019m not sure if the proposal is going to do an individual guidance with Ethereum developers, or if it\u2019s going to broader and aim at a higher participation. If the latter is the choice, then how would they interact between themselves, are they going to have tasks to do, or is it just a passive course? The KPIs included in the proposal are number of posts, likes, comments and video views, which are ok to help understanding the impact, but it would be good to know how many people went through all the process and how many people actually migrate to Cardano because of this proposal, since this is the final goal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposing team is itself migrating from Ethereum to Cardano, so they have experience with this process. They are the Fractual Fuzion team, which is not personally known to me, but they provide some links to projects and other media where they are present. They have a page selling fractal NFTs and it looks like they have the technical knowledge necessary to execute this proposal, even though individuals are not mentioned here. They don\u2019t describe specifically how many people would be involved in the execution of the proposal, but they added the hours related to each task and the associated budget. The budget breakdown is good, but for me it missed one the most important things, which is written content creation. To convince an Ethereum developer to migrate to Cardano, it\u2019d be necessary to provide a lot of information and to explain them, and I believe written content, or even just scripts for the videos will be very important. Overall, the budget seems to be a bit optimistic in my opinion, $14k to create all of this might not be enough, at least with the expected impact, and there\u2019s no mention to extra funding besides this proposal. The plan is proposed only in a high level. There is some guidance regarding what would be done in the first 3 months, but the detailed steps of each part of the proposal are not present there, only general statements. It would be better to have included more details on this roadmap, and specially about the 12 steps mentioned in the proposal, since only 4 were mentioned, and this way it\u2019s not possible to really evaluate the feasibility of the proposal because of missing details about its execution. After the 3 months of execution of the proposal, it should be clear what the continuation plan is, if after all is done and executed the proposal would be closed out, or if there\u2019s a follow-up plan or tracking how many developers get converted to Cardano during the process.

There are no KPIs to keep track of the progress of the execution in the previous steps of the proposal. To improve the proposal\u2019s auditability, it would be necessary to provide more details in the roadmap, clearer tasks and KPIs that are also relevant for execution.

Although the idea seems fine, it is important to note, that it seems that the proposal is taking its basics from the actual recovery program for addicts, and from my perspective there are the following drawbacks: some people might get offended by it, and its popularity can just explode to 0. As we all know, being marked as an \u201caddict\u201d, or actually going through a rehab is not very flattering (that is why we have Anonymous group sessions), I could not find a reasoning why this proposal would gain traction, rather I assume the opposite. The goal of Cardano is to create a movement from other blockchains (in this case ETH) to Cardano blockchain, by simply providing a better environment. By displaying the negative aspects of other blockchains might be considered as an assault (we already see twitter communities arguing over way smaller topics). Also, the goal is cross chain collaboration, and being \u201crecovered\u201d actually means that ETH = bad, ADA = good, thus you are cured. Regarding the risks \u2013 I think the highest risk will be to gain traction, and actually re-define the perception of the word \u201crehab\u201d in peoples minds. I think you will have a hard time to actually connect \u201cfun\u201d and \u201crehab\u201d.

The first phase/month is devoted to actually developing the 12 step program and to prepare marketing material.

What will take more time? At least the first month could have been more detailed. Now it appears that it will be finalized during the process, and that it is not clear yet. The second phase is focused on \u201cfinding Ethereum community members in their respective online ecosystems\u201d\u2026well, makes me wonder, what does it mean? Jumping to discords and twitter groups to promote ETH rehabilitation? This part is not quite clear. Given the budget, it seems to be well thought, but when calculating the hours, it gives 234 hours which is 30 working days, thus one month and half (calculated only those where hours estimate was provided) and it makes me wonder, how many people will be actually working on these, how many of these tasks are already having some partnerships, or nothing is pre-agreed as for now? What would be the actual tasks performed by the proposer, and what will be outsourced? Is the song for eth rehab actually beneficial for the whole project? I think the budget is containing items that are not quite relevant for the online marketing and the online content.
