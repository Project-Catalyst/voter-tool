The idea is good but it partially solves this challenge, This Proposal will do the construction and management of Goguenheim to set up art residences on Cardano for up to 5 artists from Ethereum per month (for approx. three months). Each month there will be a different group of curated artists, and they will have their artwork released weekly through NFT on Cardano.

It's the #3 largest by volume, NFT ecosystem. \"Artist-in-Residence program for prominent artists from Ethereum\" maybe be a promising program, however, but the proposal doesn't specify how the program really benefit these artist beyond buying their art and marketing their art. \"In the event of low/no patronage, the Goguenheim will officially and effectively collect said artworks using funds made available by Catalyst and thereby compensate these artists anyway.\" Maybe a a detrimental strategy because if there is no demand for the artists art and supporting the artists anyway can cause temporary failure block that will eventually lead to a failure anyway. If the proposal and program will effectively can do this for \"All artworks collected by the Goguenheim will serve as a showcase of the calibre of art-based NFTs in the Cardano ecosystem at various events such as Art Basel, NFT NYC, etc.\" and be effective at marketing and organically increasing the demand for the artists' digital assets by connecting consumers and increasing awareness of the art, that would be quite impactful. \"Diversity and equality will be key tenets in artist curation as the Goguenheim will strive to be an inclusive and equitable platform for all\" are strong tenets to adhere to to attract the best talent into the ecosystem. \"It is the hope that the Goguenheim will cause the Bilbao effect needed for Cardano to shine and progress as the foremost platform for high-quality art and many other forms of NFTs on the global stage.\" Let's all hope that this comes true. Good luck team!", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The lead on the team is the \"Keynote/Panel speaker at Art and NFT events like NFT NYC.\" Being one of the \"most recent\nCoordinator of first Cardano NFT event at NFT NYC.\" This makes this work a feasible because most of the artist circles require someone on the inside who already has connections to get the higher quality art over to Cardano. Seems like the team also has clout to make this happen. The team collectively seems to be very active in the NFT world with a decent following of 100K Twitter followers and they also seem to be legit Twitter accounts. The only drawback is that we have not seen them active that much in the Cardano Twitter spaces, etc. I wished that the team that is asking for $100k would get more involved and get this in front of more people and help not just ETH NFT project but also mix and match them with Cardano NFT projects to help grow the native projects and cross enable true cross pollination. The native NFT community involvement will likely only increase the success of this since it's very supportive of each other already. For the budget I would like to see a more detailed plan especially with more details about the marketing, PR, and events. Looking at building a launchpad community for ETH NFT projects to be able to launch into Cardano from all over the chains would be impressive.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "These are the things voters should consider with respect to auditability: \"Participation from prominent art-based NFT creators.\"\n\n- What is considered a prominent art work? This is unclear but very specific. Are we talking about blue chip NFTs? They hardly need help with marketing, etc. And also don't really care about gas fees but rather revel in high gas fees and their exclusive high NFT prices.\n\n\"A steady and growing number of community turnouts for weekly drops/releases.\"\n\n- This is specific, measurable, and smart. Is this going to be available publically? How to build this community?\n\n\"Good coverage of the Cardano NFT ecosystem by various crypto media groups/publications.\"\n\n- Is there a list of publications? What qualifies as good coverage? Media and PR usually only add to the hype of a new project or serves and an update to an existing project. This strategy would be more efficient with already established projects rather than new launching projects without much traction.\n\n\"Flawless onboarding of prominent and promising artists and their peers and collectors.\"\n\n- 100% agree. Onboarding will be the most critical part of the success of this proposal. Flawless onboarding to me means that the proposer is giving a lot of priority on this critical step. I believe that probably part of this onboarding will be acceleration/incubator type help?\n\n\n\"A quantifiable measure of NFT ecosystem growth and marketplace activity for contemporary art.\"\n\n- This is specific and smart as well. I assume that when things are going well this is going to be shouted out from the rooftops, however, what about when things are not going according to plan? Is this data going to be made available publically and easily accessible?\n\n\"A larger recognition of the eco-friendly, low cost, simple and secure approach to NFTs offered by Cardano.\"\n\n- Good ending to what the proposal is trying to accomplish. My only outstanding review here is if all of this is going to be transparently be made public and also whether it is going to be made easily accessible to the community for review beyond monthly reports: \"munity in terms of active bids/offers/purchases w.r.t. Goguenheim art pieces. This data will be readily available from marketplaces.\nThe number/frequency of artist applications looking to create and exhibit their work via the Goguenheim Artist-in-Residency program.\nSocial media analytics that highlight positive and engaged activities of users online with the Goguenheim via mentions, likes, retweets, comments, shares, etc.\"  Good luck!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2855", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7656, "q0": "This proposal addresses the migration from Eth by targeting artists currently working on Eth.

Budget is also split only on 3 big sections, without detailed split/analysis of expenses, for big amounts of $, this is very poor. One section is web development, in my experience it takes time, and good web cannot be done on few weeks, so it is highly disputable if it can be done on schedule. Also, further specification of what Web will contain is needed, as there is allocated $25k for development and SEO.
