The authors propose the establishment of an easily accessible document repository operated by the Cardano DeFi Alliance (CDA). Cardano DeFi Alliance (CDA) was founded in 2021, by a consortium of DeFi developers, infrastructure providers, and software development organizations Plutus CDA. Memberships are open and currently include: Ardana, Charli3, Coti ErgoDex, Genius Yield, GeroWallet, Indigo, Liqwid, MetaDex, Minswap, MLabs, Muesliswap Optim, Sundaeswap and VyFinance. The purpose of CDA is to communicate, educate and innovate, leveraging the strengths of the Cardano blockchain to create a dynamic DeFi ecosystem. So who can access CDA DeFi Education resources under this proposal? The team argues, dApp builders and users on the Ethereum/Etheruem Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain, as well as those in the Cardano ecosystem. They can use \u201ctechnical tutorials, how-to videos, educational articles, and how-tos that will ensure that new entrants fully understand the benefits, use cases, and even the basics Cardano's oddities\". This resource will include 4 media types: videos, articles, simple explanatory animations, and Twitter Spaces. The idea of building CDA DeFi Education is to make it easier for new developers to access Cardano when moving from Ethereum. For me personally, this is an interesting idea. However, there are some points that I suggest the authors need to clarify. For example, how will they attract members to contribute knowledge to CDA DeFi Education, and how often will their knowledge be updated? Similarly, how is the operation of the CDA Alliance's resource pool? Is there a decentralized access to this resource? The aim is to ensure that best practices are maintained across the Cardano ecosystem as new participants migrate from the EVM chain. However, I wonder, at the beginning stage, will the resource pool only be contributed by the author group, or will it be shared by other DeFi leaders, who are experienced Plutus/Haskell developers building products on Cardano. This greatly affects the quantity and quality of resources, also related to the level of resolution required of the challenge. Of course, I personally believe that, if this idea is approved by the community, building Cardano's resource pool is a legitimate and welcome endeavor. This is exactly what the community wants for our Cardano ecosystem to constantly grow. I rate the impact of the proposal 4 points, however I have deducted -1 point due to some of the things that have not been clarified above.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Regarding the project progress, the information provided is concise and clear. The team is expected to complete in 12 months, including 3 phases (3/6/12 months): to prepare, document and complete the documents in the data warehouse. The budget of the proposal was calculated by the authors based on a total of 625 hours, broken down by categories (writing articles, editing videos, etc.). However, there is no hourly unit price for each different work item. For example, how much is the unit price of a professional article writing service $/hour, what is the unit price of professional video editing, etc. This is difficult for the community to assess the reasonableness of the budget. The team also did not mention, for the community's contributions to the CDA Alliance's resources, are paid or non-profit. Although here, I see there is a category that pays for the development of documents. Regarding the team, I went to the team website that provides https://cardanodefilliance.org. According to the website's link to medium @cardano_defi_alliance, and CDA's twitter, the Alliance has also been up and running since December 2021. Information about individuals in the team, qualification records and capacity experience is complete and clear. My rating on the feasibility of the proposal is 4 points, minus -1 point because the budget is not clear.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding auditability, I found the proposal lacking specific metrics by which the community could measure the success. Although, the community can update videos, knowledge sharing articles posted on the CDA website and Twitter Spaces. However, each stage (3/6/12 months), the group should have specific achievement targets. For example, after 3 months of how many videos, the article shares knowledge about smart contract design on Cardano, protocol security, and off-chain infrastructure. How many views and followers of these articles and videos? How does the index measured month-by-month/quarterly grow? I suggest the authors should have a shared demo for the community to evaluate before deciding to vote for this proposal or not. Therefore, I see that the proposal is auditable but needs to add the specific metrics mentioned above. My score in this section is 4 points.

Cardano uses Haskell programming language for coding whereas Ethereum dApps are build using Solidity. Ethereum uses account based model to process and record transaction whereas Cardano uses extended UTXO model. Due to the differences in both of these networks, they require totally different kind of technical skill to develop dApps on top of them. Similarly having a different kind of architect used by Cardano makes it difficult for users migrating from Ethereum to understand the workings of Cardano and transaction structures. Many users get overwhelmed by the eUTXO model itself especially if they have never used an eUTXO based Blockchain like Bitcoin before.\nEthereum and EVM enabled blockchains (Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc) account for a disproportionately vast share of the smart contract blockchain market. This is due to the fact that they find it easy to build dApps on top of these chains due to the ease of building and most often ignores the downsides like unpredictable gas fees, and scalability problems.

This way, people especially from the outside of the Cardano community  can easily find the required guidance at one place.

To guild, the jouney for new people who want to move from ETH to ADA, the education campaign with in-depth document comparing ADA to ETH can show clearly ETH disadvantages such as:\n\n+ ETH is very difficult to update because there is a ton of projects already running on top of ETH and we have seen ETH\u2019s staking upgrade has been postponed many times.\n\n+ ETH is shifting its consensus mechanism from proof-of-stake (PoS) to proof-of-stake (PoS). That is a huge decision and can cause many issues.\n\n+ Staking requires so much money around  32 ETH. If ETH back to its previous all-time high, getting enough ETH to stake would cost about $40,000 and that is hard for people to afford.\n\nAnd I do believe the project will dig deep into the issues I have listed above and show how Cardano can solve all the ETH\u2019s problems. Currently, there are many people investing in ETH without understanding its nature and advantages and disadvantages. the act of measuring is like gambling or throwing money through a window. They did it just because of the huge buzz in the price of ETH last year without knowing that another coin with an extremely healthy ecosystem was about to wake up. It is ADA that will go beyond ETH and towards community and energy.\n\n\nThe scope of this proposal extends beyond just developers. Creating an educational resource about Cardano Defi with materials, and in-depth research by leading experts is essential to convince all people to switch to Cardano instead of ETH. This project will help people understand the real technology and huge growth potential of Cardano instead of rushing to ETH.\n\nIn short, this is a very ambitious and challenging idea but I believe that if it succeeds it will have a huge positive impact on the Cardano community and make the \u201cGreat Migration\u201d happen.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution declared in the proposal is a feasible and very smart approach.
