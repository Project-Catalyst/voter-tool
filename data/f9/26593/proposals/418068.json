The proposers state, that these sessions will be supported by the series of visual guides, performed via video calls (even tough it is not mentioned by what apps it will be performed, I assume the free-version of skype, zoom or teams will be utilized.) The idea is that these sessions will be approx. 2 hour long, and according to the proposal, it will have two outcomes \u2013 information materials and marketing & promotion to attract new projects to Cardano. The proposers already outlined the contents, and just to name a few, these include: low transaction fees, low minting costs, etc. whilst the most appealing I find the fact of non-failed transactions. It is important to note, that these sessions will be free for those who will request them (so catalyst will cover the fees), and the estimation is to held approx. 2-3 sessions in average per project, and the range of projects consulted is 20-25. Regarding the assessment of the impact, I am strongly convinced that one-to-one free consultancy sessions can have a positive reaction from the community, both by the fact (obviously) it is free, and also, that usually when you launch a project, not every general guidelines might be applicable, thus, it can be very beneficial to have such a guidance (one to one) available. I believe that this proposal is in alignment with the challenge goal, and even tough it appears that it will have not so big impact (in absolute numbers), I actually feel that it can get the traction they expect. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, the proposer state that the estimate is for 2-3 months. I must say, that in order to actually be able to assess the feasibility with relation to the roadmap, I would expect at least detailed plan for the first month. Now it is not really compelling, that it has some reasonable grounds. To have a better proposal, I would suggest to have the first month divided to weeks, describe whether marketing and guides creation is sequential or simultaneous activities. As well as, I would consider more details regarding the implementation plan, e.g. \u201cMarket Research: we need to check this, and that, because etc.\u201d Right now, it is not very clear what is actually meaning by some of these items. On the other hand, the budget is very detailed, calculated by expected hours spent on some activities (so it could have been implemented in the roadmap, for the better picture). Nevertheless, I would still appreciate some more information such as \u2013 who will do the guides writing? Guides design? Marketing? Etc. because the sum of expected hours is 180, and it is not clear whether it will be performed combined, or some of these tasks will be performed strictly by one, or the other of proposers, or potentially by someone else. Regarding the team, as it appears, the proposers are two, and I would describe them as \u201cartists\u201d. They also provided linked-in profiles and I have visited their webpage, they already have some projects running from the past, which I am familiar with, thus I have no doubt they have the capacity to actually develop and launch a project. The only part that is not really covered is \u201cability to be a consultant\u201d, so will take a leap of faith here, and say that as they mention, they already have offered consultancy sessions (but some sort of a proof would be nice to see.) Even tough my assessment might seem as contradictory, the overall impression from this proposal is that it is feasible, and all the negative aspects I have mentioned are considered as minor flaws.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The problem solution is clear from my perspective \u2013 how to attract new people to Cardano from ETH? -> offer them one-to-one free consultancy sessions, by people who already launched their project on Cardano. Regarding KPIs, they plan to measure  number of visits, number of sessions, number of projects who actually migrated. I would also add (since I am convinced some twitter, or any sort of medium will be used) to track also engagements \u2013 visits, likes, posts, shares, followers. The proposers also set their  success after 3 months (10-15 projects sessions) and after 6 months (20-25 project sessions). The final goal (I would say) is to have 5-10 projects launching on Cardano due to these sessions, and the guides reached to the audience of several thousands. I consider all of these being relevant to the project goal and find them reasonably set.

There are 2 side on my mind about this hijacking markets. 1st one is good thing because we get more traction on the competitive NFT Market, the 2nd one is bad thing when we couldn't maintain people traction when people joining. I think those things need to consider on this solution challenge. I can see some traction action in this proposal solution. But it would be good to put how to maintain after people attracted, that's another thing after we get people from another market share of NFT joining. and this could be more challenging the team into another level.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I can see some plans from previous fund actively running into some big goals.

It probably comes from their onboarding experiences while consulting other chain projects already or competely new projects. I know because I have lead onboarding of 1000s of companies to adopt software products that went against their daily routine. The points about Cardano's strengths that this porposal also mentions are spot on selling points for the NFT projects to join Cardano and it's not only high gas fees that other projects are quoting in this challenge often because of the challenge setting itself. Super impressed and wishing the team best of luck! This is definitely a high impact project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has been dedicated to change and creating proposals that relate to NFT ecosystem for a while. They both have LinkedIn profiles that have real activity and content make them not a rug project. The proposals I'm the past funds although not funded or perfect by any means they are decent and worth the read. The plan is solid and clear. My only problem and suggestions is that 12 hours per week may not be enough to move the needle in the four months that the proposer is expecting to close on this proposal. However, likely what will happen is they will either see a lot of success and come back for additional funding to do more 1-1 onboarding time and consulting or this will die off. For the price of sub $30k this is a solid bet to onboard more projects and possibly develop content that other people can use to also onboard more projects. My hope that this is going to be an open sourced content and shared to increase the efficiency of shilling, marketing, and onboarding more projects.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "KPIs are clearly outlined and measurable and easily trackable by the team. The number of meetings are probably the main activity objectives but more than anything bringing five to ten projects over is worthy of the investment. I do wish that the project would go above the monthly project report and proactively reach out to the community to keep tabs on the success and also source feedback on the progress of the project as well to increase the efficiency of the project and so improve success rate. The team can also measure after meeting Net Promoter Score to know what effect they have on their customers and users and how effective the meetings are. The team also clearly outlines the stages of reactions with 6 months reaching: \"Between 20 - 25 projects show an interest in launching on Cardano and book free consultancy sessions to find out more about the process.\"\n\nand\n\n\"Between 5-10 different NFT projects and/or creators are successfully onboarded onto Cardano by either choosing to migrate to the platform or launching directly on Cardano.\"\n\nand finally:\n\n\"The guides reach an audience of several thousand.\"\n\nThis is an acceptable SMART goal that is specific measurable achievable relevant and time-bound.

It is proposed to clearly present the organization of educational activities for the target audience, including the form of organization, the time for each consultation session, the topics and materials that will be included in the consulting content, KPI of projects participating in consulting.

The time for consultancy sessions for each requested project may vary, depending on its own demand, however, the team sets the maximum number of 5 sessions for each project over the course of its development, and therefore, they have good control of their consultancy length.\n Some artists and creators may wonder if Cardano works way better than Ethereum when it comes to the realization and promotion of their NFT projects.
