The content of the campaign would be comparing the features of Cardano vs Ethereum, whilst using a data driven source. It is true that the reason why Ethereum is a leader on the market both by volume and new project launched is due to the fact, that it has the biggest appearance. To catch up, or even exceed it, the proposers wants to create a communication platform #CardanoCreators, and it will end up as a hub for everyone that is interested in NFTs. It will be focused on current ETH projects, as well as new projects to be launched. The current ETH projects migration to Cardano will be performed by customized case-by-case approach, and since there is no other information mentioned, I assume it will be some consultations in the form \u201chow to\u201d. Overall I agree, that marketing, appearance and visibility of Cardano is something that can increase migration from Ethereum (or other chains, or even other fields, not strictly NFTs), and can benefit the blockchain as a whole.

These activities will be developed over the course of six month, whereas months 1-3 are containing a weekly detail of tasks to be performed and months 4-6 are having high level tasks outlined. This level of detail is providing a clear picture how they plan to proceed.  The budget is 73 300 USD in total, and it is stated that it is consisting from 2 budgets. The first budget is \u201cmarketing budget\u201d and its amount is 14 500 USD and its purpose is solely for advertisements and marketing on the media Reddit, Instagram/Facebook, Twitter and some unnamed Advertisement agency. The proposers claim that they already reached to these listed mediums, so we can assume that the budget is already pre-determined. The second budget is \u201cTeam budget\u201d and is divided by 4 members \u2013 Marketing lead, Community manager and Project manager for 6 months, and designer for 3 months, whereas the hourly wage is ranging from 20-50 USD, which I find reasonable. The team mentioned is currently consisting from 8 members and 2 advisors, but as it is stated, the new people would have to be hired for the listed positions.

Although, not every newcomer will be result of the proposal, thus I do not consider these metrics very reliable. Another metric that they will measure will be the number of posts and trend in hashtags related to the proposal such as \u201cCardano ART\u201d \u201cCardano collection\u201d etc, which is way better metric to observe. The next metrics are of course engagements with podcasts and youtube content such as likes, shares, subscribers etc, and a very interesting metric would be 1/1 NFTs volume posted to marketplaces, which could signal an inflow of such artists. The success is described as increased proportion of NFT volume (ADA vs ETH) which I am not really sure how it will be done, and also, it is unclear how they will monitor ETH migration to ADA. Maybe add another hashtag \u201cCardanoNFTMigration\u201d? or smthg similar, so it provides some idea.

In other words, doing a marketing campaign that will promote Cardano, and showcase Cardano as an industry leader in NFTs, using a data-driven approach, will show why Cardano is A better, more sustainable place than Ethereum for artists, creators, galleries, museums, universities, and other institutions. Through this proposed marketing campaign we want to bring as many Ethereum artists, collectors, and projects as possible to Cardano.
