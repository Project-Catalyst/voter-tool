It addresses the challenge setting by creating a sense of community and conversations and having people around to talk with. The proposer articulates the importance of the weekly sessions to keep the conversation going within the community. Also, regional townhalls have spun out of their initiative and which the members of Swarm consult. The proposal scales well as there is no limit on the number of users that can join the Swarm sessions and the project will continue coming back for funding to Catalyst to keep these weekly sessions going. I regularly attend these post Townhall sessions and they have been very valuable to create new connections and discuss interesting ideas with other developers and Catalyst proposers. I highly recommend new and seasoned developers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposers provide the evidence in the form of Linkedin profiles of the individuals who will deliver the weekly sessions and the strengths of each. There are a total of 6 individuals and they also hold various other roles within Cardano community including Catalyst Circle. The members of the team are core elements of the Cardano community who have been with the project for a long time. The budget is set at $47k for 4 months and split as a salary between 4 executive members plus accounting, media, and additional contributions budget. I would consider the budget to be a little high for running zoom sessions, but this is to some extent the result of the number of individuals involved and them being on hand to support the participants. I would suggest potentially cutting out the recorded videos and focusing on the meetings themselves as this is where the connections between the community happen. I personally find the live sessions most valuable to foster connections and discussions. The proposal will come back for additional funding as long as the post Townhall sessions are in demand by the community. The team is already executing the proposal and this is funding to continue doing it. The infrastructure and the operating rhythm are in place therefore there is no ambiguity about how the proposal will be delivered. The risk highlighted by the proposer is that of the community losing interest in the weekly Townhalls which would cause participation in swam sessions to dwindle, the proposed mitigating action is to collaborate with IOG to ensure the townhall remains open. The is a high likelihood that the team will continue to deliver the weekly post Townhall sessions, I do however feel the budget is a little stretched to achieve the objective.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the roadmap and the milestones are well articulated, they are a weekly post Townhall session run by proposers.

The video recording of the post Townhall sessions are recorded and posted on youtube and the team runs a Discord server open to the community through which questions can be raised and accountability thought. A transparent set-up gives me comfort that the team can deliver the proposal as set out and continue to host and encourage open interaction and networking between developers and the rest of the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1566, "q0": "I have multiple times visited the after town hall events.

These events have quite a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem and the catalyst community, as they foster governance, democracy and help to establish new cooperations (and thus naturally also aid with scaling efforts). Due to the latter reasons it also matches the challenge quite well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since those after town halls have already been held successfully for quite some time, off course it is highly likely they will be implemented successfully.

The after town hall is a community meeting between community members. This is an excellent idea and can greatly benefit the cardano community. It fits with the challenge settngs by connecting developers and thus increasing the possibility of ideas getting realized.\nThis will be and is an impactfull proposal. I've been following along with the expansion of this particular project and I'm happy to see that it has grown like so many other proposals. Now you Have several community events like the swarm after town hall, the eastern town hall, the latin america town hall and the africa town call, that's so much growth in just over 6 months it's unbelievable. Not A year ago there was only one townhall and it was out of my timezone so I rarely was abe to join so that greatly increases this proposals' impact over the future of the community and generated ideas and colaborations.\nThis project has a proven trackrecord of being able to scale to meet the rising needs of the community and adds a missing piece to the whole environment.

Overall I'd say this is an impactfull proposal and is worth evolving even further and expanding farther.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All team members are a well known part of the community and bring their considerable skills and credability to ant project they take part in. Felix Weber is one of the well known organizers of different kinds of events when I was being introduced into the community. He was one of the people answering questions for me and I've hear quite a lot of the other listed names as well. \nThe budget breakdown is really simple, basically just a sallary for all those great people that do so much for the community. The Hourly rate is more than deacent so there's no worry on that part. The timefreame seems reasonable to me. Disclaimer: I'm a developer, and I don't know anything about even execution and organization so I wouldn't presume to be able to estimate much, but it still looks like a reasonable timeframe to me.\nThe proposers have given a really good roadmap with milestones to follow along with and events to take part in. There's plenty of people to accomodate the incomming wave of interested new people to the ecosystem. There's a good breakdown of event's that need to be organized as well as people to do so.\nOverall this seems to be more than feasible proposal that will benefit a huge part of the community. These events serve as marketing as well, because anyone interested in what's happening exactly in the cardano ecosystem can look at the videos and see real people talking about and demonstrating real solutions working on the cardano blockchain.

Due to Swarm participation in Gimbalabs Token-project based learning group , the Swarm bootstrapped some first examples of implementing community infrastructure tokens. \nThe main risk mentioned is that the Swarm After Town Hall attendance depends on the main Town Hall attendance which if the main Town Hall attendance goes down, the After Town Hall attendance will go down. To mitigate , they plan to collaborate closely with IOG to ensure  that the Town Hall and After Town Hall stays open for discussions, presentations and conversations all around Cardano.\nThe information above shows that this proposal has addressed the challenge effectively.

Cardano/catalyst needs a platform where it can unite developers from diverse kinds of fields to share ideas that are useful to building the ecosystem. When ideas from these various developers are absorbed and used new innovations would be seen emerging in project catalyst which is already critical in this challenge.\nHowever, I realized that key metrics are not clearly stated. They are presented in a way that becomes difficult to recognize, however they align with the set outcome because success for this project is that there will be a continuous community engagement and participation in hosting breakout rooms each week\u2026\u2026. The metrics or goals are really in conformity with the challenge setting. The nature of the project makes it flexible to be changed positively to fit into other challenges in the long run because the catalyst swarm- After Town Hall and subsequent breakout rooms are platforms that can be used to promote other catalyst brilliant ideas. Hence the proposal appears to be scalable and functional. Knowing the team have been around since Fund 3 means that there is much dependence on Project Catalyst funds and again the proposer has stated that the would return to catalyst funds so that catalyst swarm- After Town Hall can be held continuously.

The team is made up of six (6) people and they have been well described.\nThe budget is very comprehensive and detailed. The budget cost though looks huge but however it\u2019s sensible for financing the catalyst swarm operations. \nThe nature of Catalyst Swarm- After Town Hall does not actually come with a definite time frame due to the fact that sessions are held weekly and that sessions are held as far as funds are available. I am positively attracted to the plan outlined because there is much detail on how the team would carry out the sessions and the resource personnel for a particular kind of session. That\u2019s great to see. Being a participant of the After Town Hall of catalyst swarm I can confirm the impact their sessions have made to every community member. I appreciate the fact that the proposer has provided a further explanation on how the activities of the sessions would be carried. This is necessary because it helps every community member to have an understanding of what is being done. It\u2019s very good that the proposer has outlined the possible risks/challenges that may arise during the implementation of the project and the measures to mitigate them.\nWith all these been said, I am of the assurance that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is well detailed. Reading through the detailed plan, timeline and milestone section it is very clear what the team seeks to achieve at each quarter. Much have been done in the previous quarters of 2022.

I am confident that they were wisely chosen because they are good indicators for evaluating success as they tell or measure the continuous community engagement and participation in hosting breakout room sessions each week.\n\nThe problem described here is clear and I believe that the proposed solution is very effective to address the problem this is because the proposed solution have been used for sometime now and it\u2019s actually making great impact.\nThe nature of Catalyst Swarm- After Town Hall is already a public accessible platform for community members so hence it\u2019s easy for community members to track the progress of the project in the Town Halls and breakout room sessions and also on the Catalyst Swarm YouTube channel.
