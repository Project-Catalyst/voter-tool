The objective for this to give funding to developers focusing on smaller problems than what submission to Catalyst would justify. This lines up with the challenge by improving the developers' journey and has the potential to attract new developers to \u201cdip their toes\u201d into the Cardano ecosystem before fully committing. The proposal is able to scale through the bespoke DAO creator that the proposer has delivered through previous proposals. The proposal will fund the treasury of the DAO that will give out daily funding of up to $300 for 100 days, after the proposer plans to return for additional funding. I personally tried the DAO creator platform where I created a new DAO , added a new budget and funded it from my we-wallet (on the testnet) , I created a new vote on how to distribute the funds and the experience was to a large extent smooth and plausible that the community could use this distribute small amounts of funs. Also I have seen Milkomeda from dcSpark do something very similar where a treasury was funded by Catalyst and which they distributed to promising projects wishing to migrate to Milkomeda. I will likely participate in the DAO when it launches", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposer provides evidence of his skills and linkedin profiles that supports his abilities to deliver a project like this. The project is not technical. It will reuse the infrastructure of daocodert.net that the proposer has delivered through previous proposals. It will be a team of 1. The budget is reasonable to achieve the goal. The basic premise is that the proposer will use the $30k budget to fund the treasury of a DAO that he will create on his platform and will use that DAO to attract members, accept proposals and distribute up to $300 per day. The budget will last for 100 days. The proposal is completely realistic as it is a distribution of funds and the technology to distribute these funds has been build to a large extent. The highlighted risk is not having enough developers join the platform and the mitigating action is to advertise it through one of the weekly Catalyst town halls and raise awareness through Discord and Telegram groups. I personally do not see a problem that he will be able to attract interest from developers. I think the biggest risk is with auditing the deliverables of projects in the DAO and how he plans to maintain a high standard of projects. I think there is a high chance of success given that the technology already exists and it is more a use case of that technology funded by Catalyst", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadman is clearly stated to run over 100 days where on each day $300 will be distributed to the proposers of the DAO. The KPIs are clearly outlined and will track the number of members, projects, and funded items in the DAO. A report will be shared with the community monthly.

I really really like this idea and think it will have an impact over the ecosystem. To be honest I don't really agree with several ideas of this proposal, but I do believe that no one can have the right answer right away and it's important to experiment try and fail to find an optimal solution. So in that train of thought I would really like to see this proposal funded.\nThis proposal is in the right category, because it would immensly improve funding for small budget projects. It's aligned with the challenge settings and would be a perfect addition to the ecosystem. The key metrics are reasonable, because it would show unambiguously if the DAO would be a success through tracking rapid funding and people participating on both investor and project side. \nI really believe this proposal would have a larger impact in the future once the whole process and proof of concept have been polished. Currently I don't see many things missing from the proposal, besides a few things I'm going to mention in the feasibility part of the assessment. Overall a good proposal that I think is going to have an impact for small projects.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided all the necessary links so I was able to verify that Dwayne Collard has all the necessary tallents and skillset to manage the funding through the DAO. As a developer I am a big proponent ot automated solutions so I do enjoy the proposal that much more for it.\nI am a developer, but I'm also an economist and I didn't understand what would the incentive be to fund the DAO? If it's like patreon and it's some kind of chairity, that's good, but I do belive this needs to be mentioned. It would set the right expectations, because if you're a chairitable person, you'd want to participate no matter what, but if you're an investor you'd want to know what the return on investment is.\nI didn't quite understand how the funded projects would be accountable for the usage of the funds. So there needs to be a better defined explanation about that in the proposal. I do approve of the experimentation with rapid funding. Even if it's not the most optimal solution right now (I'm not saying it's not, it's just not verified yet) it would become polished over time and this needs to be allowed to happen. I have already seen previous variation of rapid funding, and I welcome a new one to be tested out over time. As the prroposers mentioned 30k wouldn't be a big cost for testing out something that wouldn't take 5-6 months to get a project funded which whould speed up the development of the environment itself.\nThere's a sensible plan for funding and a doloar cost averaging way of keeping the price around the medium of the change of price, so that's smart and would deffinately be worth the value of the overall transactions. I'm sure the proposers have already solved several challenges and have gain the know-how of dealing with dao problems, so I defer to their knowledge about the challenges they have forseen, because I can only speculate, and I avoid speculation at all cost.\nOverall a decent and feasible proposal despite the few small improvement suggestions mentioned.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It's a DAO so it's transparent, I don't have a problem with the auditability of this proposal.

There may be room to provide some modeling evidence for situations where small funding issues can cause big problems in project development (perhaps more easily found in traditional markets).

I also really like this roadmap breakdown that explains specific actions that will be taken at each juncture of funding. I would\u2019ve liked to see a little more action points on plans to push awareness of this DAO to the community (especially since low participation is one of the cited risks for this project).

Your team's experience has led to a well-presented and concise proposal. You clearly and understandably present the idea and how the Catalyst Small Developer Funding project works, and then demonstrate the close link between it and the challenge (helping small developers eliminate the cumbersome paperwork so they have a more positive experience and can focus on app development). Because the DAO-NET project's straightforward fundraising and submission process is a positive aspect, I believe the risk of low participation can be readily managed if you have a robust promotion campaign in place. However, there is one question that I need you to answer: What will DAO-NET do to ensure voting round transparency? Even though the funding amount is not excessive for small projects, I believe you should demonstrate how to ensure transparency in the distribution of investment funds to avoid problems with claims complaints later on.
