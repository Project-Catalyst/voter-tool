This opens up their health information system to developers who prefer to work with Python. This is a useful addition it could bring new Python developers to Cardano and give an existing developer who prefers to code in Python, or has integration needs with other Python a platform to get started quickly. The SDK is geared towards Hippocrades and therefore not reusable immediately for the rest of Cardano ecosystem, therefore the reach is limited to some extent. It would have been good to see the proposer extend the scope to cover other parts of Cardano for which it could be used. However, the relatively low budget of $7k makes the reduced scope justified. The proposal scales to the extent that more developers will come to work on the Hippocrades apps. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed. This proposal is in its entirety the same to the Java SDK proposal with only minor differences in the name of the SDK. For this reason, the text of this assessment is very similar as well to my assessment of the Java SDK", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided the list of individuals that are needed to deliver the proposal but has not identified who those individuals will be. The proposed however has a track record of delivering other parts of the Hippocrades app and states that access to a pool of developers who he can pull to work on this proposal. It would have been nice to see who those individuals are to be able to assess their technical capabilities. The budget of $7k is outlined and split between the tasks of a project lead, a backend developer, a python developer, and a documentation lead. The budget monthly rates for each of the tasks are competitive (e.g., $3k for a senior backend developer). The project is planned to be delivered within 1 month and this is quite realistic given that the team already have a Javascript SDK. The language differences between Python and Javascript are still quite large, so there is some work involved in finding libraries that might not exist in Python and which can identify some bugs in the existing javascript implementation and lead to some delays beyond the 1 month that has been allocated in this proposal. I think the proposal will be able to deliver, but it would have been nice to see a little more detail on the planning and recognition of the delivery risks. The proposer highlights that there is minimal risk to delivery. I suggest the proposer elaborates a little more on how the porting of the Javascript to Python will be done. I think the proposer will be able to deliver, but there are risks of a delay. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Java SDK which I have also assessed.

The project is quite short in terms of time, so it is unlikely that there will be intermediate steps to monitor progress. The proposer commits to pushing the development of the SDK for the community to monitor. The success is stated as the delivery of the SDK which is in with what the proposal set outs to deliver. The deliverable is objective and there should be no difficulty to audit the proposal. Note: The proposer has a similar proposal to build a Python SDK which I have also assessed.

This is a key piece of infrastructure that could prove very important for the adoption of Cardano. This particular proposal is requesting funding to build an SDK to allow Python developers to quickly deploy an app on top of their existing infrastructure without the need to learn a different programming language.\n\nThe best part about it is that we don\u2019t have to hope that the team will have the skills to deliver on an SDK as they have already built one for JavaScript that\u2019s available today and linked in the proposal. The funding they are asking for in this proposal will go towards building the SDK for a new programming language, Python (this proposal).\n\nThe team has 4 proposals in Fund 9 with the goal of building SDKs for developers working with languages to be able to deploy on their infrastructure with ease: Python (this proposal), Java, Rust, and Golang.\n\nI understand and agree with the decision of the team to submit a different proposal for each programming language they intend to create an SDK for. This enables the community to choose and allocate funds to those it considers necessary, and also select one or a combination of multiple languages that are relevant and would be good investments for the treasury. This is not something that would have been possible in case of a single proposal that would have bundled all languages together.\n\nThe team has been very transparent about the fact that they have multiple proposals in Fund 9 all with the same objective, just for different programming languages, as they mention this fact in every one of the proposals. This should also help with discoverability by the voters, but my recommendation would be that if there will be a next time, they should consider including links from each proposal to all the others to help with navigation in case a voter or a community member wants to support multiple.\n\nThis set of proposals is clearly a very good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge because they directly answer the key guiding questions of the challenge: \u201cwhat are the tools that we need to prioritize first\u201d - those that will make the development process on Cardano the most seamless and effortless, and \u201chow do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\u201d - by allowing them to build on Cardano in the language they are most comfortable with. By splitting up their plans for SDKs into multiple proposals and giving the community a chance to vote on exactly which ones they believe are the most relevant they also allow developers to directly answer the questions \u201cwhat do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\u201d  Also, the Hippocrades project as a whole very much addresses the last guiding question of the challenge \u201cwhat are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\u201d, at least as it applies to dev managers connected to the medical industry.\n\nMy assessment of this set of proposals in the Developer Ecosystem challenge is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team presents not only an impressive list of qualifications in the proposal but also a complete list of their already operational medical services infrastructure platform and a demo app. We don\u2019t have to envision what developers could build with the new SDKs in the languages they are comfortable with, we actually get to see it. After inspecting it I can say it looks impressive, it seems to cover all the needs of a health professional while also maintaining a modern clean look.\n\nThe implementation plan is logical and makes sense within the context of the overall project. It\u2019s for 5 weeks of development time and seems to cover all the necessary steps to successfully implement the SDK for Python (this proposal). Each one of the 4 proposals in the set is estimated to take 5 weeks, meaning that in the case that all 4 proposals are funded, the total estimated completion time would be 20 weeks, given that the same team will be responsible for the execution of each SDK.\n\nAs this is a straightforward development project at an existing company, the budget breakdown only concerns itself with worker compensation for the month it is estimated that the development of the Python SDK would take. The amounts seem very reasonable, low for Western standards but that shouldn\u2019t be a problem since the team has indicated that they are in Africa (they haven\u2019t directly specified this in the proposal, but since they are part of the Ariob Incubator / Iceaddis program I assume this is the case.)\n\nThe team members involved in the development of this particular part of the Hippocrades project are described in detail within the proposal, and the technical speciality of each is presented. They seem to collectively possess the skillset required to successfully deliver. However, because the proposal didn't link to any professional profiles (LinkedIn) or examples of previous work, I wasn't able to verify the claims around credentials and experience. But, even though they haven\u2019t provided links for each individual separately, they did provide a very ample description of their project overall (Hippocrades) and numerous links to multiple resources about the project and showcasing the project.\n\nAll these factors make me very confident in the Hippocrades\u2019 team's ability to deliver on the scope of this project if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is very clear in what it wants to achieve and what are its intended deliverables. This alone should help a lot with the auditing process. A clear roadmap for the project is presented and from that, the delivery date can be easily extrapolated and verified. The team states it plans to use GitHub to record and monitor its activities and deliverables, which should further simplify the verification process as that is an almost universal tool used by most programmers in our developer community. \n\nGiven all this, I see this proposal (and this set of proposals) as being very easy to audit by any member of our community with the right technical skill set and knowledge of Python (this proposal), Java, Rust or Golang.\n\nNote on the proposal set and the assessments:\n\nI have verified the content of all 4 proposals using software that allows for snapshots of text and comparisons between snapshots (Scrivener). I did this to make sure the text of all proposals is the same before writing this assessment. They are indeed identical, only the name of the intended programming language differs between proposals. As such, I have assessed all 4 proposals as a set. Just as the text of the proposals, I have also changed the specific programming language in each one of my assessments and I\u2019ve written \u201c(this proposal),\u201d where this needed to be highlighted.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3566, "q0": "The proposal wants to develop a Pything SDK in order to make building healthcare decentralized applications on the blockchain easier. For the non-technical viewers asking themselves what's so special about healthcare apps let me answer - absolutely nothing, but if they must be developed to use the blockchain effectivly you need an sdk on your known language (in this case python) to make development easyer and in such a way, the developer wouldn't have to know anything about the blockchain, because all interactions with it will be behind an abstraction/interface provided by the sdk. I love the fact the authors have considered the requirements applied to healthcare like data privacy, compliance and many others I'm sure. This SDK will help developers that want to build a healthcare api using python for example and will greatly reduce the time by using the aforementioned sdk. This will bring a positive developer experience what the challenge settings are all about.\nThe plan to develop this sdk originally built in javascript is a superb one, because it will bring each individual community using that language that much closer to using cardano as a safe immutable ledger solution. The metrics and aim of the proposal are clear and distinct and a lot of thought is put into them. I'm sure this project will be able to scale and is already scaling by making all different kinds of sdks to engage macimum number of developers at once, which is smart.\nAll an all an impactfull and usefull proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is one of the few solutions that have such a readable, accessible and long roadmap. I really like it's representation. If you go on https://hippocrades.org/ and tap the roadmap button, you can have a look as well. It has checkboxes that presumably will get ticked once a task from the roadmap is completed which is such a simple yet, underestimated way of showing your progress and future plans. The only thing that's missing is an \"in progress\" box that can tell everyone what your team is working on right now and I'd recommend to the proposers to consider this idea, as it's a 10 minute job at most.\nThe bad news is I wasn't able to vefify the skills listed for every team member anywhere on the net (i googled), and could find anything because no links are provided to do the verification. And with only first names, I wasn't able to search for the individual mentioned people as well. This bring the feasibility down a bit, but what can you do. Maybe next fund you'll add some links to help along for a perfect score, because everythingg else does seem in order.\nThe proposers have a decent timeline considering they already have implemented the sdk in javascript already and all the logic is narrowed down and tested (hopefuly) already. The only problem I can see is updating the SDKs in paralel, because if there's a problem inside the logic of one, all will have to be fixed to be efficient and stable. That's the problem with writing many sdks, but that can't be helped.\nThe technologies and skills are clearly elaborated on so nothing to add or ask there. The budget is more than reasonable and for such a small cost, the value will be great. Overall this is a very feasible proposal with the small exception I already mentioned.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Considering the site and the roadmap I doubt anyone will have a problem tracking the progress of the project, especially if they follow my addvice and add an in-progress indicator in the roadmap. Many many meetings were mentioned to keep track of the project progress so that's something. The project catalyst also has a protocol to follow when the funding is seeded.\nHealthcare app and SDG goals go hand in hand so that's great they have those. It could help with their funding. It's a great and auditable proposal with a clear problem to solve and several solutions spanned in several proposals so great job, hope you make in after the voting phase.

From their website: \"Hippocrades provides a comprehensive decentralized healthcare infrastructure and protocol that unlock interoperability and security challenges among different health systems. This allows users - patients, health providers, and health facilities to manage and audit their medical records while making them shareable in a decentralized, private, and permissionless health exchange.\" \n\nThe team has several whitepapers, extensive documentation, both for the product, and for developers. At a glance, Hippocrades looks to be one of the best projects I've seen on Catalyst. It solves a great host of problems related to interoperability of healthcare systems. It is an original use case for blockchains. Suffice to say I love the project. Now onto the proposal.\n\nThe proposal is one of 4 very similar proposals in this fund. Each of the 4 proposals is to create an SDK for a different language: Python, Rust, Java, and Golang. The proposers have already created the first SDK on Javascript and now are working on these 4 languages. \n\nDeveloping an SDK that can be used by developers is entirely aligned with the challenge. That is, if the SDK has anything to do with a Cardano. There is no obvious connection between Hippocrades and Cardano. The proposers state: \"Since the team has been building the Healthcare Infrastructure in Cardano, other developers will be encouraged to build their health apps in Cardano as well.\" I wholeheartedly agree that if this project is being built on Cardano, other developers will build their health apps on Cardano as well, using Hippocrades. I'm just not sure Hippocrades is being built on Cardano. There is no mention of Cardano on their website, or on their whitepapers. \n\nI asked about this connection in their developer Discord server got this response: \"The Hippocrades Protocol (Hippr) talks about zero knowledge proofs being saved in blockchain. The health exchange is triggered by those proofs. The blockchain being used is Cardano.\". Since this is an amazing project being built on Cardano, there is some alignment between the project and challenge, yet not total alignment. The team makes almost no effort to market Cardano. It took me additional effort to even confirm how Cardano is being used. I don't believe this project will onboard many developers to Cardano. But this isn't something that can be fixed easily, and I believe this is a high quality project, so I rate this proposal with some leniency.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is very strong, with two solid developers and a Harvard grad founder with extensive experience in the healthcare sector. These guys know the problem they're solving. It shows in the extensive documentation, 2 whitepapers, and their website. They smell of professionalism. With 1 month of work and a budget of 7500 USD, I think this is a fair amount for the work to be done. \n\nThat work is not too well defined however. The plan is very general. It has no specifics as to the work, the featureset to be implemented in the SDK is not specified. I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the team here, I think they know exactly what they want to build, as they have already created a Javascript SDK, and they have a lot of work done already on Hippocrades. For the future though, I suggest giving some of this information on the proposal as well.\n\nAlso, there is no Python developer on the team. None of the three listed in the team has Python as a listed skill. Who will develop the SDK is not clear. I assume they will hire someone to do it.

The javascript SDK also doesn't have documentation, so we don't know what features it has. As such, what features the SDK will have is entirely unclear. \n\nFrom where the progress of the project can be tracked is also not specified. There is no public communication channel on the proposal. No Discord, telegram etc. There is also no github, even though github is mentioned in the proposal. This information is also not available on their website aside from a Discord server for developers. This server however has a total of 2 members.

Therefore, the impact prior to the full fruition of the Hippocrades protocol is relatively low - compared to creating an immediately deployable tool or integration that can stand on its own for example - but has the potential to make a big and very impactful project even more impactful. In that sense, the proposal does meet the challenge brief as Python is a very popular and accessible programming language and especially widespread in science and academic circles or among medical and biology researchers, who are the likely future users of Hippocrades and therefore likely future Cardano converts.

However, I am a bit concerned about whether the Python SDK support is premature or not. Looking at their roadmap on hippocrades.org, we can see that many SDKs are on the way before the reward system. I think it's more cost-efficient to delay the SDK support if they have to be re-updated again. It really depends on whether or not there will be any breaking changes after they implement the reward system. I hope the proposer could clarify more on this matter.

The proposers could add in detail here about what would constitute a success for this stage of development so that audit processes can easily follow it throughout its life.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3205", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12318, "q0": "the proposer wants to build python SDK for a health app, which will make attract many python developers because as a python developer sometimes I\u2019m too lazy to learn another language than python. this project was very helpful for people like me who didn\u2019t want to bother with learning another language. and the proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem, to encourage python developers to build their health apps in Cardano as well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "proposer didn\u2019t provide links like LinkedIn or else to members team but clearly, explain each member\u2019s team experience and skills for the implementation. the budget is outlined clearly and breakdown into identifiable items but didn\u2019t add detail on each role\u2019s salaries per hour, only the total per month. the project has a very experienced team which can be seen in projects that have been done with them, well I believe the project will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "clearly roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement. a very clear description of the targeted problem that can be measured against the proposed outcomes and has a solution that addresses the problem with a simple definition of success. has an accessible public channel for delivering regular updates on auditing progress.

The team knows that learning blockchain-specific programming language has some challenges, and they create a extensive health infrastructure with APIs so that developers can build their own health app easier. This infrastructure saves a lot of time and effort for developers as they can just build apps on top of the infrastructure. Hence attract many more developers regardless of their programming language. \n\nIn this proposal, the team offers to attract Python developers to build their healthcare apps in Cardano. The team has been selected in previous batches and their products have been released, making this a proven case. In short, they just need to rewrite an already successful infras in another language", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I really enjoyed reading this proposal. It is clear, concise and well organized.\n\nAgain, the team has already build the Javascript SDK so logic and framework can stay pretty much unchanged. They have reasonable and achievable sprints with enough time for testing, documenting and releasing. The budget breakdown also looks good to me. I am really impressed with how they present details of team members. The core team with strong background and experience over the years, plus actual references to their works so that they have talents, and that they care about health care. Actions speak loud, however, I would add a link to each member's page such as LinkedIn or Github to make it easier for me to find them if I want to know more about them.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team is passionate about what they do and are very clear on the value of their project. The discipline that worked previously is once again applied here. Stable, simple, testable code, team velocity and knowledge share make a complete protocol. I also liked how they track progress through Github and conduct daily standups as well as weekly meetings to spot issues/discuss in a timely manner. This helps them stay on top of things and make sure everything runs smoothly throughout development cycles", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4103", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Hippocrades has built a health infrastructure with APIs for devs to easily create a health app. Currently, it has a Javascript SDK already.
