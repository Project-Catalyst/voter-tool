This will help the developer ecosystem by allowing those individuals who have english as a second language, in the LATAM region, to participate in their language of choice. This is important as key concepts and definitions are easier to digest and understand. \n\nIf Cardano will truly be a global platform that can be adopted by all people around the world, it is essential that the materials and information developed are available widely. This means that even though most documents begin in English, they can easily be translated and in so doing, obtain a farther reach. Given the strong presence of the LATAM community already participating in the Cardano community, this proposal will likely result in additional members from those communities being able to be onboarded more easily. Therefore, this proposal offers significant impact. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst and foremost, the proposers have been long standing members of the community providing vital translation services. Their work has directly increased the exposure of Cardano and participation of the LATAM community. Based on this track record alone, there is no doubt that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nNext, the team's plan is very simple and straightforward. The translation of 220 sheets/month at $.05USD/word. However, why I have deducted a point here is because it is unclear what they actually mean by \"sheets\". While I can infer it is in the literal sense of \"sheets of paper\" but how will you select which ones to translate and why those over others? Since there is an enormous amount of content that could be translated, providing these details is important to give a sense of what exactly the work will focus on.\n\nThe budget and timeline is more than reasonable and would be money very well spent by the community. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nThe group behind this proposal continues to be visible within the Cardano community, and engage across a variety of different venues to support LATAM engagement. They have a good track record of engaging their community on an ongoing basis and adapting their services to meet participant needs. \n\nThis project will be very easy to measure since they will check # of sheets translated as per their goal of 220/month, and will also track the budget spent/month as portion of overall budget. Where I think the team could have done a bit better is with making the success measures more tangible. As written the success measures are broad objectives but won't necessarily be achieved through this project alone. For example, would the 220 sheets/month result in \"A Latin American community informed promptly and accurately, in your language, with the most relevant official content\"?? It is likely that such a goal would take many different efforts to come together. \n\nSince they do include targets in their plan and will use the KPIs to measure the success of these targets no points will be removed. However, I would encourage the participants in future rounds to ensure that their success measures can actually be measured by the KPIs presented.

One of them could of course be fluent in portuguese and spanish and/or english, but it's a basic information that it's not obvious to an external reader. To improve this aspect of feasibility it would be good if they could include this information in the proposal. In all other aspects, from the budget plan to the timeline, the proposal seems to be totally feasible, which leads me to a score of 4. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is easy to audit, especially because it has a quite simple design and clear metrics for the community to follow its completion.

This will certainly add value to the Cardano ecosystem as the language barrier permeates every possible area of the Catalyst ecosystem. Misinformation inside and outside the ecosystem is a force that must be constantly fought to stay at bay. Catalyst's coordinating teams in all their forms already provide the information needed to achieve the goal that unites the community's efforts as one body.

Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ing-sebastian-pabon/ The members of the Cardano LATAM translator team thus have relevant skills and more than 4 years of experience in translating English, Spanish and Portuguese. They have translated documents of great official importance (PA guide, proposal guide, official surveys, etc.). In the proposal there are 2 links that refer to Cardano LATAM's translation team. The LATAM translation group has grown as an organization capable of contributing to the better performance of information as a resource connecting all members of the community, regardless of their linguistic origin. The team that translates official documentation of great importance to the ecosystem (guides, reports, surveys, etc.) . In line with Project Catalyst's decentralization and governance process, it's time to work in sync with the evolution of the ecosystem and create the pilot of an instance that will be the bridge between IOG-Catalyst and Catalyst Latin America on information-level flows. An organism that reacts sensitively to the transmission of official information once it has been provided by the English source. This organism should improve response times while maintaining the level of quality achieved so far. The creation of a treasury, formed by the budget requested in the proposal, namely USD 9900 and entered into the public purse of the LATAM translation team, will support the development of a process that will gradually improve by immediately will quickly deploy the commitment to meet the translation of the moment. The budget is described in great detail and subdivided into recognizable items. Verification of the allocated budget is foreseen because the wallet into which the budget of this proposal will be deposited immediately corresponds to the official wallet of the LATAM translation team. This has been and will continue to be publicly monitored, therefore openly managed and its cash flow is always visible to the community. LATAM's translation team is committed to translating official documents from English to Spanish and Portuguese with high quality standards and in the shortest possible time until the allocated budget is exhausted. Additional funding may be required to implement the proposal as creating an efficient bridge of information transfer between the global Catalyst community and the Hispanic LATAM community is fundamental to strengthening Cardano's goal as one of the key vehicles for innovation and creativity in the sector. The proposal shares the vision for the success of the Challenge Developer Ecosystem, as developers in general will find their place in our ecosystem when the public in general and developers in particular have clear and timely access to information related to the conditions, opportunities and prospects presented by the innovative and productive environment that is Catalyst. They can tell they are part of our developer community when information in their own language describes the possibilities of a promising career. A possible risk of not being able to fully implement the proposal is budget exhaustion. They will do their best to put the received budget at the service of the Latin American community. Their main goal is to connect Catalyst's global community with Spanish-speaking members.

The description of each team member comes with a LinkedIn profile link for reference and verification. For this project to be more feasible, I think the team should clearly state the position of each team member in the project. A complete translation project often consists of at least two positions: translators and editor(s)/proofreader(s) to ensure the translation quality. As one of the goals of the project is to build a Latin American community with rapid access to their translated documentation, I suppose there should be someone in charge of administration to make sure the translated documents will reach their target readers as soon as possible.
