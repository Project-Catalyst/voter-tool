This is a killer advantage and a must for Cardano. As a developer myself I'll definitely consider Flutter and Dart the next time I'll have to write an app on mobile because the most annoying thing for a developer is to have to maintain the same code across different platforms, or worse depend on another developer for a specific platform...\n- This proposal is perfectly aligned with this challenge\u2019s goals as it will provide a new means for developers to very easily develop on Cardano's blockchain with the unique advantage of simplified interoperability. This alone can tip the balance in favor of Cardano when having to choose a blockchain development platform due to the important savings realized in having to maintain a single code base compatible with all platforms at the same time...", "q0r": 5, "q1": "- Proven experience available through GitHub and the dev is a Plutus Pioneer (single developer).\n- Slow but steady delivery.\n- Recurring project, no surprise apart from the proposer spending way more time than anticipated.

As a developer of a project myself, I searched for a mobile SDK  and after I didn't find one I decided to code everything up in React Native.  A mobile SDK would bring new developers into the Cardano ecosystem, knowing that they can develop mobile apps that leverage the Cardano blockchain. It would also improve the developer experience for existing developers on Cardano by saving them time on the basics. The SDK will be open-sourced and for anyone to use, therefore the deliverable scales well. The proposer has taken the approach of asking for small funding amounts to incrementally improve the Flutter SDK and plans to come back for additional funding in future funding rounds.  There have been a number of mobile apps developed on Cardano, such as Flint, Minswap, CCVault, but they have remained closed source. An SDK would give a boost to mobile app development on Cardano and I think it aligns very well with the challenge setting.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Proposal provides links to social media accounts, and GitHub repos end the video explaining how the SDK operates. A short Bio is included, which informs the reader that Richard has more than 30 years of experience in Java and mobile development and is also a Plutus Pioneer from the 3rd cohort. It is evident that Richard is a very experienced developer in the mobile field and has the right skill set to deliver this proposal. Richard will be the sole developer on the projects.  The budget is detailed with hours per task provided; covers things such as Smart contract development, fixing bugs, providing Community Support and investigating alternative backend adapters. The budget is set at $15,000 and covers 300 hours of work which works out to $50 an hour. This is a very competitive rate for a mobile developer with blockchain skills in the US.  The average rate of proposals that I have reviewed so far (30+ proposals) has been around $70 an hour. The timetable is realistic as there is a specific allocation of hours per task. Richard explains the technical aspects of the project in great detail and includes background information on what Flutter is, and also describes things that he learned from previous funding rounds, which is always nice to see. Richard describes two main risks to the project; the first one is the challenge of implementing Haskell off-chain smart contract support in the SDK.  I recommend that Richard looks at the cardano-serialization-lib, which is a helpful library for generating off-chain transactions. The second risk is that the Cardano official light wallet, Lace, will be released soon. However, Lace is not suited for stand-alone clients; therefore, the SDK is still relevant for developers that need to embed wallet functionality into their apps. With a detailed plan and good alignment between required and available skills, I think Richard will be able to deliver a quality product.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, Richard provides the link to the repository where the open-source will be uploaded and where the popularity rating can be tracked. Richard will track likes, bugs reports and pull requests to measure user engagement.  The key metric of success is that many users use the SDK. No social media communication channels are provided.  There are also no suggestions of providing a regular update to the Cardano community.  I would encourage Richard to provide a little more detail in the auditability section next time.

Flutter is a cross-platform mobile development environment that makes developing mobile applications easy. Cardano applications on mobile is non-existant to my knowledge, so an easy to use SDK for Flutter would be great for the developer ecosystem, opening the way for great applications on mobile. It will also attract Flutter devs to come onboard Cardano, granting Cardano an edge against other blockchains.

The proposer has been coming back to Catalyst to continue the funding of the project. At this stage, I would have liked to see the SDK is being used by others, or at least a mention by the developer if it's being used at all. Diving deep into the scoring system of the Flutter library at pub.dev I found that it was actually being used. The popularity metric for the library was at 47% when I reviewed. This means the project is in the middle of the pack in terms of use in the last 60 days. Not bad. It shows at least someone is using the library. Hopefully this metric ticks up in the next few months. \n\nI am a backend developer, so I'm only barely familiar with the technology being developed in this proposal. To me, it seems 14 months to develop a SDK is too long, though I'll have to say I have never developed an SDK myself and have no basis for such an estimation. From the git repository, we see development is actively progressing and the proposer says with this fund we'll reach a stable 1.0 release. So I'll give the benefit of the doubt to the proposer here and say this is entirely feasible. If at the next fund we don't see a stable 1.0 release, then this proposer has lost my trust. It shouldn't take 18+ months to develop an SDK. \n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The main metric to measure for progress is the popularity metric for the SDK library at pub.dev, where the library is hosted. This is as good a metric as it gets, it tells us how popular the library is compared to all other libraries at pub.dev. A short description and discussion by the proposer on where that metric has been in the past, and where it is now would be great. Considering the same proposal has been given since Fund 5, this information would validate progress. \n\nThe single missing piece in this proposal is related to success. This is all the info the proposer has provided on the topic: \"Many users of the SDK as reflected in likes on github and pub.dev.\". I'd like to see this defined better.
