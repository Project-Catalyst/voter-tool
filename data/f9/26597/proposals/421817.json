Python developers can use the testing suite to learn how to interact with a Cardano node as this gives them practical examples in Python. This will have to help existing developers on Cardano as well as attract new developers who fluent in Python but not other languages. The proposer is a well-respected member of the Cardinal Community and a small pool operator. The Proposal will come back for additional funding should this deliverable be well received and the community request other features. The project is scalable as it will be released as open-source on GitHub for anyone to use.  I am a stake pool operator myself and even though I don't use their tools as Python is not my preferred language, but I could see that someone who prefers Python would find this tool to be very valuable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the project will be delivered by 2 individuals: Dylan and Willie. Their short CVs are provided, but no social media links.  It would have been nice to see some social media links so their track record could be verified. The proposal suggests creating a series of tests to create a set of wallets; send and receive funds; mint and burn NFT tokens; create and retire a State Pool and delegate a wallet to the stake pool. The budget is outlined clearly and broken into sections.  Each section has an hourly expenditure at cost of $40 per hour.  Given the proposers\u2019 experience and the fact that they have built tools on Cardano before, this is a very competitive hourly rate and much below the average of the 20+ proposals that I have reviewed so far. The proposed timeline is to finish in q1 next year, which is entirely reasonable considering it would take them 130 hours to complete. The key risk highlight is that testing depends on the Cardano testnet faucet to dispense test Ada which is a third-party service and should the service come down they will need to find an alternative. This could delay their deliverable but it is unlikely that IOG would keep this faucet service down for a long time as a lot of other projects depend on it. Overall I think the proposed budget is very fair, and the deliverable could benefit developers with Python knowledge. I have no doubt that they will be able to deliver on this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, The progress on the project will be measured by the number of commits per month on the public GitHub repo and a successful delivery will be a series of tests published as open-source on GitHub and available for others to use at the end of the project. Given that the tool is being built for the community I would have liked to see some measures of community adoption.  The proposers are active in the community, and I have no doubt that the community would be able to audit them based on the information provided in this proposal and by reaching out on Github and other social media channels.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 17, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 967, "q0": "This is just one of those short and sweet proposals, that you understand what it\u2019s about and why it\u2019s important just by looking at the title. Not entirely, as it\u2019s missing the word \u201cnode\u201d from the title, but almost :-). \n\nThe goal of the proposal is to create an automated testing routine for new releases of the Cardano node software and in the process increase developer productivity.\n\nAs such this proposal is perfectly in line with the Developer Ecosystem challenge as it matches exactly the first described potential direction of the challenge \u201cdeveloper productivity: scripts to automate stuff\u201d.\n\nOn top of that, the proposal does a very good job of explaining how the tool would function and what its impacts could be, beyond an increase in productivity.\n\nThe risks to the project are also very well-identified and addressed. The main one is the difficulty in accessing testnet tokens for the automated tool, but all of them can be dealt with relatively easily, and none of the risks described could end up breaking or stopping project development.\n\nMy review of this Developer Ecosystem proposal is based on my experience as part of the Catalyst community since February 2021 and my engagement with the Cardano development communities since March 2021. I also have experience project managing and working directly with Cardano developers since the summer of last year.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the scope of this proposal is very straightforward, so is the implementation plan, a simple but descriptive 2 step solution that describes how the automation tool will be brought online.\n\nA complete description of the team is given and judging by the provided credentials they seem more than capable of delivering on this project as both team members are experienced software engineers. \n\nI would have liked to see links to support the provided credentials, however, the team members are already part of the community of funded Catalyst Proposal and because of this I will not be deducting any points from my rating for this omission, however, I recommend that the team include them in future submissions.\n\nThe budget estimation provided is very sensible. It\u2019s simple to follow, as it only includes pay for the two engineers working on the project, and the compensation is calculated at an hourly rate of $40/hr, for a total estimate of 130 hours.\n\nTwo new workload questions were introduced in Fund 9, one that refers to previously funded proposals and one that refers to proposals/projects submitted in Fund 9. The proposal has both of them marked as \u201cYes\u201d.  However, no details additional are provided in the main feasibility section as requested when submitting the proposal.

If this will indeed be released as an open-source tool then the proposed auditability metrics make sense, and the number of Github commits can be tracked by the community as evidence that the work is being delivered.\n\nI would have liked to see a more detailed list of KPIs to track while the project is in development but given its straightforward nature, the list of features described in the proposal as definitions of success is sufficient for the scope of this initial release of the automation tool.\n\nMy recommendation for future submissions would be to give some more thought to a more detailed list of trackable KPIs that can easily be verified by the community and be explicit about the license that the project's software product deliverable will be released under.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 5, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4484, "q0": "This proposal requests funding for a test suite of programs that would make it convenient to run each new release of the Cardano node (1.34.x, 1.35.x and so on) with a few very common processes, like minting native tokens, delegating to a stake pool and so on. The proposer is the operator of Viper stake pool (over 2.5 years experience and over 3000 delegations across two pools) and creator of the pypi Cardano tools for Python. As far as Developer Ecosystem directions go, this is fantastic: making devs and SPOs lives easier by automating as routine the regular testing of new releases, on the one hand, and making Python tools for Cardano more accessible and widely used, on the other, having huge potential to draw more proposers and developers with Python backgrounds to Cardano, with the hope that they will use the strong points of their language (such as in data analytics, testing, AI) and the further hope that they will learn Plutus, write wrappers and maybe ways how to add Python to the list of languages that you can deploy on Marlowe Run and in many other scenarios. This would do a great service to our ecosystem, which benefits from the deterministic and mathematically pure Haskell language, but is also held back by the lack of developers who can contribute. Obviously, JavaScript is very popular for its use both on the web and smart contract deployment on EVM blockchains, but it comes with its own issues and vulnerabilities. I see gradually more Python and C++, C# proposals here and think this is a very promising development. This proposal would definitely make the lives of many teams working on Cardano a lot easier, with the bonus potential to contribute to the overall health and growth of our developer ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is Viper stake pool operator, with over 2 years, 3000 delegators and nearly 50 million ADA staked. As Viper Science LLC apparently creator of the PyPI Cardano tools and as Dylan Crocker to Gitlabs Cardano tools. PhD from Georgia tech and 10 engineering experience. It seems highly likely that this profile will be very useful and suitable for the successful implementation of the automated Cardano testing pipeline and testing suite in Python. The second proposer has a background that suggests a lot of experience with testing, quality management and high reliability environments in the software space, and in combination makes this an incredibly strong team for the task. The timeline and budget are realistic. Milestones and roadmap are quite brief, but given the impressive portfolio of previous work and active involvement in the open source and testnet communities not a problem in my opinion. Risk factors such as discontinuation of the faucet are very unlikely, but for dev projects that are this useful, there is always a risk that the project will not be known to enough devs. This may have been addressed and mitigated more, but there are other proposals currently working on improving discoverability and summary of available tools from previously funded proposers I believe. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project provides a list of test transactions that the successful delivery of this proposal should be able to carry out. It would have been great to extend the KPIs to adoption, i.e. public repository forks, stars, downloads, maybe the availability of documentation and possibly even a short Youtube clip showing the implementation. This is a great proposal and the implementation success is highly likely. Auditability is good because the tests to be performed are already defined pre-start of the project. The only possible improvement I see is the adoption and discoverability of this tool, whether devs and SPOs like and use it, and consider it sufficiently robust for the purpose of testing before updating to the new node release on mainnet.

It explained how it provides automated tests run on new releases of the Cardano node in quite great detail mentioning some technical aspects. Besides proving tests on new releases of Cardano node, it additionally serves as a library of documents and code samples of how some common tasks that Cardano developers need. This solution seems to have a huge impact on the productivity of developers joining the Cardano ecosystem.
