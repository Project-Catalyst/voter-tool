As someone who has onboarded themselves via the docs, I can say that even a motivated self-learner would benefit from community and incentives to maintain focus through that process, so I definitely think there is value to be found here.  \n\nLike hackathons, the deliverable here isn't to have a persistent self-guided learning environment that is \"always-on\" but rather to create the content and run the first version of an event-style campaign, so voters should not imagine that this is a constantly running rewards platform.  Like any event it will necessarily have to limit participation (which they do expect to be around 1500 developers, 10% of which will complete the campaign and create a dapp) to the resources at hand, which includes not just the rewards pot but also the roles responsible for validating and ranking submissions and administering the whole thing.\n\nIf there is an issue here, it is that this doesn't have a clear path for sustainability drawn up here (they indicate more funding from Catalyst to continue to provide these campaigns in the future).  Because of this, the only source of scaling would be to build out more campaign materials, when what you really need is to scale towards adding more and more participation to what is already created.\n\nBecause the project is a solid idea for event based onboarding of developers, and because it seeks to reach so many in its prototype version, I believe there is strong impact here.  However, because of a foggy vision of sustainability and scaling I have to mark it down by one star, for a total of 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has already developed the basic prototype for the platform, having run multiple campaigns on HTML, Python and others, so they appear to have a good plan in place.  What this proposal comes down to is really 2 pieces:  create the Cardano campaign module and training guide for their reviewers, and then optimize the tools for onboarding, reviewing and incentivizing the participants.\n\nThe module seems straightforward, and looking at the list of quests for Rust, it seems like they should be able to get a very basic module built out for Cardano in 8ish quests.  The onboarding gets trickier.  I signed up for an access token to the python campaign (which shows that gating quality I mentioned...not a problem, just a limitation) and the questions they asked seemed to be about how to parse the list of applicants down if they had to.  Finally, the overhead for the project involves some kind of hand reviewing of submissions that isn't described here.  The success/fail metrics of such a process seem relevant to me here, but that point of clarification doesn't warrant getting marked down on the proposal.  \n\nAnd then obviously rewards distribution is critical.  There is no indication about whether they will be requiring crypto or Cardano wallets (bonus points if they are) or if they have or need to integrate a payment processing protocol.  It seems like an adapay integration would be ideal, since the money is going out, not coming in, but there are a whole host of issues that this creates.  $30,000 is earmarked for these distributed rewards, and 1500 participants are targeted.   There are real fairness and compensation concerns around basically \"failing\" participants who can only make it part way through the material, and whether there are time limits for retrying, and many more details that actually make this what it claims to be.\n\nBecause there is work already done and the team has a good idea of the team members and roles required, there is a solid foundation for the feasibility.  However, due to the lack of details that would indicate fairly compensated participation, I feel that this proposal loses a star for ability to successfully realize the full scope of its intentions.  4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Outside of the provided website that currently doesn't have any way to contact or learn about the team (you can submit an application for an access token, but that isn't the same thing) there really isn't any presented access to the team or means for them to be available to the community.\n\nThe creation of the campaign module, which will consist of 8 quests creates easily auditable beats over the first 3 months, and then for the last three months it has the quests to monitor, rewards to distribute, so again, it seems like they should be able to measure progress and populate the monthly reports.\n\nThe KPIs they will report are the number of developers to sign up and the number that complete the campaign, among whom, they expect to fork and deveop a Dapp on Cardano, so that also functions as a success metric for measuring impact.  They are targeting 150, which sounds high, if everyone of them is creating a dapp (however many dapps could be personal tools like address or policy queries).  I would have liked to have seen some kind of reference that put the 150 number in context, but that isn't worth marking the proposal down.\n\nBecause the project has included specific targets to reach over a clear timeline, the auditability score is solid, however I have to downgrade it by one star due to a lack of ways to follow the project and because the team does not seem readily transparent and available.  4 Stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "To elaborate on the review process, our team of reviewers led by Rachel Lee (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-kn-lee/) will assess the submission from the students.

To that respect it aligns with the challenge.the dev commenity is relatively small in number for cardano even though almost all of them are high quality devs attracting top level developers to cardano will do a lot of good for caradano.it will bring new expertise and ideas and enrich the existing dev community. However I think the proposed fails to justify why learn and earn approach will attract top-level devs to cxardano.it is that top-level devs are looking for monetary incentives to get involved. I believe that is not the case. Good developers do not have time as opposed to money.For good devs to come into the community.They look at long term prospects,the sustainability of the ecosystem,the quality of the blockchain, the steepness of the learning curve and the cost effectiveness of running projects. Today the delay with Cardano(or any web 3.0 environment) is the level of maturity of tooling, the cost and time required for projects to get up & running. According to me, what the developer ecosystem needs is tooling,open source solutions, knowledge bases, hackathons etc. more than Learn & Earn. Learn and earn can do good not as much as the above approaches. Learn and earn can incentivise users to learn about cardano in general. But I don\u2019t think it is going to result in top-level developer acquisition, a claim made in this proposal.The budget asked for this proposal is 11% of challenge budget.Remember that this essentially deprives other projects in this challenge who may be building a new tool or open source repositories or sharing their tech skills.

Different learning levels like learning exploration and practitioner is good. Breaking up learning into smaller pieces of topics that have a steep learning curve. I have a major concern with the reward: the payout is only 23% of the proposal budget. 73% goes to stack up or the team by the way of content creation , program management, community management ,evaluations etc. This amplifies my concern about whether this project addresses the challenge. 80k towards an existing platform for a total of 30k payout to new developers is a red flag for me. Remember that idea is to bring top-level developers in Cardano as per the problem statement.\n\nThe total platform costs look uneconomical. To call out a specific item reward a pay out to participants is priced at $10k four weeks. This itself looks too much.

Proposer should include each member's name as well as their LinkedIn so that the community can get a closer look at each team member's abilities.\n\nIn terms of budget, it has been divided into main categories but needs to be more specific. For example, for a $25,000 group of 3 people for Content Curation and Refinement of available Cardano resources, the proposer can specify more about the number of hours that each person works in a week and the hourly pay rate of each person. In addition, there is an amount that I think is not reasonable which is spending $ 10,000 for 2 people to pay out rewards to winners in 4 weeks. The project can save more time and resources by rewarding participants with ADA. Each Cardano transaction can transfer ADA to hundreds of addresses at the same time, each campaign participant just needs to provide their wallet address and the distribution of rewards will be extremely easy and fast. Instead of taking 4 weeks and $10,000 in costs, it can be shortened to 1 hour and $100 to pay out to 1500 people. The ADA payout makes the project even more transparent as anyone can check the payout process with the transaction ID the project provides.\n\nAs far as I know, in Fund 9, in addition to this project, the proposer also proposed another project called \"\"Virtual Hackathon for Dev Education\"\".

First, you did not satisfactorily respond to the request \"provide details of the people.\" You provide a list of required positions on your team but do not identify who they are or how much experience they have (except for the Leader whose name is only known by Linkedin link). So, who were the \"10 members with experience running 28 learning campaigns and 79 quests for >30k Web2 developers across the world\" you mentioned? Second, because you have more than one proposal in this fund 9, I recommend you include workload management so that people understand how you will arrange your work correctly. Third, and most importantly, this proposal requests an investment in the education campaign, which entices the developer with a cash reward, and you state that you will most likely return to the following funds to propose other Learn-and-Earn campaigns with a larger audience and a deeper scope in terms of technical implementation. So, is StackUp a platform that can expand and exist on its own in the future if there is no community support? Please consider and explain these questions to improve your proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal specifies the key performance indicators (KPIs) required to track project progress and practical quantifiable numbers to determine future project success. You have solid mental preparation, and the goal StackUp wishes to pursue. However, please include how and where you intend to disseminate information about your project so people can track its development. Thank you for your intriguing idea, and I hope your proposal is as successful as anticipated.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3193", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "From a sustainability standpoint, we do have clients using StackUp to scale their respective ecosystems and the platform is already up and running. This is good for two reasons, i.e. firstly we already have a proven business model and we can sustain ourselves as a business and secondly we don\u2019t rely exclusively on Cardano grants to continue running.\n\nThe team is definitely complete, and we\u2019re sorry we didn\u2019t list every single member in the team as most of the members are responsible for operations. \n\nHere are the key members (StackUp is under Tribe):\n1.

The team intends to build a platform where developers get rewarded in small monetary incensitives when they complete a quest or task. The rewarding schme and the quests intend to be progressive, meaning that the difficulty of the task as well as the reward will increase with time. I believe that this project has the potential to produce great value for our community by keeping developers always motivated and attracting more developers from outside. In this platform, the team may prepare tasks related with the latest trends in the developer community and in this way we keep our developers in constant update and relavant. I believe that this project has the potential to grow in the future and produce a global impact where developers from all around the world can learn and can be paid at the same time. In my opinion, as a developer myself, this project is the ultimate experience, get paid for learning. Very solid proposal impact and I believe it deserves highest mark.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has provided a very detailed timeline and milestones part. Everything has been desribed carfully. It provides clearity on how long will take for each task to get completed. Moreover a very carefully designed budget split is provided. The team requests a total of $110000 which I think is a substantial amount of money, however when accounting the benefits that this project will have on the community I believe it is justifiable. Every detail about where the money is going to be spent is shown carefully. As for the team it is just amazing. The CEO himself is the founder of StackUp and has been recognised by Forbes 30 under 30. After researching the CEO and company in great detail I believe that this team possesses all needed skills and experience to see this project through. I was just impressed from this part. Definitely highest marks.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This part of the proposal has some missing aspects and I believe could have been done better. The chosen KPIs are realistic, achievable and very good indicators of success. The team intends to build 8 learning quests in three different categories that are knowledge based, ecosystem based and hands-on building based. The team has a clear vision of what they want to achieve and their aim is 1500 high quality participants. One thing missing on this proposal is a way for the community to audit the progress of the project. The team hasn\u2019t provided any public channel or anything similar. I suggest they provide a github repository or make periodical meeting with the community member in order to increase transparancy and gain the communities trust.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3478", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "For auditability, we plan to present our results, e.g., key metrics, in the regular town hall so that members can observe the impact of the quests, and subsequent teams formed to join the hackathon as outlined in our sister proposal. We will also work with IOHK to publish the statistics for transparency.\n\nDuring the StackUp campaigns, individuals are welcome to ask questions or get information in our Discord channel (https://discord.com/channels/895564164783808523/895573585484214342) because we open up channels for the students to get help.\n\nThank you for your concern and your feedback!
