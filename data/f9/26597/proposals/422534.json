The proposer correctly identifies that to set up a project on Cardano a list of services needs to be set up and maintained. These services the future proposers will always need. As a project owner myself I very much understand the tradeoff of running the services myself, or relying on a 3rd party infrastructure and would likely rely more on 3rd party if a wider set of services were available and they were reliable. The proposer, however, does not inform the user that there are solutions such as blockfrost.io and koios.rest provide some of these services already and would be beneficial to know how the proposer will improve on top of these services.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There will be four technical to deliver the project; however, only two are identified, and only one has a social profile with meaningful connections (Cong Le). The skill set of the team is not specific to Cardano, which is not critical as they plan to deliver a layer on top of Cardano, but it would have been nice if the team elaborated on how their skill set is enough for the project. The number of suggested deliverables is very ambitious, and I am skeptical that all of it can be delivered within 3 months to a high standard; as an example, a colleague in the Cardano communit is delivering an Android SDK since Fund 7, and this is only one of the deliverables in this proposal. There is no evidence of prototypes or preliminary work done by the team that would suggest that parts of this infrastructure is already working. A monthly schedule is included and a budget break down with monthly expenses for salaries, infrastructure, and marketing. The project's risks are not discussed besides the risk of downtime of servers. The team plans to come back for additional funding to build additional features. Overall the budget is reasonable at $45k for a team of four for three months, but I have reservations that they can deliver the plan within time and budget. I would have liked the team to be more thoughtful in demonstrating that what they propose to provide can be delivered on time", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Yes, a list of deliverables by month and a list of KPIs are provided. The KPI focuses on the usage of the services by the community. A large number of deliverable and a monthly plan makes auditing objective.

This proposal solves the problem of Challenge because it contributes to creating a supportive environment for developers, contributing to attracting developers to Cardano through quality libraries. They came up with a very clear solution to the challenge of creating a library for the three SDKs, APIs and webhooks. The more quality libraries there are, the better supported the development of new dApps by developers, the more high-quality apps can reach the community. The project also solves a major problem that hinders developers when coming to Cardano, which is the problem of costs that can run into thousands of dollars. It can be seen that the main and most important objectives of the project are developers, this is also one of the key development directions of Cardano and Catalyst. Personally, I think that we should not only support this project to grow and expand, but also should replicate the model for many similar projects and many teams developing libraries for developers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project has been implemented with the first steps including setting up a website and building a library.

The proposal also gave a relatively detailed and complete implementation plan within 3 months of implementation, in which many parts of the project were completed by the team before coming to Catalyst. I believe that being funded from Catalyst will contribute to helping the project deploy faster and more efficiently, soon bringing the library to the community of developers on the Cardano platform. A small suggestion for the project owner is that you should add the criteria for selecting part-time Android & IOS developers to the proposal when you do not have these people on the team yet.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project has given a relatively clear implementation plan with reasonable goals and timelines. Information about the verification of the development of the project can be checked through the project's Github channel or the announcements on the media such as Telegram and Twitter. The project also has a set of criteria to evaluate and measure the quality of the project such as the number of registered developers, the number of requests to the server and the data access volume. I greatly appreciate the introduction of this set of criteria because it not only evaluates the quantity but can also determine the quality of the library.

But if there is a platform for both parties to interact with each other, then the information will be contributed by both sides.\nThe project risks are clearly expressed by the proponent. Every risk has a solution. In my opinion, these risks and solutions are reasonable based on the project.

Furthermore, when I click on Twitter and LinkedIn, I still cannot find any information related to the project.

So, DCOne Crypto will attract more users to the Cardano blockchain. I can see that serving that purpose, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge.

The description of the three core team members is pretty brief though, with their position and some profile links only.

Unfortunately, the profile of the technical project lead doesn\u2019t have sufficient presentation of his expertise to see and evaluate his compatibility with the project, while the profile of the system dev is very clear and detailed.

The team uses quantitative key metrics like the data access volume in the DCOne Crypto library for SDK, API, Webhook, the number of requests to the server and the number of developers using the DCOne Crypto library.

The team\u2019s description of their success criteria is even more excellent. They choose and define key metrics to measure their success, like having 1000 developers registering to use their library after 3 months and the uptime is more than 99.99%.I find these criteria great since they are specific enough to audit the project effectively.
