Carp has been delivered, but the dcSpark team is seeking $65,000 in compensation for overbudget work. The proposal does not really identify a new problem that needs to be solved in this challenge, if anything it indicates a possible problem in how dcSpark makes estimates of required funding for their projects. This is not a criticism, but it would probably indicate that earlier bare-bone budget breakdowns accompanying dcSpark proposals may have a consequence \u2013 which is mis-budgeting. The proposal as it stands does not articulate how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem \u2013 as Carp was previously financed and delivered. If this proposal is not approved now, I would advise the dcSpark team to resubmit the proposal to address the real issue \u2013 which might be poor budgeting for Catalyst proposals and improving Catalyst submission proposals. Or else, the team could decide to submit a proposal that focuses only on Carp future improvements and maintenance. As its stands, the focus is on compensating dcSpark for a poor estimate of costs \u2013 which were funded by Catalyst previously. The team has not addressed the issue of why was the previous estimate wrong, by how much, how will such errors be avoided in the future. Hence, without these components \u2013 that look into the financial problems with the original Carp proposal \u2013 the impact of this proposal is very low. Additionally, there is a valuable component of the maintenance of Carp, but it is intermingled with the covering the difference for past work segment. It is difficult to separate the two \u2013 as there is no clear line delineating the costs, so it is difficult to give a positive assessment about EFFECTIVE impact of the work that still has to be performed (excluding the past work that was previously financed). ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Usually, the feasibility segment for dcSpark proposals is relatively easy to assess in terms of whether the team can achieve what they put their mind to. If you don\u2019t know already, the group behind this proposal is a decentralized company named dcSpark that was created when a small group of developers from one of the three core Cardano founding entities (Emurgo in Japan) left Emurgo to set up their own outfit. dcSpark has a high profile in our community as a team that works on critical infrastructure for Cardano (scalability solutions) and the layer two solutions, as well as working on the Cardano Improvement Proposals (better known as CIPs). In fact, dcSpark\u2019s own Sebastian is one of the funded editors (via a proposal that was approved through Project Catalyst\u2019s own Fund 8!). But I digress. The budget for this proposal at hand is $65,000 and how will the budget be used \u2013 well, it is a combination of \u201cpaying us for work we already did that was over-budget\u201d and for core improvements, according to one segment addressing the feasibility. The very next segment inside the proposal \u2013 also in the feasibility part \u2013 states that \u201call funds will be used for continued development of the project\u201d. Hence, one of the problems of this proposal is that we do not really know how the money will be spent. Is it to cover past costs (how much?) or will it all be rolled over to  \u201ccontinued development of the project\u201d? A budget breakdown would be SOOOO helpful in a proposal that has this kind of scope, but alas \u2013 it is not included. The team has included GitHub links to their open source code which is great and allows for monitoring of work. Timetable? Well, the closest to a timetable that I can see is that the Carp-related work has already been done, while the improvements are scheduled for Q3 [ Update to Vasil, update to latest CML that includes the safer CBOR codegen, adding faster re-indexing support, adding more tasks mentioned in the Github issues for the projects]. The budget is not outlined clearly and isn\u2019t broken down into identifiable items. The proposal does not really provide a sensible plan for implementation that shows what is being done but also how and by whom \u2013 and it does not address how has dcSpark addressed the issue of misbudgeting and why are these estimated resources for past work now reliable and why the past budget (funded by Catalyst previously) wasn\u2019t reliable.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This is a non-standard proposal, so that a roadmap is not that helpful as we can presume that most of the funding is going to the Carp development that has already been completed, while the rest is going to fund the Q3 work that will follow from the Vasil update, plus an update to latest CML that includes the safer CBOR codegen, adding faster re-indexing support, etc\u2026 Or not. Maybe the bulk is going for the new Q3 work and only a small part for the overbudget work performed earlier? We do not know. The problem here with this proposal is not technical clarity, I am sure the team has it. The problem is more about the clarity of what costs how much and what new components will be exactly delivered for how much and how will this be presented to the community apart from Github. Of course, the proposed merging of Gihub PRs, closing of Github issues and completion of the core Q3 tasks outlined in the proposal will serve as a great tool to audit progress for the new work. However, how will we measure the budgetary success of this proposal \u2013 and avoid another budget overrun \u2013 and the possible request for more funding in Fund 10 to \u201ccover unexpected costs\u201d. The issue of proper financial planning and a proper financial plan that shows previous expenditures is critical to a proposal that is seeking to \u201cpay back dcSpark for the overbudget work\u201d. Without that, the proposal is not easily auditable as we do not have the financial elements of the \u201coverbudget work\u201d that is supposed to be covered.

I am an active user of cardano-db-sync  as well as the graphql services that  sits on top of it, and find that they work perfectly well.

The project that is the scope of this proposal is an indexer for Cardano called Carp that has been developed by DC Spark and is currently maintained by the company.\n\nThe proposal points out that there are multiple high-profile projects using the indexer that DC Spark created, projects like NFT Maker, which have contributed a lot to the adoption of Cardano.\n\nSince software development can often be difficult to correctly estimate I can easily see how the project ended up over budget and I see the request from DC spark to be compensated for the work they did on this important part of the Cardano developers\u2019 toolkit as totally justified. But far more important than that I think the company should have the resources that it needs to continue to maintain the tool to the highest standards, especially now as Cardano continues to evolve.\n\nConsidering all this I find myself highly agreeing with the impact the Carp indexer might have in the future, with the fact that it's needed and with the perfect alignment of the DC Spark proposal with what the Developer Ecosystem challenge seeks to accomplish.\n\nMy assessment is made from the point of view of someone who has been involved with the Cardano developer space since March 2021 and has actively managed developers working on Cardano projects since July 2021.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a proposal assessor, the task is to look at the info presented in the proposal and evaluate what has been submitted. So even though on a personal level I may be inclined to trust DC Spark\u2019s ability to deliver, that, unfortunately, isn\u2019t sufficiently well presented in the proposal itself.\n\nThe proposal is incomplete without a clear description of the team working on the project and proof of their skills or credentials.\n \nIn addition, a budget breakdown is completely absent.\n\nI would also like to point out the fact that, even though it was a requirement starting from Fund 9, the team did not clearly list or even give a brief overview of the other proposals they are currently working on as previously funded proposals or explain how they will manage the workload of their Fund 9 proposals.\n\nFrom following DC Spark on social media I know that they have sized up to a company of now more than 40 employees, yet this data is missing from the proposal, as is any indication of how they plan to manage the workload.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I do not doubt at all the quality of work that DC Spark has produced and undoubtedly will continue to produce, however, my assessment is for this proposal, and, as such, it\u2019s unfortunate that the data provided in the auditability section of the proposal is minimal at best. My rating reflects that.\n\nAccording to the data compiled by Lido Nation https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/groups , DC Spark is the most funded company/group in the history of Project Catalyst, having received nearly 3 times as much as the next funded company Liqwid. Given this fact I assume that the team is more than familiar with the Catalyst reporting requirements, and I would have liked to see this reflected and presented in the proposal.\n\nPersonally, I view the fact that DC Spark refuses to fully engage with the Catalyst process a bit worrying. On the other hand, perhaps they don\u2019t need to as the voters haven\u2019t penalised them and they have continued to receive large amounts of funding. Ultimately that\u2019s something for the community to decide.\n\nIn addition, given that DC Spark is a large organisation that has received considerable backing from the Cardano community through Catalyst I would like to suggest that they allocate some resources to creating an auditing portal, similar to what other organisations funded by Catalyst have done. This would be an invaluable tool for the community to keep up with their projects and see exactly how the funding they receive is being spent.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2612, "q0": "Developers of projects on Cardano often have to use a tool developed by IOHK called Cardano-db-sync that pulls data from the main network.

Carp was born from proposal #400674; with the enormous work on this project, the amount of money applied for funding at fund8 was not enough to complete. This proposal is to obtain more funds to continue the work to be completed and maintain it. As Cardano has more data synchronization solutions, it helps project developers faster, benefiting the Cardano ecosystem. Because of the importance of Carp, it is used by many projects in the ecosystem.

This is a large project, so many components have been separated into other proposals for funding; through this, I judge that the proponent did not plan to apply for funding properly. With a large project, I am not talking about the technical aspects here, and I am just talking about the planning part of the project that has the potential to make this project take a long time, lacking the budget to implement. In this proposal, I assess that there is also a need for a development plan in addition to the risk of prolonged-time; not thoughtful budget analysis will make the proposal potentially risky behind schedule.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Carp is a project that has built many modules; many components have been updated to Github at the following link: https://github.com/dcSpark/carp.

Therefore, I think that this proposal is in the scope of this challenge. The Dcspark team is known in the Cardano community for building interesting tools in the network as well as contributing to the CIP, among other things. I have to say that I always find their proposals interesting and very useful to the community. That\u2019s why I always try to give them a good rating even though sometimes their proposals are poorly written. However, this time the proposal is well written, which is an improvement from the past ones. In Addition to that, the proposal clearly articulated how it adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. In fact, CARP is already being used by other developers. As they say in the proposal, it\u2019s already a finished product that is already helping others. If you want to know what CARP is, the simplest explanation that I can come up with is: basically it's a tool that helps dapps query the blockchain and retrieve information as quickly as possible. It's more flexible than db-sync which may become obsolete in the future. I have to say that the metrics and goals of this proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. The aim of the tool is to give developers a better and faster way to filter data in the blockchain which will affect performance and user experience, among other things. Altogether, the impact of the proposal is pretty high and I think that the Dcspark team is a great asset for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have high confidence in the feasibility of this proposal. The product in question is already up and running, and it's used by some dapps. I think that it\u2019s a positive sign when a project is already a working product to show for. At least we know that the team is capable of delivering the work. In fact , the Dcspark team is one of the most well known tool builders in the Cardano ecosystem. They have built Milkomeda, the Flint wallet and many more tools that greatly benefit the community. I think that it\u2019s sufficient to have confidence that the team is highly competent to implement the proposal. Regarding the budget, I think that they should\u2019ve done a better job adding some numbers because they claim to have included work that has already been done (over-budget of previous proposal). So basically, in a previous proposal, the budget has been exceeded, meaning that they spent more than they received in fundings. Now they have added the difference in this proposal, but they didn\u2019t disclose exactly how much money the over-budget is. I think that they should\u2019ve included this information for more transparency. To be clear, it will not make or break the proposal, but, it should be a best practice in the Cardano ecosystem to be rigorous and disclose all information and back them by number. The budget is not broken down. In fact We don\u2019t know how they came up with the number. My advice to the team is to add more detail on the budget next time around. Besides that, the product is already functional and they only need these funds to pay over-budget and continue development.

Although they have included some details, they could have put more effort into this. I suggest to the Dcspark team to hire a proposal writer since I see that they usually submit proposals regularly. This will mitigate the risk of not getting funded which is, in my opinion, not beneficial for the community. That said, the entire roadmap and time horizon for achievement is dependent on the Vasyl hardfork which should be here in late july. The Vasyl hardfork is supposed to increase the performance of the Cardano network. The blockchain should be faster and more secure after it. I think that the Dcspark team and many other teams will update their codes to take advantage of these performance increases. In fact the only metric that defines the success of this proposal is the number of projects leveraging CARP, to get faster data indexing. Overall, the tool built by the Dcspark team is really useful for the Cardano ecosystem and for all developers building dapps right now.
