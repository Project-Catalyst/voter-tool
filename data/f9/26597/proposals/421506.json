Therefore, I say that the idea fits with what we are looking for here, because in theory it will attract new developers to our ecosystem; however I think it is also a proposal that could fit well in the \u201cCardano <3 DAOs\u201d challenge, because in my view these meetings and moments were a group of people who are gathered around a common subject and that says about Cardano, that is, the basic principles of a DAO. The proponent well argues the need for a more assertive investment in Houston. He claims that the city is an important economic center with industries of worldwide importance. He also claims that blockchain technology already has a certain space in the city, but mainly through the Lighting and Ethereum networks \u2013 and it is necessary to form a community focused on Cardano as well. The proponent continues his argument by stating some numerical data (\u201cHouston has an annual GDP of US$470 billion (2020) and Texas has a GDP of over US$1.8 billion. Houston has world-class foundations in the healthcare industries\u201d. , energy and space. As a result of its position as the energy capital of the world, it is fast becoming a center of gravity in the nexus of energy and proof-of-work blockchains); such data are capable of proving well why the city is strategically interesting to invest in. He also claims that there are large universities - which may represent a possible qualified workforce that will get involved with Cardano's technologies. We also have to take into account the fact that, as there is already a certain activity in the city in relation to blockchain, even if focused on other networks, this is already a positive point, which can facilitate the adoption of Cardano by the local population (if they already know about blockchain, it is easier for them to understand the advantages of Cardano in relation to other ecosystems). However, some points here should be better clarified. For example in the excerpt \u201cCardanoHTX will form a social network with monthly meetings to inform members about news and opportunities in the Cardano blockchain, provide opportunities for members to collaborate and allow members to promote their projects\u201d. How will these meetings be planned? How to ensure the best possible audience reach? What topics would be discussed at each meeting? It would be necessary for the proponent to clarify how they would introduce blockchain and Cardano to a more lay audience and how they would engage the more experienced audience - we know that there would be these two focuses (CardanoHTX \"Rucks\" and CardanoHTX \"Mauls\"). A positive point here is that the proponent makes it very clear where he intends to go with this project: \u201creach for universities that train students in software engineering, blockchain development, etc; raise awareness and benefits of development in Cardano; publicize educational opportunities and tools for Cardano developers; introduce companies and other entities with use cases to Cardano\u201d and so on. Finally, analyzing the risks, the proponent raises some challenges to be overcome, but does not make it so clear how he will mitigate them all. For example, when he comments that \u201cDevelopers are in high demand and traditional industries may be more attractive than blockchain for many. There are several strategies to mitigate this risk.\u201d What strategies? It would be interesting if this could be clarified. For these reasons, I agree that the project will have a good impact for Cardano, only a few points should have been better explained.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Talking about the script, first of all, I think this part of the proposal is not very ideal. We know what would happen in each month - the time division is adequate, I usually suggest that the divisions be monthly anyway - but it is not very detailed how the activities would be. For example, in the first month, the site would be finalized - which site? In the impact part is not mentioned about it, I would like to know what is the platform being built here and how it would be developed. Locations would be selected, I believe from events - it would also be positive if the proponent made it clear what the selection criteria would be. In month two, the first two meetings would be held, both in the modality for fewer people (focused on developers); and for more people, focused on the general public. I think a lot of information should have been included here, but mainly two things, which I've already started to comment on in the script: how the public would be invited to participate, how to get people's attention, make them stop what they're doing day to day and turn your attention to these events; and the second thing would be the definition of the topics covered, what would be said (for example at the meeting for the general public it would be interesting for them to start introducing about the cryptographic world really by the most basic issues, such as what is blockchain, the what are cryptocurrencies, what is Cardano and etc). And it would also be necessary for the proponent to better explain which subjects would be dealt with in the case to the specialized public, even though he has given us an idea about this in the impact part, for example where developers and entrepreneurs would present their ideas, not it is so clear which subjects would be dealt with - how news about Cardano would be selected and so on. With that, in my view, the script allows us to have a general ideal about what would be done, but not with so much detail about how it would be done. Moving on to the next topic that must be analyzed, which is the cost vision: the asking value for the project is very affordable, it is approximately 7 thousand dollars; compared to most Catalyst proposals, the project is low budget. The amount is divided into a few parts, and as with the roadmap, we know how that amount would be divided in a general way, but not in such detail. For example - meetings would cost 250 dollars (for developers) and 500 dollars (for the public); why is the amount requested to organize an event twice as much as the other? About the printing of materials for the handout, what would this handout be? To whom would they be distributed, and how many, approximately? A large part of the whole is requested for co-sponsorships ($1250). But it is not clear what that would be, who these sponsors would be and what their roles would be in the overall project. And finally, analyzing the team, this is the part that leaves something to be desired. We know who those involved are, but little information is available about them (\u201cJohn Jackson will coordinate the group and its social networks. I will organize the meetings. Alexisthe.dev is developing the landing page website. Jim Flint is the marketing director. of the Texas Blockchain Council (TBC) and advised on the group's marketing strategies. I will coordinate the co-sponsorship with Jim\u201d). It is not clear what the professional background of each member involved, if they have any relationship with Cardano in the past, how they would be qualified to execute the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As with the two previous topics, we have some ways to audit the proposal, but some improvements would be needed for this part to be ideal. Starting with the auditability of progress, it is possible to understand which partial results would be responsible for the progressive success of the proposal; the proponent provides us with a lot of numerical data that could be collected, such as the numbers of \u201cmembers registering wallets on Catalyst, developers referred to education programs (e.g. pioneers, GimbaLabs, Emurgo, IOHK), emerging projects (count in survey sessions)\u201d, as well as more direct data such as the number of participants in the meetings, for example. All these data are valid and important to be monitored, but that is not all that is necessary to understand if the project is being properly developed. The activities behind these partial successes would also be important to measure, what would be done to make these successes possible? What would the work routine of the 3 team members presented here be like? In my view, that should be clear too. It would be important for the proponent to maintain a bridge of communication with the members of our community, for example at the end of each month, so that we know what was done in the month; for example in month 2, what would be the marketing campaign to promote the meetings, how this work would be developed. Moving on to the second part of our analysis, which is the success scenario, the proponent again suggests some KPIs that could help us understand the ROI of the proposal, such as: \u201cco-sponsor with TBC, 1st in Month 4 and 2nd in Month 6 + introduce 100 people to Catalyst + 3 projects started in month 6 + creation of support network for projects (web and application developers, legal and accounting services, marketing)\u201d. However, in my view, two important things are missing here. The first one would be 1) how will the Cardano community have access to this information? 2) it is necessary for the proponent to understand how the people who were attracted to Cardano would be getting involved in the community and in the projects, that is, if they would have become PAs, or sought to learn more about our ecosystem and started to get involved with the projects of the Catalyst\u2026 how can we understand that the main objective of the proposal - to spread Cardano throughout Houston - would have been adequately achieved; and so we can gauge what the specific goals of the challenge would have been as well - this would be clearer if we had information on how the developers brought into the community would be doing their jobs. For these reasons, I believe that some things could still be improved in the way of auditing the proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 730, "q0": "Yes, the proposal identifies that even though developers might be able to work in a decentralized fashion, communities thrive on face-to-face interactions and local social events draw new people into the community. This lines up with the challenge setting of encouraging community and conversations between developers. The proposers plan to create a social network with monthly meetings to inform members about Cardano's news and opportunities and allow members to collaborate and promote projects.  I think this is an excellent initiative and increases collaboration between developers, which is conducive to more projects being launched on Cardano. I attend several online Cardano events but am also always on the lookout for physical events to meet people face-to-face.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, The proposers identify themselves. There are three of them: John coordinates, Jim will be the director of marketing and Alex is a developer. A short bio is provided for each; however there are no links to social media profiles. The skill set is sufficiently diverse to identify what each one will do based on the project plan.  The project plan is well organized the first month will be to finalize the website and other preparations, and from month 2 they will start hosting the event. The different types of events are thought out. There will be the shorter Rucks events and the longer but less frequent Mauils events.  The total budget is set at just under $7,000, which will cover a total of 12 events. This works out to just over $500 per event and seems reasonable.  They will also design a logo on Fiverr and print handout material at $200 each, which is well budgeted. The proposers highlight that the key risk is developer scarcity as they are in high demand and might not be able to attract enough for these events. A way to mitigate it is to engage professors at school and promote the events within the Cardano Community.  Overall, the proposal is planned well, and I don't see any problem then delivering on it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the delivery on the project is planned over six month where the first month is preparation and the events are held after that. The KPIs and metrics are very detailed, they plan to track the number of contacts in the database, the number of attendees at each of the meetings,  number of members registered with catalyst, number of new developers attending the events, and the number of new projects arising from these events. They provide details in terms of the number of attendees for each of the events and expect this to grow month-on-monthk,. They also want to see three project initiated by end of month 6. These detailed metrics show that the proposers know what they need to achieve the objective.  Given these will be public events, I think the community will be able to audit the proposal without difficulty. If I were in Houston, I would go to one of these.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1755, "q0": "The problem is straightforward and aligns well with the Challenge as it aims to create an essentially community-building space. Having experience as a community organizer in a major city myself, it was clear while reading that there is a passion in work mentioned in the proposal (starting in the problem/solution statements) for organizing community and bringing people together for such a purpose. This energy will keep the team going in difficult times that are a part of any social-building process.\n\nThe positive impact could be seen as very local to Huston at first. As well as the elements of gaining sponsorships and other means of funding is an overall value-add for future Hubs. It doesn't hurt that they are asking for such a low budget compared to the total pot, either.\n\nThe team's KPIs are surely inspired by the Dev Ecosystem Challenge, guiding questions of Prioritization of tools, attracting devs from outside the community, and so on.\n\nThe plans are sound, with metrics tracking what seems to be at the \"heart\" of the ecosystem-developing proposal. Scaling in Huston and beyond are apparent; the proposer appears to be setting the project up with a roadmap including sponsorships beyond the Catalyst funds. As an executive member of a few organizations over the years, I can offer some advice on unexpected sponsorships. I've found local actors, athletes, and artists can be a great place to source \"silent\" sponsorships. Such individuals are looking to support meaningful local efforts (like the work of CardanoHTX). If you are a non-profit, remember that for tax purposes, the period from mid-October to mid-December is a perfect time to approach such sponsors since that's when they will be looking.\n\nVoters will be happy to see a multi-faceted approach to mitigating dev scarcity. Targeting professors and students and sharing the incentives possible will surely be a great place to start by attracting young devs that can indeed be advocates in their own respect to their like-minded peers. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is detailed and offers insights into all critical areas for planning. It would be nice to see all 12 events scheduled in the project (at least informally). It seems that is what is meant by \"continuation?\" The intent is there, but remember, if rewriting, that a more detailed view would fit the ask of the section a bit better. The outcome reports for the proposal will be of more value to themselves and Catalyst at large.\n\nTo the voters, with a background in event logistics/community organizing myself, I can say that the budget is reasonable and broken down well for what it is. The team is frugal (using Fiverr and utilizing such venues) and prizes growth over time: both an excellent fit for Catalyst. If the team were to add a 5%-10% line for contingencies, it would be in line with industry standards.\n\nThe team seems well-rounded and has enough support to reach its current goals. The skill sets needed are kindly offered during the team members' introduction and the role they will play.

They also, together, define what success of the project will be by helping the team read the reality of the #'s of attendees, wallets, social engagement, and so on.\n\nA tip about \"self-reported\" wallets: Offer an \"I was here the 1st year - CardanoHTX\" NFT to any wallet created during the events to encourage members to create wallets and have a reason to report them (so you can track that stat for auditability). If timed right, a sponsorship of even $2500 would likely cover the costs.\n\nThe team may want to consider a Gitbook, or monthly vlog to update the community and further their commitment to auditability.

As a developer I think this is an amazing idea, and I only wish this to happen in america as well as it has already happened for me in europe. I can verify that having a community will enable much more colaborations and progress happening in a shorter timepan, which is important becuase the cardano ecosystem has the label of moving slow, and it's time for that to change. I'm sure this is one of the right paths to take towards that goal.\nI like the research done in order to make sure the city is a good place to start a community in and having the right people already in it. Universities are always a good place to start so I'm 100% onboard with this idea.\nThis proposal is absolutely in the right challenge and is aligned with the challenge settings, because you can't have a bigger and better improvement in the developer ecosystem than bringing in more developers and thinking people over to the cardano shore and inspiring them to colaborate. More often then not they inspire and motivate themselves, you only need to do a little push in the right direction and I believe this proposal is that push.\nAs a developer I don't have any concerns about this proposal and I believe it's inspiring and necessary to have these hubs all over the world.

There's an iterative approach to the tasks and they build on top of eachother so it's all good and optimized.\nOn the matter of the budget... it's cheap and well defined and reasonable. I am no expert, but I thought some of the items are more expensive than I saw them in the porposal, so it's all good. The cost per value ratio is really good and that alone is a point up.\nI managed to verify some of the pointed out team members because there are no professional links with credentials provided so I googled what I could which was only John Jackson.

Although they have a developer who will be in charge of the platform development, venue and meetings organization could be harder than this team is imagining. A strong marketing and social media is lacking in order to get these venues to be crowded. Key milestones aren\u2019t really detailed and timeline planning seems too optimistic. Further plan organization and a more consistent down to earth and experience backed up budget breakdown seems to be lacking for this proposal to be successfully implemented. Venue organizing should not be taken lightly in order to be feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Presented numbers are sufficient to measure success of the venues but there are KPIs missing in order to audit the progress of this proposal. Again, in order to get to successful venues there must be some successful previous work that should be measured and shared within Catalyst.

Further communication work within the Community might be necessary to ensure compliant auditability.
