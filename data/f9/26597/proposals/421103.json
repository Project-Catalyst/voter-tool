While the intention of keeping the community safe from potential scammers is definitely laudable, I view the approach that the project chose to take as potentially problematic and as a slippery slope toward creating a bottleneck of placed trust into a centralised unelected entity. They are nominating themselves to be the arbiter of what is and isn't a \u201cscam'' on our blockchain. What happened to decentralised and permissionless? What qualifies them to take on this role, simply the fact that they have the technical know-how to create the database can surely not be it.\n\nThey correctly compare their plan to the Cardano Token Registry, but fail to identify why they are not in the same position. There are two key attributes that would make the two databases very different from one another in practice. The Token Registry Is maintained by the Cardano Foundation, which by default as an organisation, has to have the best interests of Cardano at heart - it's simple - if Cardano fails, it fails. And second, the Cardano Foundation has the resources to maintain the database indefinitely, whereas the proposing team only commits to maintaining the database for the next 6 months. What happens when the 6 months are up if they are not successfully funded a second time? This is not even identified as a risk in the proposal, I might add.\n\nBut the proposers do have a point. The Token Registry is manual at the moment, and they are proposing a semi-automated solution. This will probably be needed as the number of native tokens on Cardano continues to increase. However, I don't view the creation of a separate database as the solution. In my opinion, it would be much better to collaborate directly with the Cardano Foundation and try to automate their process.\n\nThe risk of not having the database adopted by the developer community is correctly identified in the proposal however I find the plan to mitigate this risk inadequate.  Transparency alone is not enough for developers to become aware of your product and motivate them to adopt it.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts are that the implementation of this proposal would not actually be an aid to developers working on Cardano, it could actually serve as a point of confusion, especially if not adopted sufficiently, and because of this I don't think it meets the requirements of the Developer Ecosystem challenge.\n\nMy assessment of this proposal comes from my background as a project manager collaborating directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have engaged with Project Catalyst, in almost all roles, since February 2021 and my involvement with the Cardano development and NFT communities started more than a year ago.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The implementation plan for the proposal does a pretty good job of presenting the overview of the steps that would be needed to deliver the token database, however, it's not very detailed and it's only a bullet point list. Having said that, the plan only covers the technical development and maintenance of the database, without considering its promotion and the work that will have to be done to ensure its adoption. So I view it as only half complete. Why should the Cardano community allocate funds from its treasury for the development of code that just sits unused in a GitHub repository?\n\nThe budget is pretty straightforward, covering the two main stages of development identified by the team, but again, it fails to allocate any resources to the work that would have to be done to ensure that the database is actually adopted by its intended audience.\n\nThe proposal unfortunately does not provide a clear description or short bios with credentials (preferably accompanied by links to professional profiles - LinkedIn), of the team members working on the project. It simply lists the roles needed to get the development done. All is not bad, however, as the team does provide a link to their current project built for the Cardano ecosystem, so we have some reference to previous work.\n\nFund 9 saw the introduction of two new questions related to the workload on other Catalyst proposals and workload management. The proposers have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the one about other Fund 9 proposals. However, after searching the profile of the main proposer, marcosantos, on the Catalyst community resource website Lido Nation, I\u2019ve found that this is actually his first-ever submission to Catalyst. In addition to that he also doesn\u2019t appear as a co-proposer on other proposals ( https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/2145 ). So the new questions may have been misunderstood by the proposer or he may be referring to another member of the team. Either way, more information is not provided in the text of the Feasibility section as requested. But, because the questions are new to fund 9 I will not be subtracting any points from my score for this. However I do recommend that the proposers include them in future submissions.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I have found the auditability section of this proposal to be very lacking, instead of presenting KPIs or trackable metrics the team simply repeats what the main steps of the project are and assures us that they will produce documents to \u201cmeasure\u201d them. \n\nHowever we are not told what those documents will be, what exactly it is that they will measure, and how and by whom will the measuring be done. These are all details that I strongly recommend the proposers give more thought to and include with their next submissions. Perhaps try to think about what it is they would like to see themselves from a proposal successfully funded by the community treasury. What reporting commitments would they like to see? And answer guided by that.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1390, "q0": "Yes, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge by creating a common open source repository for developers and community members alike to identify potential and known scams across the ecosystem.\n\nThe team is correct in stating that with 5M assets on Cardano, we are beginning to see an influx of rip offs and copy cats, this is not only terrible for the developers who have been scammed but also for the broader ecosystem as people may be deterred from using Cardano due to the scams. By creating a repository of known and potential scams, the community could have peace of mind that their wallets and assets are free from scams.\n\nWhat I would have liked a bit more is an explanation of how their project fits in with their existing beerhouse.io platform. Looking at the site it appears only specific people (staking to a particular pool or purchasing the $PINT asset) are able to use it. Whether this would be expanded or a new platform created is unclear. What could also be more further developed as to how they foresee this project being adopted by those who it is designed for. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, given the experience and plan presented it is not clear whether this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nThe plan leaves much to be desired with only high level goals to be reached, but no indication of what is required to reach them or how much time the project will last for. I'd suggest providing additional details to this section so that voters and readers alike aren't required to guess what is necessary at each step. \n\nI think that the team also could provide a better explanation of the team members themselves. While it's good to know that you need one project leader and two developers, there should be some names to go with the roles, and then provide some sort of way to check that they are who they say they are. As written none of this is available and it is unclear who comprises the team and who will be doing what. \n\nGiven that these two major components are largely missing, I remain neutral on feasibility. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.\n\nWhat allows me to select four stars rather than three in this section is the team's commitment to making the repository open source and public through github. The use of open source tools as the default provides the community with some confidence that they will be able to explore and engage the project as it develops. However, without this piece, the rest of the proposal is very unclear as to how it would be audited. \n\nAs written, all we know is that the team will track the four stages and measure the documents in a \"qualitative way\", but there is no explanation as to what they mean by qualitative in this sense. There are also no linkages between the what is listed in the indicators section and the success measures. While it is good to say that success is to have membership similar to the Cardano Token Registry there are no actual thresholds or indicators. Are you going to be replicating the indicators on Cardano Token Registry on your platform? Will you track # of views, assets listed, scams found...etc..? I would encourage the team to provide actual milestones, indicators, and deliverables so the community can get a better sense of how this project will be implemented and audited. \n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2233", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4214, "q0": "The \"Asset ScamList\" proposal addresses the Developer Ecosystem challenge by creating a github repository containing all tokens identified as scams, rugpulls. They modify their cardano-db-sync to ignore these deceptive tokens using their developed 4 rulees (similar names, similar image and similar description and policyid). The idea is similar to cardano-token-registry and flag assets with 4 flags (no flag, ok, alert and scam). They will modify their bots to interact with this repository and alert for the tokens that need reviewing. The database option is perceived as a risk for this project but they will try to be transparent in creating and maintaining this data bank.

This database could be accessed by anyone to evaluate the validity of a particular asset. The author is also aware of the hesitation of the developer community towards a tool such as this and confirms to make the creation transparent so as to instill a sense of trust across the community. The author provides a gist of how the validation process will be conducted and against what criteria each of the assets will be evaluated.

Also, the detailed plan is not detailed in any way, there are only mentions of the different phases of the project without any tentative timeline to assist the claims. The same goes for the budget breakdown too, the amount is a pretty huge one and apart from a vague division of funds, there is no compact evidence to show the justified utilization of the funds. Also, the author mentions that there is no need for further funds and the project has to be maintained by the community itself. He/she also mentions that there wouldn't be a need for further contributions, so how exactly the registry/ repository be made more effective as the complexity of assets increase in the future.
