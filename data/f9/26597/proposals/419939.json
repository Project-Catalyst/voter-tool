The challenge has a DEFI and tokenisation category to which the proposal fits perfectly. The problems that the proposal tackles are a lack of transparency and the need for intermediaries in commercial real estate. A solution is a smart contract that in turn provides yield from real estate.\nSuch a system if implemented and adopted will surely increase tx count and provide wider ecosystem benefits, in particular, due to linking digital to real-world objects.\nThe proposal is intended to be implemented in phases and is part of a larger development. Further development will be covered potentially by Catalyst, founder\u2019s funds and investors thus, in turn, securing continuous development.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team has provided relevant experience in various fields such as blockchain, real estate, facility management, mobile and web development others. Unfortunately, no public profile links were provided to verify the claims. The team members are disclosed, each with a short bio.\nThe overall development plan consists of 2 phases, with phase 1 being the focus of this proposal. The phase 1 includes the making of the platform and generating the token to be used for raising capital. Phase 2 will implement the actual smart contract and provide utility for the token. The implementation will be with the storage facilities, where team members already have experience.\nThe budget is detailed and covers each action to be taken as well as the planned timeline. Already the founder has committed personal resources for some of the milestones which shows dedication and belief in the project execution.\nOverall, the proposal is sufficiently detailed, although more technical details in regards to the implementation and the platform would be appreciated. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The monitoring of the progress will be available via concrete metrics in funds raised as shown on the project website. 100k per month is a target to be achieved, which is a concrete value to judge the progress by. Another proposed metric is Discord users, which is a more unreliable way of measuring traction. I would propose focus on more utility-related measures such as stores rented using the token system or similar when the platform allows it. As most might be available in Phase 2 of development only, a number of users visiting the website, creating a wallet and using the interface might be the best metric to measure success. As described in the Milestone 2 goals.\nThe success of the project is defined by the onboarding of high-net individuals already in the real estate industry, which will expand the reach of Cardano to non-crypto users.\nI would recommend a schematic for easier following of the various phases and milestones of the project. It was difficult to read and find what this particular proposal will be funding in the grand scheme. \nLink to Miro board required registration, so I would suggest to extract the GIF/JPG next time and have it as attachment and review for those PA that do not use that particular software.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2093", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 721, "q0": "The proposal does not address the challenge setting.

I suggest the proposer looks into the challenge setting dedicated to Dapp development & integration in future funding rounds. I don\u2019t think the proposal addresses the challenge setting. The proposer articulates how it will add value by open-sourcing the code but also states that in previous rounds, they did not receive funding due to the proposal being submitted in the wrong category; this time, the same seems to be the case.

The budget of $25k thought in this proposal is lumped into one paragraph to deliver the Website, Wallet interface, and Smart contracts. This budget breakdown is overly generic and does not provide the hourly rates that will be contracted or other details. It is not clear why the budget could not be higher or lower; it is unclear if the budget would be enough to achieve the goals. I would suggest the prosper focuses on detailing how the proposers will spend the money. According to the proposer\u2019s timeline, they aim to achieve everything in the proposal in July 2022, which seems a very short for the large amount they aim to deliver, and July is already upon us. I have experience building websites with wallet connectors and smart contracts, and I would not expect to complete this in less than three months. An execution plan with who will deliver what is lacking, the proposers also state that they need to hire a CTO for the project. The proposal does not go into detail on technical aspects such as architecture, language, and technologies. The proposer highlights the risk of security vulnerabilities in their smart contract, regulatory risks, insufficient adoption, and community selling the platform tokens too quickly in the next bull run.

If this idea would get adoption or traction, I can imagine that it can be interesting for owners and users, because participation in this ecosystem would generate STOR tokens that could have speculative value.

Regarding the success metrics, the proposer states that each phase will have their own success criteria, but from my perspective, in relation to the proposal and funding to it, the only success criterion will be working website + all the features that are planned to have.

The token will represent fractional ownership of these self storage facilities and investment alternatives for people interested in financial sovereignty. The proposal mentions that the SToR token ecosystem will benefit Cardano immensely as it brings investors, private equity groups and venture capital and a prototype for other asset classes. The proposer mentions risk of this project as the platform being hacked, regulation and compliance with the SEC and lack of interest in the platform and lastly, the liquidity of platform from token speculation. Although the commercial real estate is used to pilot this project, the investors in SToR tokens will definitely want to know its intrinsic value, the distribution of tokens and how much is their fractional ownership into the property, how they can liquidate their holdings. There are a lot of technical details involved in applying the blockchain technology with property sector (in commercial real estate in particular) as the regulation keeps changing. When it comes to asset backed securities (token backed by properties in this case), it is important that the team perform due diligence on the true owner of these properties. The team also would have to convince the SToR token holders (investors) that the security for their platform is not compromised else it is unlikely that they will want to risk their savings into this novel area. To summarize my points, this developer ecosystem challenge goal is to grow the developer community or to build infrastructure that facilitate work of developers. Although this proposal involves website and Tokenization, it is not directly geared towards helping developers and hence might fit better with the Dapps, products and integration challenge. Anyway, I appreciate proposer attempt to bring blockchain technology to disrupt property market and hence the solution satisfies the challenge quite well in the sense of achieving the end goal of Cardano adoption.

The team has yet to provide token work-in-progress link.(miro board is not sufficient)  In December, the platform that lock their token should be available. The funding they apply for in this proposal is for phase 2 which is for website development, wallet creation, interface and smart contract. The team would need to explain how the come up with the requested budget of $25000 (rate per hour, number of hours into the project, how many people to be paid). It would be good for the team to add some links of their team members for this project and to breakdown the budget clearer although the project has a lot of periods that are self-funded.

They are trying to set up youtube channel and podcast (number of view, comment & subscribers) each month. They will pitch to investors at least 3 times per week. In phase 2, do the full evaluation of fund coming into the platform and locked and perform yearly audit. They will add 1-2 facilities per month with the aim for TGE in next quarter.
