Many performance / cost optimizations are not currently possible.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.761904761904762, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 117, "q0": "The team behind this proposal is putting forward a very interesting idea, which to develop a stripped-down version of the Cardano node that will serve as a data source for different tools but unencumbered by some of the superfluous capabilities of a full Cardano node. To spice things up further, this will not be a stripped out version of the existing Haskell Cardano node, but a new Rust-based Cardano node that will effectively host and continuously update a copy of the live Cardano ledger while also being able to respond to queries from trusted clients. And that\u2019s it. Effectively the team endeavours to deliver a limited and focused version of the Cardano node. Why? Well, this will enable developers to utilize less resources to run a cost-effective node for limited purposes as a data source \u2026 independent of the regular and existing producer / relay nodes. I can see how a project of this ambition could help the Developer community, including enterprise projects that rely on querying the blockchain \u2013 for internal or commercial purposes. What is the true benefit, you \u2013 the voter might be asking yourself \u2013 well, it is that this will allow teams that use Cardano to be more resource-efficient. As they will have a cheaper way to access ledger data as they will be exposed to lower infrastructure costs \u2013 benefiting the smaller and medium-sized teams the most.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal was submitted by an experienced and small developer team named TxPipe, who claim they have already created projects such as Oura and Pallas. The focus of this team is developing open source tools and infrastructure for Cardano developers. TXPipe has in its focus primarily backend development, data pipelines and cloud architecture. I explored the team\u2019s achievements and they are \u2013 in my view - a valid testament to their skills and interests. The team has already developed a nice range of tools such as Scrolls [a backend tool for building and maintaining read-optimized collections of Cardano's on-chain entities], Oura [a backend tool that allows the creation of off-chain applications that 'react' to on-chain events], as well as Boros and Pallas [used as a base layer to facilitate the development of higher-level use-cases]. This is a team that knows what needs to be known for a project of this scope. The team\u2019s commitment is to develop tools that \u201cremain open and free forever\u201d. Win-win for the team and for Cardano. The team has included links to their website and to their GitHub repository. The proposal is requesting $75680 to create an open-source project using Rust as its main development language to deliver a novel type of Cardano node that is currently not available in the system. The team has given us a detailed timeline that consists of three key milestones \u2013 glad to report that this open source project will be delivered with technical documentation and a full documentation site. The team has given us a budget breakdown \u2013 presented in an admirable fashion. The hourly rates per role and person engaged, as well as the number of hours they will be engaged. The names of the team members and their relevant experiences have been provided. One thing I would add, if this proposal is resubmitted in the next Fund (and does not get enough votes now) \u2013 is the links to LinkedIn profiles or professional biographies of the people involved \u2013 as a confirmation of their relevant experience. Transparency and feasibility = high marks! ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is an amazingly well presented and digested proposal. It has a clear value proposition, a clear problem it wishes to tackle, a clear deliverable that it wants to contribute as an open-source contribution to Cardano and a competent team that wishes to deliver it. It will provide a detailed roadmap as part of the open-source repository and each milestone will be presented as a partial but working \"release\" within the repository. Milestones will be tracked via Github \u2013 while the Catalyst community will be able to use the team\u2019s Discord server for communication with them. I commend the team for thinking proactively about the entire community \u2013 not just the Developer community \u2013 as they said they intend to post weekly update summaries via the TxPipe twitter account \u2013 which will allow the general Catalyst community to easily follow progress in development. In my view the team has offered a very good solution to the problem that they identified \u2013 how to offer performance / cost optimizations to the Cardano blockchain through the creation of nodes that can be used exclusively as a data source for client tools. If done correctly, this could be another game changer for the Cardano blockchain \u2013 as more node implementations and more variation in the available tools \u2013 will create a more resilient and diverse system. The team has provided accessible public channels for delivering regular updates to the technical and to the non-technical community for auditing progress.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2047", "no_vca": 22, "ne": 13, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3565, "q0": "The proposers want to create an efficient cardano \"data node\" meaning it's a node that's going to specialize in answering data queries integrating into the ecosystem. As a developer and an economist I'm a big fan of specialized labor. That means that each job that you specialize in can be done better and in combination with other specialized jobs is giving more work than the individual sums combined. I do believe a specialized cardano data node or some other form of optimized data keeping tool will be necessary in the future, because as time progresses the data in the ledger becomes more and more and it's harder to query overtime unless some optimizations are done.\nThis project absolutely matches with the challenge settings and the category it's in. It's going to prove invaluable to all parties that are going to take a advantage of this specialized data node. The team does have a good explanation on how they're going to bring value to the ecosystem which I totally agree with. One thing I'd suggest to the proposers is to keep the proposals smaller if they have a suspicion of not delivering the whole package as described in the proposal, but since this would be sort of an MVP that could evolve into an enterprise solution I'd say that's not so big of an issue, but it's something to keep in mind nonethe less.\nThe metrics seem reasonable, although I didn't see anything about measuring adoption. As a developer I'm really happy with the level of technical detail and I don't see anything missing from the proposal. I think the impact would be noticable and this proposal is worth funding.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There aren't links for all the team members, but I was able to verify their skillset based on their names and a bit of googleing, and can say that they all got the skills listed in the proposals, but for future proposals I would really appreciate if there are links to all team members in a proposal, because that makes my life easier. The team skillset and combined experience brings the feasibility of this whole project up.\nI like the very detailed plan of action includingg a roadmap, detailed milestones and individual tasks separated in decent timeframes and workable chunks. The budget breakdown is also reasonable and for the hourly rate and the work that needs to be done. One thing I would advise against is reverse engineering. I realize there might not be a documentation, but consider the fact cardano is essentially an open source project and you can just ask instead of trying to reverse engineer protocols. I'm speaking from the position of an embedded developer that has done reverse engineering and knows exactly how hard it can get. If you can avoid it, try that first, because you'll always have the option.\nI also like the regular releases based on the milestones listed in the proposal. That makes following the progress of the proposal so much easier and show the cristal clear plan that the authors have about the development. The ease of usage is another point I wanted to bring up, because as a developer I can concur I'd much rather use something that's fastt and easy to use than setting up for a week to do something elementary like querying some data.\nThe fact the team has a discord channel really makes me feel it's possible to have a good feedback and development loop, which is the definition of agile development beeing the standard.\nOverall all technical aspects of the proposal are described and that makes the proposal as feasible as it gets. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability will not be a problem considering there's an open source public github repository linked in the proposal and a discord channel where problems can be discussed. Combine that with the promised regular reports and anyone interested in this solution will be able to keep up with it constantly. As I already mentioned there are detailed milestones and a timetable to make any other proposer feel envy, so I don't see any issues there.\nThe problem is well defined, which is more than I can say for a lot of other proposals and the solution is really detailed and technical, which I can appreciate as a dev and an assessor.\nI like this proposal and you have my vote.

The project has, however, the potential to enable further use cases of a \"data node\" further down the line and might become very impactful for development on Cardano in the long run. Short-term within the 4 month timeline of this proposal, the project has the potential to significantly improve the ad hoc scaling and efficiency of backend tasks and queries. By promising to do so, this proposal is extremely well aligned with the Challenge Setting, as it would increase efficiency and give a powerful new tool to many smaller to medium sized development teams on Cardano. In this sense, this is a project \"by developers for developers\", Open Source and targeted, so more efficient, more creative, and more advanced dev work will result if the proposal is implemented successfully. By its measured presentation and very specific direction, the proposers stay true to the \"Cardano Way\" but at the same time have the potential to make a significant improvement within less than half a year that the dev ecosystem could then build on.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The existing portfolio by the team, including the highly-regarded Oura backend tool (169 stars on Github) make it highly likely that the Dolos project could be carried out successfully at least as a proof-of-concept with the existing team and planned hiring of one additional Rust developer. The team is transparent about its members and collaborators and seems to have the experience and skills required to make this proposal into a success. The proposal is extremely well written. It repeatedly states the scope and limitations of the proposal and also mentions risks and how they would be mitigated. The budget is presented clearly and broken down into items and over time, providing hourly rates. Costs other than payroll are not including, so I assume that they are absorbed by the respective functions - it would have been nicer to get a rough ballpark about any such items separately. Sufficient budgeting has been done for project management and potential blockers, without being excessive. The documentation, company website and Github presence of txpipe are impressive and give me confidence that the funds requested would be deployed responsibly.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A lot of the audit of this proposal will rely on tracking the progress of development via Github and Twitter updates. The Auditability information provided in the section is relatively brief, referring to previous sections. Although readability could have been improved by repeating or summarizing all information relating to audit and progress tracking, sentences like this show the thought process that went into the proposal and the well-calibrated risk mitigation measures: \"Our development process will include performance benchmarks execution at each development milestone.\" provided under \"Impact\". The scope of the proposal is made very clear, highlighting what will NOT be provided and what the risks and limitations of the planned implementation and proof of concept are. In my opinion, this is an excellent way to write a proposal and -given the supporting links to existing projects on Cardano provided- give me high confidence that the community will be able to follow the progress and direction of this project closely.  The three milestones of this project contain a timeline over four months of development work, so all the information necessary is there, although readability could have been improved by stating the timeline or providing a project phase diagram or something like that.
