Meanwhile, the end-users struggle to query complete raw data from the blockchain.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.666666666666667, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3268, "q0": "This well-structured proposal is a request to add 3 \"modules\" to the Koios ecosystem (a blockchain query system with the ability to self-host).  We'll describe the modules and their impact individually, but what unites them all is this idea of significantly improving developer productivity.  The first module builds into the REST API many of the functions that developers build out themselves, which will both invite more detailed use of the API as well as save countless hours of duplicated work across processes.  The second adds bot functionality (along with a hosted instance) for Cardano communities to adopt for queries, again, avoiding massive duplication of effort.  Finally, the third module adds a sustainability and maintenance factor to Guild oversight of the REST API, while creating tools to speed up many internal or local functions such as stake address queries (and the addition of local notifications will be a huge hit!).\n\nThese modules touch on end-users and average users, developers and projects large and small who want to reduce code dependency, and as such has subtle but far reaching impact.  The alignment with the challenge setting is solid, and because the deliverables feed directly into the ideas of creating a more productive and developer-friendly ecosystem, I believe it deserves full marks for Impact.  5 Stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budget/timeline integration is a bit tricky here.  80% of the project is delivered in the first 3 months (the bot integration and addition of Utilities to the API) and the line items for those budgets, total $25k, covers the maintenance and support for them.  After that, all of the funds are for the 9 months of the timeline remaining in the year to fund the updates/maintenace to gRest.  In practice, the first 3 months will likely be under funded (at only $15k), and the last 9 months overfunded.  I will assume the team is prepared for this Catalyst-specific imbalance, and will be able to get the work done in the first 3 months to be paid later, or adjust the timeline to finish the bot integration out to 5 or even 6 months.  I see nothing in the proposal or in the community that makes me think such a delay would be significantly impactful.\n\nAnother area here that is both tricky and interesting is the \"team\" component.  It would be tempting for a PA to leave feedback saying that no team details have been included, however, when one looks at Guild impact via the work done to date, and takes into account the aliveness present in the repos underpinning the Koios and Guild ecosystem, I think we can safely say that this \"team\" is the best of what opensource and decentralization has to offer.  Any concerns that this idea of a submission team will lack accountability is mitigated by the same team's successful funding round last August, a project delivered complete in just 6 months of its 12 month timeline.\n\nBecause this team is able to provide extensive evidence of ability to deliver and because the architecture behind the milestones and intentions of the budget are reasonable and concrete, I believe this proposal has a high likelihood of being successfully executed.  5 Stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The 5 deliverables are clearly stated again for reference, which is appreciated.  The opensource repo for tracking is already available and the descriptions of the deliverables leave no room for doubt about having been successfully delivered.  That they managed this in a statement about the more abstract task of maintaining and updating gRest deserves a kudo.\n\nIn addition the Guild community has maintained a bi weekly meeting for a while now where anyone can join and ask questions or get updates on the current state of Koios, or progress attained.\n\nBecause the opensource milestones are so clearly described in the proposal, and because the team has a history of availability and transparency, I have no doubt that this project can be successfully tracked to a likely completion, and I give a full 5 stars for auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3534, "q0": "The proposers want to extend a distributed system in the form of microservices into the existing koios functionality to avoid duplication in logic between builders and to make raw blockchain data more easily queriable for users. This is a fine idea and would really bring benefit to the cardano dev community. Users will also benefit a lot, because ease of access is always a good thing to educate one self.\nI had the pleasure of assessing their work in fund 6 and I hope my positive review helped them to get funded. I like this proposal as well, because it's well thought out, if a bit to big. I can see now the adoption since fund 6 took off and they have a lot of contributors, which is greate organic evolution. As a developer myself I welcome any tools that will make my job easyer and moreover will help me learn quicker by abstracting away some of the comlication.\nThere were a lot of simmilar proposals the last round, but as I did some research this is one of the few remaining that actually survived by proving themselves. I'm a fan of empirical data, because it's hard to argue with it and the data has spoken, koios is good enough for growing the ecosystem. This is absolutely the right proposal considering the challenge settings and development improvement and ease of usage is what they're offering so I have no doubt on the impact they will have, because I can look back to the impact they already do have.\nOverall I like this proposal and believe it to be impactfull and successful. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team members and contributors probably have a combined experience of over a 100 years, so you can't argue with the swarm and the data. The tool is evolving rapidly and has lot's of contributors so I'd call it probably more than feasible. The credentials and skills listed bring the probability way up.\nAs a dev, I'd have to say the proposal is very well thought out with one minor caveat I'll mention bellow. I love the idea about the distributed system to compliment the ideals of the cardano community. It's clear the proposers have done a lot of thinking when douing this proposal and they've outlined 3 problems that need solving and have provided 3 individual yet, complimentary solutions. I still would suggest to breakdown this proposal down to increase your chances of funding, but it's just a suggestion for future proposals. Incremental small changes are way more likely to happen and leaves you time to think more and code less, therefore saving a lot of unnecessary work. Even so this proposal is great and has only one caveat I can see. \nThe budget breakdown could have been dobe better. It's hard for me as an assessor to compare the hourly rate with other proposals since the way information about the budget is provided is not detailed enough to allow me to make that calculation. I don't know if the hourly rates are reasonable, although by rough calculations they are. That's a minor thing, but it is proving to be a standard to list all work in hours and then give an hourly rate for each type of work. That makes the end calculation and verification much easyer. So please do it for your next proposal to make life easyer for us assessors :) \nAll technical detailes are mentioned, there is a very very detailed explanation in the linked site if anyone is interested. Overall a feasible proposal, I'd deffinetly vote for it. Good luck.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Open source github - yes. This should be all the answer to all questions of the sort \"can i track the projet progress?\". Even so there are non-tech savvy people and the proposers have taken care of them by doing a telegram alert bot. That brings up the question of: why isn't everyone doing this, because it makes following the progress of the proposal a breeze and it's not that hard ot timeconsuming to do. \nThere are also open meetings and that is more than enough to keep up with the project. The roadmap is good and people can follow along. The proposed problem statement is well defined and the solutions to the brokendown problems are well defined and explained as well.\nOverall a love this proposal, it's impacfull, it's feasible, it's auditable, it's 5/4.5/5;", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8859, "q0": "Running a queries over a large data leads to lot of confusion as many developers use different variables , every variable might not be knowing to people who run queries ,so even while developing sometimes developers might use the same variables name which might end up in overlapping of data and even start to generate errors in the code.\nHence to develop an idea where proposer team wants to extend microservice branch into Koios ,so that it will reduce duplication of work and developers can use the libraries in most of efficient way, where they dont need to waste time on writing same old codes hence this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Setting up libraries is never an easy task as it needs to fulfill all the API's parameters and security protocols, and API's should also be easily communicated with Web so that data storage or data interaction with backend can be smooth and easy.\nThe team already have experienced community members who have independently contributed SDKs, CLIs, and integrations, with the previous work efforts seen the team has steady increase in adoption curve without putting as much effort into visibility and marketing.
