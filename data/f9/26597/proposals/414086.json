The proposal will improve overall developer experience on Cardano, as detailed in the impact section of the challenge settings. As a senior developer myself, I fully understand the need to improve and expand the testing automation and testing edge cases, especially when we are talking about mission critical systems, and in this case DeFi apps, where people's money is at stake.\n\nThere are certain limitations with tools such as QuickCheck, used for property testing in Haskell, as it can say tests are passing even though edge cases are failing. With Apropos metaprogramming toolkit, the proposal is looking to expand (an already used in production code) with a multiset of new features, thereby making it more feature rich and easier to integrate by the future dApps teams.\n\nThe proposal identifies a problem of being able to write robust and future proof off and on chain code, something that has been significantly came under attack in other chain DeFi applications. Therefore the impact of this proposal will help build teams more secured, and trustful apps on Cardano. Additionally, this framework is open source and a testing framework, it will not be an issue to scale to future challenges. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has been made by the MLabs team, and they have not only contributed to various projects in the Cardano ecosystem but also received funding in previous rounds.

The respective set of features that are planned, should this proposal be funded, are provided well in detail. \n\nAs per my own developer experience, I find the budget breakdown in total hours, timelines and costs to fulfill those hour/timelines justifiable. \n\nThe risks are considered to be low as per proposal writeup, and since they have larger development teams from where they can pull in more expertise and developers, seems justifiable for making this a low risk project, so it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap with feature sets are clearly explained, and this is split into 1-4-8 months time frame.

To address the requirement of fixing security holes of dApps, the authors have proposed the development solution of Apropos - which is committed by the team as \"a super application programming toolkit\" (in beta stage) to generate thousands of property tests from a logical model (QuickCheck style). The aim is, to help reduce the burden on Cardano's Haskell/Plutus developers, ensuring critical dApps do not contain vulnerabilities. In fact, as we know, the logical model is quite complex, representing thousands of solutions that need to check properties and generate errors. Corresponding tests to look at every contract permutation and edge case state would consume a lot of programmer energy and time. It is still possible to miss errors. Meanwhile, using QuickCheck today, although highly reliable, is cumbersome for Haskell developers. The reason, is that they have to generate large amount of attribute tests manually. Therefore, I believe that this solution will be a useful tool to help simplify and automate the attribute checking process, reducing the time and burden for programming language developers on the ecosystem our Cardano. In the early stages of testing, Apropos uses a model-testing approach to determine how to code, the authors say. In the next stages of development, the tool will continue to be refined to contribute to building dApps on Cardano, including: simplifying the API, expanding support for script testing, modeling and transaction graph\u2026 I appreciate the impact of the proposal in an attempt to come up with a useful solution for secure programming of dApps. In fact, right in my country - Vietnam, where the cryptocurrency adoption rate is among the top in the world according to Chainalysis (https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index) /), is also home to many fast-growing blockchain projects, the level of investment for the security of blockchain projects is not high. Blockchain startups can spend an average of $1000-$20000 on smart contract completion, but haven't invested in security yet. Usually, after the project develops, attracting more investment, security holes can become dangerous problems. So with the important role of the solution, I rate 5 points in the impact section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the proposal, the roadmap and budget given by the team is logical and wise. The development process was built by the team into 3 phases (1/4/8 months), starting with GHC support, tool testing support and finally feature completion after 8 months. However, what I am not clear about here is that the proposed launch date of the proposal is some month 2022. This information is not mentioned in the implementation process. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the time the project will likely be completed. As for the team, they are compiler developers and advanced Haskell/Plutus engineers, whose project was funded at Fund 8. Team profiles are full of reference links included.

Or, there will be a minimum of 20 issues discovered and resolved during the 8 months of testing and finalizing the solution.
