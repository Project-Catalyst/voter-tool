The problem statement just catches my attention when it states a very realistic situation happening not just in Vietnam but also in many other developing countries. He mentions that the talented Vietnamese developers are prevented from reaching the Cardano sources due to the lack of Vietnamese Plutus programming language documents. I think the problem quite fits with the challenge for these reasons: supplying right documents to train developers is crucial as it is a way for them to approach new knowledge. Moreover, thanks to the suitable document they can access the Cardano ecosystem and contribute to our community. In my opinion, if we want to attract Vietnamese developers to build new dApps on blockchain Cardano and create values to make the Cardano ecosystem more diversified, we first need to make these Plutus programming languages accessible. In fact, one of the obstacles in training developers in non-native English speakers is the lack of solid understanding due to the language barrier. Therefore there should be pioneers in this field gathering together and help connect the developers with the right knowledge. Not just so, with the fundamentals of Vietnamese translation, there will be a wave of translations of this document into other languages at the request of the community of neighboring countries so I think this initiative is very promising. Having realized that, the proposers give out a solution which is to have their talented team translate IOHK\u2019s pioneering Plutus course videos into documents for Vietnamese developers and I strongly believe that this is a practical solution to access a mass number of developers in this situation.  In order to train Vietnamese developers to be more qualified and effective, the proposers state that they will recruit people with specialized knowledge and test them with a specific test to assess their ability. Their professional test showed me that they do prepare for what they are doing and they will still stick with this project whether being funded or not. On the other hand, the points  like how the proposal affects the challenge and the risk could occur are described in very rich detail making me believe that they have deeply researched their work and will make it deliverable. I totally agree with the main rirsks they state which are the learning ability varies among individuals and the slippage of ADA. It is true that we are not the same in terms of consuming knowledge, some could learn faster, some could learn slowlier so their solution of creating a group to discuss and solve the questions about the lessons is practical; They also ask for a reserve fund to deal with the ADA fluctuation and this is a typical way to solve while we are all in financial decrease. For these reasons, I believe that this proposal deserves the maximum score in impact, its premise is extremely useful for Cardano and it can achieve the specific objectives of this challenge\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of the viability, I consider the provided information to be quite comprehensive and illustrates what would occur throughout the project development process in great detail. We are aware that there are 4 quotas, the first of which begins in 2022 and continues until quota 3 in 2023. The milestones are appropriate when the first two quotas emphasize hiring and training in addition to translating and publishing, which, in my opinion, may help to maintain the caliber of the final products. When it comes to the activities that were described, this section is great because we already know that each quota will be allotted to them. I really appreciate how those tasks had explicit KPIs to hit, as it demonstrates the team's crystal-clear direction. For instance: ten translators, one technician, the total minute of translating is 1980 minutes. Moreover, the criterias to rate the translation are clearly described, based on that I believe we could control the quality well. Now let\u2019s talk about the budget breakdown, the total amount is $13,900, accounting for 1.39% of the total budget.I assume it is a very fair price considering the size and complexity of this idea, and it warrants the financing because I believe it will really benefit Cardano. When the justifications for the money are broken down into tasks, they are quite gratifying. There are 5 tasks and each task contains the money to pay for each x with the specific minutes. Not just so, as I have mentioned before, there is a $1000 fund to backup incase of ADA slippage showing the careful preparation of the proponents.Overall, it completely satisfies our need to understand how the money would be spent. We now look into the team members, there are 2 professionals Do Manh hung and Do Manh Cuong beside the translation team called FIMI. Given that we are aware of the trio's professional credentials, complete confidence is conveyed in them.They have knowledge in the financial field, technology and programming. They are also the direct trainers about blockchain courses and the Cardano community managers. Their translation team showed me a strong experience in not only translation but also blockchain, especially Cardano one, they\u2019re learning the Plutus Pioneer course organized by IOG.. With the tasks clearly assigned to each member, I think it is easier to control the resources and the products made. As I research, I figure out that this FIMI project used to be funded in Fund 7, they have other proposals and other more projects under construction for a long time ago. For example they have a Youtube channel with more than 15k subscribers, own their website and groups on Telegram with thousands of members. I just wonder if they can share a bit more about how they could manage their workload if there are other proposals and projects like that. In summary, there are many initiatives about translation but I found this one of the best among those because they convinced me by quantitative data and realistic evidence they have been making so I would rate a maximum point for this part.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project's supporters list four ways to track progress, including the creation of the KPIs mentioned in the preceding section: \"The number of videos released on the YT channel, the number of developers who interact with the Plutus program through videos, the number of reactions to each video on Youtube, and the total views of the published films.\" Their Youtube account makes all the data and information available to the public. In other words, all the methods for measuring, analyzing, and reformulating the project are described, making it crystal evident to the Cardano Community what should be prioritized as each project phase advances. Looking at the final results, the team explains in more detail what would need to be done in order to achieve similar results, such as the Plutus programming language being available for the Vietnamese dev community. They are returning to join the Plutus programming language learning exchange group.Yes, I think it's conceivable, I'm just suggesting a specific rate of increase in the number of people joining and discussing the group over a certain period so that we can have a wider view through the project.Since this is a continuation of their Fund 7 funded project with 3666 minutes of quality Cardano related videos, I believe this can again be measurable and with a high likelihood of success. I think the auditability of this topic is very accurate and provides us with all the information we need to safely go ahead with it.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3750", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2866, "q0": "I believe this proposal highlights the problem the community is facing in the following excerpt: \"It is challenging for competent developers in Vietnam to access Cardano's new initiatives and activities due to the lack of documentation on the Plutus programming language in Vietnamese.\" Therefore, this proposal was created to provide reliable resources on the Plutus programming language in Vietnamese for the community in Vietnam. I think this is a good and rewarding idea because Cardano's translation of documents from English can break down the language barrier, giving more people the opportunity to work on this platform and work on it. Beginners will not find it too difficult. Specific evidence for the above opinion is the link to a video about the Plutus language that has been translated into Vietnamese and the response of the community based on the interaction and ease of understanding of the content (https://youtu.be/gxqXTYGDwuU). In addition, although there were problems such as the ability to receive information from each person, this problem was also neatly resolved by setting up a chat group so that everyone in the community could answer each other's questions in the fastest way with diverse information sources. In other words, this is a great idea because it can meet the two main goals of the challenge: to make the Cardano ecosystem diverse and to attract the community to access this decentralized technology platform. Because more people know the Plutus and Cardano languages, the buying of ADA will increase, smart contracts will grow, and there will be more potential future Dapp projects with smart investors. As a result, I think this plan merits the highest effect rating possible. From the standpoint of a commentator, I'm a little curious about how the suggested topic would prevent being copied by others and misrepresenting it for harmful objectives, like defrauding the community.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed route is described quite reasonably. I can completely determine what activities will happen when and specifically for how long. In addition, the proponent also wrote down the goals to be achieved in each timeline, such as: needing 20 videos to be translated into Vietnamese by the fourth quarter of 2022, with a total time of more than 400 minutes. With the Youtube link (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyi5FmVh6aFY2pWM0EI8Vg), I can easily check the completion of the proposal's goals in minutes with some simple math. Financially speaking, $13,900 is not a little sum, but it seems appropriate given how intricate the idea is. The project owner is to give a fairly clear expenditure statement divided into several sections to explain the need for a large capital. For example, $2000 for the IOHK Plutus Pioneer Program brochure, $7920 for the translation, with a total duration of 1980 minutes,... However, I think a few small explanations are still needed for each item to make it easier to understand and rationalize the amount stated. Even though there are still a few spots where the details are lacking, I believe that this group's financial resources will be properly protected. Speaking of personnel, I believe that a team of about 20 translators with a deep understanding of the Cardano chain and 2 leads with expertise related to the proposal will accomplish the main goal of the project well. I am aware of everyone engaged, including their names, skills, and previous experience. Furthermore, the unique part is that the two founders are from very diverse professions, thus the presentation, translation, and correctness of the content are all very well ensured. I also received a link to verify the identity of the project owner (Mr. Do Manh Hung: https://t.me/Hung_DoManh). In addition, an increase in the number of interpreters is possible if the community is expanded and the need to access Cardano, the Plutus language, is increasing for personal development. Besides, there is a question that is based on which criteria and tests can determine the knowledge level of translator candidates. My only suggestion regarding this project is that a few more professional interpreters should be provided so that everyone can check their translation experience and achievements. This will increase the accuracy of the translation. project reliability and feasibility. From the above, although there are some points for improvement, they are not significant. I believe that the feasibility of this project reaches a perfect score.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Referring to the successful progress of the proposal, I get a few specific metrics, such as: the number of videos posted, views, and comments. These metrics are easily visible on the project's Youtube channel, but I don't have an idea of specific numbers, so I can't consider how successful the project's progress is. So I suggest giving a specific number so that everyone won't have to wonder when assessing progress (for example, a successful project in terms of spreading Cardano to the community is when the videos reach 1000 views). The success of the project is related to the problem of the challenge, which is well described by the fact that the community of Plutus language programmers will expand with the growth of Dapp projects and the popularity of the Cardano platform among the community of Vietnamese. However, my advice is to have a specific file to illustrate the increased number of programmers and projects related to the Plutus language after the project so that we can easily assess the actual success of the project. Moreover, how will this result file be published to the community? Is it posted on Google Drive or the community Telegram channels? In addition, for a previously funded proposal (funded in Fund 7), I believe project transparency is reflected in the metrics that have not been neatly aggregated from the test product before. Therefore, this proposal deserves to be clarified for the Cardano community in Vietnam so that everyone can actively participate and upgrade their knowledge. Although there are some shortcomings to make transparency more obvious, I believe the proposal is still worthy of appreciation in this respect.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2354", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12463, "q0": "The proposal fully meets the challenge to develop the developer ecosystem. Along with the amazing development of blockchain technology and crypto in recent years, the need to learn programming languages \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bof major blockchain ecosystems like Cardano is also increasing. The Vietnamese developer community is also tending to gradually switch to blockchain technology because of many potential benefits in the future. According to the most recent survey, the number of programmers in Vietnam is about 430k, which is not a small number compared to the number of programmers worldwide (~ 26.9 million in 2021 according to Evans Data Corporation report). But currently, there is a barrier named language that makes it difficult to access new programming languages \u200b\u200blike Plutus. Sometimes it also leads to misunderstandings, and incomplete understanding of knowledge causing a lot of time wasted in learning. Therefore, creating subtitles for programming tutorial videos is a very good idea and solves the outstanding problem for Vietnamese developers to contribute to the building and development of the Cardano developer ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is totally feasible. In terms of solutions, the proposal to solve the real problem that Vietnamese developers are facing is the language problem. In Vietnam, there is a fact that the developers are good at their expertise but their language is not really good, and vice versa. So writing subtitles for video tutorials to learn Plutus programming is a very good idea. Regarding the team, the members of the project team have many years of experience with blockchains such as Mr. Hung and translation experience. They have a team specializing in translation called the FIMI Translator team. Therefore, the implementation of the project is very easy and feasible. The budget breakdown is clearly planned and detailed. One small point, the proposer should divide the budget by anecdotes as the roadmap has given, it will have an overview and be easier to calculate.\nI really hope the project will be successful", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project can be easily auditable.

The translation will be done by recruiting people with good translation skills and knowledgeable in the field using test (links provided in the proposal).

This proposal is aligned with the challenge settings main objective of \u201cmore developers would be drawn into Cardano\u201d by giving avenue for developers in Vietnam to access resources regarding Plutus to make products (i.e. dApps) in Cardano and in turns attracts new developers to widen the outreach as well further the innovation and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem.

The project will be implemented in the span of 12 months divided into 4 quarters starting in Q4 2022 with every quarters having the milestone of publishing 20 videos (~20 minutes each video) with Vietnamese subtitle. It also goes over the 10 translators and video publisher recruitment process.

However, I\u2019d have liked more details regarding the budget for brochure which comes out to 2000 USD.

The metrics chosen by the proposer were well defined and relevant to measure the success of this project regarding the working efficiency of the translation teams (via the no. of published work), the outreach it has (via views metric), as well as the quality of the translations (via the viewers response in comments). The Youtube channel can be viewed publicly so metrics such as views can be tracked easily. However, since the recent change of the platform where the dislike is only available to the creator, I\u2019d have preferred if the proposer provided a way to provide metrics such as like to dislike ratio in a report since viewer response in Vietnamese (which is the primary audience) will be hard to track for community members that aren\u2019t able to speak Vietnamese.

The proponent raised an important and quite interested issue, which is: \u201cThe scarcity of documentation on the Plutus programming language in Vietnamese makes it difficult for talented developers in Vietnam to access Cardano's resources\u201d. I agree with this opinion, because Vietnam is a country with an abundant human resource market, focusing on developing many industries, in which information technology and programming languages \u200b\u200bare fields has great potential. However, at present, there are still many cases where Vietnamese developers are having difficulty finding documents to study. Searching for documents in Vietnamese sometimes can't be found by developers or if they are, they won't have as many data sources and diverse content as documents in English are a common language. This will affect the research process and the work efficiency of developers. Therefore, translating IOHK's pioneering Plutus course videos into documents for Vietnamese developers to easily access and learn, I find very reasonable and necessary. The proponent has given the criteria for recruitment which are people with specialized knowledge and good translation skills. The quality of the translation is also given by the proponent with criteria related to accuracy, timeliness, interestingness, and spread. Moreover, IOHK company is a familiar company for many people, this is a leading Cryptocurrency research and development company, and they focus on building technology solutions to promote the development of the financial sector. Therefore, I think that translating IOHK's course videos for documentation will help Vietnamese developers have a reliable and quality data source. If this proposal is successfully implemented, it will not only have a positive impact on developers such as helping them get access to accurately translated videos, and have the opportunity to socialize and develop themselves, but also influence Good for the Cardano ecosystem because it can attract Vietnamese developers to contribute their ideas, thereby making the Cardano ecosystem more and more diverse. The solution proposed by the proponent identified most of the problems of the challenge. By presenting the actual situation to emphasize the impact of the problem. To successfully implement the project, the proponent also anticipated the risks. There are two main risks given that are the self-learning ability of each different developer and ADA slippage. Each risk has associated remedies. I think that this detailed and thorough preparation will help the proponent proactively deal with difficulties and limit risks.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a detailed action plan and a specific timeline. The implementation process is divided into 4 quarters, starting from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the end of the third quarter of 2023. Each of those milestones has been set with very clear goals and tasks as well as the results to be achieved. The process of all 4 quarters is mostly iterative, so it is easy to track and check. However, in my personal opinion, if possible, the proposed team should have a smaller timeline, such as monthly. The work of a quarter will be broken down by month, it will be convenient to control time and quality, ensure that the implementation time is always in the plan, and avoid letting a small segment deploy too long will affect the progress and results of that quarter. For example, the fourth quarter of 2022, still includes 4 tasks as mentioned in the proposal, but the recruitment and training of translators or technicians are only fully mastered in the first month, the remaining 2 months will focus on translating and publishing videos with Vietnamese subtitles. Regarding the budget, the team also provided a detailed and reasonable allocation plan and the intended use of each part of the budget. However, based on this plan, I see that the translation portion is 1980 minutes x 4$ = 7920$. Is this part of the proposal including the human cost of translators and other resources to serve the translation of documents. In my personal opinion, this part, if possible, should be divided into 2 different expenses, it will be clearer. Moreover, the cost to pay for the translators, the group will plan to divide equally or will be based on any criteria. I think that this part of the human cost should be evaluated based on the work completed and the quality of each good or excellent translation, thereby encouraging the spirit and enthusiasm of the translators. Similarly, video editing and publishing need to be separate for each technician, or the cost of each published video. The plus point of this budget plan is that the team has set up a slippage of the ADA reserve fund, I think this is reasonable and necessary because the market always fluctuates daily and hourly, so this risk cannot be avoided. This preparation will help the team always quickly and flexibly deal with unexpected situations. The participating team includes Mr. Do Manh Hung, Mr. Do Viet Cuong, and the FIMI Translator Team. Their identity information is easy to verify via youtube channels and other social media. I believe that with the experience of the teacher and the team, the probability of success of this project will be enhanced.

The success of the project is also clearly defined, by the fact that developers have access to the Plutus programming language, and their interest in and participation in the Plutus programming language exchange groups. This proposal is a continuation of the one that was funded in Fund 7, they translated 3666 minutes of the videos and have a link for everyone to access and check.

I think the proposal will have a very positive impact on the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems as it will bring in a number of potential and knowledgeable people to be able to create Dapps. The KPIs are also compatible with this challenge at Fund9, the goal is to recruit qualified translators and publish 80 videos with Vietnamese subtitles in the next 4 quarters. However, I have a small suggestion, the proponent should add 1 KPI to the measurement, which is how many accounts/visits these videos are expected to have, this is a very important indicator to measure the success of the project because we can create professional videos and translations, but if it reaches a small number of viewers, the project will not have a big impact.

Overall a good and auditable proposal. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 16, "ne": 3, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2875, "q0": "The mentioned solution from \u201cPlutus Video Sub for Vietnam Dev\u201d is considered acceptable as one of the major problems in the Ecosystem is information equality among developers. By the fact that only a minority of devs who had their mind experienced the cohort from IOHK makes the distance seem larger, especially for non-English speakers like the Vietnamese. While it\u2019s true that there hasn't been a specific amount of documentation in Vietnamese about Plutus programming language we ought to mention also the fact that this needs to be specified correctly. Knowing the fact that not every developer is in shortage of time and access to information sources but comparing to documentation is readable and less time-consuming rather than a singly translated piece of information, will the proposal be capable of doing that? One bright point for this proposal would be its community spirit as they stated the formation of developers after their documentations are delivered to the needs. Therefore, it\u2019s appreciated that learners can have a forum to share their ideas and knowledge with each other and make it more applicable. Speaking of Impact, it\u2019s very clear that the proposal carefully weighted their section for both developers and the whole Ecosystem, they passed the prerequisites for the challenge by attracting developers to build on Cardano. Furthermore, making comments on their risk management section, while the backup budget is understandable there should be an explanation for the part that stated \u201cThe self-learning ability of each developer is not equal\u201d. From the beginning the problem statement wrote \u201c..makes it difficult for talented developers in Vietnam \u2026\u201d, this is somewhat a contrast to their targets. Do they want the products to be delivered for developers who are able to self study or for those who aren\u2019t? This makes a lot of sense about the way they make criteria for whom and which purpose.

As the proposal could be inferred, there are qualified people on is leading this project, FIMI (the translation group) is a very large and well-known community in VietNam where their youtube channels is known to be a reliable source of information for most people who are interested in Cardano, Blockchain and Finance. Mr. Do Manh Hung and Do Viet Cuong, from their profiles in fimi.vn are also provable in their academic and professional backgrounds that would benefit their community. From the said points, it\u2019s very important to emphasize that if one\u2019s proposal aimed to universalize knowledge, their community is very crucial since their products need to be consumed, and Fimi had their problems tackled earlier by already reaching the 2.740 members in their Telegram group. Moving into budget, the requested budget is 13.900 with clearance in minutes of translation, edit and video publishment. While their $1000 reserved in budget seems to be measurable the consulting fee needs to be specified to which people. For instance, this refers back to their group profiles that should be included. Besides, what particular type of consults would it be ? Is it documentation, video or other consults? From this point it\u2019s alright to reduce 0.25 start points. Looking at the project road map which has been divided into 4 Quarters of the year 2022-2023, the only difference is that Q1&4 still targeting member recruitment while the remaining quarters are oriented to be productivity. The overall translated video is 20 x 4 = 80. As their timeline and ke milestones are pretty clear, the unclear part appears to be \u201crecruit more members of the video editing team\u201d. From their definition of what is \u201cmore\u201d, it should be measurable to PA for example, the estimated percentage of their human resource for that particular field that needs to be increased in a specific amount of time. By this criticism, it means that the project could be really problematic if the human resource increases on a fixed budget so the proposer has to be clear on this point, by that -0.25 star points. From Fund 9 documentation for PA there also exists the measurement of technology involvement for each proposal. Within the PA perspective, this proposal targets on number and translation quality but they should also focus on the transparency of their project. For example, what technology is used to accelerate the translation process and what is used to be reviewed afterward, and they should recall the fact that with human beings the middleman in the process could make the whole translating mechanism being erroneous. If this is a proposal to address an ecosystem size challenge instead of a community one, they must have their mechanism shown in the proposal so people can understand and audit to better their system, by that -0,25 star points. \n*4.25 stars -> 4 (round up)\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The provided KPI addresses their quantity in their video goal and views, comments.

It allows potential Vietnamese program access to documentation scarcity of plutus language through IOHK\u2019s pioneering course videos. \nFirstly, to ensure the translation quality, the proposal solutions hire a professional staff with a deep understanding of specialized and good translation skills. Likewise, the test https://fimi.vn/kiem-tra-blockchain/ will be judged on the following 4 criterias: accuracy, timeliness, interest and spread. However, I would like to add that the team should check the grammar, misspellings or coherence of the passage to ensure the content of translation based on a check app or platform. Besides the caption form, they can translate Voiceover clips in order for the developers to have the right choice. \nSecondly, The proposal affects 2 main objects, namely the developers and the cardano ecosystem. It not only allows the developers to access translated videos, but also helps them become Plutus program language developers and have a great chance to exchange and discuss to develop themselves. As for the Cardano ecosystem, which will become diverse and more developed with the efforts of the products of the new developers. \nIn terms of the risks, the team is aware of the challenges that have to face in the future and give solutions to solve it. They divide small groups of trainees to exchange, discuss and study together to ensure the equal of the self-learning trainees ability. However, I think that they should have other solutions before dividing small groups. To be more specific, they can assess the programmer's ability at the beginning of the course for an overview, then, Level division. Besides, they also can open private forms about the feelings of each programmer after a lesson or course to the programmer can share difficulties or challenges during the study period. Following this, the team will give solutions to solve and improve the course quality. Meanwhile, the proposal asks for a backup budget to prevent the slippage of ADA. And, I think that they should regularly read news, especially finance to update the economy situation and Stock to avoid open trade into volatile markets. Overall, these solutions that I mentioned, I think I can support the team a part of somewhat to make this proposal become better.

The first point is that The plan showed detailed information namely timeline and key milestones about the project. To Illustrate, the team points out the activities of each quarter in 2022- 2023 such as hiring and translator trainees, video publishing technicians, translation video and videos with Vietnamese subtitles. While the team also implemented a proposal that was funded from Fund 7, 6 proposals in this round and continue to apply for investment in the next rounds. Therefore, I believe that they had experience, definitely target, serious with these proposals and they were aware of the potential of the development of the Cardano ecosystem. \nIn terms of Human Resources, Each member has a clear mission and ensures completion on schedule despite carrying out many projects at the same time. Meanwhile, Do Manh Hung, Do Viet Cuong and the FIMI translator team are the main responsibility for this project. They have enough ability to lead the team and deep understanding of their specialized( community management, Plutus and Haskell Pioneer, teacher, influencer, translator and blockchain document). And also give solutions if someone in the team does not get a job done in the long-term, the member in FiMI team will support and always enough staff to fishnish the proposal. \nNext, the proposal mentioned the spending activities in a clearly, transparent way and suitable for the total budget $13900 that the team described before in the project. They listed the budget for translation and edit and video products, but did not mention Salary for employees because in the planning part they will require 10 translators, 1 video publishing technician in quarter 4 in 2022 and more members of the video editing team in quarter 1 in 2023.

And, it is based on 5 factors, namely: stable code, simple code, testable code, team velocity and knowledge share to apply the following. At the same time, in the last fund, they had more experience to complete the proposal and SDK JavaScript is an example, which leads to the simple and direct way to build a SDK for language based on logic and the same modules.\n \nThe proposal also designed a track tool to check the emissions finish on time, tick off each task done per module and as for delayed emissions, they will give solutions to solve it through meetings. The success shows the Python SDK established and already available in Hippocrates infrastructure for the developers.\n \nPersonally speaking, The Hippocrades are aligned with the SDG purposes and allows all people to access healthcare data in a security and safety way.
