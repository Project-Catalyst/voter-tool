That's a worthy idea, although as a CA for the last 4 funds I've already seen quite a lot of these hacathon ideas, and having it online is harder than having a phisical location. I'm sure if this proposal is successful this would bring great benefit to all participants. I do have my doubts about the feasibility of such a project though. The team could have come up with better KPIs IMO because branches in github is not a good indicator of work being done. I'm saying this from the point of view of a developer. Currently I don't see enough specifics about most of the parts of the proposal. I realize the idea is great, but the execution could be better. Maybe the operations manager can have a look at all proposals to bring more operational details and explanation in this and future proposals. There aren't enough hachathons, that's for sure, so I'm rooting for this proposal to succeed where others have failed. I wish you the best of luck in your endevour. Overall a somewhat impactfull idea, with some work needing to be done on the details side.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have posted links to their linkedin accounts, and I do remember reviewing their proposals from last fund, and unfortunately the quality still needs improving. I'm going to say more of the same arguments of the last funding round. There needs to be more details when you're creating a proposal. If you're a voter you want to see where your money would be spent for support. With the future inclusion of quadratic voting it would be even more important to convince the voters of the value of any proposal, because there's going to be more and more of them. Having said that the budget needs a lot more details to be provided to be on par with the best proposals I've read. 50k for prize money, great, but why not 10k ot 20k? 8k for marketing - but there's no specification of what marketing tools would be used to promote this proposal - goodle adds, or social marketing or direct marketing. 12k for developer experts onboarding - how long are you going to hire them for, how long will the onboarding be? These are all questions that don't find answers in this proposal. 10k for developing an infrastructure to host a hackaton doesn't make sense to me. As a developer I've been part of hackatons and you don't need any infrastructure, besides github, which is free. So I don't know what exactly infrastructure you need to do the hackaton, and I couldn't say I understand your execution plan for this hackaton. Overall an more details are required for me to be able to say with certanty that this is a project that's worth the support and the funds. Maybe you can find more people with your idea to create hacathons and combine your efforts. The roadmap leaves me confused as I thought this was a hackaton idea, so I don't understand the sprint about the \"initial product proposal\" and \"final proposal\" proposal of what as well as a couple of other points. I am left uncertain because of lack of information, thus my final score of 3 - unsure.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are some KPIs mentioned, but they could use a little work. As a developer I wouldn't say that delivered projects are a good measure of a hackaton and it doesn't align with the roadmap given. Besides that open branches and pull requests number wouldn't give an accurate representation of the hachaton success. What is an industry standard is a demo of the project. Even if it's a PoC that's good enough to have a clip and show off as a result of a hackaton. Oveall I think there's some missmatch between the problem you're trying to solve and the actual roadmap presenting the execution plan of the problem. The solution description could be better as well, and by that I mean more focussed and detailed.

My problem with this is that we are throwing money away to something that may not, in the end, benefit us as a community.

I think you should take a step back and focus on something that you can work on together collectively and build a proposal that breaks everything down to the letter.
