Blockchain technology is growing in popularity worldwide including in Cameroon and Central African countries following the records that Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, as well as Cardano, have achieved in recent years.

Like many proposals from non-English speaking country teams, resources written in their languages \u200b\u200bare few and hard to find. In addition, if so, the quality and content are not completely accurate and verified. Especially in Cameroon, their economy and internet technology infrastructure are not really developed, the infrastructure economy is poor, and corruption is deeply rooted, the economy mainly depends on agriculture and oil. Thus increasing the difficulty in accessing resources on the internet including equipment and knowledge. Most of the developers there speak French, so translating popular video courses and exercises from prestigious programs like Plutus Pioneer Program and Atala Prism Pioneer Program into French, then posting to free and easy-to-approach platforms like youtube is a very good idea, it solves a real problem and helps developers in Cameroon and the surrounding area speak French, people there who want to learn about Cardano, Haskell, and Plutus can get reputable, accurate, and accessible information and resource channel to learn and get started as a Cardano developer, helping to expand the Cardano developer community and incubate the future Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project is feasible to implement successfully.
