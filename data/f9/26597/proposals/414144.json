Off-chain meaning that the smart-contract validations would still be written in plutus (haskell). That means the library would have limited usage and impact, because it wouldn't consern itself with onchain data which will probably be set as bytecode directly. It's a good idea, because it will provide some perks like not needing a Plutus Application Backend for some of the operations but not all of them relating to the meat of the applications using smart contracts which is most if not all of the dapps.\nNevertheless I think this is a brave effort and a great idea, because it would have some benefits for the cardano dev community, but they will be limited. I do remember seeing this proposal in the last fund 8 (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396949), and unfortunately I don't see the necessary improvement to the proposal. The short of it is, that it's too technical limiting the voters ability to make their choice. I still don't think the problem is elaborated good enough, because a regular non-tech person, wouldn't understand the problem or the need for a solution, limiting the range of reach for this proposal.\nThe proposal could do a better job explaining the terms used, and the expected benefit after it's implementation, because otherwise the KPIs lack context. The proposal is in line with the challenge settings and I do believe this is the right place for it after some polishing is done.\nI suggest to the proposer to think about making the proposal more understandable and explaining the problem and solution in simpler terms with non-code examples.

I didn't like the fact no links or skillset is provided in both of the proposals I've seen so far, (this one and https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414103). I wasn't able to verify the proposer has the necerssary skillset to implement all the things mentioned in this proposal. I looked through the github repositories and I watched quite a few of the youtube videos but there was not much coding or showing of technical skills involved.\nThe goal of integration with browsers is great, but a more detailed explanation is missing. I see a description of the problem but not of the benefits the cardano devs would get by using this library once it's finished. With no other work, I do see a posibility for implementing the work that needs doing given you have the necessary skillset, but lacking any information about the skillset it is difficult for me to make an estimation or an educated guess if the projects timeframe is reasonable or not.\nI would suggest to the author to look through the eyes of a non-technical voter and try and make the proposal appealing for this kind of audiance, because this is the main body of voters. The proposer hasn't listed any plan of marketing or making people aware of his efforts, besides listing an open source github repository, which makes it less discoverable which lowers the chances of an organic community growing around this idea IMHO as someone that has open source experience developing a project for near 4 years.\nOverall I couldn't say if this is a feasible proposal or not, because of the arguments listed above.
