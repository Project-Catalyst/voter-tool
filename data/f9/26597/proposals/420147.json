The tool is a swiss army knife for interacting with cardano-cli and cardano-wallet. It improves the user experience of devs when dealing with Cardano services. The proposed describes an existing problem with how transactions signing currently works where there is a need to transfer files to offline devices for signing and then back to the hot environment for sending to the blockchain. As a user of the Cardano ecosystem and a stake pool operator I can relate to this problem and having a hardware wallet connected would solve some of the pain points for pool operators and developers. The users at large however use web-wallets where there is already support for hardware wallets. There is also no evidence that the service is used widely in the community; it has been forked once and has 9 stars. I would encourage the proposer to ensure there the community needs the tool before spending a lot more time on it. If the community used the tool, it could scale very well as it is installed on the user\u2019s machine.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of relevant skills through GitHub repo of the project, on top of which this work will be done. The proposer also provides a link to a personal page and a youtube video explaining how the tool works. The tasks are described in detail, and the proposer is expected to complete both stages in 140 hours. The budget is set at $10k, which works out to be $75/h. This is a competitive rate for backend engineering where knowledge of Cardano specifics is required. There is no clear timeline provided for when the work will be executed. The proposer mentions that there had been delays in the past. I would encourage the proposer to provide a clear timeline, at least biweekly of what work will be executed and when; without this, it makes it challenging to assert when the proposer will complete the project. The proposer highlights risks of illness from Covid or war which are reasonable concerns. Should something happen to the developer then at some point the community might pick up the work - from personal experience, this is a risk for any project and the given that the tool is open-sourced on GitHub means anyone pick it up. The languages and architecture are not discussed in detail; however, given that this is an update to an existing tool, the work would be done within the same language. Given that the proposer has written the original tool then he shouldn\u2019t have technical difficulties updating it for the Vasil hard fork. I believe the proposer would be able to delivert the proposal, however I have doubts about the timing where we could expect some delays.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A roadman with the deliverables is provided and includes the hours required to deliver each section. The budget is derived from the hours allocated times the hourly rate. The proposer commits to update the code on the Github repo when the code is ready and to submit monthly reports to the community. The information on KPIs is missing. The success statement is made at a quite high level, focusing on empowering people to use their means of computing and people embracing it. I suggest the proposer focuses on adopting the tool within the community and seeks feedback on what the community values in his tools. Given the lack of KPIs and a timeline for the project, I would have a hard time auditing if the project remains on track or not. Note: the proposer has other proposals in Fund 9 with very similar content in the auditabilty section.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 960, "q0": "Although I haven\u2019t personally encountered it until reading this proposal, the Transaction Editor seems like a very capable tool that allows developers and CLI users to build complex transactions. Adding hardware wallet support to it represents a good investment for the community as it could end up being a tool that is more commonly used by developers, and as such, we want to make sure that it has the best security features possible.\n\nI agree with the argument this proposal makes that the tool could represent a powerful tool in the Cardano developer\u2019s toolkit, by simplifying workloads and freeing up time wasted on manually building transactions on the CLI. Thus this proposal is a very good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge.\n\nI appreciate the really thorough set of risks identified by the proposer, as well as the mitigation plans presented.\n\nMy assessment of the proposal is based on my ongoing experience as a project manager working with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021 and I am myself a funded proposer. I\u2019ve also been involved with the Cardano development and NFT communities for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal outlines a very detailed and complete implementation plan for the project. Every step is estimated in hours. The hourly rate of $75/h is then used to calculate the budget for the project. This is a very reasonable hourly rate for blockchain development.  As this is a solo developer initiative the budget breakdown is very simple, one line really, as the entire budget is allocated to work compensation. Of note is the fact that the proposer has set aside work hours not only for writing the code for the new features but also for creating the documentation, including creating and uploading YouTube videos presenting, explaining and hopefully popularising the transaction editor and the hardware wallet features that this proposal is looking to build. I commend the foresight, as unfortunately a lot of the developers of tools seem to overlook this aspect, but it wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the Cardano treasury to fund the development of code that would just sit in a GitHub repo, without anyone knowing of it.\n\nI have browsed the public GitHub repo of the Cardano transaction editor that the proposal has already produced for the Fund 7 funded project, and while I haven\u2019t inspected the code itself, the documentation work he has produced for the project is detailed and of very good quality.\n\nAs a final note, I really appreciate the fact that the proposer actually took the time to adequately answer the two new project workload questions introduced in Fund 9, and provided all the details requested in the proposal submission form. These were newly introduced questions so in practice this was a rare sight. He has not only done so but answered very thoroughly. Kudos. If this thoroughness extends to the development work he plans to produce I have no doubt that the scope of the project will be successfully delivered.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The plan for auditing follows the implementation plan and considering that the deliverables of this project will be public by their nature, open-source code in a public repository and public videos, it will make the auditing process very easy for the community. \n\nIf the proposal is funded, however, hopefully, the community will do much more than simply verify these public outputs and actually use them. But, that is outside the scope of this proposal and the proposer obviously can\u2019t promise popular success. The definition of success given in the proposal demonstrates that the proposer understands this aspect and states that his goal is to empower as many people with his free software.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1300, "q0": "The proposal is describing a problem that currently there is no transaction editor for hardware wallets, and that users are improvising safety when editing their transactions manually. He aims to solve it by creating an open-source editor, containing the best practices and collection of commands that can be utilized by the community. The proposer is having the commands in a very clean and organized structure, and he also creates videos that are available on youtube channel. Since hardware wallets are considered to be the highest level of security, and that there are already some command line interfaces available for more technically advances users, such collection of the best practices can both improve their experience and safety of their assets. Since it is open sourced, it can be used by everyone, and therefore the impact is on the whole cardano community.

Now you have to transfer your keys to secure system before transactions, with hardware device this will be easier and big time saver. With this, I think hardware device is a good tool and should be founded.
