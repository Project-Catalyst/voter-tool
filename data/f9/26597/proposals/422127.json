Proof project can be successful: It has already jumped the first huggle and is moving towards integrating deno, Vasil,etc. I will be happy to see more of awareness brought to dev teams frustrated with other tools. \nb)ii. Team/Proposer experience aligned to the project proposed. Yes because \"Alessandro Konrad\" is not only BSC Computer Sciencee but also brought Berry Pool, Starbuz and Lucid to existence.\nb)iii. There is a plan and time frame. Yes, it is stated that within end of July 2022 Deno and Vasil will be integrated, meaning if funded the it will take 30 days to add those features, unless probably if Vasil upgrade \ndelays.\nb) iv.

Checking on github,https://github.com/Berry-Pool/lucid,\nonly developers  or tech people will be able to track deno integration and Vasil integration by actually intalling and testing Lucid. Hopefully around August 2022 or so.\nc)iii. Are deliverable dates defined. Yes, end of July 2022(07/30/2022) although there could be adjustments due to factors like Vasil coming soon.\nc)iv. Possible risks and solutions provided. According to the Project Proposer, risks that could lead to Lucid failure have been known and delt with as Lucid is procution ready.

It's a javascript (popular programming language) library that is already delivered and used to interact with the cardano ecosystem. This library will get some new functionality and will be prepared to work with the vasil hardfok comming this or next month. I'd say this proposal is in the rightt challenge and matches the challenge settings, especially the one where it makes devs lives easier. The library is used and downloaded so there is some community behind it.\nThere need to be many many libraries that will be able to be usable with the cardano ecosystem in order to drive the integration up so the more libraries that are used by any community the better. I am a bit worried about how will this library scale, considering all the work will be done by one person, which is ok for a start, but not for a full blown library with so much functionality down the line that one person can't keep up with the wants and needs of the community.\nCurrently the proposal is decent, but it could have better plans for the future. I'm a developer that has been part of a big open source project and let me tell you, once the people start using it and issues and pull requests and feature requests start raining, one person will not be enough to do everything. I'd suggest to the author to think about scaling the library team while there's still time and look for someone to hire and onboard.

The timetable seems reasonable for the deno and vasil hard fork integration, but there's no specifications on the \"librarary expansions\" so I couldn't give an estimate if it's reasonable timing or not, so I'll defer to the authors estimations for it. Considering everything will take a whole year to develop I'd suggest to break this proposal down to individual items and do iterations over several funds instead of asking the full price right now and developing for a whole year. A lot of things change in a year, and the interative approach empirically works better. \nThe lack of detail could have been easily prevented with a small list of features or expansions that the author had planned. And would give piece of mind to the voter and the assessors like me that there is an actual technical plan for the aforementioned expansion.  As it stands now, I coudln't estimate if the proposal is feasible or not and couldn't estimate the cost / value ratio which is usually what I do to figure out if a proposal is feasible or not.\nMy suggestion to the proposer would be to look at other excellen proposals from this and past funds and work on presenting the proposal and polishing in a ready format for anyone to read and understand the exact steps. Another thing that could help the mindset would be to read the proposal through the eyes of a non-tech voter that hasn't heard of this library, because there are such assessors and voters as well. \nOverall I am undetermined on wheather or not this proposal is feasible or not and I wish good luck to the proposer.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There's a github repository, so anyone interested can check out the process there.
