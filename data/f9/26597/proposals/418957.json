It also shows new developers that educational content is available. Project-based learning approach is an effective Hands-On learning experience that focuses on learning by doing. The project will run for six months and should have proved successful, then James will come back for additional funding. The Plutus smart contract language is a functional language that is quite different to all the other languages that programmers are used to. Having practical examples helps devs learn and practice algorithms that they might recognize but have difficulty implementing with this new language. I think the proposal is well align with the challenge setting", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Proposal is the co-founder of the Gimbalabs team. He provides links to his LinkedIn profile and has relevant experience in creating teaching material. James has been a high-school maths and computer science teacher for the last 11 years, and he has published two math curriculums that are still in use today. While teaching, he tries to use new tools to facilitate deep learning. James will design and deliver the courses.  the budget is set at $36,000 which will cover a salary for James of $6,000 per month for 6 months this is a reasonable salary for a developer on Cardano. Should the program be a success, James will come back for additional funding in future funding rounds. The Proposal is divided into two sections the operational part which will hold weekly playground meetings, prepare the meetings, documentation and collect feedback. The Innovation stage is composed of self-study and skill up for the participants; design and development of more project-based learning formats and experiment with new designs of project-based learning. This format has been tried and tested with the Gimbalabs team. There will not be any new software developed there for no discussions I made about languages architecture.  James highlights the risk that there might be a lack of project-based learning expertise should something happen to him; however, two to three developers are already being trained to become the next teachers. James also highlights the risk that there might not be enough students to participate in the Project-based learning program; however, experience has shown that the previous iterations of this program by Gimbalabs have shown a lot of interest. A growing Cardano ecosystem will be conducive to more participants in the type of program.  I would be interested in joining the program when it launches. I would have liked James to elaborate a little more on how this proposal differs from the project-based learning programs that Gimbalabs run and why the submission is made by him rather than the team as a whole.  I have no doubts that James will be able to deliver on this proposal", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the roadmap is clearly stated; it will run over six months, and the educational content will be prepared and delivered by James. The KPIs are well-defined and will be measured weekly.  They focus on the number of playgrounds and project-based learning held, the number of participants, and the number of new project-based learning pilots launched. The success of this project will be to empower more and more developers to build on Cardano; create an environment that is safe for innovation, and creates success stories that become businesses. The deliverable is straightforward to audit as these are public courses that anyone can attend and view the recording afterward.

This is especially true because it not only is a relatively new developer community, but it also operates under a totally different paradigm in the blockchain space given it\u2019s eUTxo model and Haskell based programming. \n\nBecause of this, relatively few developers are familiar with the tools, methods and best practices. \n\nAs such, it is especially important for those who are familiar to share the knowledge they have accumulated if they are willing and able to do so. Over the course of the last almost two years, James and the Gimbalabs team have proven that they are more than capable of taking on this challenge.\n\nThe proposal is asking for funding to enable the continuation of the Project Based Learning program for the 6 month (July - December 2022).\n\nI haven't been a part of the Gimbalabs Project Based Learning workshops myself, but the people I have come across who have, are praising them. For the work they do and the methods they are developing.\n\nMaintaining this core education infrastructure is key to the future developer adoption of the Cardano stack, something I think we can all agree is fundamental to the general adoption of our blockchain. By funding this work it is my assessment that we are only paying for the planting of a seed, but our whole ecosystem has a chance to be impacted greatly by it, and we might end up enjoying a small forest.\n\nMy assessment is based on the over 5 years of experience I have in managing mobile app studios and the fact that I have been involved in the Cardano developer community since March 2021. For the last year, I have also been actively project-managing Cardano developers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project plan and roadmap makes a lot of sense and is very simple to follow. It is actually a continuation of the PBL framework the Gimbalabs team already has in place. \n\nThe detailed budget breakdown is only a line, but that is actually not a problem in the case of this proposal as the allocation of funds is very simple: six-month compensation for a master educator. \n\nThe project is part of the Gimbalabs initiative and is spearheaded by James Dunseith the founder and core driver of the PBL project. He is a master educator with a vast experience in teaching. James\u2019 LinkedIn page is also provided in the proposal and it backs -up and ads to the data provided in the proposal.\n\nDespite the fact that the new question related to work on previously funded proposals is answered as \u201cYes\u201d, no additional details are provided in the main feasibility section as is now requested by the proposal submission form. However, I will not be lowering my rating because of this, as the question has been introduced in Fund 9 and the proposers may have not fully understood what is being requested of them, but, I do suggest the team include full answers on future submissions, especially as they have indicated that they will be returning to Catalyst to seek additional funds in the future.\n\nEven though it\u2019s not provided in the proposal, the information about past funded Gimbalabs proposals and current fund 9 proposals is available at https://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/group/gimbalabs . This tool definitely helps the community see the volume of work that needs to be managed. My assessment is that the volume of work is more than manageable for the Gimbalabs team, especially considering that they are already implementing the project that is in the scope of this proposal and the requested funds are simply for continuing the project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "From what I\u2019ve been able to observe during the last year and a half, Gimbalabs have been very transparent with their activities and this project is no exception. The KPIs are straightforward and easy to follow as they focus on the metrics around the educational content that will be provided.\n\nThe definitions of success for this project are very well presented and they do a very good job of explaining the importance of this project by themselves, as they lay out all the benefits that a Cardano developer interacting with the Project Based Learning course would stand to gain.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 3, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3546, "q0": "This is a project based learning proposal. The idea is to train developers to become proficient and be able to work and develop real world cardano decentralized applications. This is done through the project based learning approach .. meaning you work on actual project to gain your skills, which as a developer I can verify is the preffered and proven way to learn something new.\nThe impact of this proposal is sure to be great and has already been empirically proven to be so. The growth between version 1 and version 3 is amazing and is sure to be even greater further down the line when more people and trainers get involved. I would love to take part of this experience and learn something new because I would enjoy transfering my skills to the cardano ecosystem as I'm sure many developers are.\nSharing knowledge is a noble goal and I do appreciate the hard work and effort put into craeting the video content and all the documentation. I also love the open source learning concept, and the combination between a github project to work on and a youtube tutorial is becomming more and more poppular so I suggest to the proposers to consider it if they haven't already.\nThis proposal would give the skills to devs, in a short time, to become a self sustained business if they so choose and the opportunities in the cardano ecosystem are endless as I see it. Overall this is one impactfull proposal that matches the challenge settings, helping developers in their journey and helping them better educate themselves and help out business idea of others or develop their own.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "James Dunseith (co-founder Gimbalabs) is has all the credentials to teach people and has already proven to be capable. I managed to verify all the listed skills with the ones in the linked profile and with a bit of googling managed to find out more about the people that have passed his lessons and all seem to be appreciative and happy. In that train of thought I'd recommend to James and the proposers to collect success stories in the form of a short video made by a developer, because there's no better marketing than regular people speaking out for the benefits of the program and it's always nice to connect a face to a story, hence the videos.\nThe program will span 5 months till late december, which is a good timeframe based on my experience if a little too short, but with the right motivation it's farr from impossible. There will be weekly playground meetings that will help developers get to know the program and each other better and make colaboration easier.\nThere's a sensible plan for implementation and all the relevant details will be documented as mentioned several times. Testing frameworks will also be a topic which is overlooked in other such projects which is a sin if you ask me. A tested application is a reliable one.\nThe budget seems reasonable, considering James does this only and is entirely focussed on it. The hourly rate is a bit low if you ask me, but that makes the value / cost ratio even more appealing for voting it in, which I encourage all voters to do. This is a negligible amount compared to the value it will bring long term. \nOverall a feasible solution to an importan problem. No devs means no ecosystem growth because it's a digital world so we need digital gurus to be generated. Good luck to James in his endeavour.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I love the definition of success where his planning on passing the torch down the line and expanding the PBL programes to more than one. This is a worthy goal of a true educator.\nThere will also be all kinds of content related to the learning process like documentation, technical video content and discusstions. These are all great if you want to learn later on or at your own pace in your own time.\nThe problem is worth solving and we need people with this long term vision to solve the problem in a lasting way. The proposed solution is more than reasonable and as I already mentioned it's value compared to it's cost is huge.

The proposer intends to create a platform where already existing Haskell developers will be empowered to build on Cardano using plutus. Developers will be guided and provided with peer reviewed approaches, providing open source learning opportunities, Project Based Learning environment, feedbacks and a sound network of innovative people will be empowered and eventually upskill developers to become blockchain developers.

The project, (Gimbalabs) have a track record of professional guiding, grooming and upskilling some notable individuals who are currently working with projects building on Cardano. With these, I undoubtedly believe the team behind the project that they will effectively implement the project. \n\nThe budget also is solely for the compensation of the gimbalabs instructor for 6Months (6k/Month) which is in my opinion a fair and reasonable amount considering the huge task been taken up by the instructor (I happen to be one of his student anyway) not been biased,  but you can checkout Gimbalabs and make a research out of it.
