I am not a game developer but I can say that this is not the first project that talks about Unreal in this funding round, and as a developer on Cardano I can relate to the need to have a strong and open community to discuss ideas and help each other. Having a strong community of Unity developers will increase the overall number of developers on Cardano and create a sense of community and conversation. Therefore it addresses the challenge setting.  The proposal scales to the point where Discord can accommodate a large number of developers. If the community is well-received and grows, the proposer will return for additional funding in future funding rounds.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposal goes by the name of Ryan; although he doesn't provide his full name. Links are provided to his LinkedIn, Github, and Twitter, which show a considerable amount of work done relating to Unity over the last years and good feedback from peers and managers.  Ryan is the only member of the team on the project. Ryan provides a project plan on a party website called Favro, and it is very detailed and covers the steps needed to implement the project. He has budgeted 150 hours in total and provided a breakdown of how many hours each task will take. I counted 23 delivery items in total, each done approximately within a week. The project runs from the beginning of October until the beginning of February next year, which is about four months. The total budget is set at $6,000, and the hourly rate is $45; this is an acceptable rate for Community Management projects and is about $30 below the hourly rate for a developer on Cardano (based on the 30+ projects reviewed so far). In addition, Ryan highlights reasonable risks, which focus on not attracting developers, having low community participation, and the unwillingness of developers to use blockchain technology. The mitigating actions are to promote resources on forums, Reddit, and Twitter, provide constant updates, and publish news items to keep developers engaged. Given that Ryan has experience creating and managing communities using the Discord server and is one of the top sellers on Unreal Marketplace with 10 years of experience, I think Ryan has a good chance of delivering the projects on time and within budget.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, Ryan provides a clear roadmap with milestones and the elements that he needs to provide to the community to keep them engaged and promote useful discussions.  Ryan will use Favro task management system and GitHub to measure progress. Even though Ryan does not provide any meaningful KPIs within the text of the proposal, the linked Favre board is detailed with the tasks that need to be completed. Therefore anyone auditing can go there and validate if the project is running according to plan. Successful delivery would be new developers joining the space consistently, although what that means in numbers is not provided. The communication channel for updates will be the Discord server organized as part of this proposal. Therefore I do not foresee any roadblocks to auditing this project effectively; however, it would have been nice to have objective measures for what success looks like.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 961, "q0": "For those that don't know Unreal Engine is a very powerful piece of technology. It started out as a game development engine in 1998, but during the last few years, it has developed into much more than that. It's a tool that is now frequently used in architecture,  visualisation for car manufacturers and the film industry - to name just a few of its multiple possible applications aside from game development.\n\nThat is precisely why I see building a community to easily onboard Unreal Engine developers to Cardano as an extremely worthwhile initiative. The project very clearly addresses one of the key pillars of the Developer Ecosystem challenge, and that is the creation of a supportive environment through support networks and a community.\n\nI'm writing this assessment from the perspective of a game designer with experience and official training in Unreal Engine who has also been a part of the Catalyst and the wider Cardano community for the last year and a half.\n\nI would like to point out that the proposer has made a very convincing case as to why developer communities are needed as a support mechanism, especially when dealing with a nascent space like developing on Cardano, and even more so blockchain gaming development (especially new on Cardano). The proposed initiative truly has the potential to have a considerable impact on the adoption of our blockchain by the game dev community. As correctly pointed out by the proposer, this particular community, can sometimes be very sceptical or even hostile to blockchain tech (I have personally experienced this hostility on several occasions).\n\nThe risks to the project are very well-identified and thoroughly described, suggesting that the proposer has given a lot of thought to the project.\n\nI have joined the proposer's current developer community discord channel and I can attest to the fact that it seems very well run. By browsing through the channels I\u2019ve seen that all questions are answered in a very thorough and helpful manner. If the proposer plans to bring this level of dedication to this project as well, I can conclude only that it would be a great addition to the Cardano developer environment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap presented for the project is very thorough and comprehensive, it covers every aspect of setting up a new developer community and even contains exact dates for when each task would be accomplished and time estimation in hours.\n\nI would have preferred to see the timeline included in the proposal itself without the need to access an external resource, especially to a task board that only displays additional information when the card for that specific task is clicked. The reason I\u2019m saying this is because not all proposal assessors, and especially voters will visit the external site and especially interact with each card to see its more detailed description. I especially found it cumbersome to deduce the budget breakdown from the way the information was presented. However, I will not be deducting from my rating for this, and this is just friendly advice for the proposer for his next submissions. The info is all there, very thoroughly presented I might add, just very hard to get to.\n\nThe amount that the proposer is asking for is very reasonable, I'm almost inclined to say that it's too low, but since the proposer plans to do all of the work himself and doesn\u2019t plan to hire anyone it is up to him to figure out his personal financial needs.\n\nThe proposer has done a very good job of presenting himself and his past accomplishments through a number of relevant links, and after browsing through them I\u2019m left with the impression of a person more than capable of doing the job set out in this proposal.\n\nIt\u2019s very nice to see that the proposer took the time to properly detail every other proposal that he is planning to work on and has submitted in Fund 9. For future proposal submissions, I would like to encourage him to add a more detailed explanation of what he expects the workload to be and how he expects he will be able to manage it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given how very well presented the rest of the proposal is, the auditability section is the weakest link here. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s presented in an atypical manner given the Catalyst requirements. It\u2019s again very closely tied to the tasks and milestone board I mentioned in the feasibility section of this assessment. Milestones and  KPIs are not described in the proposal itself but rather the reader of the proposal is left with the task of extracting this information from the board.\n\nOn the other hand, the board itself makes for a very good auditing tool and I very much appreciate the effort that the proposer has put into detailing every step, and being very transparent about all the steps and milestones of the project.\n\nThe community will be able to very easily keep track of the progress of the project by following the activity on the board that is already included in the Catalyst proposal. Even though at first glance this approach to the auditability section might seem peculiar I ultimately find myself agreeing with the method set forth by the proposal and this is reflected in my rating.

The benefit from that, would be games for example that interact with native cardano assets. If I remember correctly there already are SDKs that make that available to some extent, but you still need unreal engine devs to integrate those sdks into the games and products of unreal engine.\nI like there are so many proposals and project that try to lower the bar for anyone to enter the cardano ecosyste. This really is the right way to go when you want to grow an ecosystem - make it easy to use. It's sounds simple but it's really complicated to do, but this proposal is a step in the right direction.\nIMHO the proposer has done a great job of assessing the possible risk and has a really good mitigation strategy in place. I'm sure even though currently it's only one person, the proposal will have no problem scaling as the community scales.\nThe unreal engine devs are a missing piece from the puzzle and would be a nice addition if this proposer manages to get them on board. \nThe project is aligned with the challenge settings and will definitely be an improvement for all. And after all who doesn't like unreal engine products .. I mean c'mon.\nOverall this is an excellen proposal that will have an impact for sure.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Single developer with enough credentials and skills to do much much more than what he's proposing technically so I have no worries about him being able to onboard people from his community and make them see the light in cardano.\nThe roadmap is understandable and reasonable, and the task management board (fravo) is realy clear and available for anyone to checkup on. The budget will be spread between October and february this year for a total of 150 hours of estimated planned time. That means that 6750 requested budget / 150 hours = 45 $/hr which is more than reasonable for the proposed work.\nThe proposal is otlined in a very detailed tasks that are available in the linked site in the proposal.The proposer has a really good plan of making thigs happen and onboarding people so I'd be happy to give him a chance to do that. Realizing this proposal is worth 0.675% from the whole challenge budget is quite the index to realize the cost / value ratio is more than good.\nOverall this is a feasible proposal and I'd recommend voting for it.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a frevo board, a discord server where anyone interested can join and checkout what's happening. There's a complicated problem and a simple solution that's reasonable and I really do think It's going to work over time, because you can't grow a community overnight.\nAs a developer I do know how much easier a good community can make a learning curve or a task or anything to do.

Developer communities are a time-tested resource for onboarding new game developers for all the reasons the impact statement has effectively laid out.\n\nWhile the proposal isn't necessarily offering a toolset in and of itself, it is proposing a forum where such things can easily be shared and discovered through word of mouth and query. For that reason, I believe the proposal meets the terms of the challenge.\n\nThis proposal may also go a long way towards addressing anti-blockchain sentiment within the independent game developer community by removing misconceptions and demonstrating the value proposition of using Cardano community infrastructure like Catalyst to fund and support their projects.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has essentially already begun the work of forming the proposed community with his Discord channel, which had 674 members at time of this assessment. He also has experience publishing tools for the Unreal engine, so that side of the equation is accounted for.

Throw some bullet points into the Catalyst form so that voters can get the highlights more easily.

This is a good idea to provide support to the community and contribute to the development of the Cardano ecosystem community.\nThe team has been very clear about the problems that new developers face. They analyzed the problem very well. They find the problem comes from the complexity in the ecosystem and this causes frustration for young developers.\nIn this part, the proposal writer will have to present the product functions and features of the project.
