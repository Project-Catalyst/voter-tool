I appreciate the usefulness of this platform because there has never been such a useful platform in the world. Blockchain, DeFi, Crypto, Metaverse, ... are new technology trends, so there is a shortage of experts. And the companies that develop these technologies need even more experts, and talented people to collaborate with. Your proposal solves the goal set out in the Challenge as a developer ecosystem, it acts as a middle ground as a bridge to meet the needs of both parties. You've identified a problem that needs to be solved, there's a solution to it, and I'm especially excited when the problem not only has a solution to it but adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. This is very valuable. I hope that in the future there will be many similar proposals developed on the Cardano blockchain. It's also a way to scale and tackle future challenges. I realize that the world urgently needs similar proposals in different fields, specifically in the fields of agriculture, industry, gaming, health, etc... Because every profession needs professionals. experts, talented people with the best qualifications in that industry. In summary, I strongly agree with the impact that the proposal has brought. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "You have experience working on the largest media site about Cardano (Cardanofeed). Those are valuable experiences that not everyone in the media can have. Your team members also have certain experience in e-commerce, software development, marketing, etc...and some of them have held senior and other positions. and have a certain capacity in the organization. This increases the community's trust in the team. One thing I find very satisfying is that all core members have a Linkedin social network link to publicize their identities and profiles. I'm sure the community is also looking forward to this because through it, the identity of each individual is disclosed clearly and transparently, step by step confirming the feasibility of the proposal. The credibility of the team is made clear through the document cited by the website Cardanofeed.com. There aren't many proposals that reveal the identity of the team and its members as clearly as this one. The detailed budget analysis also speaks to the professionalism of the team. In the proposal, the budget is divided into sections, which are reasonable with the set goals and the cost of each work part must be close to the price applied in the market today. It is also the honesty of the proposal. I appreciate the feasibility of the proposal through the specific budget to have been presented. However, I have a question regarding the budget: If funding has not been received from Catalyst, will the team continue to work on the proposal? At that time, does the team have any other funding sources to support? My questions are positive and are only meant to clarify the feasibility of the proposal.\nRegarding the plan and implementation method, the team clearly stated the work parts that are divided evenly over the months according to certain progress. I like this professionalism. When looking at the plan presented in the proposal, the community will immediately understand that the team is well prepared: from the initial steps such as designing the foundation structure to the UX/UI research in turn. for the website...and ending with the official launch of the platform and communication with media partners. I found that the sequence of execution of this plan is very similar to what you showed at Cardanofeed. I'm happy with it.\nRegarding the resources needed to implement the proposal, in addition to the core members, the team also has 7 other collaborators who are professional and highly specialized. I know that some members of the team have already made other proposals at Fund 9, I hope that the team can still assemble the best people to implement this proposal as well as the team presented. display.\nOn the technical side: I would like the team to elaborate more on the so-called specialized and fragmented platform that the team has been talking about through the technical elements. Because this is also one of the ways to increase the feasibility of the proposal. Everything the team has presented in the proposal makes me and the community understand the idea, but the technical aspects are still vague. Therefore, I hope that if possible, the team will analyze them more closely the technology and go deeper into the techniques applied in the proposal to implement in practice.\nI agree with the challenges and risks associated with the implementation that the team mentioned in the proposal. However, I would like to mention another risk that Ada's price slippage affects the budget when the team implements this proposal (provided that this proposal must be approved for funding by Catalyst). The team can consult with me to improve the proposal. And I would like to add that if more funding is needed, the team must come up with a specific, verifiable plan.\nIn summary, I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal, my suggestions and questions are for the team's reference. I just want to give positive comments to contribute to perfecting the proposal as perfectly as possible. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones for the tasks to be completed are clearly outlined. I am satisfied with this. However, I would suggest that if the team presents work that needs to be completed on a certain schedule and ties the work to specific months of the year, it would be great to demonstrate transparency about the auditability of the team. offer. For example, to-do items for January, February, March (this is just an example). Thus, it is more convenient for the community to evaluate work progress, thereby increasing transparency and auditability. I find the idea of \u200b\u200bdeveloping projects through Catalyst KPIs a very creative idea. This proves the team's commitment to Cardano and Catalyst. If the team adds more key metrics, it is good to increase auditability. Because we all know how important KPIs and key metrics are to verify auditability and transparency. The team also defines how successful a project is by a series of numerical criteria, but I have not seen a specific number to reflect this. Hope the team considers and adds more to the full. Throughout the proposal, the team clearly and easily described all problems with a reasonable solution (except for the technical verification as I said when commenting on the feasibility of the proposal). ). With my constructive suggestions, the team can refer and supplement. I agree with the auditability of the proposal.

I also see it aiming at potential directions stated in challenge description such as \"Support structures\" and \"e the tools that we need to prioritize first\".\n\nRegarding the proposal itself, it does a good job on presenting platform value proposition and, a previous survey was carried out to identify the challenges and they were properly mitigated. It's excellent they already considered an automated exporting and importing between platforms functionality.\nWhat could be further added here though is what features this platform will have, that are more specific for blockchain, other than just the telents and the available jobs themselves. Maybe it could work for sharing events or even work like a forum to have discussions and users learn with each other. Other thing that could be better ellaborated here is about the business model that will make the plataform financially sustainable. It says it will rely on fees charged from users but it could explain more how it will work (for example, if any user would have to pay or if it would work on a freemium model, if companies would be charged more, if there would also be any ads)\nAfter platform is implemented, I'd also suggest to look for partnerships, specially with trainings and learning platforms, so users have a easier way to improve their skills.\n\nAll in all, however, this is a valid idea and a fine proposal, aligned with challenge.

The amount of time for each cost is also provided (when applicable) which gives it more transparency.\nThe team has 3 people already committed with background in software engineering, e-commerce, digital marketing and Cardano, which should cover all project fronts.
