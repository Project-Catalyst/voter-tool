This is a great idea that can only be done on Cardano.\nWith the feature that all tokens created on Cardano are Native tokens, share a common token framework and are distinguished by policyID, simply understanding two types of native tokens with different IDs will be NFTs for each other, and for tokens in the same That ID then it's FT. Therefore, it is possible to create a smart contract to execute transactions between NFT and FT. Unlike ecosystems like ETH, this is not possible or if possible requires a combination of smart contracts and very high execution costs.\nThe smart contracts that the proposal creates will be open-source for devs to use to integrate and develop for their project.\nThis proposal will create excitement for NFT marketplaces, increase the trading volume of native tokens instead of just using ADA or stablecoins to trade, and according to the proposal, there will be campaigns calling for dev teams of NFT projects work together to exploit the aforementioned smart contract usage.\nThe risks of the proposal are two fold regarding the progress of the Vasil hardfork and the acceptance of the NFT projects. Although the proposal does not specify a solution to these two risks, I agree with the solution releate with the Vasil hardfork issues. The problem of the acceptance of NFT projects, the proposer's solution does not completely solve the problem. My suggestion is to put together a plan to connect a list of specific NFT projects, do clearer public consultation activities to gauge their acceptance. I give an example that community A is very interested in trading between NFT and FT as the proposed solution, but will they accept to exchange their NFT for the FT of community B, community C?\nThat is my small suggestion, in general, this proposal is very good and has a high impact on the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The level of feasibility in terms of the implementation plan is great with the implementation roadmap being 6 months with 3 specific milestones\nfor each phase: development, testing and integration. All milestones have details of tasks and workloads, which we can refer to in the auditibility section of the proposal. However, I suggest that the proposer should add that detail to the detail plan and allocate more work in smaller units such as the number of completed hours, the number of completed days ...This is related to the fund allocation part that I would like to analyze below.\nThe proposed fund allocation is divided into exactly 3 milestones, but there are no details or clarifications on how to quantify the amount. The amount allocated is shown as:\n\"Phase 1 will take 1 month and total $25,000. This budget will go to pay MLabs for their work in optimizing smart contracts and ensuring they work as intended.\" if only so general, it will be difficult for the community to assess the feasibility of the proposed budget. Promoting this thing, the proposer can introduce in detail in the Ideafeast sessions or marketing campaigns for this proposal.\nThe team behind the proposal is the Playermint team, which is a reputable funding proposer in the Catalyst community, the development team is Mlabs, along with a list of other Cardano projects in development. With a core-team as above, the proposed implementation is very feasible.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The 3 milestones along with the key metrics outlined by the proponent are the metrics to track the progress of the proposal.\nA very complete list and not difficult to audit on the proponent's communication channels. Because these are all channels that have been active for a long time and are authenticated.\nHowever, about the development stage, in my opinion the source-code of the smart contract developed should be uploaded to a source like Mlabs' github or Playermint's for the community to follow or individuals with skills in the field. dev can check the code.\nTo assess the success of the project, I suggest that the proposer should provide KPI commitments on the achieved figures such as\n-Total NFT Volume traded with smart contracts\n-Number of NFT collections traded\n-Number of interchangeable token types used\n-Total trading volume of Cardano Native Assets before and after the integration is available.\n I think this is not difficult when the proposer has proposed a quite detailed plan for the project implementation and the proposed team is also a reputable team in the community.

I really appreciate how much time you spent reviewing and providing good info.\n\nWe will be sure to incorporate your thoughts in our future proposals."}, {"id": 3529, "q0": "This is a really really really important proposal, that I've actually waited for quite a while now. The proposers want to enable smart contracts that will be capable of transacting NFTs for fungible tokens that are not ADA but are generated in the cardano blockchain. Basically tokens that you can use to purchase NFTs in a marketplace that isn't dealing in ADA, but in some other tokens. Each individual place can have it's own fungible token. This is not a new idea, but it's not something I've seen done in cardano yet, and this will enable so much new players to join the cardano ecosystem and make it more usable and give it more utility.\nThe proposers are absolutely in the right challenge settings and their proposal is aligned with the settings, stars and everything else there is. I love the video, which makes assessing this proposal so so much easyer. Thanks for taking care of your friendly neighbourhood assessor. \nThis proposal has all the bells an whistles the KPIs metrics impact and I don't see anything missing from it. You can tell these proposers are vetarans from several previous funds I think the mentioned ones were 4,6 and 8 and I think I might have reviewed their proposals from 6 and 8, and they had great proposals even then that were laying the foundations for this one.\nOverall a very impactful proposal. I can't stress enough that it's growndbreaking.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have given all the credentials necessary and I was able to verify they will have no problem bringing this proposal to it's success as they've already done in previous funds. I really enjoyed the concrete explanation in the video of why is this important, what value will it bring to the ecosystem in a concise way so I understand and don't have to google all the time as I usually have to. People have this weird notion that when you're a developer you know everything technical related, which is absolutely not true and I have to google like everyone else, when it's outside of my area of expertise, and really do appreciate the video. I wish all proposers start doing this.\nThere is pretty much a breakdown of everything: the problems that are being solved, the milestones and individual iterative tasks that will lead to the successful implementation of the project, the technical details used to develop what's needed, the value it will bring and so on and so on. This really is one of the rare close to perfect proposals I've read and I've read about 200+ proposals for the last year.\nOne small thnig that could be better is the budget breakdown done in different hourly rates multiplied by estimated time for each type of work, but the budget is decent now and is reasonable. The problem I have with it is that It's hard for me as an assessor to say: \"ok they have reasonable hourly rates in the recommended bounds\", because I can't calculate them, I can do rough estimations as I'm doing now. Because I'm a developer, I can do better estimations when it comes to technical needs, but it won't be as good as the proposers just providing them.\nAnother thing I love about this proposal is the fact they're very aware of what's already been done in the ecosystem and what is currently missing. Not a lot of proposers have this general vision and sight, and often do proposals which are 90% similar to something that's already been done. That's not the case here, quite the opposite in fact.\nOverall a feasible proposal and an amazing idea, which I hope gets voted in and implemented. I'll be voting for it, no doubt.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This project will eventuall be an open source solution, which I think is the best move having worked in an open source project for 4 years I have some knowledge of organic changes and I do believe it's a good idea to opensource it once they have a MVP. Otherwise a lot of devs might start building on something that is not stable enough which will cause more problems in the future. You always need to have a stable foundation to build on so I resonate with the idea of getting everything working first.\nThere's a clear problem statement that has already been done in other blockchains and cardano is finally ripe to implement itt as well. There's a good solution, plan to execute and team to implement, so no worries there.\nOverall an auditable proposal with good KPIs and metrics to follow it's progress along the way.

While NFT trading is currently only possible using ADA. The project will allow exchange between a variety of non-fungible tokens and swapped tokens. Therefore, NFT buyers can use a different token from ADA to buy and sell NFT. The project will increase interactivity in the ecosystem. At the same time, it will contribute to attracting more developers to participate to generate new ideas in trading for the CNFT market.

After submitting project proposals at previous funds and having some significant success, your team has gained valuable knowledge in proposal writing and how to create the best impact on readers. Indeed, the PlayerMint team's proposals always leave me feeling inspired and engrossed in the excellent knowledge you provide. Regarding this fund 9 and the Develop ecosystem challenge, PlayerMint has a brilliant purpose of designing a set of smart contracts that make it simple for any NFT marketplace to facilitate fungible token-based trading. At the start of the solution introduction, you explain the transaction structure of Cardano-based tokens and then exploit the complexity of transactions where smart contracts support fungible tokens rather than only ADA. Once the background and dynamics are in place, you describe the benefits of the smart contract suite to Cardano's NFT marketplaces in an easy-to-understand manner, accompanied by a detailed explanation of this project's three phases of development. I appreciate the examples you provide demonstrating the project's benefits because they precisely show the close relationship between solution and challenge. This set of open-source smart contracts creates transactability between two types of blockchain assets (fungible and non-fungible) for any minted project, which enhances the developer experience on Cardano to design high-quality apps. With this extensive preparation and rich expertise from past projects, I believe that your team will not face too many difficulties with the risks in maintaining and accepting this solution between NFT developers and collectors.

The budget is divided into three sections, with expenses defined for what activities and to whom. I have no complaints about your complete and concise proposal writing. The collaboration between PlayerMint and Mlabs produced an impressive idea and a great proposal. However, you have overlooked a little point in the updated Feasibility edition of this fund.

What is described is a basic native asset trading contract, open source templates for which have existed for close to a year now (the template doesn\u2019t differ in practice if the input and conditions of the contract are ADA+NFT, ADA+NFT or ADA+NFT+FT).\nSo surely the functionality they plan to offer would go beyond that, and I would have liked to see that more clearly described.\n\nBecause of these I\u2019m neutral about the potential impact of this proposal to the Cardano developer ecosystem.\n\nAs a final note on the Impact section, it could be said about the technical intro of the proposal that it is appreciated, but is it really needed, considering this proposal is in the Developer Ecosystem challenge?
