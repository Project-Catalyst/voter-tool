His website shows 3 tutorials on how to select a VPS, get a Cardano node running and how to send ADA transactions. Tutorials for new developers is in general a good idea as it increases the educational material that new developers can use and potentially increase the number of developers that migrated to Cardano overtime.  This aligns with the challenge setting  to increase the number of developers building on Cardano.  The proposal however does not articulate what future videos would be in any detail, therefore, it is difficult to judge whether they will be of great benefit to the community.  There are a number of good intro resources on Cardano already such as the Cardano Developers Portal and I would encourage the proposer to articulate how his tutorials are incremental to what already exists.  At this point I am not certain whether this materially adds to what we already have on Cardano.  I am currently myself producing educational material for countries in Africa and I can see that there is already a lot of resources from where to draw.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer is Raul Rosa and he provides a link to his LinkedIn profile. Raul is a hardware adn firmware engineer in Milan and he has had good grades at University. He will create videos on 3 topics:  about the Vasil hardfork,  the protocols on Cardano ( by that I presume he means the main apps operating on Cardano)  and NFT projects and interviews. The budget is set at $15,000 and it would be used to purchase material to create content and maintenance.  There is no allocation of budget to the deliverable items or any further breakdown of what will be purchased with the budget. The suggested timeline is to deliver the project by mid 2023.  And the biggest risk is that the timeline might get delayed.  There is no mention of the technology tools that will be used for the task, however, the proposer has already put out 3 tutorial videos, therefore it can only be presumed that same technology will be used for new videos.  Overall I think the proposal lacks detail around the timeline and the deliverables and it also lacks information on what will be in each of the deliverables. It is, therefore, impossible for me to conclude whether the proposal is feasible.  Educational content is generally a good idea to have and I would encourage the proposal to invest a little more time detailing what is it that he's proposing to deliver so that it can be objectively assessed. Talking from experience  a good way to go about it is to set out a time window when you will produce each video and then break down the time into smaller segments such as weekly (or even daily) and detail exactly what you're going to do in those time slots.

This proposal is slightly more technical, and promises an academy that will discuss Vasil hardfork implications, Plutus testing and operating a stake pool. This would be a welcome addition to the existing knowledge-base if executed well. We are currently provided with a pre-funding website and Github repository, which are more entry level, but the proposers enthusiasm and hard work could make this a worthwhile and impactful addition. I like this proposal to be in the Developer Ecosystem, but think it needs to become a little bit more technical than its current presentation to be of added value to the developer ecosystem as a whole (outside devs trying to learn Cardano, junior Cardano devs, entrepreneurs learning coding skills, node operators trying to run a stake pool etc).\nThe CNFTs from the proposal title could have received a bit more attention, as this would likely be the search term that gets people to the proposed Academy.

Most form questions are answered with only a few sentences, but backed up by links to the project's website, Github and LinkedIn of the proposer.

There are sample videos about installing a node but this content already exists on many channels and is relatively basic. \nAs this proposal resides in the Developer Ecosystem challenge, I am not judging it as a course for absolute beginners, but it should also benefit devs from outside Cardano or existing more junior Cardano devs in my opinion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The business plan and timeline provided within IdeaScale are too brief to allow auditing the progress of this proposal.

This is a project that already has a functioning platform and educational content for developers. Some of these videos include running a node on Cardano, minting an NFT, and lots more.

An important principle of auditing the potential success of a proposal is transparency from the proposer/team. When the proposer is transparent with the community, it allows for trust to be built. However, without a community, it is more difficult to help audit the potential success of a proposal. There is no accountability that can be accounted for. This makes it hard for the readers of the proposal to determine the success of this proposal. Ultimately, there is a lack of specific details, which leaves no room for accountability. This then leads to a lack of trust in the project and makes it difficult to trust that the proposal will be implemented successfully. Because of this, I give this section 2 out of 5 stars.
