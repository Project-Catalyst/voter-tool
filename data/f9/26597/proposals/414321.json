We all know the community is a great value that not every project can own. Cardano Community is something that cannot be copied. Everyone is building together with an ecosystem that focuses \u200b\u200bon knowledge and people. We share knowledge and raise awareness in this crazy market. Members can contribute useful content about the Cardano ecosystem. Based on that, they can receive rewards for their contributions. This motivates members, encouraging them to create more shared, more diverse content. Most people sharing about Cardano are not too focused on money. But, if we have a mechanism for this, we can spread value to a larger community, faster, and more. I am an active member of the community and I find this proposal suitable for the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a 12-month project and is a continuation of a project that was funded in the previous round. I have reviewed the before-funded proposal and saw that it is an information website. The progress and content of the articles are updated regularly and varied. I assume that the team is capable of implementing the requirements of this proposal. In my opinion, if members can contribute content to the website, it is a decentralized website in the true sense of the word. The information provided shows that most of the budget is paid to content contributors  (nearly 90% of the budget). This really makes sense as the proposal is distributing well-deserved rewards to content creators. They are great ambassadors of the Cardano network that are working day and night to build useful content for the community", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The number of active contributors and the number of articles contributed by the community is the main criteria for evaluating the success of the proposal.

Other good thing is that content would be consolidated in one place so community would know where to look for. Hence, solution proposed here does seem to solve, even if partially, the problem statement. The parameters they chose to calculate the distribution are also appropriate.\nIn regard to challenge aligment, it does fit well here, as it goes into some potential directions provided in challenge description such as \"Support and Incentivization structures\" and \"Knowledge base & Documentation\" and addressing metrics as \"Reduce wait time of unanswered communications with developers to 24 hours\" and \" sense of community and conversations\".\n\nAs suggestion, proposer could bring here how he intends to commuunicate this site/opportunity to the comunity both to attract more content and to have more engagement from those who want to learn more.

The only thing that is not so clear is what is this consultant fee as this was not mentioned anywhere before in the proposal. The role of this consultant could be better ellaborated.\nThe project team composition is mostly related to the marketing as the people in the community will be the ones who will generate the content, which makes sense.

For example, I'm not sure how this challenge will affect the amount of repositories on Github that use the tooling (month over month increase).

That knowledge comes from the old people who have been in the market for a long time but not everyone is willing to share and the proposal has introduced a reward mechanism based on the knowledge that users share this really motivates everyone. People tend to share what they know more. Sharing knowledge and earning money at the same time brings a lot of excitement\nHaving more people share their knowledge will help promote the network to expand, and new people getting useful information from experienced people will also help them avoid mistakes and scams.\nPeople in the community will also think more positively and be willing to share their own knowledge this will help build a positive and strong community over time.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is a continuation of an already funded proposal from Fun8 which shows that the project has been noticed and appreciated by the community before.\nWith a specific 12-month roadmap and specific goals\nSpecifically, the roadmap offers mostly goals in terms of the number of knowledge-sharing articles and the number of members, which is really great if achieved specifically as follows:\n(1.

In the crypto world, where knowledge and content are ambiguous, we should have reward schemes for contributors who create and contribute useful content. The Funded Proposal in Fun8 has achieved remarkable results, and the developer is calling for more funds to help it grow even stronger. I agree with the developer's point that \"Community is Cardano's most valuable asset.\" The mechanism the developer offers is quite reasonable; they are based on three main criteria: relevance, immediacy and spread. These three criteria are always the leading criteria in content creation, so the reward mechanism according to these three criteria is the policy in the crypto community.

The reward budget for each piece of content that mentions 20$ for each piece of content with at least 1000 words; what about collaborators who create more than 1000 words?

An average cost of $ 24.6 for an 1000-word article is an appropriate price. That is enough to ensure the qualitve required. Realizing that service costs only accounted for 6.7% of the total initial fund, it proves the great effort of proposed team. Most of these costs are paid to community contributors, it's such a wonderful thing. With a 3-phase roadmap, the first 2 phases last 3 months after being approved. And the final stage lasts 6 months. Their ultimate goal gets +1200 content. I see that the number of requests increase 100 assets after each stage.
