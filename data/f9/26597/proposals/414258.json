The proposing team \u2013 greatly qualified based on the submitted information \u2013 intends to bring Atala Prism one more step forward. Effectively the aim is to bring self-sovereign identity (specifically Cardano\u2019s decentralized identity technology - Prism) to web 2.0. Yes, this is a proposal for an decentralized identity-based marriage of web 2.0 and web 3.0 \u2013 which could propel Cardano\u2019s use for secure identification while respecting sovereign identity management. The proposal should allow web apps to easily interact with PRISM \u2013 which is essentially a fabulous tool for developers all across Cardano\u2019s ecosystem and beyond. This is in line with the challenge and will clearly add value to the Cardano ecosystem. The proposers state that exposing an API through a browser extension allows developers to access the PRISM ecosystem in a couple of hours. A browser wallet for identity could unlock thousands upon thousands of new users who will be able to manage and control their own access and control their identity and data sharing.

Yes, but what has been done was a product solution for in-house enterprise use. The crux of this proposal is to bring a similar solution \u2013 functionality to end users \u2013 a solution that is similar to the internal Atala Prism browser wallet. The work will be backed up (if needed) with developer replacements from the Wiringbits company that focuses on web and blockchain development (wiringbits.net).

The proposed budget of $80500 for a cutting edge solution from a team with these competencies seems realistic.

A lot of attention is given to institutional adoption of DIDs and VCs because of the idea of who has the scope to create the trust registries necessary for the governance layer of a \"credible\" credential, i.e., one with validity obtained through the authority of the issuer.  This paradigm misses a tremendous opportunity to discover the roots of \"peer-validation\" and true decentralization in SSI.  So what is the main tool we need in order to start getting data on this concept?  *Any tool that is in the end users hands!*\n\nThis user-centric wallet, modeled as a browser extension and webapp, is just such a tool.  Before I dig into this, I need to remind the reader that an Identity wallet, even one built around Atala, is NOT a Cardano wallet.  A Cardano wallet points to the blockchain:  the tokens that are \"in\" the wallet are not actually there, they are secure on the blockchain.  For an Identity wallet like this the credentials that are \"in\" it are actually there--and ONLY there.  What goes on the blockchain is the immutable fact of the DID's issuance, verification or evocation, not the DID itself.\n\nWith that out of the way, lets talk about impact.  The idea here is that you would have an identity wallet from which you could issue unlimited credentials.  The validity of these credentials does not come from an on-high institution verifying your ID or skills, but from you saying \"This credential suits MY purposes\".  Obviously, this limits its utility to people who are willing to agree with you on this point.  From here, this proposal suggests creating a developer side to the webapp where he can basically create a module on any webpage that is designed to agree with the user that the credential is valid.  To think about this, who tells you whether your password you choose for a login on some website is valid?  Within the limits of basic security best practices or limitations of the login system, YOU decide what is valid in almost every instance.  And it is that choice that is revalidated every time you reuse the password to login.  This is the same kind of protocol:  a website or app may require knowing it is you, and this plugin would allow that website to see not a password, but your DID.  You could create one for every website, you could add metadata to pre-populate fields such as name and address, or use another one to have all anonymous data.  This type of control is one of the promises of SSI, delayed because of the need for robust governance for the most important validation standards.  But for everyday, simple use, why can't users start to use the technology and in the process discover their OWN standards and uses?\n\nBecause this project addresses a current, critical gap in the Cardano ecosystem's ability to deliver to its users a user-defined UX/UI, and because of its alignment to the challenge goals of getting tools into the hands of developers (and at this stage of SSI, users are a core part of the development team as well) to help bridge gaps such as this, I give this proposal highest marks for Impact.  5 Stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The breakdown of the roadmap/timeline was incredibly useful for also understanding the stack/architecture for this buildout.  In particular, it highlighted for me how this project really is trying to integrate the developer backend for the webapps to a UI/UX that is basically a developer frontend for \"users\".  While the technical implementation and architecture seems straightforward enough, with Atala there will continue to be concern from the community about teams leaning into needing the SDK on mainnet.\n\nTo that point in particular, I think this team is ideally suited, having been technical architects specifically for the wallet side of the PRISM effort at IOG.  As a PRISMPioneer and with access to the SDK myself, I can say that this isn't personally an area where I have any concern.  There is PLENTY for developers to be doing with the current SDKs and especially for the interface envisioned for this wallet structure, almost everything is already available and stable in testnet.  This technical implementation is NOT pushing any sort of boundaries or limits of the technology, it is, in fact, what I would describe as the most basic usecase for DIDs you could really imagine (issue, verify, revoke).  The innovation here is defraying the institutional gravity and momentum while giving only a cursory nod to the deep issues of governance in an effort to get tools into the hands of the users, which I applaud.\n\nThe budget, unfortunately, is not without flaws.  I can tell you it seems reasonable to me ($60 an hour for developers and technical architecture) and that the bottom line total is a steal for what the scope of the project entails and the number of deliverables that will come off of this, but there is little breakdown in the proposal to give evidence of these beliefs.  It would have been nice to see cost estimates added to the milestones at a minimum, and, more importantly, it would have been advisable to get an explicit statement about the funding period and how it aligns with the budget (this will come back to haunt in auditability).\n\nThough the team seems ideally suited to be tackling this project, and while the work to be done is well laid out and explained, the lack of budgetary detail forces me to lower the score by one star, for a 4 star rating. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Similar to the budget in Feasibility, the lack of detail is hurting the proposal here.  While they aren't included here, from the milestones you can pull around 14 key metrics, from delivery of the wrapped SDK, and wallet API, to testing and documentation phases.  They do note that they will be using an agile Kanban setup, into which they will put their timeline, and while this will be opensource, the repo itself was not specified (they have two personal repos, so I'm sure we will be able to eventually find, it, but like several other things, including it would significantly strengthen the proposal).\n\nThe project, based on the timeline looks to be 23 weeks, right around 6 months, and I see lots of deliverables that should allow them to easily populate their monthly progress forms.  Their project success metrics are concrete as well, and are realistic, especially in the realm of developers from outside the project pulling on the repo (they mention one such issue or pull per month, but is should probably be viewed more like 6-10 total, as there will likely be a delay between the start of the project and that kind of collaboration).\n\nBecause the project has a very strong description of its build and objectives, and because it is committed to being opensource, I believe it has a strong auditability component.  However, because that component is either buried in the proposal or reliant on assumptions about things like the opensource reps, I am downgrading a star.
