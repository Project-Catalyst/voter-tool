The fact that this is an established project brings high assurance is their success and makes me recommend them for funding. The website adapools which is rebranded as cexplorer.io was one of the pioneers in pools visualisation and open display of blockchain data and helped many community members choose their first staking pool.

This is sometimes unfortunate, as it might not be possible to measure or evaluate the feedback of the funding requested, but in this case perfectly fine in my opinion.
