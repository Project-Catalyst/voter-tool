They propose a high level DSL integration (GLOW) to the Plutus backend that allows devs to import skills from almost any ecosystem and start building quickly and safely in the Cardano smartcontract environment.\n\nI expect that there will be plenty of attention paid to how accessible this will make Cardano to developers, so I thought I would use this space to address a single line in this proposal that I think has some of the biggest impact:  the idea of having built-in formal verification within GLOW.  MuKn has built a prototype (funded and completed from Fund5, you will want to read this:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aNPkbKSBdos5swJGgRj00NmQ6N1Tpvyq/view ) that demonstrates how to express important properties of the contract inside Glow program source code.  Special lines in the code directly describe both desired and undesired outcomes of the contract, allowing the Glow compiler to check if the program always executes accordingly.\n\nThey have built a game theory layer into this program that allows assertions to be made regarding cooperation and adversarial inputs, which brings self-verification and mathematical proofs into the realm of the average developer.  While it appears to me that there is more work to be done on this formal-verification (it was approved but not funded for further development in Fund7) this is a tremendous addition to the developer's toolbox and one that is well timed for delivery given the state of crypto.  There will be a goldrush for anything that looks like it could effectively shovel \"TRUST\" around, and this is one of the best I have seen, and its rooted in solid principles, including interoperability and scalability.\n\nBecause this project seeks to deliver high performance tools that make Cardano accessible to developers from almost anywhere (the team describes the project as the \"Wordpress\" for blockchain developers), I believe it merits a full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The first issue to suss out is how you get this EVM based program to play well with UTXO.  I have been watching this part closest of all, as it is really the crux of the issue.  A key concept of what this tool imports to the Cardano ecosystem is the set-and-forget functionality of Accounts, and so the team constructed a PoC around a basic settling or \"closing\" contract called buy_sig which they wrote to Cardano from the PAB using GLOW (see here to run yourself: https://github.com/Glow-Lang/glow/tree/master/cardano#readme).  This is a first-footsteps-on-the-moon kind of thing...it does not prove that there isn't some deeper incompatibility, but it does show that at some level the integration is possible and should be pursued.\n\nTo this end they will be approaching this through the buildout of an interpreter (which is the largest budget outlay with the most dedicated dev hours, so you can see where it fits in the priorities list), but that process will have an emergent component, as to how they resolve issues down the line.  For a sneak peak at what I think a highly likely path will be (and also as proof of the teams delivery of this completed software project as well as a hint about work already begun for Cardano under a Fund7 proposal) check out this paper by the team: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12atK0oEME0y1GHo_HmqhrcZ3pQeEqB_0tFKknhsjsLY/edit \n\nA quick note on the team...they mention anonymity here, but they are referring to two of the lead developers they are hiring.  The team itself can be seen here https://mukn.io/team/ and they have opensource repos to browse, lots of community discussion, plenty of collaborations with developers, including IOG.  The team has a history of delivery, so it is likely that they will be diligent in their hiring.\n\nFinally, the budget and roadmap, on a $300,000 proposal deserve some attention.  They present the budget in two ways, correlated to milestones and correlated to roles.  To give a brief overview of the roles, if funded, this project will have ~$43,000 a month, for a six month project to pay (4) fulltime lead developers (plus whatever support they require), a full time project manager, an administrative lead, cover all operational expenses and (1) part time documentation creator.  When looked at through this lens I found the breakdown quite reasonable.  As to budget as it relates to milestones, the two highest cost milestones are building the interpreter (already discussed) and 6 weeks of integration testing, which is the flipside of the interpreter buildout and just as important, as this is where the self-verification and compatibility prove out or not.  I was glad to see that this area wasn't shorted, though it comes at the cost of a much bigger budget ask.  The ability to sink critical developer hours into that last phase could actually prove to be the difference maker of whether this project succeeds or not.\n\nDespite the large budget, and in light of previous deliverables both on Cardano and on other chains, I believe this is a well equipped team with a clear path forward on a project years in the making, with a real chance to bring the core of GLOW program across the finish line here, and so I rate feasibility 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As an opensource project, the expectation is that they will continue to update the GLOW/Cardano repo, and they are actively building out a community component to GLOW which should help with the testing and provide an additional layer of transparency and availability for the project.  Also, it is worth mentioning that the team intends to keep developing with Catalyst going forward, with the creation of an online learning course for GLOW on Cardano, and continuing development of the formal verification methods.\n\nFor progress, this many software sprints should provide plenty of audit points, and there are several milestones provided to mark the beginnings and ends of clear phases (such as the PAB interface, and having the complete GLOW library integrated).  Towards final success, they are pretty clear in their goal, and it aligns with the Challenge:  have developers able to sit down and be intuitively creating smartcontracts in minutes.  High level DSLs have this ability (Marlowe for example, though it is limited to simple financial contracts) to allow users to pick them up based on their own experience, rather than hours of dedicated study and practice.\n\nBecause the team is running an opensource project and has made themselves available to the community, and because they have provided measurable milestones, I believe this project deserves full marks for auditability.  5 Stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 4, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 959, "q0": "The initiative presented in this proposal could be integral for the adoption of Cardano by the wider development world (think the pond and the ocean).\n\nThe proposal is a natural fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge as by its very nature it seeks to meet the most immediate needs of developers, that of simplicity and ease in their work, the prerequisites for being able to be able to focus on creative code.\n\nThe risks are very well-identified and covered by the proposal, implying that the team at Mutual Knowledge has analysed the project thoroughly and understands it very well.\n\nPersonally I very much appreciate the statement given by the team in the definitions of success \u201cwe want Glow to be the WordPress of blockchain\u201d, I think that if this goal is accomplished the impact on our blockchain would be great,  by attracting a large number of creative developers that could deploy new projects with ease.\n\nAdding to the potential impact of this proposal is the fact that Mutual Knowledge is a known entity in the Cardano community. It has been previously supported by IOG and as such, any project that they develop will have an advantage in gaining traction and adoption. Which is very important for a development environment.\n\nMy review of this proposal is made from the perspective of my previous experience as a mobile app development studio manager for more than 5 years. I have also been involved with the Cardano developer community since March 2021 and I have been actively working with Cardano developers since July of 2021.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I appreciate very much the fact that Mutual Knowledge, the team that authored this submission, has taken the time to explain the very complex technical subjects of their proposal in a simplified and understandable way. It shows mastery over the topic they have chosen to address. This is especially visible in how the proposal manages to explain the steps of the implementation plan. It is clear, concise and easy-to-read at the same time. \n\nThe budget breakdown is detailed enough and the amount requested, although relatively large at $300K, makes sense in the context of a larger development company which has other needs than a solo developer might have.\n\nWhile I would have preferred to see the exact details of the team members working on this project as well as links to professional profiles, and perhaps examples of previous works, I understand the privacy concerns cited. The fact that Mutual Knowledge is a known entity within the Cardano developer community makes up for this, and as a consequence, I am able to assess with confidence the fact that this project will be successfully deployed if funded.\n\nThe team has selected \u201cYes\u201d as the answer to the new question related to work on previously funded Catalyst proposals. However, no additional details about this are provided in the proposal as now requested by the submission form. However, I will not be lowering my rating score as a result of this, because the question has been introduced in Fund 9 and the proposers may have not fully understood what is being requested of them. I do suggest the team includes a full answer on future submissions, especially as they have indicated that they will be returning to Catalyst to seek additional funds to continue the project in the future.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "While I very much appreciate the definition of success presented in this proposal the rest of the auditability section is a bit lacking and I would have liked to see a greater emphasis placed on a more detailed set of KPIs and an easy-to-understand list of metrics that the community can use to easily verify the progress being made on this project. I think the goal of any Catalyst-funded project should be to make it as easy as possible to audit its deliverables. Having said that, I think that the proposal does a pretty good job of presenting what can be expected and this is reflected in my rating. Also as I\u2019ve previously noted in my review, the language used in the proposal is very easy to understand and as such, it clearly communicates what we as a community would need to audit.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 5, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3549, "q0": "The proposers want to provide a simple app development through the glow-language developed with safety and portability in mind by making it compatible with the plutus application backend - which is a query backend for developers making developing apps easier. I really enjoyed the videos, and that proposal gives me one more reson that youtube universisty will be a real thing in the future. Jocking aside I really think this would be an impactfull solution and I love seeing proposals I've reviewed positively in previous rounds get voted in and comming back with improvement interations over the initial development to grow towards an idea. This is the defacto definition for me for development ecosystem growth in all aspects.\nThe proposal clearly states and shows how it's going to bring value to the cardano ecosystem and is in 100% alignment with the challenge settings. The proposers have proven to be able to scale with the circumstances and to deliver what they've set out to do.\nThey had me at \"shorter code\", but really won me over with \"business logic is what matters the most for people with ideas and DApps will become mainstream only when the tools are made simpler\". This is simply an amazing summary of what needs to be done and as a developer I 100% agree with it.\nRisks and challenges are reasonable as are the path to overcoming them. This proposal would add this simplification of the tooling that would require you to put in less \"let's figure out how to write this in this specific language\" and more \"let's implement it once and have it work on different blockchains\". I can't stress enough how important this is for developers as well as people with ideas.\nOverall a grea idea and a detailed and reasonable proposal. Good and proven developers doing technical improvement interations. Will have an impact and already does have an impact in the ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have all the credentials skills and know-how to bring this project to it's successful finish. I have researched them for previous funds and proposals so I can verify for their skills thatt are obvious in the youtube videos as well and proven by the already done work that was a product of previous fund proposals.\nThey manage to explain in a simple manner an otherwise complicated process of integration so anyone interested and reading the proposal can understand with a bit ot googling, and this might seem trivial but it's an underappreciated polishing of the proposal that many proposers don't pay too much mind to and make proposals too technical for anyone including developers like me to understand. I give kudos to the authors for not falling in this pit.\nThe roadmap is reasonable coupled with the timeframe which the developers have split the work to be done. There are milestones that will be somewhat easy to follow if you look at the repository with the implementation which is open source. I'm a big open source fan so that makes me happy.\nThe budgeting breakdown could have been done better, considering the proposers are asking for aproximately 1/3 of the challenge budget. I can only imagine what voters will think when they read \"Observing the blockchain: 40k\". I know what they mean because I'm a developer, but that breakdown is simply not good enough and it's not up to the comming standard of braking down estimated time to be spent with a different hourly rate for each role. This is a hit and miss from otherwise a great proposal. It's hard to calculate the hourly rate and compare them with the guidelines or other proposals, which is a problem for an assessor that needs to be able to do that.\nMOOC - Massive Open Online Cources - I really hate abreviations that aren't that commonly known.\nOverall a decent proposal with the single mentioned caveat about the budget breakdown. Still it's a worthy and I'd say somewhat feasible proposal.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "\"Everything we publish is open source\" - this pretty much sais it all. Anyone interested has a link in the proposal of a repositroy that can be watched and followed for any progress notifications. \nI like the proposers have a methodological approach to implementing and expanding the work already done and verified to work. As a developer I can state with certainty that the problem staement is absolutely true and the solution would solve mostt of the problems, although it's not a silver bulet because developers would have to learn glow in order to make use of it's advantages, but I believe it's an effort that's worth it, considering the alternative.\nConcerning the budget auditability, I'd suggest for the proposers to put themselves in the shoes of the non-tech capable voters and read the budget and see if they wouldn't want to rephrase and make the budget table more detailed.\nOverall an auditable solution, no doubt.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 6, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4472, "q0": "This is a very difficult project to assess in the Impact category, as I am torn between the large chunk of the Developer Ecosystem budget requested and the perceived usefulness and existing great body of work from previously funded proof of concept / tooling. On balance, I agree that this project is worth almost a third of the total budget for this challenge setting, as it would still allow ample of very good and useful improvements for developers to be funded in Fund-9, while demonstrating Project Catalysts ability to finance projects of all sizes across meaningful partial funding rounds. In terms of their own merit, in my obviously subjective assessment, would be among the top 20 rank, top 15% by number of proposals in this category regardless of funding requested. Should I really give a lower score because the funding requested is high? The impact of creating a simpler tool for dApp deployment would be enormous, immediately adding hundreds if not thousands of potential would-be dApp developers to Cardano. Voters in previous funds have considered this team and the general idea worthwhile pursuing, and so have IOG (indirectly via angel bridge). The Glow language and all code will be open source, mitigating my concern that we are \"just funding a startup\" here. \nAll this makes it rather hard not to give 5 stars in this category.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have successfully implemented their Fund-5 proposal and created a mini-MOOC for those interested to learn Glow.

It would have been nice to include the profiles of the team members within the proposal, but their website has all the relevant information, including the LinkedIN profiles (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahree/) so this is definitely reassuring. \nIn the light of the large budget requested, it would have been good to see a more detailed timeline and budget breakdown, including possibly a deck or project management diagram, to assure the voters that funds will be used responsibly. The overall vision and roadmap come across well, however, and the order-of-magnitude easier dApp development in a trustless, decentralized environment is thoughtfully documented.

Not only that, the portability of Glow makes it so that Glow programs are not exclusively tied to any blockchain, so providing Glow to the Cardano ecosystem will make it easier to attract more developers to Cardano.
