The proposer suggests PureScript is widely used to build Cardano Dapps. However, no supporting evidence is provided for that. As a developer on Cardano, I primarily use ReactJs for the front-end and it has proven to be an effective framework when used with the cardano-serialization-lib for building transactions that are then sent to the node. There might exist a niche developer group who prefer to use PureScript, but then it is not clear why would they would want to use Vue (rather than ReactJs)  which, as the proposer suggests, is the third most popular framework.  I struggle to see how this would bring new developers to Cardano and how it would improve the experience of developers already on Cardano.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Walker Leite is the developer behind the proposal. He provides a short bio about himself, but there are no social media links to verify his experience besides Github. The skillset for the second developer, that he still need to hire, is provided.  Walker would deliver the bridge between PureScript and JavaScript and the additional developer would develop the link between Haskell and PureScript. A timeline is provided and broken down into four quarters. During the first quarter, the proposer will implement a proof-of-concept. In the second quarter he will build an Isomorphic API. In the third quarter, he will improve the API and improve tooling in the fourth quarter.  From the timeline, it is unclear which part will be delivered by Walker and which the other developer would deliver.  The budget is sized as an annual salary for the developer $60,000 per year.  For two developers the total budget is $120,000.  This works out to $5,000 per month salary, which is competitive for a Haskell developer and about average compared to other proposals I have reviewed so far (30+).  The proposer highlights several risks. The main ones are technical difficulties during the implementation and to mitigate it, he will implement the prototype first. The other risk is related to the possible lack of adoption, which he aims to mitigate with community outreach on community channels. The project doesn't list the second developer and lacks implementation details; therefore, I struggle to justify whether the project will deliver on its intentions.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap is provided with milestones over 1 year with quarterly checkpoints.  A good amount of KPIs are included to track the number of downloads, unique visitors, watches and contributors as well as the ratio of issues closed and the number of commits.  There is a clear statement on the success of the project which is an engaged community building Dapps using Vue and PureScript on the front-end and Haskell with PureScript on the backend. There is no mention on the frequency of KPIs or the channels for communicating these KPIs to the community. I think there's a good chance that Community will be able to audit the deliverable, given that development will happen on GitHub, and there's a good detail on KPIs that will be monitored.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4460, "q0": "This proposal would try to build a bridge between Vue and PureScript (Haskell-like language for web applications), to allow the large universe of existing JavaScript-savvy DApp developers to deploy on Cardano. While being experimental, it is a very interesting idea and has the potential for large impact on our developer ecosystem. As far as the brief from this Challenge Setting is concerned, it is an excellent fit and would contribute to all metrics that define success of the challenge. The only thing I like to have seen more of is reaching out to the developer community to fill some of the definition and skill gaps beforehand and show openness to collaborate and display the sense of community and conversations this challenge calls for.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposer from southern Brazil is a graduate of the Plutus Pioneer program and has also studied Haskell and PureScript on his own, while being a full-time web developer. He plans to hire a more experienced Plutus developer to work on equal terms (getting paid half the budget requested). As this position is currently empty, it is a crucial success factor of this proposal, and some preliminary market analysis or backstop (getting commitment from MLabs or IOHK for example to provide initial support if the position proves hard to fill) would have been a great step to mitigate this risk. I would also have loved to see this risk discussed - instead of the very good discussion of risks involving the UX and finished product.\nWhat is missing from the budget and feasibility discussion is the breakdown of working hours committed, to get a better feeling of how this project would fit with the full time work commitment of the proposer.\nThe milestones are very measured and sensible, but could have been complemented with a more detailed timeline and much more detail on testing and Cardano resources required.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "By sharing his Github and LinkedIn profiles, being open about the missing Haskell expertise and allocating half of the budget to this vacancy shows the high commitment of this proposer to make the project a success and be transparent. I would still have liked to see much more detail about the steps necessary to fill the role, KPIs and milestones for the development process pre-launch, and ways to connect with existing builders and the many extremely helpful people in Catalyst who are already sharing Plutus and development resources. Weighing the very strong points of this proposal against the weaknesses let me conclude that currently this project is not highly likely to be delivered successfully and on time, but it may well be worth taking a leap of faith, or if not funded coming back to co-propose with an experienced Haskell/PureScript developer.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10774, "q0": "After reviewing your whole proposal, I'd like to provide an overview (this is the view of a non-technologist).

So let's go a little more explicit about these.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is the final section of a proposal and has the fewest requirements, so it's simple to see why it's frequently the shortest.
