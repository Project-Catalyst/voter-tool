They suggest it will bring additional developers into the Cardano ecosystem and give existing C++ developers example code from which to start their own projects. As a developer, I think diversity in implementations is always good. So it brings new developers and enhances the experience of existing developers. The project scales well as it will be released as open-source on GitHub, and the proposers will come back for additional funding if the community finds it valuable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the project will be delivered by 2 individuals: Dylan and Willie. Their short CVs are provided, but no social media links.  It would have been nice to see some social media links so their track record could be verified. When searching for Dylan it shows his Linkedin page that corroborates his experience. The deliverable is split into four parts and each one relates to the generation of different types of keys for the stake pool. As a stake pool operator myself, I recognize the types of keys and can confirm that they are required. The budget is outlined clearly and broken into sections.  Each section has an hourly expenditure at cost of $40 per hour.  Given the proposers\u2019 experience and that they have built tools on Cardano before, this is a very competitive hourly rate and much below the average of the 30+ proposals I have reviewed so far. The total budget is $12,000. The proposed timeline is to finish in Q1 next year, which is reasonable considering it would take them 160 hours to complete. The risk highlighted is that the team might need to do some learning about the detail of how Cardano nodes encryption works if they encounter difficulties with the implementation. I think this is a small risk and a meaningful mitigation strategy as everyone at some point finds that they need to learn something new when delivering a project.  Overall, the timeline, the architecture, the language, and the technical details of the implementation are adequately described. I think the team has a very good chance to deliver this project on time and on budget", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, The progress on the project will be measured by the number of commits per month on the public GitHub repo and a successful delivery will be a series of tests published as open-source on GitHub and available for others to use at the end of the project. Given that the tool is being built for the community I would have liked to see some measures of community adoption.  The proposers are active in the community, and I have no doubt that the community would be able to audit them based on the information provided in this proposal and by reaching out on Github and other social media channels.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 911, "q0": "This team is building open source libraries containing essential functionalities for developers in the Cardano ecosystem.

At the same time the statement of how problem is to be solved is poorly explained and in my opinion it doesn\u2019t clear how c++ developers will be attracted to go to Cardano blockchain and it doesn\u2019t clear how this proposal can create financial incentive for developers.\nI think it's important to improve details about the proposal services solution for the challenge (eg. Typical services use case for developer, example benefit for service creator and community, \u2026)", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are only one link in the proposal that refers to 3 team members, but it is not possibile to identify the teams the work on the proposal and the proposal assessment is difficult.

This proposal is definitely in the right category and matches the challenge settings completely. Before googling it I didn't know that the C++ community has 6.3 active participants, so knowing that, let's let the kind authors of the proposal enable them to bring their numbers and considerable skills to the cardano ecosystem as part of them have already done.\nI think the proposers have missed anwering the possible risks, because I don't see any mention of that in this particular section, but I'd say the biggest risk IMHO would be to not get voted in because people don't understand what integral part of the cardano ecosystem would this library be for c++ devs. If augmented the library would expand the capabilities of devs to provide stakepool capabilities in c++ while spinging along with billy idols' - speed.\nAs a developer I appreciate the specifics on how the library would be extended, so thank you for that, it's usefull to me in order to asses the impact, which will be certain. Overall an excellen and most of all succinct proposal that will have an impact for sure.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I'm sure technical ability isn't an issue here, because I took a look at the github repository and with my humble c++ skills I managed to see that they are way way above my level as they should be. They've provided their names and I was able to verify their credentials listed in the proposal, but would kindly ask for links in the next proposal because it greatly speeds up the verification process on my part. Having said that, they do have more than enough experience to deliver the specified features.\nI'd say their hourly estimation is, as mentioned, conservative, so I do appreciate the value/cost ratio and would advise the voters to appreciate it as well. This is one of the \"cheap\" proposals, If I could express it in such a way, which makes it a no brainer. I really do like grand ideas and plans for the future, but I really think such small incremental changes much more likely to happen and that alongside the developers' skills brings the whole proposal likelyness to happen a lot more plausible and probable.\nThe roadmap is simple yet specific, which is a benefit of the concrete proposal with little moving parts. The budget breakdown is solid and as a developer I think the timframe is perfectly reasonable to get things done in a steady pace.\nAll technical aspects of the implementation are noted, which is already better done than many other proposals. And the greatest benefit for me as an assessor is the fact the proposal is succinct. This is something you come to appreciate when you read for about 40 minutes things that could be summarized in 2 minutes. So thank you!\nThis is definately not only feasible but probable solution. I reviewed it last round or fund 6 I'm not sure, and here they are again making incremental changes as is the propery way.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I don't know the first thing about measuring the success of a production except for the view count and profits when thinking about movies, but the proposers have listed quite an extensive list of metrics they will follow to gage the adoption and interest so all goot metrics and KPIs wise.\nThe roadmap with milestones give a good map in the mind of any supporter of the project so they know what to expect and when exactly and thus are enabled to follow along with the project updates and timeline and eventual success.\nProposers have a good problem statement, a simple yet effective solution to build a documentary which is quite nice and the first proposal of this sort I've seen so kudos for that. By the looks of it they do know what they're doing and will involve the local community as they already have done through the hackathons.\nNothing left to do besides stating the obvious - this is an auditable proposal and I recommend voting for it since...for the third time value/cost ratio = amazing!", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 3, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4216, "q0": "The \"Stake Pool Keys in libcardano\" proposal addresses the Developer Ecosystem Challenge by adding the open-source C++ library to provide stake pool cryptographic functionalities.

Rightly, the proposer will have to go through project documentation and example code in the IOHK repositories and the risk that the team would have to re-learn to extend this functionality.

The proposer could mention their strengths and compatibility to the Cardano library, or their commonality (something most C++ developers are familiar with and can utilize at ease). It is true that the proposal is well-aligned with the challenge and the impacts of this proposal are also clearly presented.
