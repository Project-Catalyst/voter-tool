An API is an integral part of the development workflow and any project that makes a free API is worth the funding. As a developer I do recognize how much easier the development is with the help of an API where the logic behind it is abstracted away and you only get the end result. That absolutely matches with the challenge settings, making devs lives easier and help growing and educating the community by providing an easier way to develop decentralized applications.\nThis proposal brings and if funded will continue to bring value to the developer ecosystem. There are projects already depending and related to this API. It's just a corner stone and you can't build without having something to rely on. I really do urge anyone reading this to vote for them because the budget is negligible compared to the value it brings.\nThere will be no doubt the team will handle challenges and requests comming their way, because they've already done it for 2 years now so they have all the necesary experience. It's a piece from the ecosystem that is an important part of the ecosystem.\nAs a developer I don't ahve any concers about the continuation of this proposal and funding rates. Overall an impactful solution to an already existing problem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I don't think there's much to say about feasibility team wise, because they've already done it and are doing it, so no point in checking their credentials to see if they can get the job done, because they obviously can. \nAs I mentioned earlyer the budget is worth it and it's basically salaries for 2 people for 6 more months and infrastructure costs, which are at regular prices for the hosting providers. The budget is clear and simple. The timetable is more than clear, and they will do this on a 6 month interval and as long as it's necessary I believe that we as a community should keep funding such projects to get the free services they offer.\nNot much more to say here besides this is more than feasible project - it's a probable one and I hope enough voters recognise the importance of it.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I love the success definition - being able to provide a service forever. All related repositories are visible and anyone can follow the efforts. The KPIs are the standard ones for an API to measure requests per month so it's all clear and auditable.\nThere's a good problem statement - if you need free APIs we need funding and a solution - get us that funding so we can keep doing what we're doing already, so no questions there. overall this is a really important solution that would cost 2.34% of the whole challenge funding, so it's a no brainer. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 13, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3817, "q0": "Having read through this proposal, the purpose of this proposal is to keep the existing Dandelion Community Service, which has been serving the community for 21 months now, running for at least 6 months to help ne  comers and small teams to try prototype APIs and build on Cardano.\nThe problem statement is very clear. The group is proposing to maintain the free community service that have served hundreds of thousands of requests every month for their community, and to carry on making contributions to the open source projects that make it possible.\nIn addressing the challenge, the proposal mentioned that Dandelion Community Service has proven to promote Cardano developer ecosystem through creating a good experience that incentivizes developers. This has led to increase in developer adoption and building on top of Cardano.\nThe proposer has emphasized that there will not be any risk involved.\nThis proposal I believe addressed the challenge effectively.

Their road map is to keep the uptime of the community nodes as high as possible and also to keep maintaining the open source  project up to date with new service updates. \nThe total budget requested is $23400 which is quite reasonable. The breakdown into smaller budgets is done smartly showing costs per person, per place and the months involved. \nThe team is made up of two community members called Roberto C. Morano and Tom, who are both stake pool operators and active members in the Cardano community. LinkedIn references have been provided. \nThe team indicated that probably they would return to Catalyst for more support in funding to sustain the service.

The 6 months that would be budgeted for in this proposal, starts out with: \"Keep the uptime of the community nodes as high as possible\", but I don't really know what that actually means. Which uptime level are we talking about? Which nodes are we talking about? It's a bit hard to visualize from just those words. Maybe put into some concrete milestones and deliverables, especially since they add in their solution descriptions that they wish to work with at least 4 other proposals in order to launch their full solution. The other element I find murky is \"Maintain the OpenSource projects up-to-date with service updates\". What updates? To which projects? In 6 months do you have concrete deliverables for any of these puzzle pieces (Dandelion validators, Spectre cryptoeconomical model, L4 software)? I don't really get what maintaining anything means here, maybe adding more clarity there will help clarify your roadmap.\n\nThe team seems to have the necessary experience to carry out the proposal as they have worked on it before.\n\nThe budget will be a total of $23,400 and that this amount is requested so that \u201c2x Systems administrator/DevOps profile\u201d can carry out their responsibilities in the maintenance of the system . But this information is low. What exactly would these administrators do in their day-to-day routine? And what will their work process look like? When does this work week start and end?

Lets look at the following metrics: Number of requests per month KPI proposed by the bidder will certainly serve as a good way to monitor the progression of success + partial results of this project. But maybe instead we could propose another KPI in addition, so I'll suggest that for this project it would be interesting to also monitor how all these information were shared with the Cardano community . Talking about numbers is one thing, and ensuring that all necessary feedback are given to us through accurate and transparent communication channels is another important issue for which I think we need to help keep an eye on. In my opinion it would be interesting for the team behind this proposal to organize themselves during the development phase and create monthly reports containing not just numerical data related to the realization of this idea, but also further information aimed at helping us understand how their work routine was each time, in other words: what they achieved in terms of objectives (this can be exemplified by looking at their roadmap goals), how they promoted/communicated it on social media/other means (if possible open a link where everyone can view all these reports together).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3205", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11928, "q0": "The proposal to maintain the Dandelion Community Service will immensely help the Developer Environment by keeping the open-source community-driven accessible prototyping helper alive, helping Cardano adoption and their development to be easier and faster than building from 0 for every project.

The PIC profile and contacts is also included for audit.\n\nThe proposal has also has a great reasoning to return to catalyst, with the feedback-loop system they seen could make the treasury sustainable. The timeline does not broken down into quite detailed, but since the project talks about long term maintenance, the timeline could be derived as a long target for first 6 months. \n\nThe proposal would also be better if it is able to point out the targets of development and updates example to emphasize the project worth and its continuity with future plan for more segmented and visible target of implementation.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "5 start for the proposed KPI by measuring request per month and boarded projects that use the Dandelion service.
