His solution, which is the establishment of an Open Source Interactive Developer Training, is well aligned with the needs of the challenge because it increases the usefulness and adoption of Cardano. Its positive impact for the ecosystem is conscious and explained. However, I didn't really manage to find the KPIs. The proposer has put a lot of effort into explaining the why of this project, but the how is more difficult to understand directly.

But it lacks important information such as indices of confidence in order to ensure its sure value, knowing moreover that the budget turns out to be quite high.

The course rules include when students are trained, then encourage students to become developers, by providing scholarships to students who start building ideas on the Cardano ecosystem. The solutions proposed by the team have examples and reasonable explanations, with evidence for examples and statements.\n* however I find there are still some shortcomings that need to be added to the plan presentation of this proposal below,\n- firstly, the proponent needs to define the areas of activity, which will apply this support program, because basically the courses of other developers to which the team has links, basically do not support support multiple languages, and since each course is so established will be in different countries, and since it is possible that you can define a target area, re-zoning and centralizing these courses , only then can high results,\n- secondly, have the team contacted the proposed topics of the courses that you have listed in this presentation, have they agreed to cooperate with the proposal team to provide support when necessary, have not seen the statement yet?

Therefore, it is necessary to give comments and footnotes for each expense.\n\n it looks like the team information doesn't have the name of this proposal team but all the links to the courses, but those courses belong to another development team, not the team Therefore, the group needs to state how many people your group will have and assign positions to each person in the group to ensure that the work is done in accordance with their personal experience.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposed group has stated that it will provide information for the community to monitor every two weeks on GitHub, but it is inadequate for the group to not state the work it will do, or metrics. measure the progress of the work of the team, so that the community can rely on it and with the support provided by the proposed team to audit and verify the work is completed or not, but it is also understandable when the team fails to provide them, because the team basically did not plan for the milestones from the beginning, and it is almost not clear what the work of the proposed team is because of all the content presented, in this proposal entirely from the courses of the other proposal, so to plan and set up the work will be very difficult, and moreover the successes are also unknown, what benefits the proposal will bring to the community , in general I disagree with the flawed plans and incomplete, out-of-the-box presentation of this proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2352", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5109, "q0": "To put it simply, this proposal aims to create a learning platform for aspiring Cardano Developers. This alone has answered one of the main problems in the challenge by reducing the friction of new developers that are planning to get into Cardano Dev Ecosystem. \n \nBut, what good would it do for yet another learning platform in the community? This proposal has the answer. The author\u2019s idea is to add more incentives for new developers by introducing \u201cCardano Developer Scholarship\u201d. This monetary reward-based system gives enrolled students more incentives and motivation to finish the learning progress. \n \nThis proposal also includes detailed planning on becoming a self-sustained project by creating a way to raise funds using NFTs. This ensures the project\u2019s future sustainability. The author also has a crystal clear vision of how the curriculum would be planned out, by the curriculum plan detailed in the proposal. With that in mind, this proposal does not aim to replace all the existing learning platforms in the community but to be an extension through collaboration. This will also help build a more collaborative, healthy developer community within the Cardano space. \n \nThe risks and ways to mitigate them also have been laid out in the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "First, the author has a firm idea of how this project is heading. They have presented a successful existing project as its benchmark. The author also recognized the risks and ways to mitigate them in this proposal. This proposal also includes a very detailed curriculum plan to be implemented, which adds some points to the feasibility of this project.\n \nBut as far as feasibility goes, unfortunately, this proposal has a few noticeable gaps that need to be filled. The author has failed to present any details on the team/people working on the project. The author only stated that this project would be a work of collaboration among other proposed projects in this fund. This proposal also requests an absurdly massive amount of funding. That is because the author calculates all the collaborators (4 different projects in total) in this proposal funding. This project itself requests $31,000 but without the justification needed.\n \nMoreover, the author has not provided a realistic timetable with milestones to track the project\u2019s development progress.

The proposal team intends to build an open-source, community contributed training hub for aspiring developers. One of the team suggestions is to provide a quality education platform where hardworking and aspiring developers can get verified certification and also get rewarded on ADA when they complete the full track of a course. While this project is really good, I believe there is one aspect that might be useful. This platform mostly addresses to young and aspiring developers, not experienced ones. The disadvantage I see in here is that the process will take a long take until it starts to become of real use to our community. Given that Haskell programming language has a really steep learning curve, there would be at least 6 months for the program to produce its first graduates and start being productive. While this project is clearly necessary to the community, I suggest that the team refine their idea and include some extra features that intend to attract experienced developers as well. In that way there would be no time loss. Apart from this suggestion I believe that the proposal is really good. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I found this part of the proposal to be confusing. First of all, the part about timeline and milestone is left empty so no real detail in there.

I must say that it doesn\u2019t seem very reliable and it doesn\u2019t project confidence. The same thing happens with the people that are going to work on the project. No details provided. Again links to other problems on other challenges are given and it has been said that all people in this other proposals are going to be working in here. I suggest that the team needs to provide a lot more detail in here given that the requested funding is $110000. That is a lot of money, and a lot more effort has to be put in this part. Again I must say this parts needs to really be revised and explain in great detail everything about the team, the hourly rate and everything else.

And I see no public channel for the community to audit the progress.
