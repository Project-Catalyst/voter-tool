However, most of today's programmers in Vietnam still write familiar and popular coding languages \u200b\u200bfor many years like Java, PHP, and Python. In recent years, blockchain technology has exploded, a large number of programmers want to switch to learning blockchain but face a lot of difficulties in getting started such as resources, specialized courses, clubs, and communities but very few. Vietnamese or very hard to find. That makes it difficult for many programmers to absorb or misunderstand the true nature and actual value of blockchain, even though many people think that blockchain is a scam. Therefore, the establishment of the Blockchain Course for Vietnamese Devs in Vietnam is a great idea, not only to help Vietnamese developers have a correct and comprehensive view of blockchain but also to help the community to build the blockchain.

The proposed solution is to conduct short training courses for developers to share knowledge of the blockchain and Cardano ecosystem. These courses have been done in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minch regularly but at a fee from the participants. The purpose of this proposal is to ask for a funding so that these courses can be given out for free. The proposer has provided a syllabus that will be discussed in the courses, which includes intro to blockchain technology, ways to evaluate blockchain, opportunities in blockchain, as well as topics on Cardano (intro, advantages. and working for Cardano). From the syllabus given, it seems that the purpose of this project is more to attract more developers into the Cardano ecosystem instead of giving a technical course on Cardano. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing since at the end of the day, introducing more developers to the blockchain technology, especially Cardano, will grow Cardano\u2019s outreach and may be the gateway for discovering new talents that can work on the Cardano ecosystem. However, from the syllabus, it seems to me that Cardano wouldn\u2019t be the main focus of the courses since the amount of Cardano topics is less than the general blockchain technology.

In the proposal, there was an attached documentation of courses that have been done in the past regarding blockchain and crypto. This shows that the team member has the relevant skills that are needed to implement this project. \n\nThe proposer provided a roadmap of this project. There will be 4 courses that will be done in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh (2 courses in each city). The 1st course will be in Sep or Oct 2022, the 2nd course in Nov or Dec 2022, the 3rd course in Jan or Feb 2023, and the 4th course in Feb or Mar 2023. Considering the courses will be done in 2 weekend days, the schedule for each event seems feasible to be completed since it\u2019s apart by around 1 month for logistics and planning. However, I\u2019d have liked if the proposer provided more details regarding the logistic and planning stages, such as reserving the room, preparing equipment, etc. but overall, the timeline provided is adequate and seems feasible to be completed.    \n\nThe budget of 22400 USD has been requested for this project and has been broken down into several items. This includes the lecturers fee (2000 USD per course), flight and accommodation (500 USD per course), documents (100 USD per course), room reservation fee (1200 USD per course), digital marketing (500 USD per course), and 2000 USD each for advisor and backup budget. The budget has been broken down into identifiable items however I\u2019d prefer if there were more details for some of the items. For example, the budget for digital marketing could have been expanded more regarding what type of digital marketing (i.e. short videos, digital poster, social media page, etc.) will be done so the cost can be judged more clearly.    \n\nThe main risk to be considered is the covid pandemic which would hinder the events since it will be an offline course and the proposer has identified this and proposed that the course will be held online at first on the set date in this proposal and will be held again later for the same students offline once it is possible again. This shows that the proposer knows the risk of running an offline event and has come up with the solution to hold the event while still ensuring that students can still participate fully in the course at a later date.  \n\nOverall, I\u2019m in agreement over the feasibility aspect of this project since the team members involved in this project have the skills needed, the budget has been broken down in details, as well as having a well laid out and realistic roadmap for the completion of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs chosen as a way to measure the success of this project include metrics such as the \u201cnumber of new registered participants\u201d, \u201cnumber of developers joining the course\u201d, as well as \u201cnumber of students participating in Cardano ecosytem (as PA, proposer, or voter)\u201d.

So this proposal for Vietnam I think is necessary and reasonable. For sustainable and long-term development in any field, it is also necessary to have a good knowledge and understanding of that field may be in the right direction. Therefore, organizing short-term training courses for developers in Vietnam to help them gain more understanding and knowledge of Blockchain technology is a very meaningful thing and has a great impact, not only for the developer itself but also for Vietnam in general. The proponent presented the community building process starting from providing background knowledge and thinking so that people have the right view, and avoid being scammed, this is quite practical and accurate because it will create confidence and motivation for new people. Moreover, the courses are always held regularly, and the frequency of impacting the students is once every 2 months, enough for the students to absorb the knowledge and have time to practice applying the knowledge they have learned. The proponent also pointed out the fact that since 5 years ago there were 1000 participants in the course, and until now this number continues to increase. Currently, some students are still taking online courses, thereby seeing the impact of the problem is relatively large. The solution proposed by the proponent identified most of the problems of the challenge. The proponent provided information on the time, location, and content of the courses. Thereby demonstrating the positive impact of the proposal on developers and the Cardano ecosystem. In order to successfully implement the project, the proponent had foreseen a potential risk, that is, the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic will prevent the course from being held on schedule. However, in the face of difficulties, the proponent has also prepared a solution to reduce that risk, by organizing online courses to ensure those who are not in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh due to the epidemic or because they are busy, they can't take the offline course, they can still join the online course. I think if this project is successful in the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh locations, there will be more courses in other localities, ensuring those who are passionate about Blockchain but not in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh are still participating.

According to the description inside the proposal, there will be a quarterly course and involve the time from the third quarter of this current year till the beginning quarter. It would be a nice distance for participants to take time to remember and upgrade their knowledge of new \u201cblockchain\u201d from the course and also avoid being stuck with a huge number of complicated definitions due to studying in a short and continuous time. Additionally, the costs for renting expenses (meeting room, teaching tool, etc.) are included clearly in the budgeted plan and I evaluate those costs are reasonable (compared to the practical price in VietNam).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information of the course is published as well so that participants or people in Cardano\u2019s community can discuss together about the possibility or reliability of the course whether they still feel suspicious. The proposer has attached the auditing information of the proposal together with the profile of candidates in the proposer group. They perform all of the needed information as well as the curriculum vitae of each member via Telegram to prove how truthful they are. On the other hand, we can make evaluation whether the courses are on the right \u201croute\u201d or not by making a comparison with the provided timeline that has been spotlighted which level can be considered as success. With all the presentation of this proposal, it would be predictable how crowded participants will join this event.

In the previous 5 years, they have had 1000 trainees join in by online course. Now, course counties open every 2 month with a tuition fee of 10.000.000 VND( ~ 400 USD), But they want to donate to free courses for all Vietnamese internships and then, there is a growing number of tailed developers devoted to The Cardano Platform. Secondly, the project brings a wide range of benefits for developers as well as the cardano ecosystem. In terms of developers, they have basic knowledge of Casanova blockchain and career opportunities and for cardano, it makes the cardano more popular and has many potential developers in Vietnam contributing. \nOn the other hand, the proposal realized that the outbreak of the pandemic of the Covid-19 will make the course unsuccessful. However, they gave a solution to solve this problem that they will teach online instead of offline through the Zoom platform. It is a good idea to set their goal without being affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Especially, 1 positive is that the proposal has been auto-translated into English from another language because as you know, it is the era of global gathering and then, language plays a key role in finding investors, find foreign businesses to set their goal.

On the other hand, the project has a professional staff with more experience and specialized knowledge in this field. They allocate to good work and are suitable for each position in the team. At the same time, proposal provided clearly actual time to achieve the goal and in the year 2023 will take to\ncomplete the project.

However, the proposal does not provide a timeline on how to reach their goal and how long. At the same time, the Team also does not roadmap or key metrics to measure success of this project. In conclusion, I hold a belief that if proposals can fix and give solutions to solve the above problem, the success rate of the project will increase. This leads to there is a growing of a number of Vietnamese developers who have blockchain knowledge and more job opportunities in the Cardano ecosystem.
