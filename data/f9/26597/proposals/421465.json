It already was when I joined in February 2021, so kudos to the proposer for taking on the challenge.\n\nBut unfortunately, this proposal does not offer a realistic solution. In fact, I found the main presentation of this project to be nothing more than a retelling of the Cardano roadmap in the author's own words. With a few errors I might add, as the author states that \u201cwhen both a voting and treasury system are in place, Cardano will be truly decentralized\u201d when in fact Cardano already has a treasury system (that\u2019s what\u2019s funding Catalyst actually) and a voting system - even though for now it\u2019s not on the main chain.\n\nWe may not like everything about Ideascale at this point, but the simple truth is that the community doesn\u2019t yet have the resources to build an Ideascale replacement from scratch currently. It will likely come in time, but probably bit by bit, not in one fell swoop like this proposer seems to indicate.\n\nI would also like to add the fact that the proposer doesn\u2019t explain why this proposal for building Project Catalyst infrastructure is a good fit for the Developer Ecosystem challenge.\n\nMy review of this Developer Ecosystem proposal is based on my experience as a project manager working directly with Cardano developers since July 2021. I have participated in almost all roles in Project Catalyst since February 2021, including as a previously funded proposer, and I\u2019ve been involved with the Cardano development community and NFT community for about a year and a half.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "It is very hard to envision that the proposers, a two-person team will be able to design a framework for an actual workable replacement for Ideascale, especially not with the budget they have requested. I think it\u2019s unrealistically low and probably represents less than the monthly cost IOG is paying to Ideascale currently. The community will eventually have to get there and build a replacement proposal system, but I don\u2019t think this would set us of in the right direction.\n\nBy looking at the implementation plan we can see that a large part of the project is allocated to research, however, I consider this approach unlikely to yield the expected results. Catalyst is a global community of many thousand - if only a small percentage of the community participates in this research the results could be far superior to what only two individuals, no matter how skilled, can produce on their own. But probably most importantly this is a solution/product that interested parties in the community must participate in from the very beginning for it to stand a chance at being successful. \n\nThe intention of the project is admirable and much needed as I\u2019ve stated in the opening of this assessment, however, I think the likelihood that anything of real value for the community will come out of this particular proposal is quite small. Not because it lacks ambition, because at this point I see it as unrealistically over-ambitious. But not impossible, that\u2019s why I \u201cdisagree\u201d not \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d.\n\nAs a final note to my Feasibility assessment, I would like to add that the proposing team has selected \u201cYes\u201d as the answer to the new question related to other Fund 9 proposals. As such, one item that is missing from the proposal currently, is the description of the exact commitment required by all the projects they have submitted in Fund 9. As requested by the question description this should have come with a plan on how they plan to manage the workload. These are elements that are now requested when submitting proposals. However, since the questions have just been introduced in Fund 9 I will not be deducting any points from my rating because of this. The proposers may have not fully understood what is being requested of them, but, I do recommend the team include an actual description in future submissions.\n\nThe data about every other proposal submitted by the main proposer in Fund 9 as well as previous funds is available on Lido Nation, a Catalyst data aggregator website.\n\nhttps://www.lidonation.com/en/project-catalyst/users/991 ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I find the answers that the proposing team has given to the auditability questions to be mostly inadequate. The reporting strategy for this proposal fails to acknowledge that Catalyst is a community of tens of thousands and that there are millions of ADA holders in the world, all with an implicit interest in Catalyst, even if they haven\u2019t engaged in the process yet. Despite this, the reporting plan presented for this proposal revolves around the few dozen people who engage regularly with the Project Catalyst After Town Halls, and Swarm events. While these are admirable grass-roots initiatives of the Catalyst community if this proposal would be funded it would have the duty to make progress reports accessible and available in full to the whole Catalyst and Cardano communities, not just to a very small subset of it.\n\nI found the best part of this proposal to be its definition of success. I am in agreement that the Catalyst community will eventually need to get to the place described, however, overall I don\u2019t think this proposal would set us up on the right track to get there.\n\nDespite this, I really appreciate the initiative and don\u2019t want to discourage the proposer to continue thinking about this problem. The answer is out there.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2169", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4955, "q0": "The proposal aims to design a community managed proposal system that will eventually replace Ideascale use in Catalyst. This is a worthy problem to solve. Ideascale has many issues and is seen as problematic by a sizeable portion of the community. Although, the proposers imply the main issue is \"no waiting on APIs or access\" which to me feels an incorrect diagnosis of the problem. I would have thought the issue with ideascale is the slowness, and outright terrible sorting algorithms that make no sense (eg. sort by trending and get the most recent ideas. How do you code something SO BAD IDEASCALE. Fix your SQL queries dammit). Ahem anyway.  \n\nAssuming the problem with Ideascale is no APIs as the proposal suggests I did a quick google search for Ideascale APIs. There's a ton of endpoints available to be used: https://a.ideascale.com/api-docs/index.html. The access to these APIs may be limited, or the API may be missing features the proposers feel are needed. We don't know that, but if that's the case this should have been explained by the proposers.\n\nMoving on to fit with the challenge, this proposal is not aligned at all with the challenge. The aim of the challenge is to make developer experience on Cardano better. This proposal creates an entirely new system to manage Catalyst proposals in (doesn't have anything to do with the challenge). It will also have an API (this part relates to the challenge). It's good to have an API for proposals but that's not the main point of creating a proposal system. If you create a proposal management system to have an API you're doing something very, very wrong. First create a good proposal management system. Then build on it with an API 3rd parties can use to interact with it. Or have a brilliant new model for a proposal management system that runs entirely out of an API, but please make sure to mention that is the case. \n\nAfter reading through the proposal several times, I realized they aren't planning to build this platform, but just to design it and present their design to the community to build it in the future. This should be made much, much more clearer. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The project will be done by a team of two. From what I understand (this is not stated explicitly), Sean does the programming/design and Joey does everything else. Through Joey's linkedin we see that he is knowledgeable in IT project management but he has no skills in software development. The proposal I assume is written by Joey who says in risks: \"I have engaged a Programmer if something were to happen with his engagement I would need to replace his skills.\". Assuming that programmer is Sean we can deduce his connection to this project is tenuous at best. This is a project to replace Ideascale. Ideascale is a mammoth of a web application. It can't be replaced with an application built by a single developer. Good thing this is just a preliminary design but still, it is a massive job that needs a diverse team of experts to pull off properly. It needs a good understanding of the problem, which I don't think the team has, since they have not shown what problems exist in Ideascale in the proposal.\n\nWhat happens after the design is done is also not clear. The plan I assume is to build it into a complete platform with the community, so if we had some detail on how that could be achieved, that would have been a reason to have a higher rating. But there's nothing on that part other than \"seeking input and feedback via After Town Halls, Swarms and Community Zoom meetings.\" They'll share the results with Catalyst community and then what? Will they create this community of builders and build the platform? Will they market their work so others pick up where they left off? I'm not sure. When asked if they'll return to Catalyst they say \"Yes, when complete this will be a Framework that the community builders and adapt and grow to their own needs.\". That doesn't really answer any of the questions it needs to answer. \n\n\n\n\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is almost no detail to how this proposal would be audited. Relating to project progress, this is all the info we're given: \"We will update the community at the Project Catalyst After Town Halls, Swarm events and Community Zoom meetings.\" They'll share information through meetings. That's good but it's certainly not enough. They'll also do a monthly report of project status. Through which communication channel? Including which details? We have no idea. \n\nAlso, where is the git repository where we can check the progress of development? As a developer myself, I'm highly critical when an open source software project fails to mention git in regards to project progress. Since this is a community system, it should have a public git repository where we can check the state of the software/design at anytime. \n\nFinally, the success of the proposal is defined very poorly. It says: \"An Front End development software product that meets the Communities needs will be evaluated and selected.\" That has nothing to do with success of the proposal. Again with this: \"An Database Product that meets the Communities Needs will be evaluated and selected.\" Only bit here that is relevant is this: \"A Framework - A Functional Front End Design and Data Model will be completed.\" So success is a front end design and a data model. That is so poorly defined that any website running an SQL server fits that success definition. \n\nThis is a terrible proposal. I suggest to the proposers to give more detail on EVERY piece of it. It is very lacking.\n\n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2643", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 729, "q0": "The proposer describes how moving to Voltaire will require a decentralized Community Proposal system. It is not clear how this adds new developers to the Cardano ecosystem it is also unclear how it creates an awesome developer experience.

The proposer also states that there's a lack of API in Ideascale however doesn't mention existing tools currently operate on top of Ideascale, such as cardanocataly.st. The proposer does not elaborate how the project would scale or future its sustainability. I struggle to see how the proposal aligns with the challenge setting.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There are two proposers, Joey, the project manager for who a LinkedIn profile is provided and Sean, the developer, who\u2019s CV is attached to the proposal, but no social media links are provided. Both would work on analyzing software that can be used and database options however it doesn't seem that they would deliver the code for the project. The project plan is divided into eight weeks where for the first 2 weeks they will review the open source and non open source applications and databases and then in the third and fourth week present the conclusions to the community of Developers for feedback. After that they propose to design a framework for using those applications in the new Catalyst Proposal Process. The budget is set at $19,000 end is logically split by the project plan. The bulk of the budget will go towards front-end and database design.  The plan does not discuss the technical aspects like the architecture, language and technologies.  The timetable seems very aggressive to find and design the front-end and back-end for something where thousands of people will use and that will cater to the Voltaire era. The proposers, however, recognize that estimating sufficient funding and time is the main risk. Considering how long it has taken to design and implement each portion of Cardano I find it difficult to believe that this project could be designed and delivered by 2 people in the space of 8 weeks. I have no confidence that this project can be delivered in time and within the budget proposed", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Auditability\nThe project timeline is provide and deliverables at each step are described. The proposal has committed to providing a monthly report with the project's status, to update the community at Catalyst Townhalls and Swarm events. Success is defined as selecting a front and that the community accepts, a database product that the community needs, and a framework for the final product. No KPI metrics are provided.

The desire of devs (and community members at large) is the actual connection to this Challenge. A decentralized option for Catalyst would be a monumental boost in morale and bring with it new possibilities, likely resulting in the formation of tens or even hundreds of new projects taking advantage of the available data. This positive impact on the ecosystem will drive up the number of developers, a sure value-add to the future.\n\nThe KPIs of the proposal align with those of the proposal. The first guiding question asks, \"what are the tools we need to build first?\" This foundational element of voting on ideas funded from the Catalyst treasury is surely among those primary tools. By raising the number of devs, repos on Github, and helping to add to a sense of community and conversations, Voters can see this is an excellent fit for the Challenge.\n\nThe mitigation for the first risk is weak. Perhaps your mitigation could sound more concrete by having a few conversations with potential devs who might offer to do what they can to help in a pinch. One variation might be: \"If the dev hired had to be replaced, conversations have already begun with others interested in the work...\" As potential mitigation for the second risk comes from your Auditability section: \"we will make sure to hold several After Town Halls, as well as be highly active on all socials to listen and make our best attempt at building with the community.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timetable is realistic; it is a simple plan. The details are action-verb full and offer voters every indication that the path forward is clear. Though results will be profound, that doesn't mean the time invested and the human power needs to be tremendous.\n\nThe budget lacks hourly rates, as has been asked of proposers beginning in Fund 9. If rewriting, please offer these details. Beyond being transparent about pay, you also help the community know where your head is on an hourly wage. For instance, solid project management is paid between $40-$80 per hour. Even at the low end, that is only 25 hours of Project management over 2 whole months or 3.13 hours per week. Based on this calculation alone, one might say the budget is not reasonable. Still, only 2 people are working on the project; no doubt the community manager will also be wearing another hat or two (totally reasonable on a project such as this). In that case, it makes a lot of sense to have a budget sub $20K. If rewriting, please include these wage details. Voters often reward transparency and don't seem to like guesswork.\n\nThe skill sets explained in the budget are a good fit for those introduced in the personnel section. The team is small but capable. It seems they will be an excellent fit for the work and are well connected in the ecosystem, so they will know just how to reach out to the most people about their thoughts on the project that has the potential to be central to many of our experiences on Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap and milestones offered in Feasibility suffice. The 8-weeks of work are well defined and actionable. The team appears to have a good handle on these aspects.\n\nMonthly reporting is mentioned for a 2-month timeframe on a highly popular aspect of Cardano's collective future. Perhaps updates at the end of weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 would be reasonable and track along with the project? Also, \"meets the community needs\" is mentioned twice. I'll just say many people will want to know your definition of that.

Virtually most parties agree that Catalyst should move on from IdeaScale due to the fact that the speed our ecosystem is moving doesn't match ideascale's speed of development which is understandable. This proposal is a good start towards that goal and the fact that the teams proposes an open source and community driven platform makes more sense and matches the decentralization goals of the Cardano ecosystem. The ability to scale here would depend mainly on the design that would be made by the team and their ability to amgage interested parties from the community in a fruitful discussion to find a good compromise on what can be done to maximize satisfaction. Furthermore, the impact of such system is huge since as the team puts it, this will allow the community to take Voltaire without having to wait for it to be handed to us.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to the links provided and the information given here.

I suggest a Wikipedia-like model where any community member can contribute and community-selected individuals can assess contributions and so on.
