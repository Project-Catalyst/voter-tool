The problem statement and solution targets to provide a typescript based library, name plu-ts, which can then be integrated by client side dApps (entirely running on browser) and Node Js backend dApps. Being a typescript developer myself, I see this as a big  contribution towards making Cardano development easier and available for web/JS/TS developers, who happen to be the most percentage of total developers in the world today.\n\nClearly, this will help to onboard Typescript/Javascript developers and hence fulfilling the multiple criterion of this challenge, such as attract more developers from outside of current community, make it easier to create a dApp, enterprise dev managers to build enterprise projects (as a very high percentage of them are familiar with typescript/javascript frameworks).\n\nThis library project is not about scalability (so we can ignore that metrics from challenge brief) as the scalability comes from the dApps that will use this library, and since this library is open source and in typescript, for which the developer community is quite huge, there will not be a lack of developers contributing to this repository and hence making it sustainable.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has no LinkedIn profile and has mentioned that it is because he is not active there. Nevertheless, the github profile links, twitter, youtube channel and the GitHub repository links with proof of concept of this proposal and timelines are provided. \n\nThe proposer is the lead developer and the only developer who will be working on this project, with a possibility of expansion in the next fund.The developer has provided a good youtube video explaining the technical details and how he wants to fulfill this proposal solution, and a detailed features based estimation of 8 month is given\n\nBeing a typescript developer myself, I feel that he has the capability to finish this proposal. Additionally the budget requirements for a full 8 months development are justifiable. A separate amount of $30k is devoted to critical code audit. This is important and should cover the vulnerabilities present in the code. However, it would have been great if details were given of what all would be covered as part of the audit ? Since you are a single developer, what are the code quality measures ? Who will do the code review on your library code, that will potentially be used by many developers in the future.\n\nFinally, The risks and challenges (with potential solutions) are discussed on github ReadMe.

As far as I understand, the proposal wants to flatten the level of transformations between the smart contracts human readable code to the actual execution code. This has it's benefits, like verifying the contract locally, which really is a big deal. Imagine the human readable code passes through a translator or two, to be understandable for the execution environment, this brings more dependencies, which is more risky in general. What the proposer wants to do is create a more direct path for everyone when writing a dapp and a smart contract to be specific.\nI do belive that this is a really ambicious idea, and it would have an impact over the community. I also think it's going to be challenging work, that has a possibility of not being good enough if only a partial subset of functionality is implemented, but there's no way of knowing if it's good enough or not before releasing the solution into the real world. There's no other way around it, but having said that, I do believe it's a worthy effort that needs to be tried out. It's in line with the challenge settings and does provide a solution to a very basic problem, that people just take for granted, but development could be better if this solution is implemented. \nOverall I think this is a great idea and would add a missing piece to the development flow. The impact has a really big potential. I don't have any concerns for this proposal besides the few small things I already mentioned. Good luck to the author.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The budgeting scheme is sound and I do like the project would be opensource. One thing that I found difficult to confirm were the skills of the proposer. I looked through the code in the github repositories, but there isn't anything implemented that would give any assertion for the level of skill. It's mostly documentation updates and nothing logic heavy that could verify the skills. The youtube channel did have some explanations of haskell tutorials and run through of some specifications, but no actual practical (not-examples) code written, which makes it hard for me to verify the skillset necessary for the implementation of the described proposal. That's not to say, the proposer doesn't have the necessary skills, It's just that I couldn't verify them with the resources and information given.\nI do like the idea of expanding the team, once the MVP passes, because such a project would need years to mature and actually be mass adopted and usable in production code. The budget has a good breakdown, although I don't see any reasoning behind the 30k for critical code audit, and how this number came to be. This project is really complex and I find it difficult to believe that 1 person can manage the whole development. As a developer myself I know what's in the relm of possibilities and this would be near impossible, no matter how skilled you are, because it's a time problem not a skill problem. The heuristics are simply too big.\nI can appreciete the idea, but overall I'm left uncertain if this is a feasible project or not. I tend to be on the sceptical side, but I choose to give the benefic of the doubt, and say I'm just unsure, giving it a score of 3 for that reason.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I don't have anything to say about the projects' auditability since if it's an open source project, anyone interested in the progress will be able to follow along using the github repository linked in the proposal. The roadmap is present and anyone can try to follow the milestones set by the author. There's a clear problem and a solution so that's good, butt I think more people should be involved in order to get this project to it's fruition.\nOverall an auditable project, but I'd suggest to the author to put themselves in the shoes of the voter and read through the proposal again and polishing it in order to be more understandable for the everyday reader and make it more accessible.

Not only Plu-ts would be a great tool for developers to generate smart contract client side seamlessly but the Plu-ts solution would also result in true decentralized applications.
