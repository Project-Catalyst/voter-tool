If this problem can be solved, this is really a potential customer group because it is the development trend of the world.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The solution raised is to conduct the Seedstars Impact Investment Readiness program to further support developers who want to build startups on the Cardano blockchain. Developers in emerging markets will be further encouraged to join the Cardano ecosystem and build on top of the Cardano blockchain. The proposal outlines progress and milestones along with specific work to be completed. It really impressed me because it was very detailed, specific, and professional.\nThe project's core team consists of 5 people: Zeb Hastings - Seedstars Project Manager, who coordinates Seedstars' projects and capacity-building programs focused on growing startups in emerging markets. Daria Markova is an entrepreneur and an experienced Founder, Daria has experience in training and coaching startups. Konstantin Hapkemeyer assumes the position of Investment Analyst / Funding Manager. Konstantin is a venture capitalist focused on early-stage startups in emerging markets. Maria Camila Albornoz assumes the position of Brand & Communications Director. Maria Camila is a designer, marketer, and communicator, with international experience in media, digital marketing, and project management. Ratko Ivanovic is an IT Specialist and Support Specialist. Thus, looking at the experience and education of the core team of the proposal, we see that the team is fully capable of ensuring a successful project launch. The proposed risks are that not enough entrepreneurs are interested in the program, participants are reluctant to research online, experts and advisors involved in the program are not fully engaged and committed, and finally, there are joint ventures with very specialized training needs corresponding to the specifics of the country/industry. However, they have outlined measures to reduce these risks in quite a detail.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The total required budget is 100000$, which is a suitable budget to launch a support project for developers who want to build startups on the Cardano blockchain. In addition, the budget is explained in detail, specifically for each project item, showing that the proposed calculation group is very close to reality. Furthermore, the proposal includes specific indicators, monthly progress and a KPI tracker to track the project's progress in a very detailed and professional manner. Conclusion: The project is financially transparent.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2280", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for the feedback! Happy to see the interest."}, {"id": 3296, "q0": "(vPAs, please note that this duplicate proposal has been referred to IOG for filtering, however at this point both proposals remain.  This assessment is being submitted to both and may be self-similar if one of the proposals is not removed.  Thanks for your consideration.)  The first thing we need to get into is alignment with the challenge setting.  There is an assumption that \"development\" means \"coding\", but a better description would be that it means \"specialized knowledge for creating things\".  Obviously in Cardano most things are built from code, so coding and development become synonymous, but we should also be considering the parts of this challenge that target \"support\" for those who would build in this ecosystem, and in particular, this statement from the Challenge Brief: \"There would be a bigger talent pool of developers that Catalyst projects can collaborate with and turn project concepts/Proof of concept into successful protocols...\"  This is where seedstars comes into alignment with this challenge, by building up start up ventures with training and tools to be better applicants to Catalyst, better targets for seed funding, and better able in general to articulate and achieve their potential.\n\nThe seedstars platform itself leverages an interesting algorithm that they use to help ventures create an \"Investment Readiness Score\" (and by proxy, they have training for investors to help them structure an investment based on using the score as well).  The score creates a data driven approach for proposers to structure a venture and its KPIs in a way that increases the likelihood of success.  On this note, there was one area of the proposal where I would have appreciated more clarity, (and since the team indicates they will be approaching Catalyst again in the future I hope they pursue this) I would love to see a list of the current graduates of the Blockchain challenge, and just generally any data supporting the impact the Fund7 proposals had, which are identical to these ones.  I was able to dig into their website and find 5 finalists (though the proposal indicates there were 12 across 2 accelerators), one of which I recognized as a successful Catalyst endeavor (Snapbrilia) but the rest were ??  For a project that leans into data driven decision making, it is an unfortunate oversight here that such key performance indicators were not succinctly organized and presented so that voters could better inform their own decision.  What has been the impact on Catalyst or Cardano from this venture?\n\nWhile the lack of metrics to show how impactful this project has been cause me to lower the rating by one star, I do believe, just as I did in Fund7, that they have described a proposal that could provide excellent tooling and resources to those building on Catalyst and Cardano, and so I give it 4 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is literally zero doubt that this team can deliver this product.  They have spent 9 years developing and delivering their principles and methods, and they had 100s of applicants to their previous events for the Blockchain challenge.  The description for this iteration doesn't seem to have varied at all except that the team has added a few new faces.\n\nWhat they describe here is an extremely detailed series of onboarding workshops, indepth mentoring and training, and an elegant measurement algo that helps connect all these elements together into an integrated vision for each venture to pursue full realization of its potential, and to shine the best light on them as attractive investments.\n\nThe budget and timeline were clear, but may benefit from added granularity.  That they successfully concluded the previous round with similar budget numbers (the only real difference I spotted was the addition of a $15k administrative budget that seems targeted at an advisory role in Catalyst) is a good indicator that these numbers are accurate, and they certainly seem fair to me.  They clearly state that this is a 4 month funding cycle, 1 month for setup and 3 for running the challenge and finalizing the results, and every milestone they note is also a deliverable.\n\nBecause of they have provided proof of the work done to date, and show a deep engagement and understanding of the ins and outs of the project and its goals, I believe this is a project with high likelihood of success, and give it a full 5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given that one of the key principles of this project is to help innovators pin down projects to measurable goals and outcomes, you would expect them to put together a good list of KPIs and they haven't disappointed.  The list of milestones doubles well as a series of deliverables over the course of the four months, far more than is needed to populate the monthly progress reports.\n\nThe team has made themselves available in ATHs and some swarm meetings, and due to the nature of their project, they have a dedicated part of the team for communicating with the community.  As well they seem to be in close collaboration with Catalyst advisors as well, so there is an expectation that transparency and availability won't be an issue.\n\nOne place where I think their metrics could be improved, and my statement under Impact touches on this, is that they include success metrics here regarding the 12 proposers attending and completing the workshops...which are great progress metrics, but success for this project is something else.  If I may make a recommendation, it would be nice to see a set of sub-metrics for these graduates that indicate how many proposals they have submitted to Catalyst, what kinds of rankings these proposals earned from assessors, what their voting results and approval ratings they receive are, and finally the $amount of funding they receive from Catalyst (it is important those last two are treated separately, due to approval and funding being two separate metrics in Catalyst).  An accelerator should be measured by whether applicants gain an advantage over their peers in an ecosystem, and in Catalyst, that means innovation funding.  Alternatively, if graduates receive investment from another source, a metric should be included to indicate any investment captured for ventures building on Cardano.\n\nBecause the progress reporting metrics are strong and the team makes themselves accountable to the community, I believe this project has a strong auditability component that will keep it on track.  However I am reducing auditability by one star due to a lack of metrics which accurately measure the impact, indeed the success, of the project.  4 Stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thanks for your feedback!

Having said that, it totally fits the challenge, addressing kpis such as \"Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano\" and going into the potential direction of \"Support and Incentivization structures\", as this may motivate and prepare better the future entrepeneurs who are still insecure and dont have yet the necessary skills.\n\nRegarding the proposal itself, its imporant to highlight that it is very well strucutured, complete and articulated. It presents in a very good level of details how the acceletation program will work, in staged mannersm provides information regarding its communication and engagement strategy for most of the involved parts (startups and investors) and has a good risk management strategy. The course modulus/syllabus is also available, making it easier to understand what the focus will be. A video explaining what seedstar is also posted here.\nThe only detail I'd add here is more information on the results of the F7 funded proposals in Catalyst, to better understand their impact so far in Cardano ecosystem.

A good description is provided for each person but linkedin or references links could also be provided. Other suggestion would be to make clearer here the experience with Cardano of these team.

The proposal should aim more towards developers and mention how this proposal is exclusively for Cardano once the startups are selected and nurtured.
