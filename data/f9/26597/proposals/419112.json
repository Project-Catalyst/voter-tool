Typically hackathons are 2 day events, and even though they have a sense of community, the urgency of the event puts a damper on the collaboration that makes Web3 so powerful.  In this proposal the team lines out an approach for a 4-week hackathon that creates plenty of room for collaboration on resources and learning.  And this principle shows up in the teams other proposal where they flip the basic hackathon model upside down to distribute small, bounty-style rewards across all participants.\n\nThe links to Cardano are clear, as the whole 4 weeks will be dedicated to building on Cardano. The materials they build will be able to scale in that they can continue to hold these hackathons with less lead time (currently a full 3 months, but a lot of that is establishing the resources and content of the event) and also make the format avaialable to others if they desire.\n\nWith a planned outreach of 1500 attendees, this would be a massive hackathon to deliver, but it would also have a tremendous impact.  Their expectation that could be featuring 50 projects by the end of the first round would be an amazing accomplishment for everyone involved.\n\nBecause a hackathon would directly lead to enhanced developer skills, and because of their collaborative approach to the process that provides opportunity for developer skills beyond just coding to grow, I fell this project merits full marks for Impact.  5 Stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal really shines through this section.  The team is exemplary, and brings a decade of experience running these types of events, including many current major ones on other chains like Polkadot.  They also bring a community of 260K+ member developers, which is absolutely stunning.\n\nThe description of the event and its preparatory stages is well described and provides an easy to parse roadmap through the approximately 6-7 month timeline.  When correlated to the budget and roles outlined in the team requirements section, each line item of the budget is accounted for in detail and well explained.  The majority of the funding goes to setting up and executing the event, and rewarding the participants, which is a reasonable approach given the experience accounted for here.\n\nBecause the team has thoroughly describe their experience, resources and approach, as well as the scope and use of the resources they are requesting, I am marking this project a full 5 stars for feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The kpis presented (1500 participants and 50 projects presented) are ambitious, but also seem well within reach.  The approach they are taking appears to be for participants to get familiar with the ecosystem and resources, and then to pick interesting projects and figure out how they work.  If that is the formula they follow than it stands to reason that all of these developers will have a pretty good cross-sectional view of the Cardano ecosystem, and through hacking it a greater appreciation for what they can do on the platform, which is in alignment with the challenge.  If the projects presented end up being forks of existing projects, this will make a great metric for measuring the projects ROI (while distributing a fair amount of support throughout the opensource projects they will be emulating).\n\nBecause the team has established clear, measurable goals, and because the roadmap presents deliverables and milestones over the course of the whole timeline, it is expected that they will be able to keep this project up to date and progress monitored through Catalyst.

This helps the community audit the project conveniently. Unfortunately, the specific KPIs are not continued in the description of the project success. Criteria like the hackathon participants inr hackathon will \u201cappreciate the Cardano ecosystem better\u201d, be \u201cinspired to launch startups based on products built on Cardano\u201d or \u201cfeel inspired and confident enough to participate in a Cardano-funded incubators and/or accelerators\u201d are hard to measure. I suppose their appreciation, inspiration and confidence may be shown in something specific, for instance, the number of products they build in the Cardano ecosystem, the startups they create, and the rate of hackathon participants taking part in Cardano-funded incubators and/or accelerators to better ensure the auditability of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4072", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for your concern regarding the lack of details regarding the team. \n\nTo be honest, we are just a group of ordinary but motivated individuals doing extraordinary things.
