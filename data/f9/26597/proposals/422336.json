By building a site for these groups to go and find one another is a great idea. Reading through the proposals submitted in F9, there are many which seek to hire specific roles to help them complete their projects. If successful, a proposal like this could be the place that those groups go to find what they are looking for. \n\nAs mentioned by the proposer, this website is envisioned for more than just blockchain devs finding projects but instead includes a variety of other technical skills (graphic design, website creation) that may be required by teams who don't have them in-house. This approach certainly aligns with the challenge by creating a common forum where different specialists can interact. \n\nOverall, this project seems like it could have a major impact for the community if realized. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFirst and foremost, Joey Chessher is an excellent community member and has been active representing the Toolmakers and Maintainers Community in the Catalyst Circle. Joey continues to approach every challenge with a positive attitude and keen interest in helping everyone succeed. While I really wish more details had of been provided for the rest of the team, knowing Joey is on the team gives confidence in its feasibility. \n\nNext, the plan is decent but I think there could have been a bit more detail as to the platform's development, marketing, and testing. As written the proposal spans eight weeks, yet it is unclear whether this is an appropriate timeframe given that the entire platform will be built from scratch. To improve this gap I would encourage the proposer to consider explaining any outreach done to date, including any potential interest from technical experts in the community. By adding these components it would help readers better understand whether the project is actually feasible. For example, who would be building the platform and do you have comparable costs/activities that you could point to? As of right now it's a bit of \"trust us\". ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal.\n\nOverall, the proposer plans to track the project's progress through the regular catalyst reporting, and at the Catalyst After Town Halls, Swarm, and Community events. However, I would have liked to see a bit more auditing of the development side itself. How will you be auditing the build? How often will it undergo testing? And who/what group do you envision supporting the auditing of the platform? Would the code be made available on github for community review? \n\nThe reason I am taking off a mark here is that there are no real tangible success measures that could be used to determine if/if not the project was successful. As they stand, the measures are abstract and do not really lend themselves to being measured. For example, how do you measure \"active participation\"? What amount of use on the platform would represent sufficient engagement by people using the site? \n\nI would encourage the proposers to consider adding in more measurable KPIs and thresholds for the measures. If you want to track traffic to the site, then the KPI could be # of visitors, and the Measurement could be 1000 visitors within the first six months. Framing it in this clear and measurable way reduces the need for the community to interpret at what stage you would deem it a success.

The coupling to the \u201cDeveloper Ecosystem\u201d campaign brief is not the strongest, but sufficient, in terms of impact. This is primarily because it will help increase the developer productivity and resource management from the Cardano Ecosystems perspective. \n\nThere are some questions that could be addressed in the proposal to make it more credible and give voters confidence. \n\nThere is no definite mention of Cardano specific talent in the proposal, why would this service be favorable over already existing solutions that provide general technical resources? It is a somewhat competitive market and it is unclear how this service will stand out against competition in order to gain the traction needed for widespread use. A recommendation would be to provide a clear plan stating how you will market the service and why your service is necessary for the ecosystem. The proposal in its current state does not provide any type of significant niche or argumentation that would give voters much confidence that this proposal is impactful. Examples could be: Do you target the Cardano Developer system primarily or a general crowd of technical resources? In order for the proposal to be more impactful, a stronger coupling to the Cardano ecosystem would be preferable.\n\nGiven the questions raised in terms of impact, a neutral score will be given and it is recommended to address at least some of these in the future in order to raise the impact score.

The detailed plan is split into 8 weeks where it is implied that the project should be finished after week 8. However, the project will be presented to the community during week 7 & 8 where feedback will be gathered. What will happen with this feedback and functions that you aspire to develop? There is no room or time (or budget?) set aside for this. It would be preferable if you could state more clearly what the plan is with the service after week 8. It is mentioned that you will seek further funding to develop the service, is it presumed that it is a fully functional product by then? Or is it a POC that will be refined over multiple funds?\nThese questions are raised because it is hard to understand if this project will be a fully functional service or more of a POC, and it is not very clear given the somewhat sparse plan and budget. A developer can only do a finite amount of work over an 8 week span. Answering these questions would increase the feasibility of the proposal and increase the voters confidence in the project. \n\nAll in all, the detailed plan is sufficient if the given scope is limited. This should be defined more clearly as stated. The budget seems fair but it should be further broken down with hourly rates and time estimates in order to justify your claims. Example:\nDBA Database Design \u2013 100 hours * 45 $ = 4500 USD\n\nIt is hard to judge if the project is feasible or not since the scope is not very clear.

Will you present the same information at all these meetings? It is unclear how the community and voters can follow this project in an easy manner. It would be favorable to provide one main channel that either lists all relevant updates in chronological order. This should ideally be in text format in a public channel such as a Discord server, gitbook, or website/blog. \n\nFurthermore, there is no clear definition of success that is measurable. Currently success is defined in soft terms with no way of evaluating the success with the question: Did the project succeed according to their goals x, y, z [Yes/No].\nAn example could be to add definition of success such as: \n- 100 Proposers and Technical Resources used the service by the end of the year.\n- 25 Proposers found Technical Resources by the end of the year.\n Etc. This also raises the question about how you would gather this information so that you can measure your success against these goals? That is also just as important to provide information about in order to raise credibility.\n\nAs it stands now, it is hard to claim that the proposal is easy to audit. The intention is right but it would need further concretization according to the points raised above.

The proposers identify the need for developers to advertise their capabilities. The proposer also takes note that not all of the technical requirements are for blockchain developers, but rather that a successful project also needs front-end and back-end developers. A platform like this would be beneficial to attract developers with these skill sets to Cardano. The proposer does not mention how the platform could scale, but an automated job board could service a large number of individuals. The proposer would come back for additional funding if the platform becomes popular. From personal experience, there is no lack of technical resources with generic front-end and back-end skills and there are freelancing websites such as fiverr.com that provide networking opportunities. The lacking resource is experienced blockchain developers with Haskell experience. Therefore in general an additional advertising board does not do any harm, but I do not see a strong case made for how it complements or goes beyond what is already in the market as a whole, or Cardano in particular", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer identifies the individual who will be working on the proposal and provide the CV\u2019s for both of them. Joey is an accomplished project manager with decades of experience and Sean is a developer with about 2 years of experience. While reviewing the CV I would suggest that Sean places the most recent experience first. Given the project is quite technical in nature I would have expected a plan of how this would be delivered in quite some detail, including the languages to be used the front-end frameworks and the backend infrastructure, and possible prototypes that the team has worked on - this information is not provided in the proposal which leaves me skeptical on the ability to deliver the project within the projected 8 weeks. The project schedule is split into buckets for 2 weeks and the budget is allocated approximately in the same way. The budget is set at $11k which I would consider fairly competitive for a fully functioning website that connect projects with developers. $8k of the budget is to pay for the front-end and back-end development and $500 for project management, this is reasonable for 8 weeks of work for two people, but I feel like the project management budget is set a little too low. From personal experience of developing full stack websites it is important to set-out upfront what stack will be used (React, Angular, Vue, NextJs), what CSS engine will be used and what back-end services will be needed. If this is yet to be decided then it would seem the proposal needs a few extra months to complete. The key risk identified is the developer not being available to do the work, in which case the project manage will look for replacements. The individual have the skills to deliver a project of this type, but there needs to be more planning in how this will be done. I therefore neither agree, nor disagree that that the project is feasible.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "A roadman is presented with what features will be completed by which date within the 8 week schedule. Thee budget is also set accordingly. The proposer will provide a monthly status report and will update the community in the Catalyst townhalls and Swarm events. There is however no mention of KPIs nor metrics that the community could track the deliverable. However the project will last only for 8 weeks there is potentially only 1 checkpoint in between. Success would be the application being used by Proposers to find Technical resources to complete their projects. Here it would be good to have an intermediate measure such as 2 successful connections between proposers and technical resources.

To offer technical services 2. To post a project and demand technical services. This is a good idea, that can eventually increase the success rate of many projects, and due to the lack of technical resources, we can at least have a common place to share it \u2013 work marketplace. The risks that proposer identified are all good, but the main risk \u2013 is definitely community adaptation, and it would be suitable to provide a solution to that \u2013 by simply involving marketing to the budget, or if the marketing would be free on public channels, than at least have it in the roadmap.

No linkedin or additional info is provided to verify this and a google search of his name doesn't lead us anywhere. Either way, the technical need here is minimal, so I think they can get it done.\n\nThe real issue is the lack of consideration for marketing the tool. If nobody uses it, it won't be of any use.

The proposal states the creation of this talent pool will attract outsiders to the ecosystem, building up cardano\u2019s adoption rates and creating a supportive central marketplace for both technical blockchain and non-blockchain developers to attract jobs for proposers who need it. Equally, the imprints of the project will be its migration of developers from outside marketplaces into cardano, for opportunity, and subsequently assimilating into the ecosystem, learning its languages and partaking in innovations that change the infrastructure of cardano.
