The course programe is pretty straightforward covering the marlowe basics.\nThe end result will be more generated financial smartcontracts using marlowe so that's a good and most of all measurable KPI. The proposers have done some risk assessment, and I agree the biggest threat they could face is a second pandemic, because these courses will be live. On that note, I could suggest recording their sessions, because it might be usefull for other devs later on and would mitigate the risks.\nOverall this is a good proposal, targeting vietnam specifically, which I think is good, because some parts of the world can't be reached with english only mentality so it's great to see inclusion of other non-english-speaking countries as well.

I think the prices are reasonable, although I'm not aware of the lifesile requirements in vietnam, but nonetheless it seems reasonable. There's a plan for 4 courses which should be enough with the timespan mentioned in the proposal. All the links and credentials are listed and I can always appreciate standing behind your work with your resume and face out front. I think this is a really important quality of each proposal that is often overlooked.\nFor future funding, I'd recommend to the proposers to think of a subscription model for their services, once they get a name for themselves and get things going, because every good business plan and long term solution to a problem needs to have a payment plan sooner or later.

The proposal presents convincing arguments for the Challenge since blockchain is a new and less accessible industry, particularly for students who are future developers who lack access and expertise. The purpose of the Marlowe course, which intends to satisfy a challenge requirement, is to offer possibilities and entice developers to engage in the blockchain industry in general, and the Cardano ecosystem in particular. This is a great idea for IT students who are building a real environment and dApp development experience on the blockchain platform, so that the proposal may be developed and scaled up in the future. Students who complete the course will become competent and honest developers, therefore enhancing the Cardano community's quality. \nThe course assists and provides inexperienced programmers with a suitable and advantageous start in the blockchain area, bringing essential information and thinking about Crypto to make the right decisions in investing and practicing, avoiding being scammed. Because the proponent of this course is experienced, they have previously organized courses for 1000 students over a 5-year period. Submit a proposal to provide adequate explanations and reasons. The proposed group also addressed the possibility of not being able to carry out the training as planned due to the pandemic. The proponent's proposal eliminates this risk by organizing the online course using the Zoom platform. \nPersonally, I see another risk that the proponent should consider: as the world's top fuel prices rise, so will inflation in Vietnam, forcing the cost of services to employ human resources and locations to rise appropriately. As a result, the proponent may plan for this risk. This is a great concept for Cardano ecosystem developers who propose the course as experienced experts with strong arguments, thus I give this piece 5 points.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal provides for four courses to be held over the period of five to six months.

The third session will be conducted in Hanoi in January or February 2023, while the fourth session will be held in Ho Chi Minh City in February or March 2023. Because Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are two major cities in Vietnam with numerous technological centers and universities, this is a particular and viable approach that will attract more students and developers to enroll in the course.\n The proposal has not yet provided channels of communication to monitor the project's progress. The project's financing budget is $26,900, which is less than 5% of the Challenge budget. The budget blueprint offered by the proposal is generally reasonable, however there are two parts that require clarification: advisory and contingency. When organizing the course, the proponent should describe what the responsibility of choosing a counselor involves. In terms of contingency budgets, as I mentioned in the efficiency section, this is the part of the budget that should be accessible for this plan; the proponent only has to indicate that this cost is sufficient for those expenses that can be increased further due to inflation.\n The proposed group consists of four members who have been allocated certain responsibilities that are appropriate for them. Do Manh Hung is the proposal's leader, and he is a person who has many positive activities for the Cardano Community in Vietnam, such as a Telegram group with nearly 3000 members who exchange and actively discuss Cardano's developments, or the Fimi Youtube channel, which has 15k followers and provides up-to-date Cardano translations; as far as I know, this is another proposal sponsored by Catalyst.\nIn addition, the proponent has 13 other proposals that will benefit the community.

It is very promising as the proposal also mentioned covering related topics of Haskell, Plutus scripts, and Glow. This is a step back to slow down and very healthy for the Devs to back to the basics and build their knowledge in an official and foundational way.

This is foundational as the ecosystem will very soon go into Varsil's hard fork with more capabilities' requirements. The risk is also very well articulated as the class mostly in the face-to-face traditional manner.

Regarding the budget, it is broken down by the key tasks for the preparation of the classes. What could have been improved is the breaking down of the budget by month in regards to the budget allocation of Catalyst will be monthly on the 24th day in ADA, this would make it more feasible for the committed deployment of the proposal given the market fluctuation of ADA price.

The report channels should be more transparent and updated more frequently instead of one report at the end of the proposal in March 2023, the PA already entered the Telegram group of the current pools of Devs, it is just more than 50 users at the time of the PA entering the group. There should be much more marketing world to attract the Dev into the course.

I was just wondering as mentioned, the proponent is also requesting funding for another Blockchain learning program in this Challenge, and the two courses are held almost at the same time (I've looked through the development plan that proposal). So the question is, if both projects receive funding, how will the proponents balance the organizing time for the two courses. The cost allocation plan is pretty clear about which work/resource items will be divided. However, the author still needs to clarify the number of working hours of the working positions/the number of days where the teaching will take place for each course in order to be able to better assess the reasonableness of expenses such as costs of lecturers/support groups, room rental fees.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent needs to go a step further in clarifying the success metrics/audit roadmap for the project, with a foundation of KPIs that are relevant to the project's inputs and outputs, the author needs to build addition the milestones for the audit, the targets for the KPIs.

There are two metrics to measure. The first is the number of students enrolled in the course. The second is the number of developers who can practice with the Marlowe language.

The beginning of the proposal emphasized an important and quite interesting issue today, that is: \u201cDevelopers in Vietnam are difficulty with Haskell, and Plutus programming languages, so it is challenging to start with building an application that integrates with Blockchain Cardano.\u201d I completely agree with this issue because Blockchain technology is still a relatively new concept for many people. I just started to know and learn about Blockchain not long ago. However, through the process of researching, I realized that Blockchain technology, Cardano is a very potential ecosystem and has more and more practical applications in life. Currently, many newcomers are still vague in finding direction, but because they do not have enough knowledge and conditions to make them lose their direction, or fall into scam traps, this makes them even more distant from leaving the community, this is quite a pity. Therefore, providing free Marlowe courses, and helping many Vietnamese people to learn and write smart contracts on the Cardano platform by themselves is very necessary and suitable for this challenge. The proponent stated the fact that 5 years ago there were more than 1000 students registered for the course and I believe that by now this number has increased a lot. Thereby, it can be seen that the impact of the problem is relatively large. The course is held regularly every 2 months and is held in big cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, where many students and workers gather. Moreover, the time to organize the course on the weekend will be very convenient for students who register to participate. The content of the course is also prepared and planned in detail by the proponent, in a logical sequence. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified most of the problems of this challenge. By showing the actual situation, the impact of the problem has been shown. The course will give inexperienced programmers a good start in the Blockchain world, then when they have enough knowledge and practical experience, they will be able to build and develop their careers or they can form and join other project groups. I think that, when they have individual successes of their own, it is also the overall success of the Cardano Blockchain community. In order to successfully implement the project, the proponent also anticipated the risks. The potential risk mentioned here is that the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic will prevent the course from being held on schedule. However, along with those risks, the proposed team also has solutions and solutions to overcome that difficulty by opening online courses. In this part, my personal opinion is that currently, we are mainly organizing offline courses in places like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, only opening online classes when there is an outbreak of disease. However, in other provinces, when there are not enough conditions and opportunities to organize an offline course, if possible, the group will also organize an online course so that those who are not present in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh can also register to attend. I think it's also an option to expand Cardano's popularity and influence on the community.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal has a relatively specific and clear roadmap and action plan. The proponent has divided it into 4 courses, with an estimated start time and specific venue so that students can easily track and schedule their registration. However, as I said above, if possible, the group should plan to open online courses not only during the epidemic period to attract more students in these other provinces, although the similarities, the interaction between students and teachers is limited, making it less effective than face-to-face learning, but still ensuring the necessary background knowledge for students. Regarding the project's budget, the Proposer also gave a clear and reasonable allocation plan and the purpose of using that budget. In addition, the team also has a provision of $2,500, which will help the team deal more quickly and flexibly in unexpected situations or also cost to expand the training scale and training method when necessary. I am very supportive of this way of organizing and planning. About the participating team including Mr. Do Manh Hung and the FIMI support team. The information is presented and the identity is easily verified through the media such as Telegram or Youtube channel. Recently, I am also learning more about his training courses and the FIMI community is also the one who led me to the Cardano ecosystem because of FIMI's influence in the financial sector in general and in the Blockchain field very big. I think that the experience and capacity of Mr. Do Manh Hung and the FIMI community who have had many proposals from previous Funds, it will be a great advantage to implement this project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to measure the progress and success of the project, the proponent has provided criteria that are easy to measure and easy to check. That is, the number of new developers signed up for the course and the number of developers who can practice with the Marlowe language. This is a new proposal, the first time FIMI requires a Marlow course, but with the capabilities and experience that have done other proposals before, I think the probability of the project's success will be high. The success of the project is very clearly defined, that is: hundreds of new developers in Vietnam can practice with the Marlowe programming language to help them develop their careers, and the team creates a team of talented developers. New talented developers in Vietnam can work with other projects that are lacking in human resources. Thereby, the information provided by the group is very clear, transparent, and has high auditability.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3190", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12386, "q0": "The aim of this proposal is to give more education to developers in Vietnam regarding the technical aspect of the Cardano blockchain, such as Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe programming language. This gap in skills make it hard for developers to start building products that are integrated in Cardano. The proposed solution is to conduct courses explaining the Marlowe language to Vietnam developers to raise their technical knowledge of the Cardano blockchain. Like the blockchain course that has also been proposed in this Fund, the purpose of this proposal is to ask for a funding so that these courses can be given out for free (usually participants pay a fee of 400 USD). Each course will be held in 2 weekend days and the proposer has also provided a syllabus that will be discussed in the courses, which includes introduction to Marlowe and smart contracts, using basic Marlowe CLI, how to write smart contracts, case studies and practical exercises (loan, monthly payment, auction, swaps, simple lock ADA), as well as other topics (Haskell, Plutus, Glow). From the syllabus given, it seems that the purpose of this project is to give basic knowledge and skills of using the Marlowe programming language as an introductory course for Vietnam developers to get into the Cardano blockchain. Overall, I think this proposal is aligned with the challenge setting objective of getting \u201ca bigger talent pool of developers that Catalyst projects can collaborate with and turn project concepts/Proof of concept into successful protocols which would enhance the growth of Cardano\u201d by providing fundamental techincal knowledge and practical exercises for developers interested in the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team consists of a main lecturer who has experience with Cardano, such as the Plutus Pioneer program as well as experience as a trainer. In the proposal, there was an attached website showing the proposer\u2019s experience conducting courses regarding blockchain and crypto. This shows that the proposer has the relevant skills that are needed to implement this project. \n\n(Note: A lot of the assessment in this feasibility section will be very similar to other proposal by the same proposer during this fund, \u201cBlockchain Course for Vietnam Devs\u201d, since the breakdown points are very similar)\n\nThe proposer provided a roadmap of this project going over the timeline and key milestones. There will be 4 courses that will be done in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh (2 courses in each city). The 1st course will be in Sep or Oct 2022, the 2nd course in Nov or Dec 2022, the 3rd course in Jan or Feb 2023, and the 4th course in Feb or Mar 2023. Considering the courses will be done in 2 weekend days, the schedule for each event seems feasible to be completed since it\u2019s apart by around 1 month for logistics and planning. However, I\u2019d have liked if the proposer provided more details regarding the logistic and planning stages, such as reserving the room, preparing equipment, etc. especially since the timeline of this proposal is the same as the other proposal submitted so more details regarding how these two projects timeline will line up would have been appreciated. Overall, the timeline provided is adequate and seems feasible to be completed in a vacuum.    \n\nThe budget of 26900 USD has been requested for this project and has been broken down into several items. This includes the lecturers fee (3000 USD per course), flight and accommodation (500 USD per course), documents (100 USD per course), room reservation fee (1200 USD per course), digital marketing (500 USD per course), and 2000 USD each for advisor and backup budget. The budget has been broken down into identifiable items however I\u2019d prefer if there were more details for some of the items. For example, the budget for digital marketing could have been expanded more regarding what type of digital marketing (i.e. short videos, digital poster, social media page, etc.) will be done so the cost can be judged more clearly.    \n\nThe main risk to be considered is the covid pandemic which would hinder the events since it will be an offline course and the proposer has identified this and proposed that the course will be held online at first on the set date in this proposal and will be held again later for the same students offline once it is possible again. This shows that the proposer knows the risk of running an offline event and has come up with the solution to hold the event while still ensuring that students can still participate fully in the course at a later date.  \n\nBased on the points above, I\u2019m in agreement over the feasibility aspect of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs chosen as a way to measure the success of this project include metrics such as the \u201cnumber of new registered participants\u201d and the \u201cnumber of developers able to practice Marlowe language\u201d.

Firstly, The team gives knowledge and the right mindset to the community of crypto investors in Vietnam to avoid scam blockchain projects. There are over 1000 trainees who have joined other courses in the last 5 years. And now, they want a free course instead of trainees having to pay a tuition fee of 10,000,000 VND (~400 USD) as an IOG company and they also said that if this proposal is funded, thousands of Vietnamese trainees will learn free. The course will be held on 2 weekend days in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. They transfer the contents of the program and check student capacity through case study and practical exercises. At the same time, the team members support new trainees by organizing questions and asking talk shows based on the Telegram Online platform. Likewise, the proposal also shows relevant links, media and videos on GitHub and YouTube websites to provide to detail information. However, I do not see the team mentioning the number of trainees per course, lesson duration, number of lessons, how many students maximum or what is the minimum number of students before the course starts?\nIn terms of addressing the challenge, It is a great idea because the course addresses the challenge. To be more specific, the course not only provides knowledge, skills, but also creates a good background to seek more job opportunities in the blockchain world. \nAs for the main risk, the project shows the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic is one of the main reasons affecting the development of the program.
