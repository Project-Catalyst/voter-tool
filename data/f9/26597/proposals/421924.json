This addresses the challenge objective of increasing the number of developers building on Cardano. On a personal level I see there is a lot of demand for qualified Plutus developers and for the projects that I am delivering we are always on a look up to hire new developers, so having access to additional developers would help me advance my projects. The proposal is able to scale in future iterations by tracking a large number of developers through the program. The proposer also suggests that out of the 2 million developer market in India, only about 0.5% are blockchain developers and there is the potential to attract many more with the right training and incentives for new developers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposal provides Linkedin profiles for himself and co-proposers. Udai, the lead proposer has more than 20 years of experience in tech and has successfully established a hotel software business. This suggests that he should have no problem finding candidates for his program. The Co-poser has a similar track record and has been more involved with Cardano than Udai. The schedule is provided and is split into 3 periods of 2 months each (6 months in total) where a cohort of 10 selected devs will do self learning for 2 months, then project-based learning for 2 months, and training on live projects in collaboration with Gimbalabs. The budget is reasonably set at $31k where $15k will go as a stipend to trainees and the rest spend on preparing training material ($6k), marketing and material ($2.5k), and project management ($7.5k). Having worked with outsourcing contracts I can conclude that this is competitive for the Indian market. The timeline is realistic and logically broken down into self-learning and project-based training. The proposal is not technical in nature, as no new software will be built, at the end of it there will be 10 new developers ready to join Cardano projects. The key risk identified is not being able to attract the right talent and the risk that there will not be adequate projects for the new devs to join, these are reasonable risks, but given the contact network that the proposers have and the constant lack of Plutus developers ni Cardano I believe these risk can be adequately managed. I do not see any problem with the team delivering this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, a roadmap is provided and broken down by months and by task. The KPIs are thoughtful and cover the key metrics of a number of developers in training, assignment progress, and feedback from the community during the live projects. The team will keep the Cardano community updated with monthly reports and also make it available on a Github repo. At the end of the project, the team will make a formal communication with the profile of newly trained developers at the Catalyst townhall. What success looks like is well articulated and is objective: 5 new Plutus and 5 new Atala/PRISM developers available to join Cardano projects. This is a good auditability section and I am comfortable that the community will be able to monitor progress and reach the members for comments should that be required.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 2, "ng": 12, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2519, "q0": "The objective of the Developer Ecosystem challenge is to create a positive developer experience which makes developing on Cardanon a fun experience for the developers . At the same time training the developers from other communities and even those who are not active in Blockchain technology, for Plutus, Haskell and other developer tools required to build on Cardano will also fulfill this objective and bring more developer activity to our Ecosystem. Haskell is not a very user friendly programing language and there are not many developers who are efficient in it. Training and motivating such developers to learn Haskell and Plutus and then build on Cardano will create a new line of developers which is essential for growth and adoption of Cardano.\nIndia is a breeding ground for software developers. The IT market, in India, is one of the biggest in the country with a market size of $197 billion in 2021 and projected to be $350 billion by 2025. The Indian IT industry employs 4 million workers with nearly half being software developers. Yet, of the 2 million software developers in India, only 0.25% possess the necessary blockchain development skills. The big tech giants like Google and Microsoft employ a large part of their workforce from Indian engineers and software developers.\nThe proposal is planning to train such web 2.0 developers from India in Haskell, Plutus and Atala Prism and assist them to build in Cardano ecosystem. This will help in bringing new developers to the Cardano who are well versed with its architect and understand the basics of creating decentralized application using Plutus. This perfectly aligns with the objectives of this challenge and fulfills the growing need of having trained and qualified developers for the Cardano Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The projecd is divided into 4 stages which include, Marketting , Guided self study, Project based learning, and Training on live projects. The program will run from September 2022 till April 2023 and plans to train 10 developers from India, who after this training, will be ready to participate and contribute in Cardano ecosystem.  The team consists of two people from India and both have long experience as developers and worked at number of organisations. One of the team members hold M.Tech Degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) which is the most prestigious technology Institute in India.\nThe team has requested the funds of $31000 to complete the project. The break up of funds, required for different taks, shows that the amount is reasonable to complete the project. Moreover, a major chunk of this amount ($15000) is being spent to incentives these newly trained developers for project based training. This will motivate the developers to participate in the training program.\nAll these factors show that the project is feasible and will create a new breed of developers who will be ready to start building on Cardano. Only concern is finding enough number of interested people for this project and then making sure that these developers are actually participating in Cardano Ecosystem. The best way to it would be to look for the people who are already members of Cardano community and who are interested in building decentralized applications on Cardano. It would also be good if they can invite applications from interested people before applying for Catalyst funds and in this way making sure that there are enough number of interested candidates.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team will share regular updates with the Catalyst community about the progress of the project through community channels and monthly reports submitted to the Catalyst. These updates will include data regarding Number of developers being trained, Developers learning progress notes and Projects assigned to different developers for project training etc. A  dedicated Github will also be opened to present the progress as well as include all relevant information in the monthly reporting and final report. Once the project based training is concluded,  they will communicate through social channels and After town hall session about the available developers for collaborattion and existing  projects on Cardano can hire them. This will help both - these newly trained developers and the projects who will be hiring them. For newly trained developers, it will be live project training and they will get first hand experience about building on Cardano. On the other hand the projects will get extra manforce to help them in their project completion. The success of this proposal will be reflected in the facts about how many of these developers become Plutus or Atala Prism Developers. Loking at the transparency of the team and the regular sharing of the data-monitoring and Auditability of the project looks attainable.\n\nIn the end, I would add that this is a good initiative by the team and if successful, it can help in increase in developer activity on Cardano.

This is a great opportunity for the ecosystem to grow. It's true that it would be 10 people at a time, but those 10 people would develop applications that could possibly reach millions of people, so it's a matter of efficiancy not quantity. I do appreciate the idea and really believe it will have an impact over the developer ecosystem.\nThe proposers identify a serious problem in the dev community, because it's currently growing with an amazing rate, and more senior developers are need to accomodate all new projects and ideas that come up. I really like the practical approach and having projects to learn on lined up. It's clear the proposers are well integrated in the community, because they've spoken to already running businesses to check the demand for senior devs. Any good market approach includes checking where best you can fit economically into any environment so this is a really good step to take, even before any work is actually done toward growing your own senior cardano devs.\nThe key metrics of the proposal are good enough, considering it's a hard task to know what each individual has learned since starting the self development program. As a developer myself I can say that different people have different growth and speed of learning, so having any kind of notes on what's being learned is a good way to show what's going though their minds and having it written down helps with the learning process as well as the metrics.\nI don't see anything missing from the proposal, and overall I think it's an impactull solution for the aforementioned reasons.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have provided plenty of links, credentials skillset and done projects and have a solid work history, which brings the credability of the whole project up in my eyes as a developer and a veteran assessor.\nI really like the self learning + project learning + live project learning each for 2 months. It may seem a bit rappid to someone, but keep in mind these will be senior developers which don't need to learn programming, just need to learn the paradigms speciffic for the space and have a solid experience with all kinds of technology so this wouldn't be their first rodeo. It's a really practical and pragratic approach and I'm a fan of both, and have experience this rappid form of learning new things, which is not uncommon in our work.\nThe budget is more than reasonable, although it doesn't specify what exactly will be the generated marketing content, for the pricepoint, I believe it's worth it. Even so I would have liked to see in the proposal a more detailed breakdown of what exactly marketing approaches would be taken - digital, direct marketing or something else entirely. Just curious, but I do believe it would make the project more transparent and would invite assessors with the necessary skills (unlike me) to give you a free suggestino or two in the assessments.\nAs a developer the timetable of 6 months is a reasonable one, but that depends on the people they choose, so I defer to the selection process of those 10 devs to the proposers that have much more experience than I do in that particular sphere of operation.\nThe proposers have considered possible challenges, and I do think they've hit the nain on the head, because everything seemed really reasonable to me as a developer and I would have loved to be a part of such educational opportunity. It's true to make the switch from web2 to web3 development and I'm speaking from experience. Overall A feasible solution that I would definetely vote for when the time comes. I wish good luck to the proposers!\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since there will be a github to present the progress as well as include relevant information in a monthly report, I think it will be possible to follow along with the projects progress and eventual success, keeping in mind of course that people are different and the learning curve and speed of learning is different for all participants.\nThe roadmap and milestones are reasonable and can be followed by interested parties. \nSolution is really practical for the problem stated and I do hope it's going to be efficient as well as well planned out. I appload the proposers for a well thought out proposal and I like the preparation steps they've taken like talking to businesses to setup the demand before they provide the supply. That's a blue ocean strategy https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/what-is-blue-ocean-strategy/ and I do like the efforts to supply the newly created demand.\nOverall an auditable proposal, no worries there.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3840, "q0": "This proposal is about adding senior developers in India on the Cardano ecosystem to bring awareness, and identify web 2.0 experienced developers and train them on Plutus and Atala Prism, to help them collaborate with projects.\nThe proposer emphasized that India skilled and experienced developers pool can be a solution to fill the gap of the developer requirement for Cardano, and these developers are engaged in developing complex applications using other technologies in web 2.0. In six months, they expect to prepare 10 experienced developers as Plutus or Atala Prism developer, 5 for each, and these developers will be available for the community to hire on projects. \nWith the approach, the shortage of developers on Cardano can be solved quickly.\nIn addressing the challenge, which is about supporting this challenge by bringing in more developers into Cardano, this is exactly what this proposal is seeking to do, that is making available more trained developers on Cardano by existing web 2.0 developers in India and training them and also giving them on-project experience.\nThe proposal mentioned 2 main risks, one being that web 2.0 developers may not be interested in Blockchain technology.

Udai is the founder of eRevMax.com and served as CTO and CEO. eTevmax is a leading travel B2B integration technology company that was founded over 20 years ago and has more than 1000 tech integrations. It is also being used in many hotels around the world. Narendra is an Enterprise Software Architect, Developer, and Manager. He has 22 years of experience in Software Application Design and Development. The team alone is very capable, at one glance it is shown that these 2 individuals have a lot of experience and know what they are doing in their fields. In addition, their plan is well thought out. The first part of their plan is the marketing and selection phase, this is where they will run awareness campaigns on various social media and private groups and ask interested parties to join their program. Throughout this first phase, they would weed out uninterested candidates. Once the first phase is completed then they would start phase two of their proposal, which is the training and development phase. They also plan to hire a Marketer, Content Creator, and two Project managers for said proposal. The team has planned things out rather well and thus I am confident in their execution.

Those milestones consist of the number of developers being trained, developers learning progress, projects assigned and progress, and finally, feedback from the community project team whenever applicable. In addition, the team would also show the community the process of learning and also the identities of the onboarded developers. Furthermore, a dedicated Github would be opened to illustrate progress. The team would also announce the available team members to collaborate after the project-based learning stage through social channels.

This proposal aims  to tackle this challenge by recruiting several developers from India to learn blockchain via a training course that includes a guided learning stage and hands-on projects for the participants (working on other community projects). The course itself will be focused on training web 2.0 developers to work with Plutus and Atala Prism. The issue brought up is relevant since blockchain technology is still an underexplored sector of interest, especially in Asia, and the goal of this project is aligned with the challenge setting objective, which is to grow \u201ca bigger talent pool of developers that Catalyst projects can collaborate with\u2026\u201d. Overall, I think this project can add value to Cardano ecosystem by introducing more developers that are capable in the Cardano blockchain that will lead to more products and further adoption of Cardano.

The budget includes marketing, training and development cost, partial project funding (for hands-on training), and the rate for project managers. The budget is well laid out and seems reasonable with its justification.\n\nThe 6 months roadmap was well laid out going over the 3 key milestones (2 months per milestone) of marketing, selection, and guided self study (weekly progress assessment), project based learning (working on sample or finished projects), and live project trainings (working on community projects). With the clear and well laid out roadmap, the project seems feasible to be completed in a timely manner. The proposer has also identified the risks that can come with the project regarding participant interest and developers willingness to let developer in training to work on their project by giving monetary incentives and finding for projects with shortage of developers. \n\nOverall, the proposal shows that the team has the relevant skills and experience as well as the ability to identify the resources needed & come up with a feasible project timeline.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The overarching goal of this project is to have 10 web 2.0 developers with experience working with Plutus and Atala Prism (5 developers each) and the metrics used to measure the project\u2019s progress is also suited for its means (i.e. number of developers in training including progress notes, the live project\u2019s progress, and community feedback from the live project used for training developers). These metrics are not only able to measure the progress of the project\u2019s deliverables but also the competency of the developers after training.
