Wada has identified a clear problem that this proposal will help to solve, and that is that Haskell and Plutus development has a reputation for being challenging, and there are only a small number of courses and resources available for new students and developers. It can be difficult for new developers to know how/where to get started when developing with Haskel and Plutus. This additional resource will enhance Wada\u2019s mission of onboarding more developers from Africa, as well as providing a great learning tool for anyone in the world to access and learn to build on Cardano. The potential for this to add significant value to Cardano is very high, because this training course can easily scale up in the near future to onboard more developers and users. There is potential to create a sustainable revenue generating model with premium paid content, or to offer free and inclusive education with funding support from catalyst.  Being designed mobile friendly will insure inclusive access for anyone with a smartphone. Educational resources are the foundation that can help developers to build new apps, unique use cases and drive economic activity on Cardano all built with the security of functional programming. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This Academy for Haskell Devs is rated 5 stars for feasibility because the proposing team has outlined the team involved, their experience and qualifications, and evidence that they have successfully delivered several Catalyst projects in the past, and they are well qualified in a range of relevant fields such as teaching and education, as well technical experience with Haskell and software development and delivering Catalyst proposals to Cardano. Wada has built up a large team of well qualified and experienced Cardano community members who are well equipped to deliver this proposal. In addition they have a large and quickly growing network of additional resources if they should be required to help with any issues or unexpected problems with delivery.  The proposal outlines the software tools they will be using, and the budget for this development is very feasible and reasonable. I have personally implemented online learning courses with similar LMS platforms in the past, so I believe the financial and technical challenges will be minimal with this proposal, as the software chosen will provide low cost hosting options, and It is highly likely they will be able to deliver the course with the generous budget requested. The majority of the cost likely will be the labour of the team required to create the course material that will be done by professional educators. In addition they have allocated $10,000 for marketing and design, which can be used for outreach to onboard new students and spread awareness of the project. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal contains sufficient information to audit the progress and success of the proposal, and I have rated it 4 stars for auditability. I did not give 5 stars because they only metric they have committed to deliver is the completed course which is described in subjective terms such as \u201c easy-to-use, mobile-friendly solution to learning Haskell, Plutus and other technical subjects.\u201d And one numerical/measurable metric which is to \u201conboard 50 developers onto the Wada Academy platform within its first 12 months of public launch.\u201d I would have liked to see some additional commitments such as, for example: 40+ developers completing the course and 10+ actively developing new apps or working on Cardano projects within 18 months. Or 75% of developers/students onboarding rating the course 4/5 or above in a survey. The scope and budget is significant, and while I don\u2019t doubt the teams ability to deliver, it would have been 5 stars if they included some more measurable/auditable commitments like course completion rate or follow up surveys on participants. However, they have committed to providing the relevant measurable Key Metrics on their website, they just don\u2019t have specific targets set for those metrics and included in the \u201cwhat success looks like\u201d section of the proposal.

The solution is, to build a comprehensive online education system for Cardano developers based on the available space of Wada Academy, a decentralized education institution in Africa. Specifically, the content of the solution will be, providing modular courses and tools to support Haskell language learning; create an open and friendly learning and knowledge sharing community. The aim of the solution is, to help increase the number of active developers on the Cardano ecosystem, overcoming the current shortage of Haskell online training programs. At the same time, the team wants to build an open and appropriate learning space so that Cardano developers are constantly equipped with up-to-date knowledge. Personally, I consider this a comprehensive solution, bringing value to our Cardano ecosystem. The information of this proposal is brief, complete and clear. The team has fully calculated: tech stack, sound marketing strategy, unique elements and future expansion use cases of the solution. In addition, the current picture of the challenges faced is also clearly shown and how they will focus on solving them. In fact, online learning is becoming more and more popular and friendly because of the benefits it brings: convenient in terms of time, does not take up much space, is cheap and has many options. Learners can pursue free courses from the web, Youtube... However, the disadvantage is that knowledge is not logically systematic, cannot track personal progress, and especially is not verified, guaranteed quality assurance. As for Haskell, the core of Cardano's development, is also considered one of the hardest coding languages to learn. This further requires that training be delivered professionally, creatively, and sustainably. Recently, a number of free training programs to assist Haskell developers have also been held. Specifically, the Haskell Academy program, announced by ADA Finance and BitDegree in November 2021, provides intensive training for up to 20 Haskell developers, to build Dapps. However, due to the limited number of people, these programs cannot universally support hundreds or thousands of Haskell scholars at the same time. With the proposed team solution, this seems to have been resolved. However, there are a few things I would like the team to clarify further here. Specifically: the quality of the course is guaranteed by what standards? Who will stand for the assessment and verification? What value and certificate of training completion are provided to trainees after training? Regarding the risk of preventing success, since the project's budget is relatively large $48600, I suggest that the team consider setting up a contingency fund (10-20% of the budget) to mitigate the impact of ADA price, may affect the fund for implementation.

At the same time, they also clearly understand the goals, the results they need to achieve in the process of work. Regarding the project's budget, this is the only minus point in the feasibility of the project. Although the team has a cost breakdown for large items, they are completely lacking in providing unit prices*quantity with details. This leaves the community with insufficient information and basis to assess the reasonableness of the project budget. I ask the team to explain in as much detail as possible how they construct the cost of each item. For example, the cost of website and software $7000 should be divided by unit price: domain purchase, hosting/month, software license/month. Or the cost of video and editing should clearly state: unit price for production, video editing* expected number of videos\u2026 About the team, information about Wada Academy - where team members are active and profile of each member team is complete, obviously.
