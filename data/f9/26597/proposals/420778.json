The learning curve for someone coming from another blockchain is rather steep. I had to deal with this problem when starting out and acquired the knowledge primarily through trial and error over the last couple of years. The proposers correctly say that excellent and organized documentation would greatly help new developers who join. It would also improve the experience of developers already on Cardano. I liked how the proposer researched what high-quality documentation looks like and provided references; applying these best practices, no doubt, would greatly benefit Cardano. However, after reading the solution to the problem, I felt the solution is much more restricted than the problem statement. I suggest the proposers adjust their language and focus on the problem they will address. In terms of existing documentation resources, the proposals mention them, such as Cardano Essentials, and state that they may contribute there. Should the deliverable be well received, the proposers will apply to extend the work through additional funding in future rounds. I think the MLabs team will be able to contribute positively to the developers\u2019 journey and ecosystem but would have liked to see more integration with other documentation sources.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Yes, the MLabs team is one of the IOG partners and suppliers of Plutus resources for projects building on Cardano. The link to their website and descriptions of the individual working on the proposal has been provided; however, there are no links to Linkedin or other social media (or Github) profiles. There is also no mapping of who from the team will perform what work in the proposal. The budget is broken down into identifiable items. The total budget is set at $60k, which will pay for 750 hours; this works out to $80/h, which is a competitive rate for development, but a little high for documentation. The proposer set out a clear delivert timeline to deliver tutorials for Plutarch in the first 3 months and then tutorials on Blockfrost, Oura, and updates to Plutonomics in the second 3 months. The proposal describes how they will deliver each element of the budget which is largely a documentation effort of tutorials but leaves out who of the team will be responsible for each part. No new software will be built; therefore there are no language or architecture considerations. The key risk highlighted is agreeing with other projects to update their documentation in line with MLab\u2019s recommendations, not mitigating action is suggested in the proposal. To address this risk, I would recommend the proposers seek sponsorship from the Cardano Foundation or Charles to let the community know they are behind MLab\u2019s effort. I think the proposer will not have any trouble delivering updates to the documentation of the project they control and writing tutorials, but I have doubts that they will manage to get the other projects to onboard their documentation recommendations without sponsorship.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the proposers set the targets for what they want to achieve after 3 and 6 months; however, there are no intermedia targets. I would recommend the proposers add intermediate targets so the community can get comfort that the project is delivering on target. The proposers aim to track statistics on user engagement in their GitHub repos, citations and backlinks, likes, kudos, and reception of the documentation by the community. I would add a KPI to track the receptivenesses of other projects to adapt the proposed documentation practices. The team does not mention the main channel for communication with the community; however the team makes extensive use of Github, which many other developers also prefer. The proposers state that success is setting best practices, setting standards, and increasing reliability through better documentation. Similarly to the problem statement, this success statement reads that the proposal will deliver more than what the proposers plan to deliver. The KPIs are objective and will be easy to audit, whereas the success will be more challenging.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2123", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 680, "q0": "I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. Being a developer myself, and being in Cardano community and part of plutus pioneer program, I myself struggled to find good resources on writing smart contracts on Cardano along with integration with open source projects that are built to help developers with the tooling.\n\nThis proposal is targeted to solve this problem and it is high time that this is solved as early as possible, because tools and projects will only grow from here, leading to a lot of hardships in developing on Cardano. I have again and again witnessed this in my career of over 16 years, that how important good documentation is to help new developers. \n\nThe goals of the proposal is to help overall developer experience that aligns with challenge settings. Additionally, a detailed set of software projects are mentioned that they are planning to improve/build documentation upon. Finally, how will this documentation be sustained in the long run ? I am unable to find the answer to this question from the writeup.

It would have been nice to have this information as well.\n\nThe total budget of $60K breakdown is provided based on the total 750 work hours. The total time is then split into each of the projects for which the documentation will be provided. Overall, based on my own experience too this is quite realistic, as they are not only providing documentation but also tutorials, code samples, on the line of industry standard Mozilla documentation for web developers. The timeline of 6 months for this with a 3-6 split is quite realistic and achievable.\n\nThe risk section explains the potential challenges/risks involved, and the proposal's successful implementation could be hindered by this, especially because of cross projects coordination. I see some issues here and this can affect the timelines of this project deliverables. Therefore, I can not strongly agree. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I strongly agree that information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal. The team will track the engagement metrics of the published documentation(e.g. Haddock, currently used by Plutus developers, in repository docs on github), therefore tracking it via number of issues raised, questions asked, citations or, likes, general reception of the documentation, comments etc.\n\nThe success of this project is explained in terms of 3 main points, best practices, setting standards, and reliability.

Therefore, the target users are dApp builders on Cardano, they are potential customers because this is the trend of the new era.\n  The proposal output is documentation so that developers across the Cardano ecosystem can move faster, with less difficulty, and ultimately ship products at lower prices.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution raised is that the company MLabs has experience working with Cardano smart contracts across many projects. So they can contribute directly and work with the maintainers to improve the documentation for everyone. The proposal outlines progress and milestones by month with specific work completed. The core team of the project includes 4 people:\nLas Safin as Head of Research, Las is a software engineer and formal method expert who has experience with dependent typed languages like Idris and Agda .Vlad Posmangiu Luchian takes the position Project Director & Architect. Vlad is a software engineer working with Haskell. At Mlabs, Vlad works on the design and delivery of various DApps including DEXs, Oracles, and NFT Marketplaces.\nViet Tran holds the position of Project Manager, Viet holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Mathematics along with a PhD in Theoretical Physics. He has experience in Haskell, Plutus and Purescript combined.\nRory Tyler Hayford is the Delivery Manager, Rory is a programming language and multilingual developer. He has experience in both backend and frontend development.\nThus, looking at the experience and education of the core team of the proposal, we see that the team is fully capable of ensuring a successful project launch. There has been a risk raised that the consent of the maintainers is required for projects not directly run by the MLabs company for the work to be consolidated. However, the group has not clearly stated how to completely solve this risk.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal's total required budget is $60000, which is an appropriate budget to launch a project that provides documentation for developers building Cardano dApps. In addition, the budget is explained in detail, specific to each project item, calculated by the number of hours. However, the budget analysis should explain more clearly about the amount per hour, the number of hours for the work should be divided into smaller and more detailed to increase financial transparency for the project. .

The proposed solution, if successfully and skillfully implemented, would address the challenge proposed by this category and go a long way towards eliminating some pain points for Cardano developers.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see addressed a little more clearly is the level of experience of the target audience. Will this be a resource that's friendly to junior developers, or those who might be new to Haskell, or is it primarily aimed at keeping veterans up to speed and more productive? Theoretically it could accomplish both, but it would be clarifying to get a sense of what types of resources will be prioritized.

It's unclear how many people will ultimately be working on the project, but the budget breaks down to $80 per hour which, while slightly on the high side, isn't unreasonable given the team's experience developing on Cardano.  \n\nWith any kind of reference repository, it's less a question of \"can it be built\" than \"can it be maintained.\" With that in mind, I'm glad to see the proposal address the possibility of extending the reference's lifespan through future rounds of Catalyst funding. \n\nWith regard to projects not run by MLabs, have the relevant parties been approached? What happens if they don't agree with the proposed style of documentation?", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A documentation drive is a very tangible deliverable, so there should be very little question as to whether the proposers have created what they said they would create. \n\nTracking engagement metrics should also go a long way towards gauging how useful the community finds the resources to be.

In addition, I think marketing and communication are also very important, it will help increase the number of people to reach this project.
