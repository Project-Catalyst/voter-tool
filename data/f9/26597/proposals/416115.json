While teams will still be able to create and/or upload their own standards, others who may not want to create their own will benefit from a full library of options. This will likely appeal to a variety of different teams while simultaneously working towards a more standardized subset of metadata standards. \n\nThe additional benefit of having the library on one site that is able to replace the standalone websites that exist for on-chain tasks. By having a one-stop-shop where groups can identify their appropriate standards and integrate them into their project will likely improve the developer ecosystem and provide additional functionality to Cardano. \n\nThis proposal can also succeed in improving the connectedness of the ecosystem by providing a common taxonomy and lexicon for the community. In so doing, we can reduce the duplication and potential conflict of efforts. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. \n\nFrom reading the proposal, it is very clear that the proposer is well educated and knowledgeable on the subject. The explanation of what they are trying to achieve, the need, and the solution are all very well laid out. \n\nThe plan is to integrate the metadata standards library into their existing application \"Vrooli\". What is nice about this is that the Vrooli application is already up and running. Therefore, the integration into this application feels very feasible. It is also nice that the application will have both web-based and mobile accessibility, which will potentially further increase its use. \n\nThe proposer provides supporting details of their experience and capability that imply they are up to the task and likely to deliver. Their credentials are well suited for this work, and although I may have liked a bit more granularity in the plan itself (beginning/end dates - in months so we can know when the project is expected to be delivered) the activities and timeline are sufficient.\n\nThe budget is clear, but my only critique here is that he should have splurged for a $20 bottle of celebratory champagne. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. \n\nAs I like to say, any project that commits to being open source by default can give the community extra assurances that they will have an opportunity to audit the progress and success of the proposal. Cardano aims to be a global open source project and by instilling this approach from the outset, we only need to solve each of the major problems once, then everyone gets to benefit from that knowledge. \n\nThe proposer also does a decent job at explaining their KPIs and success measures. By tracking the number of active users, standards created, and then number of votes across all standards, they hope to achieve thousands of developer hour saved and an increase rate of metadata standards development. I think the #s for each of the KPIs could also be success measures since those are what you are hoping to achieve. The nice part is that all of the data/analytics will be made free and available 24/7. \n\nFor these reasons the community should be very confident in their ability to audit this proposal.

Vrooli is a feature packed metadata standard library that streamline the discovery of standards and allow anyone to input their own data into standards and an API. Later on Vrooli will have a smart contract execution feature and allow routines to be built on routines. It will be possible to share standards across DAOs. Even the possibility of downloading the entire library as the .csv file. Vrooli will help developers to receive feedback on standards early in the development. Instead of Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP), the user can upload their own standards without having to write a formal proposal. It will save time & effort and lower barrier of entry. The key metrics and goals of proposal aligns very well with the challenge setting which is to create a positive developer experience so that the developers can focus on building the successful apps. The main risk of this proposal is on time but the proposer mitigate this by hosting all features on a website that will keep the development on track.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is likely that the team is able to successfully implement the proposal. It shows very organized timeline of 16 weeks until its launch. Also the proposer gives the precise budget breakdown (enough to achive the goal).

There is a clear roadmap with time horizon of 2 weeks to check the progress. The KPIs can be tracked (200 monthly active users, 50 standards created and 1000 votes cast in total) and the track result is real-time as Vrooli is on progressive web application.

However, it did not mention how it analyzes data and makes it useful for developers to use. This project seems to be simple and it did not emphasize how this will help develop the Cardano ecosystem. It should give the list of all questions so that people could see whether the data collected is mostly related to Cardano and this will encourage developers to build apps on Cardano as they got some information related to this blockchain.

The description of how to be considered a success of this project was kind of general.

According to the team, metadata standards are a vital component of smart contract development, yet they are difficult to utilize and construct. In order to address this problem, they tend to build an open-source library that allows anyone to search and build metadata standards by creating smart contracts, APIs, data, interfaces, and standards compatible and decentralized by utilizing visual building elements known as routine. I find this extremely interesting since not so many people are concerned about this problem. The objective and metrics of this proposal are aligned with those required by the challenge. Besides, there is a plus point that the team has given out a brief explanation for those unfamiliar with how metadata is used on Cardano.

The project is to create the standards library and to implement this standard into their Vrooli Application (already done) which will allow users to build Smart Contracts with standardized meta data.

I do however think that the challenge of getting this solution into use was not discussed enough. Presumably at the start, the library will be pretty much empty and it will depend on users using the standard builder feature to make standards to fill up the library.
