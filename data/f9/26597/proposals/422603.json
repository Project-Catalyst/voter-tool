This is useful for developers of large-scale applications that receive large volume of traffic and need to ensure high availability. As a user of Kubernetes in the financial services industry, uptime is of utmost criticality, particularly when things get busy. Also as a user of cardano-node and DB-Sync. From personal experiences, the repercussions of slow recovery from the failure of these services can be critical. A Kubernetes solution has scalability built-in by default - it launches replica services as demand increases. A ready-to-deploy kubernetes service would improve developers\u2019 experience and lead to increased developer adoption, productivity, and creativity. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, the proposer provides reference to previous work done in building cardano back end services. The website txpipe.io is collection of backend services that improves the user experience of back end developers. I have not heard of the Sctolls repo that has 38 stars on gitrepo and Oura that has 169 start on gitrepo. The team demonstrate experience in the field and a track record of building tools on Cardano. The budget is set at $64k and deliver in 3 month, majority of this is to pay for a python developer $65/h which is reasonably priced for a senior developer in South America. The budget also includes tetsig and a technical writer. This seems to be a reasonable time and budget to deliver an on demand Kubernetes service for the core Cardano services. From personal experience it takes around a month to set up a Kubernetes cluster for a handful for services, so an additional two months to test, packaged and document seems very reasonable. The main risks highlighted are in the uncertainty of facing unknown technical difficulties which they plan to resolve by reaching out to the community and contemplating best practices. The proposer reasonable plans to start with what they know and will come back for additional funding if the usage picks up and there is demand from the community for additional functionality. I strongly agree that the team has the skill and the right plan to deliver this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer suggest that a detailed roadmap will be presented as part of the open source repo.

The proposer suggests weekly updates via twitter. The proposal would benefit from more detail in this section, particulary a set of KPI metrics that can be tracked by the community. The roadmap for the project is clearly artcularted.

There are fairly complex processes and require experience and a large amount of time to host correctly. Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Availability of k8 operator for the Cardano resources as mentioned in the proposal like node, dbSync, Ogmios and Submit API will provide immense help to projects like dandelion from Gimbellabs and can boost API service provides productivity.

This is a great benefit for the developer experience because automating things is always a good idea. This proposal will have a positive impact over the envitonment, becuase usually when you hear that something can be deployed with a click of a button, you need this infrastructure in place to make that possible. Where to deploy (test environment / production) or what projects depending on other projects should be deployed first (ordering services deployment) and so on and so on are all configurations that need to be done in order to have a seemless experience when deploying. That's what the authors mean behind having a complex configuration that will be hidden.\nAs a developer myself I really like the solution provided, because I'm used to having this infrastrucuture in place and realize that's not the case for cardano, and tools and infrastructure such as this needs to be built from the grownd up. Hence the proposal clearly adds value to the caradano ecosystem and is aligned with the challenge settings.\nThe proposal will be able to address future challenges and from what they've listed as risks I can really appreciate the approach and understanding they have, because knowing someone might have already done what you're trying to is smart. Asking for help is even smarter and more efficient than figuring out everything on your own. \nOverall an impctfull solution, no complaints.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I checked out the team members first, because they're the most important thing to making this project a relity.

I can speak also to the documentation part, having written quite a lot, so all and all the effort compared to the time seems well planned out. I like the iterative approach, but I do wish there was a better breakdown of tasks, because the listed information is just a roadmap (an overll view) and does not provide the necessary technical details in order to do a better and more accurate estimation of the tasks.\nThe wages are in bounds with what's regular, so there are no complaints there. The resources necessary to implement this proposal are clear and well defined.

These all small set of codes are deployed on a kubernetes cluster where in it can be managed efficientlywith having certain servicers continuously running even if a services goes down by having multiple instances of the service running on the cluster.\n\nThis employs a container technology, which reduces the work load on the developers to make their application to deployable on a particular platform. \n\nThe proposal essentially is providing these clusters with operators for environment management, to developers to deploy their code or application without making their application platform specific. This in-turn increases adaptability of Cardano and hence attract more skilled and seasoned developers to the environment.\n\nThis is a great initiative, as it allows the developers to actually deploy their code/test/modify/update without having to worry about the platform.
