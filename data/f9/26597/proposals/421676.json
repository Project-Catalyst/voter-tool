It will help existing developers interact more easily with the Plutus off-chain code and comfort new developers that they can use a familiar platform. REST APIs are used all over the internet and are a standard protocol for transmitting data between services. The cardano-wallet service has a REST API built-in. The PAB lacks a REST API, and the proposers suggest creating one. I have developed a similar solution for my projects, specifically for parametrized smart contract templates that need to be run off-chain and generate the smart smart contract that can then be run on-chian. Therefore, if the team delivers what they promise, I would at least try it out. It is aligned to the challenge setting as this would improve the developers\u2019 experience on Cardano and open the door for new developers looking for a familiar API to generate smart contracts. The optimal solution, however, would have been to build this into the PAB rather than adding a solution on top, at some point, it is likely to be added to the PAB in which case the proposer solution might be superseded.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers provide the git repo where the team has built other open source solutions for Cardano. The repos cover several use cases and gives comfort that the team has experience working with Cardano services. A short background on two individuals is provided; however, there are no links to Linkedin or other social media accounts for them to validate the claims. The roadmap and budget is broken into sections and with what will be delivered by when and the target functionality at each stage. They target to complete the project in 2.5 months, which is achievable, it took me a week to implement a similar service; therefore adding a month on both sides for preparation, testing, documenting, and releasing is reasonable. The plan describes the Plutus PAB, but does not describe how the API will be implemented. I would recommend the proposers detail the technical aspect a little more, such as whether the API will rely on the PAB webserver, or they will need to run a NodeJS instance and use the Express server, or something else. The requested budget is $32k is a little high for this type of deliverable, and the requested rate of $80/h is in the higher range. The team highlights the risks of the developers being unavailable or IOG developing a similar solution, which is possible given this feature is in demand. I believe the team will be able to deliver the proposal as described", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the proposers outline a biweekly plan and will monitor the deliverable at the end of each period and report back to the community through monthly updates. The team has an active Gitrepo where the code will open-sourced. I browsed through several repos there and saw that they had been updated at most a week ago, which suggests good developer activity. Publishing updates to Github allow the community to monitor progress and engage in conversation. Success is stated as many devs using their app, an active issue log on Github, pull requests from other community members, and positive feedback from the community. This list is concise yet thoughtful and an excellent way to monitor the adoption of an app. I would add to add the number of stars and forks.

A UI can interact with the PAB to call exposed endpoints via Plutus off-chain code, but the PAB cannot return a response back to the calling UI. A RESTful response from a Plutus off-chain will provide access to properties inferred with Plutus. It is important to highlight that this wrapper tool is non-intrusive and it does not change the way PAB or Plutus peripheral chains work. Instead, it provides an abstraction for communicating with Plutus' off-chain code at runtime. The wrapper will provide the necessary abstraction for the frontend/backend for Plutus offline thread access. Development teams can reuse REST endpoints from this tool and then connect them to their own smart contracts by following the examples that will be provided. Various endpoints can be called by the dApp front-end (or backend) and the REST-based wrapper will interact with the off-chain code. What do developers want and how do they get it from the Cardano developer ecosystem? - Developers often want open source and tested code that they can adopt in their development, preferably from people who have been in the space longer. This will be one of the open source repositories through which we share our expertise and learn from working on Cardano. What are enterprise developer managers looking for to be able to build enterprise projects - internal or commercial? - To have standard approaches to doing something and not have to reinvent the wheel are the aspects that development managers focus on. This solution provides an easily usable tool/codebase to help with dApp development. Unforeseen circumstances affecting developer resource availability - In the event that developer resource availability decreases over the course of a project due to health issues or other unforeseen circumstances otherwise, that would put a strain on the timeline.

This ticks a lot of boxes for me, as it makes it much easier for development teams already tackling the steep learning curve of Haskell/Plutus to increase their productivity and fall back on familiar development patterns while staying true to the new environment and avoiding the use of \"training wheels\" instead that will never get them properly on the road. Given the relatively broad scope of the challenge setting, this is an area aiming at the core of Plutus PAB and Cardano dApp development, that is a welcome \"back to basics\" among a lot of proposals on the fringes of developer ecosystem (like training videos and web development tooling). In my opinion, this is exactly what the Developer Ecosystem challenge is there for, to add to the native Cardano stack and improve the work productivity and flexibility of \"pure\" blockchain development.

The main pain point that the team is going to solve is that PAB cannot return a response to the requesting client.
