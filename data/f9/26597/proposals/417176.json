It's excellent that a survey will be conduct in early stage of the project to understand the needs that should be tackled and the final outcome is the co-development of a proposal, which should help to reach the final goal. As well pointed out here. It has a great alignement with challenge by tackling kpis such as \"Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano\" and \"A sense of community and conversations\" and answers at least one of the guiding question (\"How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\").\nRisk management part is also clearly articulated and presents a very good mitigation startegy.\nAs a minor suggestion, it would be nice to understand how the  tailored content to communicate with developers in Latin America would be created. This would help to asses the communication strategy beforehand and already collect some feedback from community.\nHowever, this is more a small detail and does not compromise my rate (5).

By its plan, its possible to clearly understand how the roject will be strucutured and what kindoe content will be built. \nBudget breakdown is sensible and aligned with project plan. It's nice they already explained what will be done in case the \"Security Budget\" is not used. The only thing I'd improve here is breakingdown the hackaton budget a bit more, saying which costs are incurred there.\nThe team has 2 people already committed with experience in digital marketing,  entrepreneurship and Cardano. Besides this, they'll count with advisors on technical end if necessary (although dont tell here who they'd be). The descripition on each person are really complete  and they provide several links to work as reference.\nAll in all, my rate is 5. Although I made some small comments regarding possible potential improvements, they should not be worth 1 star of penalty.\n\n\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposer explains very clearly how auditability will be communicated and tracked, which includes tools that were developed by community. Besided this, several kpis are suggested and the final develiverable of a co-creating of a proposal should really attest project success. I also appreciate feedback is taken into accout.\n It would be nice though to see some goals on the metrics as Number of seminar registrations and Number of participants enrolled in the post-seminar mentoring group.\nBesides this, a final report telling the methodology used and the main challenges of the project could also be ellaborated so community gets these learnings as well.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4949, "q0": "The proposal aims to bring new Latin American 9developers to the Cardano ecosystem, through a developer onboarding seminar designed to end in a self-managed community hackathon and a future Catalyst proposal by the new developers. Proposers note that educating developers is key to attracting them to work in the space. As a developer, I find this to be true. There is a large educational gap for newcomer developers to onboard onto the ecosystem and start providing value. The proposers take a holistic approach with this problem, educating these newcomers on the blockchain ecosystem and technology, Cardano ecosystem, and on blockchain as a tool for social change. They also focus on self-organization and community mindset, which I think are key hurdles for newcomers to get used to when coming onboard Catalyst.\n\nThe proposal is aligned well with the challenge, as it aims to onboard new developers to Cardano and Catalyst, bridging some of the early gaps in knowledge and getting them to a place where they are contributing to Cardano. The work will result in a knowledge base of introductory knowledge that fills gaps in the exploration stage, a support structure/a community for new developers, and it will encourage the development of a hackathon by this community. These are all items highlighted specifically in the challenge. \n\nOn the surface these make the impact of the proposal look good. Yet there is an issue. The only information on the size of the impact is this in the plan: \"Executing 2 to 5 seminars with the intention to close 2 to 3 groups of 3 to 6 developers each\". So at the maximum, this will onboard 18 developers to Cardano. There is no mention of scaling this beyond this original group, or if the seminars, the community, or any other part of the work done in this proposal will benefit any other group in any other way. There is no mention of marketing, even though both proposers are marketing specialists. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is a massive issue with this proposal. The proposers have 6 proposals by my count. In 4 of these, they are the entire team. In 1 only a single proposer is present. In 1, there are 2 others. Looking at this workload, and looking at the 2500USD/month rate in this proposal, 2000-2500 USD/month in 3 others, and extras from the remaining 2, that adds up to around 10000USD/month of pay to each of these two proposers. There is 0 mention of workload management. There isn't even any effort by the proposers to mention these additional proposals. They're also working on proposals from past funds. Adding those all up, I find it extremely difficult to believe they can produce anything worth 2500 USD/month with this proposal.\n\nThis is the first time I'll be so blatant in judging a proposal: I believe this is a cash grab. They purposefully hid their other proposals, failed to mention workload, and left out how much time they'd spend working on this proposal and on others. I estimate with a usual 40 hour per week workload, they'd be making around 250USD/hour of work with all of their proposals. 250 USD/hr for work that is mostly content production. It is not highly technical. It does not require an extensive expert understanding. This is not a fair rate by any margin. \n\nDisregarding this outrageous price tag, we can assess if they can actually deliver, and they can, since there isn't much work to do anyway. The project plan is made of 7 months. First three months is focused on content development. Most of this information is generic and widely available, like Web3, NFTs, Smart Contracts. The team is made of 2: a developer, SPO and a tech copywriter. Both have experience in digital marketing. They have the skills and backgrounds necessary to build an introductory course for newcoming developers. The information is already out there so it'll just be a basic curation of existing resources. They won't have any issues, especially since they haven't defined any of the topics in their content production beyond the title. It's so unclear that delivering it should be no issue at all but read Auditability for that.\n\nThere is also no mention of marketing the work. As part of the work the team will do \"outreach\" to developers and companies. Where will you find these companies and developers? How will you get them to come onboard to your seminars? Assuming you did, how will you build a community with these developers? These are left completely unmentioned. The name of the proposal is to attract new developers. Kind of funny there is no mention of how it will be done.\n", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I found this proposal perplexing. It looks like it has detail to the work done. It's not a very short proposal. There is some good explanations. Yet going beyond the surface, I found it extremely difficult to understand what the outputs of this work will be. They will create a seminar. What topics will be covered is known, but at what detail is completely unknown. What the format of this seminar will be is completely unknown. Will it be a single presentation? How long will it be? A single one hour presentation could fit the bill. A 12 hour long seminar would also fit the bill. Do we have any clue as to what to expect? No. They mention they will execute 2 to 5 seminars. Is that 2-5 1 hour sessions? 2-5 12 hour sessions? That would make a whole lot of difference. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2643", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5644, "q0": "This proposal aims to create content tailored to introduce new LATAM developers to Cardano and to encourage engagement through group mentoring and community activities such as project development. Building decentralized developers, especially Cardano developers in the future, is excellent.

It helps the learning process is more exciting and competitive. \n\nThe proposal is well-fit with the challenge since it helps to develop the Cardano platform and our community. The risk is considered well, however, how do they solve it if it does not reach enough the number of group participants? Additionally, the proposer should note ADA price fluctuations, it would be great if they added to the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget breakdown is presented healthy and thoughtful since the proposer foresees the risk in the budget if it cannot be used entirely.

What sources are they expected to be referenced from? Please update specifically to help the community evaluate and supplement the project. This is an important part of validating knowledge.\nAs for the risk, there are 3 situations that are foreseen and have mitigation plans, which I highly appreciate.

Let's highlight the advantages of Catalyst, the largest decentralized fund in the world.

For more detail and follow-up, the project should estimate the number of working hours for each activity, thereby proposing an appropriate budget. I have a question, the proposal has not yet stated the cost of organizing the seminars. Or suggest another contingency plan. Please contact to clarify the problem\nThe team consists of 2 members, with expertise in software development and analysis and blockchain advertising, provided by the project with specific social links.

The roadmap designs a clear outline of the content that will be presented to the target audience, as well as processes for refining, mentoring, and advancing. The results of this proposal, if we see relatively substantial participation, will be adding more capable developers into the Cardano ecosystem to support existing Dapps and/or creating their own Dapps that might support their local region for greater adoption potential.

Overall, I believe that the whole idea is very innovative and beneficial towards society. Not only does it enhance the development of Cardano, but it also brings technology, especially Blockchain, closer to many people, as well as gives them a chance to self-organize and aim for social goods. As mentioned in this section, the proposal addresses correctly some criterias that match the challenge setting, and I believe it is true. Furthermore, some reasonable potential directions are also provided to show what other ways this proposal can be effective. Besides, from my personal point of view, the risks stated in this section are well-prepared and sufficient. Coming along with those are mitigations for each one, and I believe they are the optimized options. To conclude, I believe this is a well-written part which shows fully what they are aiming for and how they are going to actualize it. However, there is 1 omission that still makes me confused. Although the team described that they are going to invite Latin Americans to the seminar, yet, I think that they did not explain particularly. Specifically, I believe the team should give some general detail such as: the estimated number of people being invited and the estimated number of people showing up, which country or which particular city where the seminar would be held (if some unexpected situations like Covid-19 happen, would it be postponed or held online), what particular characteristics the audience should contain (age, career, education, profession,...),... In my opinion, these criterias, if given sufficiently, would be very helpful in the process of evaluating the scale and impact of the proposed solution.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Initially, a very obvious plan is offered in this section. In general, it takes around 7 month to conduct the final outcome, which is the proposals towards the Catalyst made by participants. Particularly, it would take about 3 months to finish the content development, 1 month to launch the BETA version of the presentation, receive feedback as well as refine it and another 3 months to officially hold the seminars as well as collect the results. Personally, I believe the steps contained in this plan are given clearly and convincingly. Besides, a detailed budget breakdown is also provided with the total requested funds of $50,000. In order to help the Catalyst understand the salary required for each team member, the team offered a brief introduction with details about profession, work experience and Cardano relations, as well as affiliate links for further background research. From my observation, I believe that the information included in this part is very comprehensive and logically ordered.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of this project is proven thoroughly by different ways such as managing tools and tracking spreadsheets. Furthermore, the team also provides reasonable KPIs to follow, yet I would highly recommend that they specify on the numbers/levels that they are expecting. Additionally, although they express clearly their success measures in the future, I suggest that some particular sustainable development goals should be added to ensure a more efficient growth.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4118", "no_vca": 20, "ne": 5, "ng": 15, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Developing content tailored to introduce new LATAM developers to Cardano and to encourage engagement through group mentoring and community activities such as project development.", "experience": "Thiago Nunes - Cardano Ambassador, Developer and SPO.
