However, the proposal says it is targeted towards women in the summarized solution, however in does not explain much how it's made to reach this target group beyond the creation of bootcamps for women. It would be important to see how these bootcamps are related to the platform that they are creating, and what is their approach to have women participating - and, perhaps, if it's a platform target to be women-only or if it's just a wish to have more women. In the way that they describe the proposal, it seems a bit secondary and maybe not genuinely made for women. To improve the proposal design and give a better view of its impact, it would be important to articulate this aspect better. It's also worth saying that they point to the problem that there are not many resources offered beyond the english speaking world, but their solution involves more \"comprehensive courses in English and Spanish\". In this case, why not Spanish and another language? ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The references of the people behind the proposal are well described. But the proposal says that they plan to offer incentives to those who finish the course, but they don't describe the value of these incentives, nor they tell how many people are expected to complete the courses (and, therefore, are eligible to receive rewards). They say that they expect to have 100 users registered, which is different from people eligible to receive rewards and the women in the bootcamps. In addition, the budget for salaries is relatively high, as they will have 6 people under 50k USD plus a few developers for platform creation. It's not clear in the proposal the role of the 6 people, if they will also count on external developers and translators, designers, etc. To make the budget plan more comprehensive, it's recommended that the role of each person is better described. And it's important to say that even though the timeline is well described, they plan to offer 30 courses and they will be create in stage II, that lasts 2 months. For anyone with experience in course and content creation, it's well known that 30 courses is a huge workload to be done in just 2 months. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal offers discrete metrics that allow to assess the success of the platform AFTER it starts its operations. But the proposal could offer metrics to assess its progress DURING the 6-months phase, so the community could check its development. The other problem is that their view of success could be worked on a bit more. If you consider that their target is to 30 courses, but to have only 100 people registered a year, it's simply a lot of courses to a very low number of people registered. Especially if we consider the potential drop out rate that normally exist in every online offer.

I do appreciate the effort it will take to create content concerning the wide variaty of topics the proposers have chosen to cover. I am a firm believer in the statement the more devs are trained to develop in the cardano ecosystem the larger the impact long term we'll have as a community. In that regard the proposal aligns perfectly with the challenge settings and is in the right category.\nIt's good the authors of the proposal have an already established social platform, taking advantage of Youtube, Discord and Facebook to name a few. This makes the conversion of their listeners to be users of the future platform that much likelier.\nOne thing I'm not sure about regarding the impact of the proposal is the notion of tests to measure what the people have learned in their platform, but as long as it's not centered around tests, but rather practical work, test can be a really good tool to keep sanity checks that all the information you learn covers the basis.\nFact is we need more knowledgable people to do online training master classes, because youtube + github has proven to be an unstopable combination for learning new things in the quickest most practical way possible. As a developer myself, my first instinct when learning something new is to see a practical example implemented and to see a youtube video with the explanation, because that gives me the quickest assessment of the language / platform / problem / solution. This is why a practical project, even a small one has been most usefull for me when learning. I urge the proposers to consider this idea.\nOne thing that made a strange impression was the expectation of 100 registered users after a year. I think this number is too small considering the proposers have already youtube channels that get 1k views per video. If the platform is free, I don't see a reason for only a 10% conversion from viewer to registered user and I think that's underestimating the end result. Overall a great idea and proposal that will have an impact if implemented.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I do appreciate the extensive team members and their long list of credentials. I have no doubt they will be able to provide all the content, get certified, although it's a first I'm hearing of IOG giving out certificates for proficiency. The academic background of the team members is sure to provide quality content for the platform mentioned.\nThere are a couple of things I found strange when reading the proposal. I'll try to list them alongside my arguments.\n1. I saw the proposers didn't want to use a ready solution, because it didn't fit their needs, but they haven't specified what exacly those needs were. The term LMS means \"learning management system\". The fact there's an abbreviation speak volumes on how many solutions are out there. There was a comment of having audio/video format needs that's covered by most LMS platforms as well as youtube. The documents done in gotbooks are accessible as well as easily maintainable by community members as well. Github has proven to be the single choice when doing source hosting. That's some of the reasons I disagree with the notion that the current e-learn platforms don't provide the necessary features to cover the needs of this or any other educational proposal. I might be wrong, but the mentioned research wasn't included in the proposal, so I couldn't know the exact aruments and I'm just giving my 2 cents.\n2. Considering the budget: 37700 spent for content creation from 180200 asked. That's 21% of the whole budget for actual content creation. This looks just too low, considering the sum. As an economist by education and a developer working on optimizations I would strongly urge to reconsider this ration and instead of building a platform the proposers try and revisit the LMS solutions and use them instead of creating an entirely new one, that comes with an after-cost of constantly supporting it over time. That's not economically sound, given there are proven solutions that work.\n3. Concerning the user support: I think in order to embrace the decentralized state of mind, you also need to implement this in your support expectations. There already are a plethora of discord channels that give out support for free on any topic you can think of. You can contact those channels and ask for help or offer rewards, that would be much cheaper than hiring someone and training them separately.\nOverall I do believe this is a relevant proposal and I do think it's somewhat feasible, even though I don't agree with the expenditure scheme. I'd advise the proposers to start smaller and start with one course and make a proof of concept for one LMS of their choice of just do youtube + github + gitbooks which is all free and covers most of the educational content presently. Good luck!\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since the proposers are already operating on multiple social platforms I don't see auditability as a problem. The proposers could easily keep their community informed about the progress of the work being done so anyone can follow along. There's a clear problem statement - more pople need to be onboarded and educated on cardano and a matching solution that simple enough - build a platform that would enable solving the problem.\nConcerning KPIs I think the bar is set too low, compared to the expense of the project and the already existing community and following on the social platforms. The metrics seem reasonable to get the necessary information about future optimizations. Overall a decent proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 4, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Thank you for taking the time to review our proposal \n\n1.

There are two things that are important when determining the success of a proposal. The first thing is openness and transparency.

Without this accountability, it will be more difficult to audit the success of this proposal. I would suggest thinking of more ways to potentially implement accountability. The second principle is what has been mentioned before. Accountability. These two factors will have a huge impact on the trustworthiness of the project and ensuring that the potential funds will be utilized in a way that will benefit the Cardano ecosystem.

The project's aim is also clearly expressed through the platform's format, which includes high-quality educational content and rewarding multiple-choice assessments. With the educational expertise gained in the Latin American environment, your team has focused the project's audience on the Hispanic community, and you also want to spread the platform's effect in English.

Other learning platforms charge users since they need revenue to be in existence (those sources can be membership promotion fees, lesson opening fees, advertising fees, etc.). So because all of the knowledge on your platform is free, it appears that it will require long-term community involvement if it is to last. Do you have any plans to reduce your reliance? And one more issue that I believe you should include in your list of big risks. It is the intellectual property right for all monopoly-designed lessons on your platform.
