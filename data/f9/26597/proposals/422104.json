It tackles a real problem in the challenge \u2013 how to attract, motivate, help and boost developers who wish to use Plutus, Cardano\u2019s smart contract language. Plutus is right now \u2013 a somewhat esoteric add-on or derivation from Haskell, which is a functional, secure and powerful language \u2013 but that is not as widely used as other imperative programming languages. Hence, there is a barrier for newcomers who want to learn Plutus \u2013 but do not want to learn ALL of Haskell. There is a need for familiarity with Haskell and this is even openly specified in the Plutus Pioneers course that does require knowledge of Haskell. I know, as I enrolled in Plutus Pioneer cohort 1 and then gave up because of my lack of knowledge of Haskell. The team here proposes to create the bridge that will connect many people like me (keen to learn Plutus) to Plutus Pioneers program, by providing Haskell fundamentals so that students can succeed in the Plutus Pioneer Program. That\u2019s it \u2013 amazing project, but I do have some concerns about the scalability of this proposal to onboard large numbers of future Plutus developers and \u2013 how will this proposal ensure future sustainability \u2013 without awarding scholarships \u2013 as I presume that this will not be a one-off (if it is a one-off then its impact will be limited to the success of the first and only cohort).

The idea is that Haskell is sufficiently different that it requires mentoring in order for key concepts and fundamentals to be understood \u2013 which may be true (not sure \u2013 but the proposal might help prove the point).

Currently, the Carnado ecosystem is becoming more and more complete with smart contracts and will continue to scale under Phase 04 \"BASHO\". Therefore, in the near future, the search and development demand for Plutus programmers is very high. At the moment, the Plutus Pioneer Program is one of the most prestigious programs to help promote training, development and search for Plutus developers for the current and future Cardano ecosystem. Because learning Plutus programming is very different from the languages \u200b\u200bsuch as Java, and PHP and requires a solid Haskell background to be able to learn Plutus smoothly and easily complete the Plutus Pioneer Program because Plutus is a programming language for writing smart contracts in the Cardano blockchain. It is based on Lambda Calculus and Haskell, so it will inherit the best features from both factions. Plutus is based on Haskell and uses the Haskell Template to let you write Plutus pretending it's Haskell. Therefore, the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is very practical, helping to provide an optimal way for students participating in the Plutus Pioneer Program, helping to improve the Haskell platform to complete the Plutus Pioneer Program smoothly and easily.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is workable for implementation. The proposed solution completely solves the problem of the fact that many students participate in the Plutus Pioneer Program without being able to complete the course, ensuring the output quality is up to the standard due to the lack of knowledge of Haskell and the lack of knowledge. Additional training for students with Haskell knowledge before learning Plutus is essential to help students overcome a steeping learning curve. There are 2 members in the project team Luis Morillo-Najarro and Patrick Lance, so the management and operation are extremely easy. Furthermore, they are people with a lot of teaching experience and Haskell like Luis Morillo-Najarro has been a Haskell dev for over 13 years. He graduated from cohort 1 of the Plutus Pioneer Program in 2021. That's why we can be completely assured about professional matters. The budget breakdown is provided very clearly and in detail for each item of the project. like teaching fees, marketing, website, video, etc. The proposer should divide the budget by stages in the project's plan detail, it will help to have a clearer financial picture like September 31 - Scholarships awarded - How much?\n\nIn conclusion, the project is 100 percent workable.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project can be 100 percent auditable. The roadmap is detailed from Jun 30th, 2022 to Feb 6th-10th 2023.

Moreover, the course content has also been designed and made very detailed and clear for 10 weeks with specific knowledge areas from week 1 to week 10, from basic to complex knowledge levels. That can help students with a certain amount of knowledge prepare for the Plutus Pioneer Program.

This proposal effectively addresses the challenge in which it\u2019s submitted. In order to learn Plutus language is first needed a strong basis of Haskell programming. Having a well founded and developed course and educational program of Haskell will be the cornerstone of a strong Developer Ecosystem. These newcomers will bring new opportunities of product development and enhance internal and external dynamics and transactions.
