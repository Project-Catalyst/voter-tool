All of them can be potential future generations of blockchain, especially Cardano. But in fact, very few or almost no schools have included blockchain in the formal training program, which brings a lot of inadequacies for students if they want to approach blockchain in a methodical and systematic way. Moreover, even though there are specialized courses on blockchain by individuals and organizations, students cannot afford to pay because it is not cheap compared to the student's cost of living. According to Timo Digital Bank, the average spending of Vietnamese students is 3,000,000 VND (~ 130 USD). Therefore, the idea proposed by the proponent is extremely necessary to meet the actual needs and meet the future technology trends for students. If this model is successfully built and spread, it will have a huge and positive impact on the Blockchain developer community in general and the Cardano developer community in particular.

This is a relevant problem that can halt the growth of the blockchain developer ecosystem by not having educational resources dedicated to blockchain technologies in mainstream educational body (i.e. IT courses at university) that leads to IT students graduating with minimal knowledge on blockchain. The proposed solution is to provide a standardized courses via collaboration with Emurgo to structure the curriculum, assigning trainers, as well as creating courseware and textbooks that will be used in university. The course mentioned will be divided into fundamental course which will include topics such as Intro to Blockchain, Cryptographic, etc. and advanced course which will include topics such as Intro to Cardano, Marlowe, Plutus, etc. By having these standardized curriculum be implemented on university, it will hopefully raise the level of education/knowledge of students regarding the blockchain technology, especially the Cardano ecosystem. Not only that, the proposed solution can also be scaled by having more university/institution adopt the courseware in their curriculum.

The proposer also plans the subsequent continuation of phase 2 in Fund 10 to spread the standardized curriculum to other universities and encourage students to utilize the Cardano blockchain to deploy their research topics.

To gain access to excellent courses, people either spend a lot of money or learn in English, which is not their first language. As a result, the proponent sees the necessity to create and adapt a high-quality blockchain curriculum for students who want to be blockchain developers but cannot afford blockchain programming classes and formal fundamentals. This idea promotes and motivates future developers while also allowing them to deploy their solutions across the Cardano ecosystem, as required by the Challenge. Furthermore, the developers who participate in the curriculum will be the primary human resources available to businesses in the future. The proposed course will not be expanded in the future. This answers both of the challenge's questions. The proposal is to create two basic blockchain and Cardano blockchain learning modules for developers, which would later be implemented in universities. This is a wonderful concept since IT students in Vietnam lack formal and standardized teaching materials on Blockchain, and understanding of Blockchain is restricted, failing to fulfill the demands of Vietnam and the globe. And, if you wish to integrate these courses in your teaching, the curriculum approval procedure might take a long time. Another issue is that blockchain documentation, which is frequently published in English, may be more difficult for future developers to obtain. The proposed course of action will solve the difficulties identified above. As answers, the proposed team advises working with Emurgo to standardize the curriculum and sending participation. This group will be crucial in the preparation and translation of the syllabuses. The proposal team will gather, respond to, and improve the curriculum after using this program to educate students/developers. The next phase for the proposed squad is Coach Training. The proponent made some really strong arguments. \nBecause they are experienced academics who teach and produce IT syllabuses, participants understand the process of designing and publishing textbooks in universities. This will help the proposal fit the actual demands. The risk for the proponent was that Emurgo would refuse to participate, in which case the team would send persons to sign up for Emurgo's courses and then design the curriculum. This is a realistic assessment of the proposal's hazards. In addition, when implementing this approach, I'd want to draw attention to two other obvious risks. Other universities refuse to use this program to teach their students because they already have their own programs. The second risk I'd want to mention is ADA price volatility. As we see, recently, the price of crypto in general and the price of the ADA in particular, has changed according to the market, therefore this risk will most certainly effect the proposal's execution. My approach to the first risk is to work on the Cardano Blockchain and arrange talks and communication sessions for university decision-makers. They will readily grasp and accept your program. Regarding the possibility of price variations, you may include a redundancy budget in the proposal that accounts for 7-10% of the entire cost. This is a valuable suggestion for future devs, and it would be fantastic if it were realized. This aspect of me receives a 5 rating.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The two stages proposed by the idea are realistic. The task has been split down in the proposal to make it easier to complete. Creating a blockchain course requires a significant amount of time to research and prepare, the majority of which is spent on paper approval, so I believe that phase 1 of the proposal, which includes communicating the need for the course, negotiating with Emurgo, writing syllabuses, and applying teaching done in fund 9, is reasonable and achievable. Following that, the second phase will apply to implement the program in fund 10 is entirely appropriate. With a thorough work schedule for each month, such as the first: Organize a scientific meeting, and negotiate and collaborate with Emurgo to establish collaboration agreements Set knowledge and competence criteria for students who successfully complete the blockchain segment. In the second month, the comprehensive overview of the syllabus for the Basic and Advanced courses will be written (in 50 hours), with the accompanying work assigned to the relevant members of their assignments. The planned work plan for the fourth month focuses on the construction of course materials and the collection of feedback from professionals with expertise evaluating the content of learning materials. Revise the curriculum. The proposal's final month will execute the program's application to teaching at the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Transport. Following this period, the proposal team will receive curriculum feedback from students in order to revise, amend, augment, and complete learning materials. Following the implementation results, the proposed team will implement further proposals at phase 2 in Fund 10. This is the proposed stage for implementing learning materials in other universities' teaching. The notion of hosting application development contests on the Cardano Blockchain platform, as well as students studying science and writing graduate thesis on topics implemented on the Cardano Blockchain, will motivate students and developers to demonstrate their abilities. This is a fantastic concept. When the students have finished the course, the proposal will work with businesses to train human resources to create applications on the blockchain platform. The proposal has yet to give details on the status of the specific project. In terms of budget, the proposal is valued $46120, wich is less than 5% of the challenge. This budget meets the challenge's budget requirements. The budget expenditure strategy in the proposal makes sense to me. However, because the proposal lacks an additional strategy, I recommend that the proposed team establish a redundancy cost of 7-10% of the project cost, as specified in the impact section. The proposal has 9 members, each with particular work assignments that correspond to their experience with their jobs. Members' information is obvious and can be verified by platforms like Linkedin, Email, and Facebook. Nguyen Anh Tien, the project's leader, is an active member of the Cardano community in Vietnam. He worked on 18 additional Catalyst projects and successfully coordinated the Catalyst 4 Student Vietnam Event initiative. This would be a fantastic starting point for him and his team to finish this proposal. This section's main point is number 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes realistic measuring indicators, such as the proposal's teaching program, which may be expanded to at least three universities. At the conclusion of the proposed group course, Blockchain human resources will be available to enterprises. The team will post this result on the cardano2vn.io website. Personally, I would add a statistic to this proposal: build a group of trained students and developers who are actively involved in developing and creating apps and solutions throughout Cardano's ecosystem soon after the course ends. This will allow developers to put their newly acquired knowledge to use while also enriching the Cardano ecosystem. The proposed team established a target of implementing teaching materials for at least three universities in the first five months of educating 50 developers on the Cardano Blockchain. Every year, 300 blockchain developers can be provided. This is a feasible and simple decision. The achievements offered by the proposal are consistent with the Challenge. Unfortunately, because this is a fresh concept with no test product, the transparency of the proposal is undermined. However, the proposal has generated strong and verifiable ideas in general, thus the total score for this part is 4.

And the team came up with a way to solve this problem by actively collaborating with Emurgo to create two blockchain-related learning programs for students. This is a very good proposal and very useful for university students. I fully support it. In general, the proposal has solved the goal set out in the Challenge. Not only is it beneficial for university students in Vietnam, but it also indirectly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. This is important. Because it's the foundation to scale and tackle the challenge of the future. With young human resources - students, they will be the owners of the country and the future developers of blockchain. So, the impact of this proposal has been confirmed to be very clear in the present and has great potential for development in the future. On the other hand, I very much hope that the team's cooperation with Emurgo (this is an organization that is too famous in the world) will become a reality and consider this a step forward of the proposals from Vietnam in the cooperation between the two countries with foreign organizations.

Specifically, for the team to clearly state the name and professional experience of each member, accompanied by documents about links to social networking sites to publicize their identities. The disclosure of identity is very important to further affirm the community's trust in the team. That, further increases the feasibility of the proposal. I appreciate the team doing this well. My other opinion is that the budget is broken down by items - reasonable for the goal. Through this, the community and PAs will see whether the proposal is feasible or not. To me, the proposal is highly feasible because the team has shown the reasonableness and ability to balance finances in the items (with funding for funding). Another factor to confirm the feasibility of the proposal is that you have clearly stated your plan and how it will be implemented. However, I have a question for the team: I know that the team is also working on another proposal at Fund 9 called \"Cardano developer club in Uni\", if so will the resources be needed to make it happen? do both proposals side-by-side (I mean the number of implementers - human resources)? I think you should have a more specific explanation for this question to increase the feasibility. If your explanation is reasonable, the community will fully recognize and believe that the proposal can be implemented. On the technical and technological edge, how does the planned curriculum keep pace with the evolving technologies in the Cardano ecosystem? Do we have to completely depend on Emurgo for this? That is, if you do not cooperate with Emurgo, what other options do you have to teach students? Where will the sources of knowledge be supplemented by you? In addition, I have input to make the feasibility more fully demonstrated. Is it that the team that can further analyze the curriculum will favor the fundamental aspects or the technical aspects (Plutus programming, Marlowe)? Regarding the risks and challenges, I fully agree because the team stated that Emurgo may not agree to cooperate. But in return, the team came up with a convincing plan to mobilize cooperation from Emurgo. I would like to contribute a few thoughts about another risk, is the team think that the curriculum teaches elements related to the blockchain (technical elements, programming languages, smart contracts...) Is it difficult for the students and will there be few students involved? Will the leaders of universities and government agencies fully agree to let the team open a class to teach about the Cardano blockchain? You can refer to my opinion just above about the risk. I just want to contribute to making the proposal even more complete (especially in terms of feasibility). However, as a PA, I am confident to affirm that the team is capable of solving the challenges and putting this proposal into practice soon (provided, of course, that you get funding approval from Catalyst).\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I rate the presentation of the roadmap and milestones as what you do best in this proposal.

I visited the Cardano2vn.io website for more transparency verification and found it to be a pretty well-built site, packed with Cardano knowledge, Catalyst educational in nature. I think one of the steps to prepare for the cooperation with Emurgo is, can the team develop the Cardano2vn.io web into a larger scale web to internationalize it? To cooperate with a world-class technology organization like Emurgo, we must have adequate and commensurate preparation (prepared a lot in terms of people and knowledge). . I very much look forward to this cooperation becoming a reality. And I believe that if the team working with Emurgo is as clear and standard as what you wrote in the proposal (from posing the problem, description, planning, how to do it, and attached solution... ) then it is possible to cooperate with Emurgo.
