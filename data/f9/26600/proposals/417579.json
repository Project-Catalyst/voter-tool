Its aim to recast the \"story\" that is often told about Africa aligns well with the Challenge goals; and I like that the proposer is taking a wide-ranging apporoach, and covering not only the need for individual support for individual entrepreneurs, but also looking at the wider regulatory and governmental framework. The proposal is clearly aiming to address some very significant and impactful issues - the need of entrepreneurs to know that their ideas have value and can be protected by intellectual property rights, and their need for access to training, capacity-building, and support - but I am a little unconvinced by the proposal's focus on supporting \"young\" entrepreneurs only. First, it's not clear what \"young\" means, or what the age cut-off is - and second, it's not clear if the team would actually exclude a promising entrepreneur who happened to be older than whatever age limit they had set? If they would, it's hard not to see that as deliberately choosing to limit the proposal's potential impact. Ageism doesn't mesh well with the proposers' explanation of the barriers faced by African entrepreneurs - after all, since would-be entrepreneurs in Africa are facing all the barriers described so well in the proposal, it's not surprising if, as a consequence of these barriers, some of them are unable to attempt to pursue their dream until they are no longer young. Another problem in this Impact section is in the fact that the proposal's risk assessment is missing (it reads \"See measuring systems section\", but there is no such section in the proposal). I feel that particularly for such a multi-faceted, high-budget proposal, we do need to see a risk assessment to properly evaluate impact. So although I agree that the project, if it was delivered as planned, would clearly have some degree of positive impact, I think there are some concerns.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There are some issues with the feasibility of the project. First, there's the question of the unnamed, celebrity \"award-winning Senegalese singer-songwriter, farmer, educator and activist\" who will spearhead it. From the description given of his career, it seems likely that it is Baaba Maal - if so, his involvement would certainly draw attention, and contribute a lot to the success of the project; but the difficulty is that we don't know for sure that is *is* him; and if it is, we don't know how far negotiations have progressed to secure his definite involvement. I can, of course, see reasons why his name might need to be confidential at this point - but this makes some aspects of feasibility hard to assess, because a significant part of the proposal rests on promoting and showcasing the project via a large-scale event featuring this celebrity's name. Even if he can't be identified as such in the proposal, I would like to see some information about what the situation is - has he merely been thought of as someone to approach, or has he been approached, or has there been some expression of interest or even agreement in principle? And crucially, what is the plan for what happens if he is not on board after all? There is a similar issue with the launch of the project being \"in conjunction with a globally-known brand content release\". If these elements are not in place and could possibly fall through, it could badly damage the level of publicity and interest that the project will generate. This relates back to the issue in \"Impact\" of the lack of a risk assessment. Another feasibility issue is that no budget breakdown at all is given - the use of \"TBD\" suggests this is probably an oversight and the proposer meant to include it, but it's a pretty big oversight for such a high-budget proposal, and does not give me confidence in the proposer's project management skills, attention to detail, or level of commitment to Project Catalyst. There is a large and varied project team, which is very positive - but none of them mention having any knowledge of or interest in Cardano. This is not necessarily a problem in itself, as the project aims to use \"vetted members of the Cardano community\" to deliver training - but it is rather unclear what this means. How will they be selected and who will \"vet\" them, if there is nobody on the team who can do so? Generally, I feel a project whose main  focus is \"seeding and growing Cardano in Africa\" should have at least one team member who has some links with or interest in Cardano - the fact that nobody on the team has this, raises questions for me on how feasible it is. The time plan is also a little confusing - the project may actually have already begun (the proposal says it started in July) and yet several basics are not yet defined. for example, I can't see anything about how many young entrepreneurs will be selected to take part in the acceleration programme, and who the stakeholders are seems poorly defined for a project that is starting imminently:  \"Partnership development with Senegalese and international collaborators, including domestic and international agencies, non-profit organizations, and other stakeholders\" - I would expect to see one or two possibilities named, even if they are not already in place. Overall, the vagueness and lack of clarity on things that have a strong impact on feasibility (budget, timeplan, who will be doing what) makes me feel that the project is not feasible, or at least, that it faces too many feasibility issues that are not acknowledged and addressed.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer gives a lengthy answer to the question on what they will measure to track their project - but unfortunately, without giving much information about what they actually will measure. There is little here that could enable the community to track the progress of the project, apart from two reports that the proposer will deliver - but it's unclear how and where those will be shared. In general, it's unclear where the proposer will store information about their progress to enable the community to access it; and a lot of the information is fairly vague - for example, the proposer says they will \"implement project management processes\" to \"enable coordination\" but doesn't say what exactly those project management processes will enable us to track. Some of the sections appear to start mid-thought, or even mid sentence, giving the impression that the information has been cut and pasted from some other source, perhaps not a particularly suitable or relevant one. Overall, most of this section is essentially additional description of how the proposer will work, and what they will do, rather than information on how that work can be audited. It seems possible that the proposer may have misunderstood the question a bit, which is unfortunate, but still makes it very diffocult to assess this section positively. The section on \"what does success look like\" is considerably clearer and more focused, and actually very helpful in the way it summarises what the proposer hopes to achieve - but there is still an overall absense of any clear metrics or deliverables we can track, apart from the two reports. On balance, I can only say that as it stands, this proposal is not auditable.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2343", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3463, "q0": "Proposals is really well strucutred, providing an articulated overview on how the mentoring programme in blockchain and De-FI wil work and what its value proposition is for Seneral.

I really appreciate how the phases of it are devidied, helping to understand how the program will work and making it easier to assess its full impact. Mentorship initiatives like these are always imporant, specially considering when they have a local impact. It is so because the program can adapt to the reality of each place and collaborate with existing organizations in the country, as proposed here. Other nice thing here is that the programme will be designed to be scalable to other regions, which can increase its impact in the future. Other good point is that proposer is already considering the development of a proper communication strategy (though some insights on it could be brought here already)\n\nAs for the challenge alignments, it fits well here, addressing several challenge kpis and helping to answer the challenge question of \"How do we continue to seed and grow adoption in 2022 and beyond?\"\n\nIn conclusion, I'll rate as 5 as this is a high potential project and proposal brings most of the imporant information necessary to understand how it will work,", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a very complete plan provided, time-framed, containing activities with a nice level of details and clear deliverbales in each part.

I would like to see this project again in the next Foundation if this proposal is not Funded in this Fund.

They intend to organize events, form partnerships with Senegalese and international collaborators and invest in marketing and branding of Cardano.
