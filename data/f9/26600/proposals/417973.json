The bidder already has a highly rated app on the playstore that instructs users on how to buy Ada and how to delegate in a stake pool. In the case of this proposal, the idea is to translate the content of the entire application into the Sual\u00ed language, so that speakers of that language have easy access to the content, since the language barrier would be broken. This meets the objectives of the challenge in a precise way, because at the same time it will benefit the speakers of Swali, which is a language that I have seen being addressed in several proposals of the African challenge, it will also contribute to the popularization of our blockchain. We need to make an investment in making Cardano's technologies accessible to everyone, as the difference between content in English and other languages \u200b\u200bis blatant, so much so that this issue in itself has already been the subject of a challenge. We also have the fact that most stake pools are created by the European and North American community, since blockchain is more popular in these locations, so this type of investment needs to be taken to other audiences. I believe that, as people from other locations (such as Africa) become more knowledgeable about the processes they say about Cardano, more projects will be created in these communities. In other words, perhaps Swali speakers, when they understand some possibilities that could be made, such as this type of investment, become interested in Cardano's technologies and can become more involved in the community, becoming active members. With this, more digital wallets will be created, more Ada will be delegated, probably the level of participation in Catalyst will increase, maybe we will have more Swali speakers studying about the possibilities of our blockchain and maybe in the future working on different projects and so on. What I'm trying to justify is that, through a gateway (like a Dapp that is focused on the native language), many people can be attracted to our community, which would generate extra income opportunities for them, but at the same time could bring several benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. However, one suggestion I would like to make for this project would be to include a short guide. It could perhaps be in mixed format, that is, containing videos, texts and images; the guide would aim to explain the main concepts of the cryptographic world, such as what is blockchain, cryptocurrency, a pool and etc. This could educate people who have downloaded Dapp out of curiosity but who have no prior knowledge of the subject. In general, there is a lot of confidence that the KPIs of the challenge will be addressed, such as those present in the challenge summary \u201cnumber of new Africa-based Catalyst members (proposers, voters, CAs), number of new African projects seeded in 2022 , number of African developers onboarded in 2022, local impact (measurable through user activity and reach), local partnerships formed (size of institution + influence)\u201d, etc.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is simple to execute, but this does not rule out the need for a more detailed planning of activities. We know that the main job here would be translation. With that, we would need to know how this process would take place. How long would it take for Dapp to be translated, in total? What would the work routine of the professional who would be responsible for this be like? It would be important to know how many hours per week the translator would dedicate to this project and how this activity would happen in practice. Another script issue that could have been included would be the translator selection process - it is not clear if the proponent already has a professional in mind or if this one would still be called to participate in the project. If you are still hired, how would the selection process take place? Another activity that I think could be part of this project would be to include a marketing plan: how would the translated Dapp reach the knowledge of Swali speakers? Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which is the budgetary part, the amount requested is quite low compared to other Catalyst proposals, but it would still be important for it to be better explained, to justify how the money would be used. $2,000 is requested for translation and $400 for development. What would the developer's job be here? How many hours would the translator work so that we would know the value of his working hour? It would be interesting if we had a better understanding, the value above can be fair or very high, depending on the amount of content that would have to be worked on here. And finally, talking about the team, unfortunately there is not much confidence in this part, again due to the lack of detail. We don't know who the bidder is, exactly. This app is said to already have several translations - into which languages? Did the translations work, that is, was a new audience added based on breaking down language barriers? The proponent claims that he has 10 years of experience with application development, so it would be nice if he had exemplified some of his previous work, so that more confidence was conveyed overall. The main thing here, however, would be that the translator was already selected and that he/she demonstrates practical experience with translating the language in question, also exemplifying some projects in which he has previously been involved. Unfortunately, this topic is not very suitable and needs some improvement.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is not good, unfortunately. We have no means of auditing the suggested progress. It would be necessary for the proponent to define a more detailed roadmap, a schedule of activities that could be monitored. For example, in week 1, the translation could start (it is not stated how long this would take, but let's say in two weeks it would be ready). From week 3 onwards, the translated Dapp would be disseminated to the target audience, etc. In other words, a script that would give us a better understanding of what would be done, when and how, both in terms of the translation itself and in the activities surrounding the main one. As this part of the proposal is presented to us, we have no tangible material to audit; the proponent also does not demonstrate that it will maintain contact with the Cardano community during the process, which would also be necessary. Talking now about the ultimate success, this is defined by \u201cThousands of Swahili-speaking users in Africa will download and use the app, learn how to stake their Cardano, and buy and delegate Ada to a community participation pool\u201d. For sure our main goal is this, that as many people as possible were downloading Dapp and delegating Ada from it. But how could we measure the consequences of this for Cardano? Could it be that, in addition to the increase in Ada investors, new active members have been added to the community? Have Swali speakers, in addition to the delegation, become involved with Cardano in other ways (for example, are they participating in Catalyst as CAs, vCAs or proponents\u2026?). How can we substantiate the more general benefits that Dapp was responsible for for the African population? Quantitative and qualitative data should be studied, in my view; and these should be brought to the attention of the Cardano community in a very direct way, for example, the proponent could prepare a final report of this project that would indicate what were the advantages presented to Cardano from the translation of his Dapp and in what way the African speakers of that language have benefited beyond the direct use of Dapp. So, unfortunately I will give it 2 stars, I believe it is necessary for the proposer to pay more attention to this part of the proposal, attaching more detail and making it safer to monitor.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 8, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1781, "q0": "This proposal offers to translate into Swahili an existing web-app named \u201cPool Peek Mobile\u201d.

It is also interesting to note that with the expansion of other Cardano services on the continent, the use of this application tends to become even greater, as more people will hold crypto assets and will look for a way to allocate them. With this, we have a positive impact in the medium and long term for the ecosystem with the success of this proposal. Furthermore, we realized that the task to be performed is not so complex, but in the same way a very large amount is not being requested. All these factors, along with the fact that the app already exists, make us believe in the project's impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the project, we found succinct and direct explanations, which seems perfectly consistent with the purposes of the proposal. In fact, if funding does occur, there don't seem to be many risks that need to be mitigated for everything to flow correctly in the translation process. However, it is worth mentioning that some points could be better detailed. For example, the use of a professional service was mentioned for the translation to be carried out, but it would be nice to know specifically what this service will be and what its average cost will be, even to be able to relate this to the amount of $2,000 being requested for translation costs. . The amount being asked for the development seems quite fair, and as the professional mentioned in the proposal has extensive experience in mobile development, we believe that there will be no problems in this action. Another positive factor is that the application in question has already been launched and used by several users (and even translated into other languages), which leads us to believe in the feasibility of this project. But there is the observation that it would be interesting to have some amount dedicated to the marketing of the application. After all, although it is already ready and functional, with the translation a new audience will be reached, and it also seems important that the application is simultaneously introduced to this new group.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The perception of success that was conveyed is quite consistent with what the project proposes to deliver. However, regarding the metrics chosen to understand the development of the project, we see that the exposed idea makes sense, but does not provide points that better describe the evolution of the proposal. In fact, the launch of the translated application is a good parameter, but it would be interesting to observe additional factors such as the number of users who started using the application and previously did not because of the language barrier or if there was an increase in the number of pools developed in Africa after translation.

What functions does Pool Peek's App include? How does the team reach out to people who want to staking? What makes users have to download this app to their phone instead of other apps on the market today? After the app is translated into Swahili, how can the Swahili users benefit from this app?\nWhen I download the app to my phone to experience. I have a few feelings such as:\n- App is quite slow when I select features.\n- I really don't know how to use the app and still don't understand the purpose of the app to help users.\n- Pool Map features and filter pool by criteria are also quite interesting.\n- One thing that is unusual is that no matter how I choose the parameters of the pools, the first pool that the app recommends is always the pool of Pool Peek developers. Is this fair when the developer team always directs users to stake into their pool?\n- In the staking basics section in the app (instructions for staking users), the instructions are all text, so it is difficult for someone who doesn't know anything about staking to follow and stake into the pools.\n\nSuggestions:\n- The team should come up with marketing plans for the app after the app is translated into Swahili to reach out to Swahili users. Only in this way can it make an impact on the Swahili user community.\n- In the solution part of the proposal, I think the team should explain more clearly what are the benefits of users when using the app. What is only in the Pool Peek app that can help users that other apps or websites can hardly do (Unique points)\n- Instead of deploying an app that needs to be downloaded to the phone, I think the team should make a website that will have better perfomance and more convenience for users. Because staking is something that doesn't need to be done often. A person usually only staking 1-2 times, so downloading the app to the phone to make 1 staking is not necessary.\n- Teams should eliminate the need to always put the team's pool on the first choice regardless of the user's filter parameters. This is not fair at all.\n- In the staking tutorial, the team should put pictures and videos of staking instructions into the app, it will be easier for users to do staking than reading the text in the app without illustrations.\nHope the team can improve their proposal better with these tips.

These proposals are very similar in their goal and structure. As a result, the assessments for this set of proposals will also be similar]\n\nThe premise of this proposal is pretty simple which is to translate their Cardano Stake Pool app to have Swahili language support. The project is definitely aligned with the challenge setting objective of growing Cardano\u2019s outreach and adoption in East Asia by providing accessibility to users who can understand crypto terminology better in their native language.

After doing a bit of searching on the internet, it has been translated to Korean and French based on the latest update note on App Store. One thing for voter to note is that the proposer\u2019s claim of the app having a 4.5 average rating on Play Store and App Store while true, only has 21 reviews on Play Store and 3 reviews on App Store.\n\nEven if as the proposer stated that the proposal is easily achievable since they have already translated the app into several languages, I still think that they should\u2019ve provided some kind of timeline even as simple as a start and end date since it will allow us to evaluate the project better and it can act as an auditing tool to track the project\u2019s progress/completion.\n\nThe budget has been divided into identifiable items, such as the translation fee and the development cost. I personally would have liked if the proposer included the breakdown for this cost. For example the translation fee can details the number of words or total workhours and the rate requested (can be word count basis or work hours basis) by the hired translation team so that the budget can be evaluated better.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I think the proposer should\u2019ve added KPIs to measure the project\u2019s success regarding how many Swahili speaking users downloading the app, this was mentioned briefly but the proposer did not explain how the downloads from that specific demographic can be tracked and reported. Additionally, the project\u2019s progress is hard to audit since while the update note can be easily seen via App Store or Play Store, the proposer didn\u2019t mention the set end date for this project and what the target timeframe of implementation is.
