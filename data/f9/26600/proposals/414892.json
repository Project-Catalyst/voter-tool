This issue has a lot to do with the goal set in the Challenge. Because the Cardano blockchain has an extremely important role in solving the problems of Africa - the continent is being considered underdeveloped. I highly expect when this issue is resolved it will contribute to an increase in value in the Cardano (direct impact) ecosystem. And an equally good thing is to contribute to the growth of the country's economy (create an economic benefit when selling NFT - and use the proceeds to benefit society: return the artifacts) stolen, building local museums). The application of information technology, specifically the Cardano blockchain, is considered by me to be a breakthrough for the development of the country, provided, of course, that it is applied and implemented well in the present and future. From there, it is possible to scale up and solve the challenge. I find this proposal very interesting and undeniably the impact it will have on Africa and the Cardano ecosystem. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When I read the proposal I saw the number of team members, and they are all experienced, even experts in the fields they are in charge of. These members made several other suggestions before writing this one. It is believable the feasibility of the proposal with such people. What I am very pleased with is that all members reveal their identities through social networking sites so that readers can easily follow and learn. With such data, I have no doubts about the team. However, we need to take a closer look at the budget the team asks for funding. I was convinced by the very detailed and item-specific budget breakdown. This shows that the team works professionally. I have a question, as you build your budget items, do you consider the current workforce landscape, do you take into account the potential for widespread adoption of NFTs? Because I want to know that the proposal must be implemented immediately if funded, without delay (in the current team some members have already made other proposals). Will the implementation of other such proposals have any impact on the progress of this proposal? My last question was related to the resources required for implementation. I'm afraid when a member executes another proposal in parallel with this one, resources will be scattered. Can you please answer this question of mine? I found the plan and implementation method presented very well by the team. The team had a good approach to technology when it came to planning and caught up with the technical side of making NFTs. So the community knows the purpose of creating NFTs, next can you tell how many NFTs are intended to be created in three main areas: culture, history & gaming? On the other hand, I strongly agree that you save the risk in this proposal as marketing. What other potential risks are there? I would like to present my opinion on another risk that I think needs to be clarified, which is the permission of your local government to apply new technology to create NFT. And when NFT is created, is NFT allowed to become a commodity to sell for money to benefit society (does the government allow this)? I ask this question because I understand that not every country in Africa allows the Cardano blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem to grow freely.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Propose with reasonable concrete roadmaps and milestones. The team has divided into 5 phases with modules for direct application and implementation of the proposal. I was impressed with the technical aspects of the technology and the language used in the proposal. Glad the team did this well to demonstrate some transparency and auditing. But unfortunately, I don't see KPIs. I think this compromises transparency and makes it difficult for the community who wants to audit this proposal. My advice is to add digital KPIs and key metrics as soon as possible. If these two factors are added, the team's proposal will be confirmed by the community to be auditable and transparent. In return, in the presentation, the team clearly described the problem and clearly stated the solutions to implement. I am convinced by this. I have read the 3 factors you mentioned to measure the success of the project. It seems to have great stature after this project is successfully implemented. I think it takes a lot of time and effort from the team to achieve that. In short, besides what the team has done, I need you to complete the audit through KPI - key metrics.

I find you guys extremely detailed, you guys gave a specific example Le Louvre in France is a classic example of one of those museums that has stripped Africa of its valuable ancestral artwork and until now refuses to start a reparation conversation. Belgium, Germany and many other countries are no different. Here is Mwazulu Diyabanza at the African Museum Berg en Dal in Holland teaching about a stolen symbol of peace from the Lemba school of life in the Congo. You can analyze the general situation of the problem and come up with thorough solutions. However, my suggestion is that you should have English subtitles in your videos so that people in other countries can understand because many people do not understand your language. You can evaluate three aspects clearly: Culture, history, gaming.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Your FEASIBILITY did a great job. You have a detailed plan in stages.

Some NFTs will be linked to stolen artefacts, while others will be created by lesser-known African artists. \nAt first, I was not convinced that there is a need for a marketplace dedicated to this and that the NFTs could be minted on demand and resold on already existing marketplaces - like jpg.store, for instance. However, since the team intends to scan objects to be used by game designers or any other artist/collector/creator, it would make sense to have a dedicated platform built with that purpose in mind. Sort of like the Megascans project, but dedicated to only African artefacts and objects https://quixel.com/megascans/ \nWhat I would like to advise the team, is that my feeling after reading the proposal is that they have too many goals they want to achieve with this proposal, and even only one of those would have been sufficient. Creating a marketplace, several NFT projects, scanning artefacts, and bringing artefacts back to Africa, all of these could constitute several proposals. Considering the low amount they have requested, they have strapped themselves to a lot of work. But since I am familiar with the team, I know that they have the energy and passion to fulfil those goals.\nGiven all the information provided, I can see the potential impact this proposal can have on the Cardano ecosystem and how it fits the challenge of \u201cGrow Africa, Grow Cardano\u201d very well. In conclusion, I will rate this section a 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan provided is very descriptive and detailed. They have split the tasks into 5 phases, covering a span of 24 months. Given the scope of the project, I can perfectly understand the long period of time. Probably some of the tasks can be run in parallel, but still, the amount of work to be done is very large.\nThe budget of $44000 is detailed per job/task, yet it would have been helpful to have a detailed amount of hours covering each task. As mentioned in the impact section, I find the budget to be on the low side. Creating a marketplace is not an easy task, I am familiar with the rates for development, and even though the developers are from Africa, where the wages are lower than in most Western countries,  I find they should calculate their work a bit closer to what the rest of the community is charging.\nBut the team working on this project is well known and respected throughout the Catalyst community and seeing their skills and previous work, I am confident that they will be implementing the project successfully.\nAs such, I will rate this section a 4, because I do not agree entirely with how the budget has been drafted and calculated.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The metrics for the project's progress are very detailed. They are grouped in 4 sections: Research completion, Secure partnerships, Design and Adoption and each section has its own several sub-metrics to be verified. \nWhat I would have found important to have in this section, is the mention of a place where the community will be able to independently verify these metrics.\nThe success question is the most general and brief section of the entire proposal. Given the details provided so far, I was a bit surprised at the lack of any quantifiable amounts presented here. For example, how many artefacts have been successfully scanned in the first 6-12 months would have been a clear, quantifiable metric.\nI will score this section a 4 since I think some of the missing details would have been important to the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Build an\u00a0NFArt marketplace where artwork can be monetized and a portion of the proceeds will go towards organisations fighting to return stolen artifacts, but ultimately towards building local museums", "experience": "Already started work last year in Preserving Culture and DID/SSI paradigm: See also related proposal SSI through African Ancestral lenses.  that has resulted in securing key partners:\n\nLocal authors and cultural experts\nPanafrican Ufulu Library\nKimuntu: Ecole Initiatique Solaire\n"}
