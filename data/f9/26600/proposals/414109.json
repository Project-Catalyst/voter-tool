The main goal is to make information easily digestible for the audience, since usually this kind of information, about blockchain in general, is limited to YouTube explanatory videos, podcasts, texts, and other media like this. The objective would be achieved through the incorporation of Cardano and Catalyst terms and explanations in the storyline of the TV show, which would have elements of Sci-Fi and magical realism. This way, people would learn the concepts in a more entertaining way in comparison to other media. Also, the story would have NFT elements that would allow the audience to interact with the series via a second screen, which would already be an element adding Cardano to people\u2019s lives. The series would focus the African audience, although it\u2019s not explicit in the proposal what would be the series\u2019 language. It is mentioned though that the marketing would be done in both French and Kiswahili (a local language), so I\u2019m assuming it would be recorded in one of them and maybe translated of dubbed to the other. Most of the series are actually recorded in English, and having one in a different language, that\u2019s focusing Africa, is good for inclusivity for non-English speakers. This way, the proposal is aligned with the challenge and with the challenge KPIs of increasing the number of Africa-based user onboarded to Cardano and to Catalyst. This proposal does not aim to fund the whole series, but just a concept trailer and everything that\u2019s required to make it happen, like a series mood board, character descriptions, logline, besides season 1 outline and season 2 arc. Therefore, the quired budget of approximately $28k would be used only for this first stage, and the plan is to sell the TV series to Netflix or a similar platform, or to find investors. The impact of the proposal is therefore related to a next step that would be done after the proposal is concluded. If only the trailer is delivered, the impact would be much smaller. Because of this, there\u2019s the risk of not finding investors after launching the concept trailer, and this risk was not mapped by the proposer, what makes sense since it\u2019s not related to the proposal itself but with the after work, but it influences the impact of the proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The plan presented by the team is very solid. It has been divided in sub-steps, each one focusing on a specific part of the execution, divided in months and with a clear deliverable for each step. It is not mentioned the total time, in hours, required to execute each part of the proposal, but the timeline seems realistic and reasonable for me, with expectation of producing the trailer in 1 month (at least that what is seems based on the information provided, maybe they will start filming when the proposal gets funded, but we cannot be sure). The budget seems appropriate for most tasks, and as mentioned in the proposal, the budget for marketing is quite considerable, but that\u2019s reasonable given the nature of the proposal, since they are looking for investors. One thing that\u2019s missing in the overall budget is the budget allocated to the actors that are going to participate on the trailer. In fact, it is not mentioned if this will be a series with real actors or an animation. But in case it\u2019s an animation, there\u2019s no budget for animation as well, so it looks like this is missing in the proposal. The risks mentioned in the execution of the proposal seems to be well covered by the team, and they have anticipated some of the things that could cause this proposal to be a failure. Regarding the team behind the proposal, they seem to be experienced in the field, since there are producers, directors, writers, editors, and social media specialists in the team. Most of them have provided links to their bios, websites and/or IMBD pages and they all can be verified. The team seems to be very capable of delivering the proposal. But something that I missed again is information about how the concept trailer would be in practice since there\u2019s no mention about actors or animators in the team as well. One good thig is that the team is not involved with proposals from previous funds, but they are submitting other proposals this fund. And since they are looking for external funding, they don\u2019t plan to apply again for Catalyst.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposing team included KPIs to measure both progress and success of the proposal. I believe they mixed up the concepts of both KPIs, but considering all the information provided in both sections, plus the information provided in the roadmap, I believe it\u2019s possible for the community to track the progress and to measure the success of this proposal. The roadmap of the proposal is clear, and it has clear deliverables for all steps and almost all months of the execution, and those could be used to track the progress of the proposal. The KPIs indicated for measuring progress are actually measure of success, and the first 4 of success metrics (Completed series treatment, completed mood board, completed concept trailer and Comments on concept trailer video) are actually measures of progress. I believe there is enough information in the proposal overall to enable the community to keep track of everything that\u2019s being done. The auditability of this proposal is very good.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2110", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 2, "ng": 6, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact:  There is nothing written that states or suggests the proposal's impact doesn't meet the required criteria or lacks in any manner.\nFeasibility:   The PA makes a lot of assumptions, and then states that the budget is lacking because it doesn't meet their assumptions about the creative direction taken by the team, which shouldn't be taken into account when rating the proposal."}, {"id": 2053, "q0": "According to the author, there is a lack of engaging and entertaining media projects to educate African audiences about Web3, Cardano, and Project Catalyst. And his solution is awo.AI which is a Cardano TV series that entertains African audiences while educating them about blockchain and Project Catalyst. Unfortunately, his link to awo.AI is not accessible to me but based on the description I can imagine what he wants to accomplish in this project. What he's going to do in this proposal is to provide educational entertainment, with audiences learning about Project Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem along with characters from a series. By building a dramatic series that combines elements of Science Fiction and magical realism. Its plot revolves around the Cardano ecosystem and will include the creation of NFTs. I like this idea and think it fits the goals of the challenge. Film education is also a way to engage the community interested in Cardano, just needs an interesting and engaging script, capable of bringing the audience to the story and their main goal is to understand them. We should care about the Cardano ecosystem. Besides providing the content of the story, the proposal also provides additional marketing plans, increasing our conviction of the success of the project. Through social media strategies, we know this proposal will reach out to social media in French, English, and Kiswahili, which will widen the reach of the community, helping more who know more about the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Starting from the roadmap, the proposal provides a 9-month roadmap and we know what tasks will be done. Each of these stages has a list of tasks so that it can be understood quite clearly what will happen and in what order, besides, at the end of each stage, the proposal also gives the deliverables. what. Next is the budget, I think this part is just satisfactory, we know how the total amount will be divided into parts and each of these is detailed on average. The proposal asks for a total of $28,675 and splits it into costs such as Batch Processing, Moodboard, Concept Trailers, Administration, Social Media... In each of these categories, the budget The book is also broken down, however, I think it can explain even better. For example, in \"Leading Social Media Marketing: $6,000\" How would you market? How long will it take, and how much will it cost to implement it? Similar to the cost for social networks in French and Kiswahili why need $3000, what are you going to advertise for social networking sites? It will be even better if you can provide links to such sites so that the community can evaluate the quality of these sites. How many followers, how many interactions, and how many people may be interested in the project through the social sites you provide.\nAnd finally, about the project team, we know the team consists of 6 members along with a small description of their background. They are Shirah Dedman (producer), Mildred Achoch (writer), Oluwapelumi Dada (Cultural Consultant), Anthony Capitan (Story Editor), Natasha Younge (Social Media Lead), and Kristin Layne Tucker (Advisor). In general, we know each member's role as well as their current experience and field. In my opinion, they are perfectly suitable and qualified to carry out this project, however, it would be perfect if they all have their profile linked to their profile (in this proposal there are only a few). members are provided) so that we can better understand them. Overall, I think the feasibility is pretty good, I would suggest adding more details about the budget and the team needing to have a link profile with all members, not because it's not good but because it could be more perfect.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of the project, the proponent provides several KPIs that are relevant for us to understand whether the project is achieving the desired results. Such as \"Social Followers Count, Discord Engagement Count, Project Catalyst Referral Count, Polls Show People Become Ad Owners\". However, I think this section is incomplete because it does not provide a way in which the community can monitor the process behind it. How can we track their work processes? These KPIs can be checked continuously by the Cardano community. Are updates posted on any websites? Any social networks? And finally, the group's perception of success is also clearly defined. The team identified 6 successes. Each success is very clearly described as stated in the proposal and has specific results to be achieved. With that said, I see this proposal as having good potential, so it would be interesting if you could provide additional ways in which the community can monitor the progress of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 6, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasibility:  The proposal links to website which verify team members' credentials. In the entertainment industry IMDB profiles have much more credibility, which is why there are links to IMBD profiles in lieu of LinkedIn. After stating that they find the budget reasonable, the PA states the budget for producers, editors, directors, etc., should be equally divided equally among everyone. This response doesn't align with assessment guidelines, and it also is strange to state a budget should be equally divided among roles instead of the work done. The roadmap is clear on the length of the project's social media campaign. Asking about what specific content goes beyond assessment criteria, but it also doesn't make sense: posts about the project in order to build the community, which is stated in the proposal.\nAuditability:  The proposal makes it clear that the metrics and completion will be able to be followed by going to the project's website, Discord server, Twitter and Instagram."}, {"id": 4028, "q0": "This is a strong proposal, a creative solution to the problem of the lack of engagement of the African people in the Cardano environment. Often times discussions about web3, defi and cryptocurrencies diverge to very technical issues which makes the interest of the average person go away. One of the goals of the campaign is try to overcome this in order to make more Africans adopt Cardano and everything its environment has to offer. The proposal is very clear in the way they intend to do it, through a strong marketing campaign they want to let everyone aware of their tv series which in turn will educate about topics in blockchain and the catalyst project. The metrics chosen strongly aligns with the challenge. They are all directly or indirectly related to the number of people engaged whether in the Cardano environment or the catalyst community itself. Moreover, it has a great potential to scale as when a tv series is picked up from the general public is spreads very quickly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal clearly describes the relevant experiences of the team. LinkedIn and IMDB pages are provided for all the members. The budget is broken down into identifiable items and they all have been fairly priced. The total amount of USD 28,675 seems reasonable for what they will produce. Also, the timetable provided sounds pretty achievable, they will have enough time to implement each stage of the project. The team has also added a deliverable for each step of the plan which enhances transparence and reinforces the feasibility. Finally, the proposers have also discussed the risks to a successful implementation and have provided mitigating factor for each of them. It is virtually impossible to state any of the risks won't impact the project but the fact they have already prepared themselves for the risks already make them less likely to negatively affect the plan. For example, for the risk of their content be deemed boring by the public they have selected a professional storytelling team which significantly decreases the chances of that happening.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A clear roadmap with precise milestones was traced by the team. Also, they have provided deliverables for each stage which improves the auditability of the proposal. The metrics defined are objective, easy to measure and translate very well the progress of the plan. Number of social media followers, people engaged in discord and project catalyst referrals, for example, translate if the plan has succeeded in what the campaign is all about, which is to grow Cardano in the African continent. The team was able to provide a clear and creative solution to disseminate content about web3, blockchain, NFT and defi which helps address the problem of the challenge. Finally, they could have let a bit clearer where they are intending to release those links mentioned. The relevant link 1 https://awo.ai was not working when I tried to access it (even though they never mentioned the links would be posted there) but even if that's the place where they planned to post the links they should also post on some social media and leave that clear for the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Auditability:  Since the proposal is about funding the development process, the website currently  takes you to an InDesign presentation of the proposal, and I just double-checked that it's still working/active.

However, as society evolves, many individuals, particularly a large portion of today's youth, may no longer find pure educational approaches appropriate. Additionally, a cutting-edge approach to teaching is required for a new world like Cardano and Catalyst to draw in more users.

That's awo.AI\".\nThis TV show not only extends the audience for blockchain users but also provides a novel method of knowledge dissemination.
