Seniors are left out although they have the brainpower and free time to ideate and develop projects to improve the communities they live in", "f6_no_assessments": 20, "f6_rating": 4.65, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 11602, "q0": "The proposer and his team has done a very wonderful job by placing this very proposal in this right challenge, I therefore say that this proposal would effectively address the challenge and have the potential of bridging the gap between all classes of people and ages of people.  I think this has the potential of bringing value to the cardano ecosystem and the project catalyst itself. If we say that we want to make Africa the hub of cardano ecosystem then I think this is one of the right proposal for us to pay our attention and commit our resources into making it a success. The senior professionals are also Africans who are retired of their jobs and a lot of them are wallowing in poverty just as the youths are also struggling for employment. This project brings to bear the need to look at the fundamentals that would promote Africa from being a cardano adoption leader rather than the perpetual follower we have seen in the past. The proposer and his team deserve  a sound applause because this project has got what it takes to include the long-forgotten people with experience.\n\nIt is always said that they are retired but not tired they are left alone to while away time with their experience and so this project having identified this quality materials and source of experience which I think if sorted would add value two cardano ecosystem and project catalyst is the swift steps to assist these people. Though a lot of them are not ICT inclined and may not want to get themselves involved in this modern-day specially the threat of cyber crime and blackmailing of people, but it's not too late with the experience of the proposer and his team in person meetings meetups and explanations of the work of project catalyst, cardano,ecosystem and wada will be good tools to use to convince them.\nTo add to these, with the untapped but experience knowledge available for Africa I think if a good look is taking at this proposal it will bring the needed results to the African Community and from the Communities where these senior professionals are going to be picked and taking through lessons to become conversant with the cardano ecosystem and project catalyst. I am optimistic that this project if funded will see the light of the day and which is going to bring out one of the best results expecting and yet may not be found yet. Experience they always say is the best teacher and I want to believe that the vast experience of these senior professionals would add flesh and wisdom to project catalyst and cardano ecosystem if these projects is funded.\n\nPerusing through this proposal Project I have realised that a good number of fine brains are being left at the mercy of retirement in the name of attaining a certain number of age, over here in Ghana that is 60 years, which is the right time and without considering the kind of service you can render to your institution or whatever organisation you belongs to the deal is you have to go home and rest. But in some instances most of these senior professionals are engaged and they provide due diligence services to the institutions and organisations where they are engaged and so the coming of this proposal is like a novel and an eye-opener to every African country and to the world at large. These  Amalgamation of senior professionals is going to bring on board diversity of knowledge and experience which would help build a standard Society and community as that which cardano ecosystem and project catalyst is looking for. Teachers, Bankers, Civil servants, Police, Soldiers and other organisations forces of professionals always retire but not tired and I think agreeing with this idea is one of the good and wise choice one may have ever made in the course of the program if funded.\nAccording to this proposal research Ghana's statistical service said the population of people age 60 years and older in Ghana is projected to reach a 2.5 million by 2025 and a whooping 6.3 Million by 2050 this is only in Ghana, imagine combining other African countries what the numbers would look like and so if this used in Ghana as a pilot Project in order to replicate same across the African continent is commendable and I think this project should be funded with immediate effect.\n\nThe proposer and his team with their expertise, expect to implement this project in in a pragmatic way, so they said that they intend to grow a core group of professionals and gradually onboard them into the cardano ecosystem using a series of deliberate interventions is designed purely and purposely for the older generations In order to assist them realise their potentials  and their place in project catalyst and cardano ecosystem.\nThe proposer and his team has ropped in some key metrics by way of monitoring the progress of the work and a number of them include the number of proposals offering solution to infrastructure and education concerns, number of new African Based useer  onbordered onto cardano ecosystem, number of new African-based catalysts members,number of new African projects seeded in 2022, local imparts through user activity reached and partnership formed.\nWith the in-depth knowledge of this proposer and his team concerning the senior professionals I agree with them and I pray they get the needed funding to carry out this project successfully.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the research and the experience of the proposer and the passion and plans put in place to carry this project, there's no doubt that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposer and his team intend to carry this program in phases.\nThis project according to the proposal is expected to last for six months and within the six months a number of activities will be executed. One of such includes a number of preparatory activities need to be undertaken prior to the actual onboarding program and this is estimated that a timeframe of 5 weeks will be required to complete them. The proposer and his team I have brought in a number of ideas as to how they  intend carrying out this program, one of such is the tasks estimated time required. The proposer and his team intend to develop and /or compile a relevant material for the projects, the project is also going to be using a tool for identification and contact with professional bodies to obtain contacts of the retirees, then by contacting retirees via telephone, email, WhatsApp, to provide an initial overview of the project and receipt of feedback. The proposal also intimated the initial project meetings with interested candidates to screen and select core group senior professionals and thereby onboarding them into the cardano ecosystem and project catalyst. According to the proposal there's going to be a bi-week meetings which will be held twice each month except in the month 2 where there will be only one meeting and this is because the preparatory activities will continue into month 2 and only with 3 weeks remaining which may not be prudent overbearing this retired professionals with so many meetings that would bored them.\nOn the area of budget the proposal has presented a detailed budget allocating a sound amount of money to every activity he intend to carry in the cause of the six months and how every bit of the money is going to be spent as spelt out in the budget and at the end of the day it tally with the overall requested budget. The experience of the proposer and his team if funded this proposal  a good work will come out of this project. The details of every individual and organisations, blockchain companies the proposer intend to Work with they have provided their links and details and has made it public in this proposal for easy tracing and reliability purposes.\n\nIn the area of risk it is said that the fear of resistant maybe part of this but none the less the proposal and his team were not going to relent in their effort to mitigating these there by taking serious education campaign to educate this senior retired professionals for a good and successful result to come out of this. Some of the risk alluded to are lack of interest in and/or difficulty in learning to use new technology, the other thing is distrust associated with cryptocurrency and nonetheless technology difficulty and or power outage in the land which are always facing this proposal, But with determination and the passion of the proposer and his team if funded this project will see a brighter light of the day.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has a genuine  plan as to how this projects ought to be audited, some of the ways this program is to be audited is, number of professionals organisations, trade unions contacted, number of senior professionals present at initial project meetings and initial meeting with core group include pictures, output from end of workshop questionnaires completed by participants are also ways of providing sufficient information to audit this projects. The other thing is the number of seniors attending the in-person bi-week meetings will also be obtained and compared over the period to ensure that each candidate is present at every session. The proposer and his team also intimated that post of meetings/workshops, feedback from participants will also be obtained and shared to provide the community with information which is necessary.\nProposal has an elaborated way of simply auditing this project of which I do agree, in conclusion the project also has it that, links to proposals  submitted by participants on ideascale will be shared with the cardano ecosystem and the number of new members obtain for the next round of onboarding will also be shared. All senior professionals who participated will understand to a large extent blockchain technology particularly cardano blockchain and how to use it to solve the problems of their continent, lastly all participating senior professionals between 25-30 \nseniors will have yoroi wallets and be able to use them. With the precise lay down procedures given which are tangibles that you can see I agree that enough and sufficient information has been provided concerning the auditing of this program if funded the results will be mind-boggling.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3260", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 459, "q0": "Though very noble, Cardano at it's current development stage is challenging enough for general public, young developers and minds to understand conceptually let alone seniors.\n\nOnboarding the general public even onto being a PA or vPA is not as straightforward as one would expect. One would expect dangling the possibility of compensation would attract rows of people but the reality is, the general public experience hesitancy due various factors ; from the dominant use of advanced English, the complex processes involved Project Catalyst, the user interface to the topic of blockchain/crypto itself.\n\nThere is indeed potential in tapping into the experienced minds to assess proposals but we are in no shortage of non-technical individuals. As we consistently see this fund round there is a huge disparity of proposals receiving 1 to 5 assessments between non-technical and technical proposals. That itself should be indication we should focus on developing education for developers. And it is only natural that the developers come from a younger demography.\n\nIndeed there are hidden gems, such as Masako Wakamiya, but it is very rare seniors are willing to take time to learn new skills. The time and funds invested would be better of educating the future for as the Challenge Setting mentions, Cardano has stiff competition for adoption in Africa in the form of China the nation.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Seeing that WADA is partially involved in this proposal, given their wealth of experience and local insights, they would most likely be successful in implementing this proposal. Results though I expect to be not as rosy as this proposal proposes. The mental barrier to entry for the general public is high enough, you can see this from the current growth throughout all Project Catalyst and various Town Halls where it has seemingly decreased or had minimum advances. Seniors or advance mentally individuals takes more time to accept new concepts, very rare are they willing to change or add new perspectives in their lives.\n\nThrough a recent public offline workshop that I have held with the intent to educate on Cardano for the general public, those that came are a healthy mix of young professionals in their late 20s and stable individuals in their 40s. What was interesting is those individuals in their 40s has asked for the young generation to step-up and be more active in the blockchain/crypto industry. Of course this is a small sample, but an interesting one to take note.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer have indeed provide almost all the information needed that comprise as a complete proposal but what it is missing is the compelling reason why should there be a focus on elders. Yes, numbers wise they are untapped resources but there is no data or survey that shows that these untapped resources are actually needing this solution. There is a quick mentioning of it in a paragraph but other than, this solution is not supported by data.\n\nWithout the initial database of seniors they would like to onboard it becomes challenging to gauge what is success for this proposal. The proposes mention numbers, but what kind of numbers are we seeking here? What pool are you attempting to persuade? Perhaps some initial ground work by approaching Senior Healthcare Facilities and organizing a survey would do these proposers well in the future.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 12, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12256, "q0": "I strongly agree that this proposal concretely addresses the objectives outlined. I am of the believe that, when retirees which include professionals are given the opportunity to bring their vast experience into the cardano ecosystem, the number of proposals that offer solutions to infrastructure and education concerns in Africa will surely increase as well as the number of Africa - based users which aligns perfectly with the key metrics of this challenge.\n\n\n\n\nThis proposal will provide a greater potential to the cardano ecosystem, since i am of the view that, the education of the older generation in the opportunities of the cardano ecosytem will have a ripple effect on the younger generation. Because they willl rely on the experience and expertise of the older generation to take advantage of this opportunity in the long run.\n\n\nI believe this proposal will provide a greater impact to the cardano ecosytem and provided a win - win scenario for both Africa and the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that this proposal can be successfully implemented without any serious concerns, given the relevant skills and experience of the team members.The combined number of experience(50yrs) in blockchain processes and the fact that some members have been vCAs, the project is in safe hands and can be implemented without any serious concerns.\n\n\nmoreover, given the detailed presentation of the budget for successful implementation of the proposal, provides me with the adequate information to have no doubts about its successful delivery.\n\nTo add to, the timelines provided are surly within realistic and reasonable range ,considering the fact that those involved are the aged or retirees who deserve longer duration in order to grasp the various processes of the education.\n\nThe risk and challenges posed to this project are very relevant , however the strategy proposed by this proposal to use in persons meetings for this category of the population provides a better alternative to mitigate these challenges.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I agree that, the proposal can be evaluated without any challenge, given the clarity of the roadmaps provided which is in alignment with the milestones and time horizons provided, especially when dealing with the older generation. \n\nThere is no vagueness in what the problem is about and thus, the outcomes of the solution can easily be measured.\n\nThe key metrics provided were carefully selected which gives me direct ways for measuring the success of this project and providing a yardstick to measure the impact to the cardano ecosystem keeping in sight the goal for this specific challenge.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3371", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12040, "q0": "I think this proposal is good. The team reaches out to retiring and educated seniors such as teachers, bankers, etc., and encourages them to become a member of the Cardano ecosystem as CA , vCA, or voter. The compilation of documents in many forms such as videos, and documents to make it easy for the seniors. While the authors did not specifically talk about the language used in the document, I think it's highly likely that the local language is meant to make it easier for seniors to access the Cardano ecosystem. Ghana, is a country in West Africa, a country located in the geographical region of the challenge, the project also aims to increase the number of users participating in the Cardano ecosystem, so, I think this project is suitable for the requirements of the challenge. The team also shows that the project is scalable in the future and can be independently and sustainably viable because of the benefits and ways of building a community of project participants.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team gave very detailed explanations on how to access seniors data through reliable data channels. They also suggest how to approach this group of people through two methods that are online and offline. This combination is optimal for increasing focus and understanding in face-to-face sessions and saving time and money in online sessions. The implementation roadmap and budget allocation are very detailed by weeks, days, such breakdown shows that the project implementation can be completed according to each schedule. I am just a little concerned that in the schedule section, contacting the seniors is up to 2 weeks but in the budget estimate is 7 days, I think a more detailed explanation is needed for this difference. The filtering of potential participants by survey questions will be better if the team provides some evaluation criteria such as age, information technology-related qualifications, etc. The team is experienced in Catalyst projects, however, the person connecting to the user data is not very experienced, but I think this is easy to improve.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, on auditability, the proposal details the number of workshops, documents, and people that will participate in the Cardano ecosystem. They are also ready to provide evidence of what they have done so that the community can check and monitor. This shows that the team cares about providing criteria for the community to monitor the progress of the project. Thus, the community can fully track the results of the learning goals set by the timelines given by the group (for example, papers related to the collection of elderly data, the number of seniors participating at the meetings, the number of seniors registering as members of the Cardano ecosystem. It would be greater if the team could provide an estimate of the number of participants in the offline and online sessions).

But yet it is highly unlikely to find the aged especially sitting down and discussing issues of cryptocurrency when they can offer enormous ideas on how best to push the adoption of Cardano in Africa. Most of these aged persons can get more of themselves onboarded on Cardano if they know that most of their years spent idling during pension can actually be their best years ahead.\nThe proposal also captured key important metrics under the campaign brief by mentioning some of the new participants who will come in as users onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups). The first 20-25 retirees will serve as the core members who will go ahead to register more numbers as they scale up.

I think this proposal stands out from the rest of the proposals I have assessed in this challenge so far. Most of the proposals in this challenge are focusing more on the youths but this proposal is rather focusing on seniors(retired professionals). Growing a group of senior professionals who already have expertise from different ventures in life and gradually integrating them into the cardano ecosystem is a smart way of onboarding more Africans into the cardano community and creating the awareness of cardano across Africa ( Ghana to be precised). Most senior professionals in Ghana are retired,yet strong enough to venture into other opportunities and I believe catalyst is the opportunity for them and this will prevent them from being idle,but rather be engaged. I believe after these seniors are trained and onboarded into catalyst ,they will begin to contribute in roles like PAs, VPAs,proposers and others. And by so doing,they are engaging themselves and in return may receive some rewards for participating in these roles which in turn will support their meagre pension salaries. I think this proposal effectively addresses the challenge because at the end of it all,,the success of this project will measure the key metrics of the challenge. Throughout the existence of this project,there will be onboarding of Africans (retired professionals in Ghana) into catalyst ,we will have these seniors write and submit good proposals via ideascale to seek funding to solve problems in their societies,we will also have these seniors opening cardano based wallets and operating them and I believe all these match the metrics of this challenge and are capable of measuring success of the project,I believe these outputs clearly solves the problem in the challenge, therefore cardano will be seeded and grown in Africa (Ghana).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I will start with the experience of the team for this part of the proposal,I believe from the description presented in the proposal,the team is very much experienced in the cardano community and are capable of handling this project and I believe with wada Ghana as part of the team,this project is highly likely to be implemented if funded.

Possible difficulties are taken into account as well as ways to eliminate them, such as a distrust of cryptocurrencies and difficulties for seniors to use modern technology. \n\nTherefore the proposer considers to provide gradual education of Cardano ecosystem in in-person meetings combined with using online communication tools (online meetings and chat groups).

This group of people is the one who has the most experience on this planet, and they are the ones who are the most aware of the actual problems that could not be solved with previous systems. Anyway, it is not an easy task to achieve these goals, since blockchain is still not that user-friendly.

It would also be prudent to rather use retired educationist for this purpose as they are more project and research-focused than other groups of pensioners; Retired CHASS Associations; Takoradi, Technical University Pension Association, Ghana University Pensioners Associations, Ghana Pensioners Association etc. are examples of such pensioner groupings for consideration. Another risk that may be encountered is the death of some of these pensioners immediately or not too long after joining the community and commencing a project. There is the need to scan the history of these pensioners based on well-developed checklists, so as to gather pensioners that although sixty (60) and above and still brainy, have the energy and good health to go through the training and make contributions to Cardano for a longer period.
