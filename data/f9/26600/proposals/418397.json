In fact, there are many projects financed by Catalyst, and it is necessary that a lot of manpower be employed, while many young graduates in Africa (and in the rest of the world, I believe) represent a skilled workforce that is often left behind. unemployed. To mitigate this solution, the Wada group intends to \u201cdevelop and launch an internship program that serves students and recent graduates in Africa. This program will consist of onboarding, training and then connecting them to Catalyst projects.\u201d This idea certainly serves very well the two sides to be explored here: both the benefit of the inhabitants of Africa, giving them opportunities, and the greater strengthening and engagement of our blockchain, since the community of active members will be fostered, will grow and there will be a greater connection between the projects and the well-qualified young people who can work on them. The proponents (the Wada group) still well argue the problem situation through surveys, such as \u201caccording to the African Development Bank, on the continent, 12 million young people seek to enter the labor market each year, while only 3 million formal jobs are created in the same period\u201d and also \u201cin Nigeria alone, there are over 600,000 graduates released each year, with youth unemployment rates among the highest in the world\u201d. We know that the lack of emphasis on entrepreneurship and the creation of attractive CVs are the main problems that lead to this situation, but in reality I believe that the lack of networking is the main cause of this dissonance, and that is exactly what the proposal wants to do. to work. I say it's a theoretically perfect idea because, in practice, some more details could have been provided. I think the main issue here is to understand how the students will be recruited and how the Wada group will select the projects they will work on, how this bridge would be established. It is said that online and face-to-face events would be held on university campuses, and I would like to know more details about this integration program, because this would only represent 1 week of the total project time. How would young students be coerced into participating, how can we make clear to them the opportunities being offered here? It is said that \u201cthe recruitment process will be such that only the most committed students will be accepted into the program\u201d: how would the selection be made, what criteria would be used so that we could actually understand who are the most engaged students? Another statement I would like to comment on is \u201call interns should be familiar with Cardano, set up wallets and transact with Wada using the Cardano blockchain\u201d - how would that familiarization be done? I think that in order for us to understand these processes well, the group could have cited an example of how a student would be introduced to Cardano, how he would be selected and what were the criteria used for him to be chosen, for example. A very positive aspect of this proposal is that, in addition to being developed by the Wada group, which is already very well established in Catalyst, partnerships are also established with other well-established groups, such as \u201cDapp360\u201d. Having said that, I think the proposal is very valuable, just a few points could be more detailed.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script is not presented in an ideal way. The temporal division is very long, that is, the intervals chosen are extensive. It would be more appropriate to have a monthly division of activities, as happens in the first 30 days. It would also be better if each of the activities were explained in a very detailed way, so that we have a more solid understanding of the process. How would the student registration process be carried out? How would training resources be created, actually what resources would these be? How would the marketing campaign be (it would be very important for us to understand this part, as it is crucial for the success of the proposal - the more students and institutions are presented for this initiative, we would have more engaged students who could represent an important workforce for the projects of the Catalyst How would the interviews and evaluations be carried out, what would the process of preparing interns be like? Would partner projects be the only ones to receive these young people, or could other projects also apply? If so, how? would there be feedback from the entire program? From the way the information is passed, we have a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would happen, but without the degree of specificity and understanding of ideas - it would be necessary to go deeper into the past information. Regarding the costs, the amount $42,500 is divided in a very basic way, that is, we know which parts this would be divided into but we don't know much about each of them . For example, instead of delegating 10 thousand dollars for team fees, it would be more interesting if the amount was divided more evenly between project management, coordination, contact with partners, etc.; how much would it go for each? In the same way the other expenses could be better detailed. It's $5,000 for marketing, but we don't know exactly how this campaign would go, how much would go to social media ads and how much to print materials (offline materials); what documentation would be required, and why would that cost $2,000? What would be the incentives that would cost $3,000, maybe pay for interns? Finally, talking about the team of professionals involved, I believe that this is the best part of the feasibility, as we know the names, the roles in the project and a little about each one (it would be even more positive if we had more detail about their resumes). However, we can't help but trust a team that is already well known in Catalyst and active in Cardano, who is a member of the community has already come across the team in Town Hall and knows how committed and serious they are to their projects, in addition to having already many other funded proposals (over 20, by what is said here). So I think the proposal is viable, but some parts of the roadmap and the budget explanation could be better.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Some really relevant metrics are raised to track partial results. To understand what would be the relationship of students with the program, it would be analyzed how many students managed to complete the program and also how many were hired by projects in our ecosystem. It would measure how necessary the program was for them to get paid work. It is said that alumni surveys will be conducted for an annual report (more on this in the final success auditability). I believe that what is lacking here in terms of the auditability of progress is an understanding of how the work of the professionals involved is being carried out, in which way the individual activities that make up the program are being monitored? Proponents do not say how this work behind the final results would be analyzed and measured, so my suggestion is that this too be audited, in addition to the partial successes being achieved. It is necessary for the Wada community to keep in touch with the rest of the members of our ecosystem, keeping us updated both on the advances and on the work that would be developing behind them. As they already actively participate in the Town Hall, my suggestion is that this information is also passed on there. Talking about final results, proponents tell us how it could be perceived in various ways, such as an 80% rate in the internship program; the interns being employed in Catalyst projects in various roles such as marketing, translation, administration etc, and that finally the youth unemployment rate will be drastically reduced after the program is completed. We know how such information will be collected, as the group would conduct an annual survey of alumni. Therefore, the only thing that was not so clear would be the format of this research (probably a long written report) and where it would be made available (perhaps through the group's website?). I think that in general we are very well covered when it comes to monitoring the project, only a few more specific details could be better explored, which are mainly the audit of the daily lives of professionals and the communicative bridge between Wada and the Cardano community, so that all the information studied and collected here reach the members of our community in a very simple and direct way.

Though as a core team they are short in terms of overarching involvement in various Cardano communities, this is negated by their effort to collaborate with WADA's network.\n\nIn terms of the education plan/program itself, I have been trying to identify what is in it but unfortunately I have not found any related documents. I only have their solution statement as following ; \"This program will consist of onboarding, training, then connecting them with Catalyst projects.\" Other than, nothing is available for us to study and gauge whether it's content correlates with the goal they seek to achieve.\n\nI am willing to overlook this, for based on the LinkedIn link provided, they are indeed capable.

And what guarantees will the graduate be employed? Have they already contacted these Catalyst projects? Or will they only prepare a pool of trained individuals? There are many questions that arises from not providing further details on their program.

The proposal therefore effectively addresses the challenges and has a potential of bringing value to the cardano  ecosystem. \n\nFirst of all, unemployment has become a canker in the African Society and according to the Research from this proposal a colossal number of 12 million youth of Africa seek to enter the workforce every year where as only 3 million formal jobs created within the same period according to the African Development Bank. The question one may ask is what do we do, and so come to mind is this proposal and the work of cardano ecosystem that has come to help alleviate this menace of unemployment in the African continent. To answer the question  about how do we do this the proposal has a forthright sights on how to carry out this project.\n\nThe proposer has a strong link with wada and so he intends to use wada internship program which aims to tackle several of the key issues of graduate and youth unemployment on the African continent of which I do personally agree. \n\nSecondly the proposal has also identify the lapses which leads to this massive unemployment on the continent of Africa and one of such is, lack of employable skills, no emphasis on entrepreneurship in the school curriculum of the African continent and last but not the least the quality of education not in sync with the changing needs of the society of which I agree with the proposal for quick funding to address this canker.\n\nHow do we address this with the use of cardano ecosystem and project catalyst is now the question of the day. But the proposer and his team's experience on dealing with matters like this have set to recruit students through a student network and outreach, he also hinted of using  online webinars and on-campus events to reach out to this unemployed students and youth of the African continent to engage them on the cardano ecosystem by giving them the requisite skills, training, coaching and handing over a career that will turn the fortunes of these young men and women around. Hence the need to fund this project to address this problem.\n\nYouth unemployment as we all know is a national threat to any nation and so what this research is showing is that about 12 million Africans youth graduate every year and are seeking to enter into the job market of which Nigeria alone releases about 600,000 graduates seeking to enter into the job market and at a same time only a paltry 3 million jobs are available. This is an insecurity to the continent of Africa and so to make Africa the leading hub of cardano ecosystem and not a perpetual follower I think this is the time to take up this opportunity by engaging these millions of our graduates and youth that have no hope in getting a formal job today or tomorrow and so funding of this project is key.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a clear roadmap as to how this project is going to be carried out. This project is in so many phases which is expected to be run within 3 months and within the three months are a number of activities running through the months. This would include program development and documentation, enrollment of Officers, onboarded, website and content updated.\n\nThe proposal has requested for an amount of a budget to undertake this project work. The whole budget has been broken into activity base and value for money was taking into consideration here where some cutbacks have been made from the previously estimated budget that was supposed to help carried out this project and this I think the proposer and his team are diligent and transparent people who actually need funding and are passionate about this work of cardano ecosystem and project catalyst to assist the African youth unemployment rate. In terms of risk the program completion is said to be one of the risk and with this the proposer said that, the recruitment process will be done only on the most committed students who will be accepted and the program will be done by way of piloting. The quality of the program is also another thing which he intimated that wada will leverage its educational resources in partnership in order to deliver a programme that is highly valued for both it's training and Career Development.\n Another risk that was looked at is financial sustainability whether wada will be able to get additional funding to help in the sustainability of the project.\nWith the experience of the proposer and his team I stand to agree with the proposal and have no doubt in my mind that this projects will be implemented successfully if funded.\n\nThe people and institutions that would be helping in the work of this proposal's details and links have all been provided in order to help trace their authenticity and existence if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A litany of information has been provided to help audit this proposal project with ease. One of the ways according to the proposer  is the program attrition, that is how many students were able to complete the program entirely and this is going to be done based on the attendance on weekly and monthly basis and at the end of the day will be reported to the cardano community. Increase employability is also another metrics that will be used relating to the number of students who are working with the cardano ecosystem and the project Catalyst and how beneficial was the program in helping them to obtain further working within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nOn the success of the program the Proposer said this program would be an over 80% approval rating for a wada internship program by its participants and I agree because it fully addresses the canker of unemployment in Africa, he further stated that wada interns will be equipped with the skills to join the catalyst Project in a range of functions that is in editing, marketing so on and so forth if funded.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3260", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11546, "q0": "Underutilization of graduates and unemployed youth in Africa is a major issue, but also provides a great opportunity for Cardano to grow, as described in this WADA proposal.

The proposed solution may have both local and global impact, assisting with local employment (or boosting the skillset and increasing the attractiveness for future emplyers) among young adults/graduates, as well as connecting with foreign institutions such as Edify UK, Dapp360, and possibly other sponsorship organizations, and presenting Catalyst among young adults, that may have a more global impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In the previous iteration of Catalyst funding, the team behind the this\u00a0proposal successfully delivered education products, and was funded.

The team identified the problem that needed to be solved by leveraging the current student workforce to become active supporters of Catalyst and Cardano. With funding funded by Catalyst, the reality of young human resources existing in Africa is that many talents are undervalued and underutilized to meet the needs of the organization. I think this proposal has a lot of potential because it is directly related to the human factor, the students will be the future owners of the country and Africa (if they are guided, trained, and fully utilized). properly used). Therefore, this proposal has a large impact on the growth of Africa - a continent suffering from poverty and underdevelopment, and also increases the value of the Cardano ecosystem. With the attached condition that it takes time to train and guide young people to develop as expected. The team can then scale and tackle future challenges. Who knows, the future with a knowledgeable workforce will solve problems not only in Cardano but also in many other areas directly related to the world. A proposal of great stature involving the continent and the world (it may be a long time before it solves the world's problems). But let's imagine, this idea is like a person who sows a seed, the seed that is sown after many years will grow into a big green tree, which will then give sweet fruit and shade. I fully support this proposal. I vote 5 stars.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Probably most of us who know Catalyst know Wada - an organization of 25 experts focused on connecting the world with Africa using blockchain and AI. In the proposal, it is clear that they are experienced people, have full documentation, and publicize their identities through social networks. While the core team to implement this proposal consists of 3 people, many people act as collaborators behind the proposal and 2 trusted partners, Edify and Dapp360. I strongly believe in the feasibility of the proposal endorsed by Wada. One more thing that made me more confident, was looking at the detailed budget breakdown, clearly divided into subsections with the budget. I only have one question: If there is no funding for Catalyst, is there another source of revenue for this proposal to operate? I think the team can use their ability and reputation to create other sources of income along with directly applying for funding from Catalyst. About the plan and the implementation steps are very professional and easy to understand. Regarding the implementation resources, I think that the team has enough human resources, but I would like to comment on the use of human resources in project communication. As we all know, this proposal is very helpful for the community. Therefore, if possible, the team should promote communication and promotion to attract more students and talented young people who know the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem to join. At that time, we will have a large number of human resources who are young, talented, and enthusiastic students. This also addresses the main problem of graduate unemployment in Africa \u2013 in line with criterion number 8 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Good jobs and economic growth. I think this proposal is very necessary and urgent at the moment because Africa is a continent facing the highest unemployment in the world. I pay attention to the details of the use of common language for students in different countries, how does the team plan to use language images to match? As far as I understand some countries in Africa use different languages. Then we need to agree on a common language. That is my suggestion about using language when implementing the project (this suggestion is useful when the project is widely developed in African countries that do not share the same language). I agree with the challenges and risks associated with the implementation that the team mentioned. This proves that the team members have a very clear awareness, grasp the real situation carefully, and have carefully studied before writing the proposal. Back to the issue of using funds when implementing the proposal. I would like to comment, that in case the team needs more money to implement, you should come up with a more specific plan to be able to verify. Recently, I just gave my opinion in the spirit of trying to improve the feasibility of the proposal. I endorse this proposal, this proposal for the community is very good. I would very much like to propose to be funded by Catalyst. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The routes have been specified by the team in the proposal. However, I have a small suggestion to increase transparency and audit you can attach the roadmap to specific months of the year. If the community sees this, it will help them a lot in the audit and will beautify the presentation of the overall layout of the proposal. The KPIs are highly focused on the number of new African users joining Cardano and the number of new members of Catalyst based in Africa. I think the team is right when choosing such a KPI. I also agree that the key metrics to measure are (1) Program attrition and (2) Increase in employability. As for how many students will complete the entire program, I would suggest that this depends partly on the content of the program and the amount of knowledge you want to convey to the students. As for the employability index, my opinion is that you can promote communication to let more people know about this proposal, so there will be more opportunities to recruit students. Talented children are trained in the course. The rest of the problem has been described clearly and easily with the accompanying professional solution by Wada experts.

I see the majority of the challenge objectives being served through this proposal. Of course, if we want to see wide-scale adoption of Cardano in Africa, then one needs to understand clearly why he or she must adopt it. There are lots of educational projects happening in the community at the moment but the question to ask would be how many African students forms a part? It is usually low because the mechanism for onboarding these students onto the community may be missing and I think this proposal has found the solution to it. I am highly certain that if this project gets the chance to launch, a lot more of these targeted audiences would be happy to be involved and the impact will be realized on a maximum level. Everything is on point and a good job once again.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal makes the assessment of feasibility quite easy by providing basically all details needed for verifying whether or not the identified problem can be solved successfully. However, it was mentioned in the proposal that due to budget limitation reasons, the total budget of 42,500 USD which is officially feasible for a successful implementation of this project has been cut down to 26,500 USD in order to align more with the challenge. Unfortunately, 42,500 USD is still a good budget that would align with the challenge since there is no budget limit stated in the campaign brief as stated in the proposal so there was no need for cutting down the budget. Now it is clear that the feasibility is quite shaky since some of the workloads like project management, enrollment officer, and talent manager which are relatively different roles are being assigned to an individual whereas enrollment officer could be handed over to a human resource professional to ensure that the right people are being recruited for the project manager to ensure that available resources are being utilized efficiently. In my humble opinion and expertise, assigning an individual to these different roles would make the work more tiring for him/her despite the experience as these roles have different attributes.\nI fail to understand why the team is unable to provide a name as a project manager for this project in the proposal already. It was mentioned under the experience that Wada has about 25+ professionals who are focused on ensuring the growth, etc. but refuses to mention the name of at least one person who is going to oversee that the project is going to be successfully implemented. However, this lack of understanding may not compel me to deduct a score but I think it would be great if individuals for high-end positions like these could be ready for the proposal by looking at the size of Wada and some of the enthused members onboard like Nana Safo, Afia Owusu, Mercy, Frederic, Manfo, Steve, etc.\nThe listed team on this proposal makes a solid team to ensure implementation. Personally, I have had encounters with some of the projects they have worked on and it is an amazing job with a different level of positive energy.  The links provided also helped to confirm their profiles and experience as stated in the proposal. However, it looks like only Josh F has been assigned the role of project lead whereas the rest were assigned no specific role. This raises the question of who will be doing what, at what time, and at what rate? \nThe roadmap looks very clear with milestones that can be measured against the definition of success. At least we know what would be done at different times and what outcome to expect as a community.\nFor risk management, the identified risks are provided with great mitigation methods. The absence of financial over-run should have been considered a risk as well and the team could have mitigated this risk with a budget for contingencies which is unfortunately not included in the budget breakdown of this proposal.\n\nFor all other parts of the project's feasibility, I agree that the identified problem can be solved. However, I am skeptical about the financial feasibility of this proposal as certain key questions remain unanswered. From my perspective, I see financial feasibility as about 60% of the total resources needed for a successful implementation of every project and hence I will give a score of 3 for the project's feasibility but all in all, a good job done by the team.

It is obvious that the Wada website provided can be used to track the progress of the project even though it was not stated in the proposal which I think should have been the case since three links were provided under the description of the relevant links. \nFuture challenges of unemployment and absence of the Africans in the Cardano community are surely going to be solved by this project and I am glad for the disclosure that the team would be reaching back to Catalyst for more funds until a different reliable funding mechanism like youth unemployment agencies who support initiatives like this are met. With this, the community can expect to see more proposals like this in the coming fund rounds.\n\nThis is a great project and I really hope it is funded as the impact would be huge both for the Cardano ecosystem and the university community.
