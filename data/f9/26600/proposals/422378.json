It is still undergoing optimisation since it was finalised in 2016. As part of their infrastructure, they want to develop a medical records ownership protocol, a way to give patients their much-needed privacy back. At the same time, it will also provide access and interoperability to health care providers, all achieved through a permissionless health information exchange.   \nThrough the power of blockchain, zero knowledge and smart contracts, patients will be able to decide and set the sharing settings of their medical data and doctors, pharmacists and insurance companies will be able to access the required data only, and not get access to the entire patient\u2019s history and personal details.\nThe research the team has provided on this subject is very extensive. Their white papers describe every angle of medical ownership, with reading, creating, editing, deleting, selling and more rights for each individual stakeholder, from patient to doctor and to medical facility.\nI view the proposal to be comprehensive, perfectly matching the challenge brief and with an incredible impact on the medical system not just in Africa but worldwide, as well. On top of that, the entire Cardano Ecosystem stands to benefit, as well, both from the great increase of transactions on the blockchain to the increase in adoption and popularity following the platform\u2019s deployment in medical institutions.\nIf I could, I\u2019d give this section more than a 5-star rating. Congratulations!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The provided plan is extensively described. The timeline spans over a period of 16 weeks, and the tasks are well organised in groups of 2-3 weeks, depending on the team\u2019s judgement of implementation. I especially appreciate the fact that the team has structured their timeline in such a way, as to have 2 weeks for quality assurance and testing towards the end, to make sure that everything is working as smooth as possible.\nThe budget is grouped per team member\u2019s job, with a monthly salary ask and a number of months needed to finalise each task. The pay is not just reasonable, but rather on the small side, according to my knowledge in the blockchain space. But I see that the team is working from Africa and their passion is motivating them to have the project finalised. Overall, I find the budget feasible and realistic.\nThe team members' field answer is not as informative as the rest of the proposal, it doesn\u2019t offer clear descriptions and LinkedIn profile links for verification, however, considering the amount of work that has been done so far, and the fact that the team has been selected as part of the Ariob Incubator, developed in collaboration with IOG, I see no reason not to trust their skills and dedication to the project.\nAs such, I will rate the feasibility section a 5, as I have no doubt that the proposers are perfectly capable of implementing the project successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I find the proposal progress answer to be highly professional.

But the deployment of the medical records rights protocol is the final point of success, and after that, as the team mentions \u201cthis is considered DONE\u201d.\nGiven all the extensive details provided for each of the two questions, I rate this section a 5/5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1336, "q0": "The team has chosen a problem statement which belongs to health care domain focusing on the current existing organizational issue of how the medical documents are mainatined in health care sector especially on which entity of the health chain is supposed to hold these medical records (patient/doctors/health care centers) and the solution being proposed focuses on creating a decentralized exchange for medical records which can help managing the ownership enforcement to share and manage the records among all the different nodes of health sector chain. this solution will be integral part of the Hippocrades healthcare infrastructure.

They have provided details regarding how they will handle the consensus regarding ownership of the records and have provided phases wise details on how they will be implementing in integrating with their infrastucure parts of which were previously funded bu catalyst rounds.

You clearly define the project's primary substance, the target audience that the Medical Records Rights Protocol wishes to reach, the benefits it can provide to the Cardan ecosystem, and the objective risks that the project will face. However, I regret not being able to offer you 5 points because your solution introduction lacks detail. When the interviewer asked for more information concerning medical records ownership in Hippocrades, your response, \"We have written a white paper on it here,\" left me a little dissatisfied.

And how do I know that the protocol has aided each individual's health care?

It is not satisfactorily explained why the project would be directly designed for the African continent and how it would especially benefit its inhabitants. It seems to me to be a global initiative, which serves all countries, without being specifically designed for the African context. At least, there is no explanation of this degree of specificity. It is certainly a relevant project for Cardano, to create a platform for enforcing proprietary rights over the medical data of patients/providers/facilities (such as hospitals and offices, I believe); on this platform, end users would have more control over their data and could use it to profit (companies often need this data to do research and develop products). And all of this would be minted on the Cardano blockchain. However, I reinforce that there would need to be more explanations about why this project would be aimed especially at Africa.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "What I like about the script is that the time division is very specific (based on weeks). Even so, it would be interesting to have more details about the activities \u2013 we know what would be done and for how long, but we don't have enough information on how. Who would and how. Regarding the budget, it is confusing what the \u201cT\u201d would be, I believe it would be like a thousand, for example 10t = 10k? This would need to be more clear. In my view, the way the financing was explained is very superficial, we don't understand in detail how the requested money would be used since the parts themselves are little commented, there is not a good detail.

When it comes to the final results, we also have some very interesting information about how this project would be considered a real success, but I believe there could be more depth here. My suggestion is that the team keep in touch with patients who used this platform later, how they would be learning to deal with Cardano technologies, how they would be making a more controlled and profitable use of their data, if they would have become active members the community and in what way...
