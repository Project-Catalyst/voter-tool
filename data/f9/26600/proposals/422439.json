From there it is possible to build a community run by the group. We can ask and answer questions on youtube comments, we can create live discussion topics via the Zoom application.

Also we don't know how the locals of Accra would be motivated to participate in the event, even though there is already a certain IOG initiative about Ghana (with the haskell course), I believe most people still don't know about blockchain/Cardano.

Talking about the budget, there are 12 events \u2013 each one has broken down parts, so we understand well how the requested money would be used.

We are living in a time with high inflation, so setting a one year budget could be somehow unrealistic related to the growing inflation.\n\nWhat is even more unclear for this proposal is the timetable.
