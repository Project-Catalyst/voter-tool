Although utilizing NFT's would have potentially wider financial use cases. For NFT's are some extent also some form of DID's. Although DID's in the proposers understanding are equally interesting, DID's are more of a long-term effort to adopt Cardano. Nonetheless any effort to increase adoption is crucial.\n\nThough this proposal does not speak of direct adoption per say, it does identify the needs to study the market on the necessity of having DID's. This I feel is a very sensible and pragmatic approach which needs to be understood by the larger Cardano community. You can't just expect to have superior technology and have it applied throughout a community. In terms of traction you actually need to have a product that is needed by the community. This is what essentially this team is trying to pinpoint through market research. Is DID's that compelling in Tanzania?\n\nAny effort of adoption in Africa, especially driven by data and potentially partnering with a business entity that already uses Cardano will eventually create an ecosystem. Build on this ecosystem and the real-fi benefit it brings will naturally onboard more on to it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team are seasoned individuals that have the essential background to conduct this market research. Key experiences that correlates directly with this proposal, is Product Development. Which the team lean and CCO has years of experience in. They have also provided their LinkedIn for further review by the Cardano community. What is provided in the LinkedIn only solidifies their capacity to conduct a proper market research.\n\nThis of course is carried through the approach of their market research in this proposal. Most important aspect of the market research is the duration, topic and target of the research. A minor critique is the number of participants of this research is a bit low, the only seek to interview 50 individuals. There is no mentioning of sampling a larger market.\n\nLooking forward to the results of this market research. It can become a case study of what Cardano needs to launch first to a similar market. Should the focus of Cardano be on expanding the use case of NFT's or introducing DID's. As a gambling man, I would rather go for expanding the use case and the further understanding of NFT's.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "All the metrics needed are there. From a clear roadmap, detailed budget and also what they seek to achieve. Although it is a shame that a lot of the budget goes to traveling cost. This just underlines how Cardano is still not diverse enough. There is still a strong tendency towards relying on the minds of westerners. Perhaps it can be considered in the future to also involve more of the locals as a future attempt to explore being cost-effective in Africa.\n\nBesides that though, the additional KPI's are a bit confusing. Since it is a market research I do not understand why there is a metric regarding number of successful recruitment using DID's. Is it not the function of this proposal is to determine deployment of their solution? Perhaps they are preparing for the future?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 4, "ng": 11, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 783, "q0": "Great proposal and continuation of the previously funded 'Employment Credentials in Zanzibar' proposal from Fund8.

Currently in Zanzibar and Tanzania the job applications are still dealt via paper. Fairway, a Finnish company is offering to digitize the job application processes and the applicants profiles in the country by reapplying what has already been done in Ethiopia. \nI like this proposal because if combines prior knowledge from both the Atala PRISM chapter and the previous experience in another country. \nDigital identity has been adopted already by European countries to access national services like tax declaration, health insurance, pension records ect. following a top to bottom approach. This is a bottom to top approach, because it does not come from the government, but as in Europe the digital identity acted as a simplificator tool, this Finnish company is helping african people to adopt the same technology standards when it comes to verifiable identity.

As developing country, the unemployment rate is around 9.5% based on the 2020 World Bank data.

One being the research phase, during which the team would work on the first 4 stages, that include: pre-study, market study 1 & 2, and the post study (market study analysis report); and the second phase, that would be the project implementation. I raise this because the implementation is somehow conditional to the result of the market study as stated by proposers in the risks. (the adaptation level of PRISM DID's is still too low and/or the Credentials that the users of World Mobile get from using the service are difficult to utilize properly in the recruitment process). \nThe Proposers team has been involved in a similar project in Ethiopia and is formed with people from various professional backgrounds related to this type of initiative.\nThe budget is detailed and a reasonable timeframe.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It's clear that this proposal respond to a social need and provides a reasonable roadmap, and KPI's, that are measurable.

Verifying credentials is extremely necessary in recruitment processes but they can be a burden in Africa as it is difficult to be implemented because most of these verifications are paper-based and lack technological advances to make them more efficient. The solution designed by the startup Fairway is based on Atala PRISM based identity solution and their idea is to offer proof of employment and educational records as verifiable credentials in their platform in the form of a SaaS. In other words, the company is adding value to the Cardano ecosystem by creating a product that addresses a real problem faced by Africans and incentivizing new Africa-based users to join Cardano. The KPIs proposed, however, are not very precise and aligned with the challenge setting. For instance, they list \"Engaged to a conversation with multiple job seeker segments in the markets\" as a KPI but this is not objectively measurable nor very precisely constructed. Instead, they could pursue KPIs more aligned with the campaign such as local partnerships formed and number of Africa-based users onboarded onto Cardano.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal provides a brief introduction to each of the seven team members presented and also links to their LinkedIn profiles.

It is divided in four parts, the pre-study, the Zanzibar market study trip, the Tanzania market study trip and the post-study analysis and deployment plan. The timeline also follows a very similar division and dates are estimated for the conclusion of each phase. Overall, the plan is expected to be finished by the end of November of this year, which sounds realistic. Finally, the team has considered the potential risks of the project and properly identified the adaptation level of PRISM DID as the main one. That is because their business strategy revolves around the assumption that the credentials that the users of World Mobile get can be leveraged to be used in recruitment processes.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provided by the team has clear milestones and they have estimated conclusion dates for each of the five phases designed in their plan. Some of the KPIs defined, however, are not very well-thought. For instance, the KPI \"Published Feasibility report for the Cardano community\" is more of a milestone than a KPI.  A better metric would be number of Africa-based users onboarded onto Cardano or user activity and reach of their platform.

Surely the recruitment market in Tanzania and Zanzibar will be much more exciting if this proposal is implemented. I think that has a big impact on the goal of the Challenge. It is because it uses Cardano blockchain technology through IOG and World Mobile that it will increase the value of the Cardano ecosystem. I find that this confirms the photo impact of the proposal.

Regarding the challenge risk, I would like to highlight one factor that you mentioned in the proposal. That is: the current job market is not ready for digital services and document processing.

This lowers the trust between applicant and employer because credentials can be easily faked. The problem is real because the employer wants to get the best employee and when their experience is dubious it\u00b4s hard to decide. Therefore this could be good for the employer and qualified employees. \nThrough investments from IOG and World Mobile is the technical capacity to implement this in Zanzibar and Tanzania. The project could help the people there by giving the employee a verified certificate for their experience made and the employer real proof of their previous experience. This could make the jobmarket more efficient, allocate experienced and good workers to the best workplaces and thus make the companies more effective. \nThe proposal includes just the research on whether there is a viable option to deploy it there. The research will be made by market studies and an included deployment plan.
