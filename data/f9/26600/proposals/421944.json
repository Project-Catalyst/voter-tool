We also see that the professionals involved have good technical skills, which converge with the objectives of the project. In addition, we noticed that their CVs were made available so that the experiences could be proven. But as mentioned before, it seems the amount of capital required would not be enough to establish such a platform with the desired degree of connection. In fact, the total amount described in the budget details differs from the one initially indicated, here we have $29,000 and $20,000 was previously requested.

It seems the team is trying to use Project Catalyst to leverage an already existing project that originally had nothing to do with Cardano by adding some slight touches of Cardano in the proposal. Indeed, there are some intersections in the subjects discussed such as impact investing and sustainability, but they don't go much beyond that. The goals of the campaign are to spread knowledge and adoption of Cardano in Africa, to increase the number of African projects seeded, to increase the percentage of contribution in the project catalyst coming from Africa-based members and to promote innovations that will tackle unique challenges faced by the continent. On the other hand, the main goal of the team's plan is to organize a peer-to-peer coaching to provide global connections and advice to the youth leaders, which not necessarily involve Cardano and not necessarily addresses any of the goals previously mentioned.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team described in composed of Antoinette, Bianca and Elise.

Also, the timetable described is realistic and the total duration estimated of the project is six months. Additionally, the plan described is sensible and conductible, they explain what they will be doing every month or so. Finally, the proposer has discussed three major risks the project faces and also how they intend to mitigate them. They are the risk of not delivering what they have promised, the risk of the targeted people not wanting to mentor the youth and the risk of not reaching the desired outcome. For the last one, for example, their solution is to build a network of supportive, innovative climate solutions.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team didn't highlight the milestones of each stage of the plan, but have provided good explanations of what will be done at each phase. It's not a big fault but as a suggestion to enhance the proposal I would add explicit milestones in the plan. For instance, in the October phase they could have defined a milestone of reaching one million people through social media summing all of their platforms, and the announcement of at least three relevant high-level speakers. Additionally, in the metrics they could have defined more precise KPIs. They used local impact and local partnerships formed as suggested in the campaign, but the impact referred in this case is user activity in the Cardano ecosystem which is something the proposal neglects.

With the following objectives: Efforts to build long-term community; The preparation team for the closing meeting, and some other work\u2026 was explained in detail about each budget for each task to be performed in the project. This is a pretty reasonable budget. However, for the explanation of the budgets in each job, it was $29,000. So, what is the exact budget of the proposal. As far as the explanation is exactly 29,000 dollars. There is an important question here, is the required budget and the explanation are completely mismatched?

I am extremely glad that they were able to get them onboard because with their advice and focus on impact and driving change this proposal is more likely to succeed than not. I like how they already have hubs of students across South Africa and won awards for their work indicating that they already have demonstrated impact.

I believe this is a hyped up number of ghost views which I would not advertise without solid conversion rates OR that indeed the team has manages the achieve this number is impressions but the conversion to subscriptions or community membership is miniscule meaning the marketing although good at brining awareness doesn't actually resolve into meaningful relationships and impact for the business, project, and for the people they are trying to help. This can be overcome by focusing on true bottoms up approach instead of going to the BBCs of the world and splatter and market a product that doesn't stick. My suggestion is as students and success stories emerge to really tell the story of the people who were helped, people naturally gravitate towards success. Other metrics are fine.
