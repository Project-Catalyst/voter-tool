And a limited use of it. The proposers intention are for ADA to become the currency of choice for farmers to buy and sell goods. There is indeed an education factor in this, but what it seeks to educate is limited again only to the potential use of ADA in day-to-day transactions.\n\nWhen it comes to value chain, the use of ADA should perhaps be the last effort. The focus should be more into the supporting infrastructure. The use of ADA will come naturally.\n\nGoing back to the point of education, targeting farmers is perhaps not the most effective method. Rather farmers, it would be better to target perhaps local students through the promise of blockchain education and a part-time job. Then from there approach the farmers village/community and identify and train individuals who are trusted in the community and interested  in being conduits between the farmers and the technology. Will go deeper into this in the following assessments category.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team involved or related to agriculture itself are passionate individuals. This can be view by their various credentials and long history in this field. The implementation team though is only generally stated, which is WADA. There is no further detail on who from WADA and what credentials do they bring. Indeed WADA is trustworthy, but you still would need to identify the certain individual who will take lead on the implementation of the technology.\n\nHence, my previous assessment which states they are focusing too much on the use of ADA without detailing the implementation of the technology involved. What is stated briefly is the mentioning of \"Agri Input Shops\" and \"Agri Input Markets\". These 2 (two) entities are essential, for this is where the transaction of goods happens. We need to know what and how is the method of input? Is there a front-end app? And how does this app connect with the blockchain? How will the farmers use this app? Is it through a mobile? Or is it through some stationary data input in the physical Agri Input Markets? How does ADA travel from one individual to another? And how does the proof of transaction be recorded? Will be written on the blockchain? These are some of the questions that should have been addressed by the implementation team.\n\nAt the very least, there should a visual/simple infographics that depicts the whole process and explains in further detail the concept of the technology. A simple wireframe would do. There are various other shortcomings but I will limit it as is.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It becomes difficult to audit when the goals itself are unclear. Indeed there are some targets, but there is also an overliance on WADA. There is a continued mentioning of \"X will be done by WADA, Y will be covered by WADA\". Again, this is dangerous, for it can potentially compromise the good name of WADA. Before going deeper regarding auditability, highly recommend the proposers to please in the future, if this proposal does not get funded to please coordinate and communicate well with WADA.\n\nThe goals mentioned are again too focused on the use of ADA. The use of ADA itself will not have much change in creating a better livelihood and ecosystem for the farmers. It can actually add a burden in the existing agrichain for you are adding an additional process that perhaps is just not needed yet.\n\nThen there is the budget, again, there is very limited mentioning of budget allocation for the implementation team. What is stated is only a huge lump sum of $10,240 for this \"Agri Input Market\". What is actually this \"Agri Input Market?\" Other than that, the budget is largely used for marketing and PR gimmicks and for team operations.\n\nIf not funded, kindly recommend for the proposers to first coordinate well with WADA and also participate more in-depth with the Catalyst School. There are numerous other notes regarding the proposal, but I will leave it as is.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 3, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11600, "q0": "The proposer and his team's  proposal is timely and will go a long way to solve a problem that has bedeviled this country in terms of price hikes in agro-inputs and I therefore applaud this proposer and his team. The proposal and has identified a major problem that is facing the agro community in Ghana and therefore is intending to use project catalysts and cardano  ecosystem to assist farmers get value for their sweats and money when using Ada as a medium of exchange for agric input. The proposer bemoan the fact that taxes and levies on mobile Money are too much and normally when you engage in farming which deals with money and you want be transacting with the mobile Money vendors and other financial institutions your cash end up reducing in value, hence  the introduction of Ada by agritech company to assist farmers through  training. The proposer said farmers normally are always disadvantaged by the shortcomings of cash which are costly to collect and send and that, the cash can also be stolen or misappropriated and when there's slow transportation. The proposal according to the proposer has two phases, one according to the proposal will involve the following, that is organising workshops, online training sessions, practical training sessions will aid farmers to have smooth usage of the Yoroi wallets. The proposer said knowing your farmer gives you a better chance of assessing his financial status, also by building internal and external value proportions for Ada payment. Cardano ecosystem will be used as a legal tender or a medium of exchange to acquire agro-inputs. The proposal also intimated they intend enabling farmers to spend their funds and access Services digitally that is by sensitizing farmers on the value of Ada payment using the Yoroi app.\n\nThe Phase 2 of The Proposal seeks to use angritech Society to create an ecosystem where farmers can freely use Ada for transactions by creating agri inputs shop where farmers can buy inputs and pay with Ada. According to the proposer and his team farmers who buy inputs with Ada will be given a discount of 10 to 15 Ada and this will depend on the volume of goods or the kinds of goods one buys from this agritech shop.\n\nThe project also seek to help solve issues related to the farmers and that farmers who get involved in the cardano ecosystems and the blockchain will be trained on how to use yoroi wallet to help themselves. Another thing the projects would help is the unemployed youth, by employing a number of youths to help run this project \n and the other thing is food security and poverty will also be addressed by this project if funded. This proposal projects also seek to use the cardano community to help the farmers overcome the challenges facing agriculture in this 21st century, there are multiple challenges that faces the labour force of farming, it produces more food and fibre to feed a growing population with a small rural labour Force and this project if funded will help farmers realise their potentials and the fruit of their toil.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer and his team has intimated that they have ever work with atinker on agro processing. Therefore I have no doubt in my mind that this project if funded will be a success to the glory of God. The proposal said the project will take five months to complete which will go in the following order with the milestone. According to the proposer the projects will be launched then recruitment and training of Community-Based Assessors(CBAs) and creation of a physical agri input marketplace that will enable or accept Ada transactions from the farmers after they've been onboarded onto cardano ecosystem. This training is expected to be organising in the 5 northern regions of Ghana. The first and the subsequent months almost all, if not the same but similar programs running through all the months with \ndifferent dates and months  a summation of the five regions where the project are expected to be launched.It willl be a two-day program that will invite stakeholders and farmers in the value chain to help create awareness about the project and how it's recruitment and training of 10 CBAs two from each of the five northern regions to help in the dissemination of information in the language which may be a barrier as a way of getting the message of the proposal. These candidates are expected to be literate and should come from these regions, they should be natives and should be able to speak the local languages of the people in order for easy dissemination of information. The project is expected to take a form of 5 months training sessions in the five northern regions.Its expected to go this way if not same but similar, but a varying dates of which I think it is laudable. In every month and a given proposed dates will be sets for maybe a first week of the month or second week of the month then the time for everything is from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the targeted people are hundred farmers from the said communities.Where Agritech input shops are open these products are expected to begin sale on this day. When asked about the risk involved in this, the proposer and his team intimated that language may be a barrier which may not be helpful to the cause of the project cardano but with his vast experience in farming and agritech he said he will be able to liaise with the Community-Based Assessors(CBAs) who understand the language of the people to break the language barrier in order for the information to get through to the farmers so at the end of the day project catalyst will benefit immensely from this an the farmers themselves would also benefits from this program if funded.\nThe proposer and his team have also been able to request for an understandable amount of budget which they further broke it down into activity base for cardano ecosystem to be able to fund it and monitor the progress of this project if funded.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Yes the information provided above is enough monitor or audit the progress and success of this program. The proposer said, monthly status documents will be communicated to the community and that Wada a reputable blockchain organisation is also going to be involved in the provision of transparent records on the progress of this project and some deliverables that are also going to be measured by way of auditability will include the number of farmers who express their satisfaction in using the Yoroi wallet to transact business or buy agri-inputs at a cool price. Moreover the results from the proposal will be communicated to the community through a joint meetups by cardano4climate and wada. Receipt, waybills and invoices, records on transactions made by the proposed payment system will all be available for auditability and to this extent I agree that the information provided above is enough to monitor the progress and success of this project. On what success look like the proposal has hinted that a mass adoption of Ada as a form of payment for goods and services in the agricultural value chain which will create employment for people as well as farmers getting the privilege in buying goods at a good discount are all going to be things that are visible and auditable and I believe this alone is a success and worth funding.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3260", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11387, "q0": "Agriculture is a source of food and sustenance whose supply chain must be kept going at all times, as livelihoods depend on it.

Their first focus is on educating secondary and tertiary students in Northern Ghana, but if the project is successful it will be relatively easy to roll out to other countries in Africa. The proposed indicators and objectives match the challenge. The group will organize meetings and conferences to reach more than 2,000 students in universities and high schools in Northern Ghana, thereby working to increase the number of students becoming community advisors, increase the excellent proposals submitted by these students, and increase the number of Cardano wallets.

Months 3, 4, and 5: five farmer training sessions will be held in each region of the northern belt of Ghana. It is a very reasonable and favorable plan for them to successfully implement the project. The team budget breakdown is clearly outlined and broken down into identifiable items. The project is expected to be used in Ada, the total amount is $35,268. Expenses to pay for the work: launching projects, recruiting and training CBA's, Training courses, and seminars are quite reasonable to achieve the set goals.

They will use Ada coin, therefore increasing more adoption of Ada. The program contains 2 phases, first one is farmer to farmer transaction, second one is the market.

Of course, this answers the challenge in this category because it will increase the use of the cardano blockchain with ADA transactions by buyers to local farmers. Proposer seems to be focused on teaching farmers how to use the yoroi wallet, but it's a good idea to generally introduce the wallets that are now available for cardano and the advantages and disadvantages of each. The suggestion for the proposer is to also learn about one of the projects on cardano, namely https://indigoprotocol.io/ which hopefully can provide an idea of \u200b\u200bhow to turn real-world assets into tokens and can be exchanged, in this case agricultural products into tokens and make it easier to sell .

However, with a pure phrase 01 about training sessions, you need to add an important indicator, Number of farmer participants. At the same time, there need to be mechanisms to assess whether the participants in these training sessions really understand and apply it in practice, possibly through small tests.\n\nIn addition, to assess the success of the proposal, it is necessary to add specific numbers and metrics. For example, 100 farmers participate in training sessions, or 1000 transactions are done in ADA through the Yoroi wallet.
