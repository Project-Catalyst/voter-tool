It involves education on an individual level the leaders of this community hubs. This is very important, for although we pride ourselves on being decentralized, in actuality the training, the materials that teaches on decentralization is still very limited. Hence this multifaceted approach is needed. A qualified leader that understands and is trained on the ethos of decentralization will breed a better DAO till the time comes where there is enough data on how to operate a self-sustaining community hub.\n\nAt this current development stage of hubs is more at a stage of being pragmatic meaning the main goal is to have one first. In future iteration, for these hubs to be truly effective, unfortunately needs qualified individuals. This is something that has not yet been identified by the Cardano community. There is a tendency to view an underperforming hub is not effective based on the founding of the hub itself. Where the issue might be that the individuals operating it is not qualified. I think this is what this proposal is trying to get at.\n\nFrom that it branches out to the main programs that have a direct effect on the development of Cardano in Africa. Those programs vary from target and intent such as a nation target program of becoming local channels for Catalyst supported products and capabilities. To individual target program such as having access to a wide range of educational material and training courses.\n\nTheir end goal simply put is to create a blueprint that incorporates that what is mentioned above and then some. This blueprint than can be exported and studied by other regions looking to develop their hubs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is again, an intricate collaboration of vetted Cardano communities and entities, such as WADA and Cardashift and also a Edify Ecolabs, some form of think tank that addresses the needs of an organization so it can grow and scale in a sustainable mannerism. Claiming to have developed hundreds of organizations. Knowing WADA, knowing their reputation was and is very much highly regarded, partner with Edify to an extent validates their credibility as per their websites seeks to portray.\n\nWith having a strong partner that indeed is specialized in developing organizations, WADA and Cardashift has the potential to achieve the current holy grail of a community hub, which I believe is to become a self-sustaining entity.\n\nThe potential blueprints that come of this proposal would have far reaching effects for it then can be implemented by all hubs that Cardano has created. The game changer would be, by implementing these blueprints, all the existing Cardano hubs can potentially be self-sustaining, therefore freeing more funds for new endeavors. At this current stage, hubs are slowly taking an ever growing chunk of the Catalyst fund. This is not an effective use of funds and an effective sustainable model for the hubs.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unfortunately though, the structure of this proposal is quite confusing and time consuming. It is very hard to find the gist of the program. Program details I believe should be in put their attachments, while the proposal on IdeaScale should somewhat in spirit be something of a shark tank pitch. Of course, is should be structured as is what has been educated on by Catalyst School. The proposers should take this into mind, for Proposal Assessors are also a product of Catalyst School and have been trained in certain format that perhaps this proposers proposal is not conforming though. Therefore Proposal Assessors might miss or have little patience to go through all the details.\n\nTherefore making it quite difficult to determine mentally in bullet points ; what are the deliverables, when will they be delivered and how much is needed for to be delivered. If this proposal fails to receive the funding it needs I recommend to please re-tool it so it becomes more concise.\n\nWith that said though, the proposer has indeed provided sufficient concept explanations and metrics on why this proposal is needed and how to achieve the proposals intended target.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 15, "ne": 4, "ng": 10, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11531, "q0": "The proposal clearly states and describes how the Cardano Ecosystem could benefit from ACH expansion by accounting for both commercial and cultural value created by the community, as well as a potential risk in transferring the created content to local cultural norms.Furthermore, the project describes the impact on multiple levels, focusing on individuals through education and training materials, local communities through scaling solutions, international communities within the continent such as WADA, and the catalyst community as a whole through the establishment of a blueprint and MVP that captures the possibility of the program self-replicating and self-sustaining in the future.

Not because they are poorly managed (although the elaboration of a well thought out MVP is very important), but also because of the way they are seen by the local society \u2013 as centers of charity, many times. With that, it is suggested here that a series of changes be made, for example the creation of models that value beyond the commercial vision of the centers, organizing the actions based on social impact and making all this use several Cardano technologies - this reaches well to what the challenge seeks, which is to benefit Africa at the same time, and also promote greater adoption of our blockchain on the continent.

The proposal explains it: \u201cThis is a continuation of the F7 Accelerator and un-funded F7 WADA accelerator\u201d. The fact that the team proceeded with their WADA collaboration even without being funded shows their commitment and makes this a worthwhile proposal.\n\nThere are a few things that make me doubt a little. The first is that it mentions Cardashift (only once) and this shows it was originally meant for another challenge.\n\nThe second doubt is the fact that the proposal says \u201cWe are currently running this programme as a non funded MVP with WADA\u201d yet the budget talks about funding an MVP. Let\u2019s hope this doesn\u2019t mean retroactive funding for work already done. Most likely not. The team probably had this feedback already and that\u2019s why they are making a distinction between an ongoing \u201cbeta-level trial\u201d and the actual MVP that is yet to be funded.\n\n\u201cWith WADA as our lead partners we will reframe this MVP to produce a viable MVP Community Hub scale-up programme that will then be run with selected Community Hubs on the continent.\u201d That brings me to my third, and most important, point of critique. With all this time since Fund7, one would hope the plan would have evolved a bit more. Partly this similarity is explained in the enclosed Miro board (it was an honest mistake to leave some old bits linger). But at least those countries should have been selected already but there is no mention of the chosen community hubs in the plan.\n\nFinally, it is often mentioned in the proposal that the outcome is a blueprint (so did their previous proposals in earlier funds). It\u2019s time to go past mere blueprints and create some real social impact action in the continent of Africa. Unfortunately, the proposal seems to repeat much of the old stuff. it even has a spelling mistake from the earlier proposals (\u2018watch on, do one, train one\u2019). The enclosed Miro Board is a bit more updated. It states the phases of the road map: Whitepaper, Blueprint, MVP trial, Rollout, Scale.\n\nHaving said all this, it\u2019s still a strong team, with a good amount of experience, great partners and the right attitude to pull this off.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has listed a good set of metrics that they will be updating as they go, mainly utilizing their Twitter channel. They will be running a weekly project management meeting and attending regular Catalyst Coordinator meetings.\n\nThe proposers envision that the community hubs will be able to \u201cscale down the need for support from Catalyst whilst also scaling up the ability to support their communities\u201d. Ironically, it is also mentioned that the team itself will keep coming back for Catalyst funding \u201cto continue with the rollout of the program\u201d.
