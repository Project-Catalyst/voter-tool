With a teeming youth population, how can we convert her population to talents for economic growth?", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.777777777777778, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 2439, "q0": "We note that the central idea of the proposal aims to create a solution to a latent problem on the African continent. In fact, there are comparatively few job opportunities compared to other continents, and blockchain technology can be of great use in improving this, both in the aforementioned way and in other ways that we will discuss. With that, we have that the proposal is adequately allocated in this challenge. In addition, given the initial intention of the project, the budget being requested seems adequate. The success of this proposal helps both in the development of the African continent and in increasing the visibility of Cardano's technologies.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the scope that the project plans to reach, we have that a possible problem would be the adoption, from the beginning, of actions that are too large for its implementation. But on the contrary, we see the coherent choice of building a pilot plan first, which is being divided into three phases. We also noticed that these phases are well organized, starting from simple actions, from the implementation of initial concepts of the idea, and progressively evolving until reaching the stages of testing and corrections. One of the positive points of the feasibility plan is the team of professionals, we realized that they have a very wide range of knowledge, including not only people involved in development, but also people who have experience in monitoring processes and HR. In addition, their CVs were made available so that their skills could be proven. In terms of budget detail, we have consistent capital distributions, without any over-allocations. And as this project relies on considerable traction from users, it's good to see that special attention has been paid to this aspect, with approximately $7,000 being allocated to marketing. Additionally, we see that the project has a very well structured website, which helps to expose the idea and increase confidence around the project and its viability.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, when we are going to analyze the auditability of a project, it is always interesting when there are clear metrics that indicate the evolution of the project by monitoring important characteristics of the project. And here we observe the presence of these metrics, such as the number of people participating in the project and the rating of the product. It is also interesting to see how the perception of success was built. We noticed that numerical goals were established that help in defining the success or not of the project. Such targets even relate to the previously defined metrics.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5855, "q0": "Finding a decent job to sustain livelihood is one of the major challenges in Africa at the moment. This proposal seeks to create a platform that will develop African youth and prepare them for global job opportunities and that is great. Since it is a Cardano powered platform they are proposing, it means anyone who signups on the platform automatically participates in Cardano ecosystem and there is a high possibility of adoption of Cardano by most people who signups. The proposal meets the setting of the challenge in this way. If this proposal is well executed there will be a great impact both on the continent and the Cardano ecosystem. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal presents details on team members and also provides relevant links to their experience and that is good. There is a detailed plan indicating the phases of the project, the timelines for various activities and milestone to track progress and achievement.

The author proposes the idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding a job verification platform powered by the Cardano blockchain. Proposal, challenging impact. Ecosystems are not only meant to promote technological leaps forward, but also establish other positive impacts on the planet, such as: environment, education, economy, gender equality, ... all for people, communities, developed societies and developed ecosystems. I think the proposal was described in detail. 85% of Africans live on a salary of $5 a day according to the world bank. Many Africans lack the skills, experience and technical know-how needed for global companies and startups. So the author builds an employment support platform powered by the Cardano blockchain. Use this platform to learn and gain initial work experience after being linked to the remote working global. The author also estimates that it will affect 10,000 Africans in 6 months and 1,000,000 within 5 years. Besides, the author of the proposal also recognizes the possible risks. At the same time, there are solutions to reduce risks when the proposal is implemented.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the plan of the proposal, the author provides us with background information to evaluate this section. The first is about the route. The proponent cites the objectives to be achieved in 3 stages. and explained in great detail. Phase 1: Build the product (September 31 to October 31). Stage 2: Accumulation period (November 1 to December 31). Stage 3: Deployment and monitoring. In each stage, the author analyzes the work in detail. We see that the main author of the idea, has almost gone to work. This conveys a lot of confidence in the author's involvement in the project. We know what work will be done, where, in space and time. Next is the budget. The proposal asks for $40,000. In my opinion, the value requested is quite reasonable given the complexity and time of the project. The author has provided a very detailed budget table. The budgets are divided, and allocated to each job, personnel, time... in 3 phases. Finally, about the core team members. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides a text presentation about each member, and attaches a link to let us know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented. In general, the plan of the proposal is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced, increasing the feasibility of the proposal. Proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "From the experience of the members and the proposed plan, the kPI can determine the successful progress and what needs to be achieved of the project.

Competitive advantage to the Cardano ecosystem is to eventually help drive awareness creation and adoption rate of Cardano blockchain based solution across Africa. Considering that this is an ambitious project, I prefer the team specify which community or country would be the starting point and also, I suggest the team consider a more strategic and advanced offline marketing strategy that would put the platform as a preferred choice for jobseekers. Having developed the platform, the team can consider workshop for students and unemployed graduates(to educate them on the platform) and also consider the traditional media to attract users.

Finally, I see a team with solid expertise and experience within the IT field and  a few in a other areas.
