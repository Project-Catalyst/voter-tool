How can we educate students in Northern Ghana and beyond about Cardano Ecosystem and its benefits?", "f6_no_assessments": 21, "f6_rating": 4.333333333333334, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 4145, "q0": "Reaching out to university and high school students to educate them about Cardano and its opportunities is indeed one of the great initiatives to ensuring that Cardano is well-rooted in Africa as the 'challenge setting 'proposes to achieve. As the saying goes: \"Education is the key to success\", education would definitely be the only mechanism to aid in eliminating the preconceived idea of blockchain being a scam which is noted as one of the major reasons why the participation of the African region in blockchain-related activities is very low statistically comparing to the Western world. This has been a problem for centuries and I am glad to see a solution like this emerging gradually.\n\nWith regards to value addition to the Cardano ecosystem, I think this proposal has done a good articulation. What I feel is quite general and could be improved to increase scores is the use of the phrase \"Number of\" and \"Percentage of\". This creates the impression that the team isn't certain of what to expect from this project. Being more precise by using phrases like \"x% of\" would have helped the community's judgment on the impact while not holding them to the bar of providing specific figures.\n\nI see about 90% metric alignment from this proposal as far as the 'challenge setting' is concerned. The scope and metrics of this proposal cover not less than 5 of the 7 main KPIs of the challenge setting and thus indicating that the proposal is a good fit for this 'challenge setting'.\n\nAdoption has been a challenge in Africa and continues to remain a challenge due to the lack of comprehensive education. Years back, people regarded electricity as a demon creature and hence refrained from its usage and adoption until after some time where they received comprehensive education on what electricity is and why it's a great invention and not a 'demon' as they see it to be. Blockchain and as a matter of fact, Cardano has the same case here. One of the major future problems likely to be encountered would be adoption. However, since this proposal is to educate the university and high school students who are by far the immediate next nation leaders, I see the futuristic problems being addressed by it.\n\nThe proposer indicated that he might return to the Catalyst to request more funds to conduct another line of workshops like this if the need be. But of course, I think he will come back to Catalyst to request more to do more since there are not only 1,000 university and high school students in Northern Ghana for him to reach out to with this great initiative. Therefore, a clear plan on how this project would be sustainable in the future would have been great.\n\nWith regards to my humble submission stated above, I score the impact for this project 4 out of 5.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "From his Twitter feed, thanks to the link provided in this proposal, it is clear that Jeremiah Baani who is the proposer for this project is blockchain-enthused personnel. Some of his posts confirm his statement of having done this before in his project description and also his capability to deliver the role being assigned. However, little information was provided for Mustapha Yakubu who is listed as a team member in the proposal. The proposer only provided information on what role he will be playing which is good but no information on his relevant expertise with regards to that role can be found despite the link to his Twitter profile being provided. I thought I could get more relevant information from there as I did for Jeremiah but unfortunately the outcome was minimal. It is of course stated in his profile that he is an \"events and project manager\", and \"youth leader and advocate\" but no extra information like posts of activities to confirm.\nWada, on the other hand, is a great entity in the community of which if not for all, the majority of the community can attest to the great contributions they have brought to the scaling of Cardano as far as Africa is concerned for over a year now. Being assigned as the project overseer is something feasible as Wada has the capabilities. From the Wada website, I see about 23 team members listed of which Jeremiah and Mustapha are inclusive. This leaves me to believe that they are already part of the Wada force which has been delivering great contributions to the Cardano ecosystem and thus feasible to get the work done if funded. However, the proposer could have done even a better job by listing exactly who is or are going to take up the supervision role just so as to help us judge against the budget.\n\nAn amount of 26,000 USD being requested to execute this project is feasible in a general sense but the breakdown raises so many questions that should have been answered in the project description but were not and thus renders me skeptical. For instance, the proposer quotes an amount of 5,000 USD for the transportation, feeding, and accommodation of resource persons but now information has been provided on how many resource persons would be needed for successful implementation and where they will be traveling from. The absence of this information makes it hard to determine whether or not the allocation is feasible or not and hence proposer should consider including such information. Also, I am left with no option but to question the amount stated for the \"resource persons honorarium\" since I do not know exactly how many people are entitled to this amount of money (1,600 USD).\nThe rest of the budget breakdown looks okay for me except for the fact that the proposer could have provided more transparency by telling us how many quiz winners would be announced and what percentage of the 2,000 USD they will be receiving respectively.\n\nThe proposal, from my perspective, comes with a broad roadmap that fails to discuss exactly what would be done at what time, by whom, and even at what rate. It is only mentioned in the proposal that they intend to use 1-3 months for the project implementation but exactly what would be done in week 1 through to the last week remains unknown to the community. I advise that the proposer considers this, as it's very useful for progress tracking of the project despite the conductible plan provided in the proposal.\n\nThe proposer does well to address the risk of permission granted by institutions likely to be delayed but I think that may not be the only risk. Just so you know, students are quite skeptical with exposure to content they do not understand. In this regard, what is the plan to ensure that students (at least 1,000) as quoted in the proposal show up at the event to grab their share of the education?\n\nLastly, the proposer refuses to tell the community that he or any of his team members are involved in any other proposals in Fund9 but background research indicates that Wada is involved in not less than 5 different proposals in Fund 9.\n\nPer my submissions stated above, my score for the feasibility of this deduces to 3 as I remain skeptical.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is quite unfortunate that the proposal refused to capture exactly how the project's progress can be tracked by the community. From the proposal, there's a YouTube link attachment that leads to a CTEIL video titled \"Masterclass 2022 Lesson 1: Introduction To Blockchain\" which was presented by Jeremiah Baani. In his presentation, he made mention that he is the lead for that project, and for that, I was thinking he could use that channel as a public medium of reporting progress reports to the community since there's no plan of developing a YouTube channel or website to take care of that.\n\nThe proposal refuses to give a clear roadmap that details what needs to be done and at what time. As argued in my feasibility note, the information provided as a roadmap is only vague and thus has no milestones to measure as far as implementation is concerned. A clear roadmap like (x and x are to be done in week 1 with an expected outcome of y and y) would have been a great supplement to the proposal.\n\nAlthough the team has showcased a good level of understanding of the targeted problem and a solution that can be measured against the problem outcome, it is not enough to clear my doubts regarding auditability as most relevant questions were incorrectly answered in the proposal. This leaves my score at 3 out of 5. However, I wish to extend the best of wishes to the proposer and urge him not to give up if not funded but to pay attention to the PA feedback in order to help him put together a great proposal for subsequent iterations since the idea is superb!", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2518", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5545, "q0": "The idea is wonderful. Education is one of the effective means by which people can be well informed about Cardano blockchain. The proposal seeks to raise the awareness of university/college and high school students about Cardano blockchain and the opportunities available, and hence the proposal tackles the critical issues of the challenge setting. Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge seeks to expand the Cardano ecosystem in the African continent, with this proposal, that vision can be achieved in the long run. The value that cardano would derive from this project cannot be overlooked. It\u2019s clear that the proposer/team seeks to shape students through the education to become competent Community Advisors (CAs), referrers, proposers and active community members in general, hence I believe that this would help increase the number of active participants in the various catalyst roles and also to ensure that participants are well informed on the roles they have taken up. All Project Catalyst roles require the necessary skills and training in order to provide constructive feedback to the entire ecosystem, the proposer is actually concerned with that, and that for me is a plus to cardano. I like the idea that the proposer seeks to help students create native wallets and consequently create new Ada holders because this would help to increase number of voters and hence would promote a fair representation and decision making in project catalyst. One of the key metrics of the proposal seeks to measure the number of students who attend the team\u2019s cardano conferences: this for me is very necessary to ascertain the number of students/participants that have interest in the blockchain\u2019s opportunities. \nAlso, the measurement of the percentage of students that become Community advisors and proposers are expedient to ensure valid assessments and brilliant projects respectively as far as project catalyst is concerned. There are other key metrics and all of them align with the challenge setting .\nGoing through the goals of the project, I see that they are in congruence with the challenge. \nA proposal of this nature has high chances of increasing the number of people who are currently in the cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe African continent is considered as deprived not because of the absence of good and excellent intellectuals but due to the fact that the African people are not exposed to golden opportunities like this: so with this proposal the African people can be well informed about cardano and contribute to benefit both the ecosystem and themselves.\nWith all these stated above, I believe this proposal is impactful.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It\u2019s clear that the proposer/team have been engaging in cardano blockchain education for sometime now considering the fact that evidence of their meetups with participants have been provided. They have provided links to prove they are members of WADA and also there is a video that supports the fact that the team have been embarking on blockchain education. With the above relevant experience, I believe that the team is well skilled and capable of implementing the project. Also the team to the proposal is not vague. The proposal has clearly stated the team members and their relevant experience. Members of the team are also members of WADA, and that for me shows they are the right team for the task. \nGoing through the budget, I realize that there is a great deal of clarity in it, the reason been that cost of every sub-item is clearly stated. However, I believe that the cost of \u201c transportation, feeding, accommodation of resource personnel\u201d which is $5000 could have been cut down a bit so that it can create room for easy funding. All the same, considering the nature of the proposal, the budget stated is reasonable to cater for the expenses. The team intends to execute the project within 3 months which happens to fall within the time frame of the challenge, and also the time duration in this sense would give the team enough time to engage students in the targeted schools. \nWithin the 3 months, the team seeks to reach out to atleast 1000 tertiary and high students in northern Ghana through conferences/meetups. I believe this creates the impression of the possibility of reaching out to the stated number of students because organizing conferences and meetups where there is a mass attendance of students would really help the team realize the 1000 students they anticipate at the end of the conferences.\nThe team also expects to hold about 10 face-to-face community events when funded, this is great but however, I feel that more face-to-face meetups can be created within the 3 months life span of the project. This would help to accommodate for more participants. I also understand that the team would also have online session with students, probably that would cover up for the limited face-to-face meetups, though it\u2019s not clearly stated as to the number of sessions that would be held online.\nCardano is written in Haskell. It\u2019s great to see that the team would factor in preparing students to have interest in learning the coded language. Going through the proposal, it does not appear like participants/students would be taught Haskell by the team but rather the team would raise their awareness and those that have interest in learning the language can pursue to achieve that. That\u2019s actually a great move.\nThe team have indicated a risk which is that there might be delay in approval of letters by school authorities to hold conferences. The management of the risk provided in the proposal is very efficient, because if letters are sent earlier before event start, it would help the team to be sure if permission is granted or otherwise and that will also prevent time wastage.\nAt this, I can say that considering information provided with regards to the project\u2019s feasibility, I believe that the project is feasible.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap presented in the proposal is quite comprehensive as it\u2019s easy to know how the project activities would be carried out. As stated earlier, the team wishes to reach out to atleast 1000 students within 3 months and realize about 200 active participants, that for me is a clear milestone for this caliber of project. The time frame for the project as stated is expected to be 3 months: that\u2019s stated clearly.\n\nGoing through the metrics, I believe the team wisely chose them. The proposal is geared towards educating students about Cardano and later on on-board them into the ecosystem; the metrics stated in the proposal are good to define its success.\nThe problem the team is communicating is that tertiary and high school students in northern Ghana are not aware of cardano blockchain so they are seeking to educate the students through conferences and meetups. With this, I think that there is clarity in the problem, solution and how the proposal is aligned with them. If the problem of students unawareness about the blockchain is tackled, then the proposed outcome of the proposal would be achieved. I would say that, the metrics/KPIs chosen are good indicators for evaluating the success of the project.\n\nThe solution provided in the proposal is clear and understandable. \nThe team has stated that WADA would play a supervisory role in the execution of the project. However, there are many other channels that the team can use to communicate the project\u2019s progress to the community. Social media platforms like Facebook, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Twitter just to name but a few are good grounds where community members can monitor or track the implementation because almost every community member is on atleast one of these platforms. The team can factor in this in future proposals as it would create room for public accessibility.\nHaving stated all the above, I am confident that the proposal is auditable.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2713", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 461, "q0": "This proposal can be categorized as an onboarding effort for newbies. This is due to the materials they will be educating on, which are general information on Cardano and blockchain with an exception on the topic of Project Catalyst. As is, without considering the competing similar proposals, this would indeed instigate initial enquiries regarding on how to be more involved in most likely Project Catalyst.\n\nIt also is a offline or face-to-face event which is more effective than online events in numerous ways. First is the potential of having instantaneous connections with groups of individuals which can spark on-the-spot future collaboration. This is what typically happen when we are in social setting, there is a tendency to gravitate towards individuals we have connection with. Online meetings, prohibits that instantaneous connections, it takes numerous online meetings to achieve a mutual understanding. Though in the future, as we are more used to WFH, our social tendencies most likely will evolve and become more effective in communicating online.\n\nThe situation in Africa is that not all areas have the infrastructure to support a comprehensive online experience.

How will the Community Advisor (which is now Proposal Assessor) education materials be communicated? Where will this training take place? When will it take place?\n\nThere are many discrepancies that permeate also into the budget. It is very generalistic and also does not mirror the proposer intended program.

The solution creates events to allow people to share experiences, learn about Blockchain and Cardano, and find the right talent. The main objective of the proposal is in line with the challenging settings at F9 and solves the stated problem. Community events for students, high school students in Ghana have impact on the process of learning blockchain knowledge, students have potential in the development of Cardano, they can be developers providing projects for the ecosystem. Participating in events is also an opportunity for students to add new concepts to blockchain. More specifically, both the author, who has been a lecturer and blockchain advocate for many years, has organized a series of online classes to introduce education on blockchain. This has a big impact on students, students who build trust and see job opportunities for the future with Blockchain and Cardano. Students, who are future developers, are ambitious and will make a great contribution to Cardano.
