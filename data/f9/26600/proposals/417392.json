I found this team proposal to have a very positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem. Of course, this will take time when this proposal is implemented. But in the immediate future, we can see its impact on the people's knowledge of some African teachers and students mathematics. We easily understand that once the Cardano ecosystem develops, it will help a lot for Africa - a continent that is being considered less developed and backward than the rest of the world.

If the identity is not disclosed, the community will not appreciate the feasibility of the proposal. So when I advise you to quickly add identity information about the member. Regarding the allocation of policies, it is quite detailed and clear, with the goal of training math teachers. I wonder if your team has any other members besides the 2 members, Angela and Anne? Because I see that the plan is made and the way to execute it is clear that requires more than 2 employees to do it. I am very interested in practical resources, especially human resources. Technologists have a very good idea of using the Haskell language. Haskell is a difficult programming language, it requires a lot of student thinking, but students who have experienced it successfully will be the ones who can contribute greatly to the development of Cardano. The risk is already in the proposal (you have difficulty with blockchain), I see it as an obstacle to implementing this proposal. Because the Cardano blockchain is closely related to the Haskell programming language. But you have difficulty with blockchain, so will this proposal work smoothly?

I asked if the team has considered a long-term plan to improve Haskell programming for the time of writing proposals to apply for funding in the next Funds? The milestones for the implementation of the proposal are clear, but in my opinion, the team still lacks a roadmap of steps to carry out the work associated with the months in a year. I continue to recommend adding this because it increases the auditability of the proposal. Then the community and PAs will trust the proposal and the team more. You have listed the necessary KPIs (standards for recruiting teachers and students). What I like about this suggestion is that the problem description is easy to understand and the solution attached.
