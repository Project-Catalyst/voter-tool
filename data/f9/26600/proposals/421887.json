The main issue to tackle here is the lack of inclusiveness at COP27 resulting in blind decision-making. The second issue is Cardano not being present at the event that is the solution to the 1st issue.\n\nI am not convinced that the problem statement defines a problem within the challenge when trying to answer wether the SCC does prepare Africa for a future of wide-scale Cardano adoption? This being said, it does fit within offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns.\n\nThe proposal would lead to a positive impact on the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem in terms of awareness however it doesn't seem to have a direct practical impact for the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal doesn't clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem beyond the fact that blockchain and Cardano will be discussed at the event. The direct results/consequences for Cardano are difficult to quantify, I will therefore rate IMPACT a 3/5.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer gave a good account of what experience will be necessary to deliver on the proposal and provided a description of who the team members are, including their roles and some past work. \nThe budget is outlined clearly, understandable and broken down into identifiable items (Community-building long-run effort, Summit team preparation, Summit coverage with IT support and facilitation, Feedback, monitoring impact, and reporting, financial management). The budget makes sense and seems reasonable to achieve the set goals.\nThe proposer provided a list of actionable tasks and order of execution, and a clear timeline for the project ( 6 months breakdown from June to end of year). Given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a roadmap with milestones and a time horizon for achievement, as well as KPIs for the success for the event (1000 participants globally, 154 million people reached). I will argue that the KPIs are valid for the event, but lack of Cardano-specific KPIs (number of Cardano partnerships, number of Cardano/Catalyst attendants, number of Cardano speak time or events, and Cardano adoption in future innovations or solutions). Given the KPIs and nature of this proposal, the community should be able to easily track the progress of this proposal. I would rate AUDITABILITY a 3 out of 5.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2040", "no_vca": 18, "ne": 2, "ng": 16, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2433, "q0": "We realize that the event aims to transmit knowledge about blockchain during a lecture cycle, emphasizing how technology and Cardano can contribute to the evolution of the African continent. Thus, we have that the proposal is aligned with the objectives of the challenge, in the same way that its success would help in the resolution of local problems, so there is the possibility of a positive impact in the medium, long and long term. However, given the duration of the event (24 hours), it seems that the budget being requested is very high. Possibly a more lasting impact would be achieved if this amount were allocated to lectures spread over more days so that the engagement lasts longer. Even as the material gets recorded, the event seems too momentary for longer-term relationships to form, which seems to be the most important point here.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the ways chosen for the project to be executed, we found a good action plan, with consistent and well-organized activities, which evolve gradually. We say this because in the timeline we find steps that range from the organization and establishment of initial partnerships, to the execution of the event itself and the subsequent data collection. About the professionals involved and who will carry out these steps, we can see that they have considerable familiarity with the subject, having experience in social causes involved with other developing nations. In addition, their CVs were made available so that their experiences could be proven. However, once again it seems to us that the problem is mainly in relation to the budget being requested. In the breakdown of the budget, we can find, for example, that the largest allocation of capital ($11,000, approximately 38% of the total) is going to the long-term effort to create the community. But this doesn't seem very consistent with the daily scope of the event and we're not very confident in saying that these relationships will last (after the event) in order to justify the allocation. In general, we can think like this in relation to the general expenses with the event.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to track progress, we note that relevant indicators were chosen, especially when measuring the local impact, the partnerships formed and the number of participants. These parameters make it easier for us to understand whether the desired connections are actually being formed. Although the exposure of the results to the public was mentioned, we miss the indication of how this transmission will be done, which would be the tool used for this. Furthermore, regarding the perception of the project's success, it seems very important that some goals had been established that would make it easier for us to understand whether the event was successful or not. These goals could be, for example, a number of new projects that emerged from the knowledge acquired during the event.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6144, "q0": "Africa is the second most populous and second largest continent in the world.

People. people, communities, developed societies and developed ecosystems. I think the proposal was detailed and richly described. The focus of the event is on addressing climate finance and agriculture in Africa, becoming a platform for transparency, cooperation and support, and gathering communities for diverse, positive climate solutions. . It is very positive that the author of the proposal has set several KPIs right from the beginning of the impact analysis of the proposal. It proves that the author has precise goals, knows what he will do, how to achieve the ultimate goal is the success of the project.

Regarding the plan of the proposal, the author provides us with background information to evaluate this section. The first is about the route. The proponent cites the goals to be achieved in 6 months. To build relationships and execute strategies to help mentor sustainable growth. There is a problem here, the author provides information that planning for 6 months. However, the analysis is presented from June to December of January. So how long will the project be implemented and completed? The roadmap in each month is still presented by the author very specifically for each work to be done. We know what work will be done to get to the end result of the project. Finally on the budget, the Proposal asks for a budget of $29.000. With the following objectives: Efforts to build long-term community; Preparing the team for the summit, and some other work... is explained in detail about each budget for each task to be performed in the project.

She clearly presented a strategy that has the potential to generate value for the community.\n\nAn improvement worth considering would be to exemplify how initiatives similar to this one have previously generated scalable results.
