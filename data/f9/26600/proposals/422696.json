Their proposed solution does lack some information and could be improved by adding a small summary of their plan or what tools or way they will reach the goal of more adoption in Africa. The proposer/s stated that one of their risks would be unfairness in a selection process and then that the solution would be to make the process fair. Adding some more details to how it will be fair and how the process will happen would be a good addition to this proposal.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposer/s have done a good job with their budget breakdown and have clearly explained what each part of the $75 000 is for.

This proposal with the connection of Asian - African youth will indirectly solve the goal set in the Challenge. The team also identified the issue that needs to be addressed, which is to strengthen youth cooperation between Africa and Asia. It is also a cultural exchange between the two continents. I think this is beneficial for the development of Africa, although the benefits are not immediate, it will have a long-term impact and tend to be of spiritual value. Specialized communication platforms and global conferences both offline and online will be held via the Cardano blockchain. This adds value to the Cardano ecosystem both now and in the future. Specifically in the future, this proposal can scale up to create youth connections between all continents (that's my thinking). Then the exchange of cultures and ideas will become strong between all continents. It is especially beneficial for Africa when they can absorb new things and advances of the world. What I want to suggest to the team here is that the team can better explain the contents of the exchange between the two young African and Asian - with clear benefits for the community to understand better. about the impact of the proposal. From there, the community will accurately determine the impact of this proposal and have the most standard assessment. I agree with the impact of the proposal but I apologize to the team for considering my comments to further improve the proposal, especially when it comes to practical application. I vote 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to the presentation, the proponent has experience working in several global Youth organizations with leadership roles for 10 years and has been working with Seeds for the Future. This partly makes the proposal feasible. However, the team mentioned the names of 3 core members, but I did not see attached documents to prove it and did not see links to social networks to clarify the publicity of these members' identities. This will make the community and PA doubt the feasibility of the proposal and reduce the credibility of the team. My advice to the team is that you add the identity and background of all members as soon as possible. We all know that specifying the name of the number of members as well as publicizing the identity of the team members is important to prove the feasibility of the proposal. That's why I expect the team to work this out quickly.\nRegarding the budget, the presentation is quite sketchy. The budget is broken down into categories but it doesn't seem right to the goal because the team failed to demonstrate the adequacy of the amount requested from the Catalyst fund. I would like to emphasize the role of public budget analysis, which plays an important role in demonstrating the feasibility of the proposal. Hopefully, the team quickly adds a more thorough analysis of the budget and reasonably attaches the amount per job. That's my advice on the budget. If the Catalyst funding has not been received, will the team continue to implement the proposal? Is organization funding available from youth organizations? This question should be answered or presented to the community so that people can better understand the feasibility of the proposal.\nThe team has a plan and how to implement it, but I consider it a sketchy representation. You only provided a list of things to do, not a specific analysis to better demonstrate its feasibility for the community. I continue to advise the team to analyze carefully the plan and how to implement it to increase the persuasion of the proposal's feasibility.\nWith the resources needed to make it happen, I don't know of any other members other than the three key members of the team that was originally named. Certainly, to carry out such a continental proposal, the team needs to have more than 3 members, maybe collaborators from youth communities to support the work. Unfortunately, I did not see the team mention any other members with relevant documentation. Thus, it is difficult for the community to trust the prestige of the team. At this point, I would like to note that the team should supplement the list of personnel to implement, this is extremely necessary to confirm the feasibility of the proposal. Have you ever thought about hiring outside experts to suggest better practices? Of course, depending on the actual situation of the implementation of the proposal, the team may consider whether to hire an expert or not. But for me, hiring an expert has a huge advantage in that the team can interact with the best people in the world who specialize in their expertise, from which you can learn a lot from them. (experts).\nTechnical and technological aspects: Although introduced in the proposal to use blockchain technology, the team was very sketchy in presenting and explaining how this platform applies in the proposal. I think this is a shortcoming that needs to be filled in immediately because the technical and technological factor is key in connecting Asia and Africa, especially the application of today's advanced technology, the Cardano blockchain. Not to mention whether the team thought about releasing the project's NFT? Or other advanced features such as smart contracts closely related to the Cardano blockchain platform?\nThe only thing that satisfied me in showing the feasibility of the proposal was that the team raised the risks associated with the implementation. It includes the risk of government officials, claims of unfairness, and connectivity problems that will occur in some countries. That is, I have not mentioned other potential risks that will arise in the case of insufficient human resources or insufficient financial resources.\nIn summary, I feel the team needs to have many additional points to confirm the feasibility of the proposal. Notes on additional comments have been provided by me in the form of advice. Hopefully, the team will continue to perfect the proposal so that it can be effectively applied in the future. I disagree with the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Roadmap and milestones associated with time are almost not shown in the proposal. This greatly affects the transparency and auditability of the proposal. It inconveniences the community when the audit evaluation makes the community more suspicious. Why don't you time add specific timelines and milestones to the proposal? Because without it, the proposal would be greatly affected by unclear transparency. Performance indicators such as KPIs or global human rights indexes are also not shown. Key metrics are also absent. These are major disadvantages in terms of transparency and auditability. We all know that KPIs and key metrics are an essential basis on which to accurately evaluate whether the proposal is implemented transparently and effectively. Therefore, I continue to advise the team to try to understand and add indicators to increase the transparency and auditability of the proposal. While the definition of what success looks like in this proposal is just a healthy community with active members. Does the team think about other indicators such as: How many young members from different continents participate in the exchange, etc...? Throughout the proposal, the problem described seems to be easy to understand with a workaround, but with careful PA - vPA, they will probably be more demanding on how to describe the problem - solution. must achieve depth and thoroughly solve the problem. All of my advice is positive and I want to contribute to the improvement of the thesis every day. I look forward to consulting with the team to improve the current proposal.

When you are asking a community to fund your concept for $75,000 you really need to answer all relevant questions, pertaining to the Challenge. As a PA I hope all proposals get the same diligence by the Proposers, no matter the dollar ask.  First you should state and then explain what your proposal is for so the PAs and the voters can understand, and it should be relevant to the Challenge it is in. First, your short answer Proposal as stated is:     \"Setting up specialized platforms of communication\", with your long (unlimited) answer for your proposal of : \"Despite the plethora of platforms available for communication and connection, and the abundance of learning resources\".

The only mention of Africa is in your title. You include nothing about Cardano or how this project would help the continent of Africa.\n----------------------------------------------------\nMy assessment for the reasons stated above is a 1 (Strongly disagree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge) star.\n    \"Create and set up global conferences both offline and online to maintain that culture\" ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The first step take in assessing a proposal for its Feasibility of success is to look at and check the credentials of the team leader and any team members listed.

Two things that are very important in this proposal is they focus on young people, who are very creative and strategic, and also connection or networking. I can't be more agree that to educate and connecting young people can be very beneficial to the ecosystem. My main concern for the proposal is the goal of the networking platform. It is good to unite them, but what are the purposes? Are there any educations that will be given to them? Are there any integrations with developers or Cardano's Africa/ Asia communities? A group without clear purposes won't be strategical to move forward. Key metrics and goals of the proposal should be sharper and shown the benefit for this Afro-Asian networking project.

What the team means by allowance for the period $10.000 and the cost of contingency is too big $10.000 without detail explanations.
