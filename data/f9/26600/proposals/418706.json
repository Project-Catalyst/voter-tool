By using smart contracts, it offers transparency in transactions and ensures that disbursements are made only on the desired terms.\n\nThe proposal also hopes to create a stake pool for which they have already identified individuals willing to delegate a minimum of 2,000,000 in ADA for this pilot project, which will also help increase Cardano's participation in the country's economy.\n\nThe metrics that the team set out to evaluate its success, such as the number of students and teachers at the MCA school with Cardano accounts, the number of smart contracts or projects implemented, and the operability of the stake pool mentioned above, are also aligned to the challenge as they are concrete ways to identify the impact of the project in bringing new users to the ecosystem and its positive influence in the community.\n\nFor all of the above, my impact evaluation is a 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Having been funded in Fund 6 (bit.ly/3AwTiur), the team clearly describes the plan and resources needed for this second phase of their project, bringing evidence of their achievements. This gives me confidence that the team is prepared and has the necessary skills to implement this proposal. Even so, they remind us who they are and their background, with a brief description of each one of them. Both the photos from the events, the presentations and the documentation of the teachers' profiles provided in the proposal, give us a good summary of the objectives completed so far. But beyond the photos, the most relevant thing for me is that the team was able to identify (and show us in this new proposal) the main learnings of Phase I. A project can be a success or a total failure, but whatever the outcome, the most important thing is to capture what was learned and leverage that learning in the following projects, both what went well to continue to do so, as well as what did not end as expected to take corrective actions. This team has also identified the main risks that may affect the success of the proposal: at a financial level, such as the possibility that the price of ADA will fall and not allow them to fully fund themselves, at a technological level, that the continued development of the protocol and smart contracts will stall, and at a personnel level, that they may lose key people such as their smart contract developer. While they took the time to list the aforementioned risks, I believe that at this point the proposal could be more robust by identifying other risks and especially what actions they would take upon their eventual occurrence, so as to strengthen their preparedness. For example, in their Fund6 proposal, they mentioned poor connectivity and lack of internet as a problem, for which they requested $5000 in Capital Expenditures. However, in the current proposal script, they comment that internet access at the site continues to be an issue, finding that MCA stopped purchasing internet data. Given issues like this, is that I suggest to include it in the list of potential risks, and describe what can be done to correct or mitigate them, because if the problem persists, it may affect the success of the proposal. Finally, we can see in the attachments a detailed budget with each line item and its monthly disbursements that seem in line with what is needed to carry out the proposal. What I could suggest, going back to the internet topic, is that I see an item for investment in connectivity equipment, but I do not see that they have considered the monthly cost of data consumption or an Internet data plan. It would be interesting if they could clarify where they will get the funds to maintain the service on a monthly basis. In summary, I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully, I just recommend a few small adjustments so that there is no doubt.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team provides us with a clear roadmap of what they expect after receiving the funds, starting with the implementation of the incentive system through the Math Performance Project, as well as the treasury system with the Website Treasury Pilot Program. They then plan to initiate the governance system with the introduction of the FirstRoot.co Pilot Program. Each of these milestones has clearly defined who will be responsible for them and what is expected to be achieved. Subsequently, they hope to initiate their own stake pool and the implementation of the Smart Contract linking individual donors to MCA's treasury account. \nAs there are multiple challenges, I think it is right that the team has contemplated that the following months will be dedicated to the sustainability of the challenges through continuous improvement, innovation and experimentation, an issue that other proposals do not consider and is extremely important to ensure that ideas do not die after the kick-off. \nRegarding the proposed metrics of having at least 1/3 of the student body involved in smart contracts or related projects, a minimum of 5 donors in a smart contract with MCA students and the establishment of the stake pool, these are achievable goals and at the same time challenging enough to demonstrate the success of the proposal. These are KPIs that can be easily measured without any subjectivity.\nIn terms of auditability, I would only recommend to make a public channel available for delivering regular updates to the community of the progress made, so that we can determine whether the proposed objectives were met in a timely manner. Although the web page www.amodelschool.com is under construction and the theory explaining how the pilot programs will work can already be visualized, the proposal does not mention that they will publish there, or through any other source, which specific objectives have been achieved and the KPIs at the moment. It is of utmost importance that the community has access to this information both for auditing purposes, as well as to promote the success of the project, in order to motivate other schools to do the same, as well as the general public about the different use cases that can be attributed to Cardano with its infinite possibilities.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3161", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4387, "q0": "I feel very interested in the group's proposal. A proposal that has a high impact on young people in Africa in particular, students who are still facing difficulties in learning and living conditions. If this proposal continues to be implemented, it will improve the performance of schools and students in the educational environment. It solves the current urgent problem of people's intelligence that the African community is facing. We all know that improving knowledge and raising people's knowledge is a key conditions for poverty reduction and national development. You have specifically stated the goals you need to achieve success throughout the day. It has a great impact on the Cardano ecosystem now and in the future. It makes sense that even Charles Hoskinson himself was interested in doing work to help developing countries in Africa. I believe that a proposal raised in Fund 6 will continue to be implemented in Fund 9. It will not be difficult if the group is supported to have the conditions to disseminate knowledge about Blockchain Cardano to each student. teachers and other interested people and not just encapsulated in at least a third of the students, 40 students, the board, faculty, and staff... Key indicators and goals are also relevant to Challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I found the team members to have the expertise and experience to implement the proposal. However, I would like to comment on the listing of the members' identities, which is the group that needs a quote with a link in the social network for the community to easily view and follow. It is also a way to improve the community's confidence and feasibility of the proposal. Regarding the photo quality of the members, I completely trust and support them. For the budget is also listed in detail, reasonable. I like how you laid out the plan and how it was done. It's a continuation of what you did from Fund 6. Just keep the impact, feasibility, and transparency of the proposal plus the quality of the resources needed to do it (including resources). about human resources), then you continue to have support from the community. The group also saves quite a lot of martial arts and related risks: finance, technology, and human resources. I haven't seen you document how to tackle the challenges. These are challenges that any proposal can face. Technologically, it's a pity that I haven't seen the team specify the Cardano protocol used. For me, the team needed to complement the presentation on the technical side of the technology.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has outlined a specific program. I wish the team could show the whole way through the 6th Fund proposal so far so that the community can be full of people, what the members have been doing so far. It is also a way to increase the transparency of the proposal. I have no doubt the problem is well defined, to understand. I've seen you measure project success or not. Thereby, I would like to comment on how to measure the project, that is, based on the progress of the work completed and the results for the community after the work is completed. The team can also invite the community to participate in filling out the reference sheet to get a better idea of \u200b\u200bthe community's feedback on what's good and bad. From there, the team has a basis to recover and improve the things that exist or do not work well. Another thing I'm concerned about is that although you already have a way to measure job completion, it doesn't show metric KPIs. You should consider adding numeric KPIs only to the proposal because digital KPIs are just a great way to get the job done. In the end, I have full confidence in the success of the proposal and a good future for the children of Africa.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2552", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7636, "q0": "The problem described in this proposal is closely aligned with the challenge.
