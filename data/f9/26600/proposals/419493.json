The project budget is clearly outlined, and detailed, and does seem appropriate for what the team is trying to achieve in this challenge. Some constructive feedback I have is that the project needs more clear goals and metrics that will make it easier to understand how it will align with the outlined challenge settings.  One concern I do have is that the proposal states\" Where to start? The problem is so big and we feel so powerless.\" The team has various members that are from Africa or have worked in Africa for quite a while yet no clear risks were stated that would prevent the project from having an impact on this challenge. While it is great to want to dive in and get further information to identify key areas, the team should have a general sense of the risks this proposal would have before submitting the proposal. My suggestion here would be to think about the risk that could derail the overall impact of Cardano4Climate Africa. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "With the information presented in the proposal, I find that this proposal does not provide much information that would lead to the ability to accurately audit the progress and impact of the project.

Competency Strengths: The proposal is a partnership between WADA, Africa Town Hall and Cardano4Climate. In theory, the idea is to support climate initiatives related to the Cardano blockchain. The plan is outlined in 3 specific parts: Key activities, roadmap and deliverables. In the main activity section, the group clearly presented what activities will be carried out. The roadmap is presented with tasks over time (months). And the products will be delivered. However, could the team be more specific, where will the meetings be, who will attend and how many days, hours/weeks? Overall, from the plan we have laid out, we have a clear understanding of what will have to be done to get to the desired end result. Next is the budget. The team suggested $14,500. That's a pretty low percentage of the total budget challenge, and it's well explained. Funds are allocated to each job hourly (monthly). The team also provided further details that they will start operating in July supported by the C4C global hub.
