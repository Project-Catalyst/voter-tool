Boots on the ground that understand the knicks and knacks of local nuances. First and most lowest hanging fruit in terms of onboarding onto Cardano is indeed the Project Catalyst community. Most specifically the engaging program called Proposal Assessor (PA). Involving oneself in PA, not only educates on the whole of Cardano community and all its branch out possibilities there also lies potential compensation. From there, what usually happens is a number of inspired individuals further involves themselves in their respective community representatives in Cardano. Or the holy grail, they create their own project and ask funding through Project Catalyst. The dawn of Cardano in Africa and all other places, starts from boots on the ground, from Catalyst School education and develops from there.\n\nThe onboarding format is there, it is slowly being proven real-time all that it needs is a continuation. Eventually Cardano will be a household name as the blockchain that truly cared for the community and not just businesses.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As a previously funded proposer with almost similar action plan, whom achieve what they intended to do and has successfully reported their achievements to the Cardano community, there should be no doubt, their continuation efforts will go as successful or even better.

Though perhaps in the future, as a development of this proposal, they could also target the growth on involvement onto Project Catalyst.

For instance, how many messages from the community do you anticipate there will be on each of your channels, how many community members do you anticipate there will be on each of your channels in the future, etc. It shouldn't be difficult for you to map out additional precise KPIs as you already have a baseline of Telegram group members, Discord users, and previously held meetings.

If possible, directly give the name of 4 higher education institutions where your team can plan the session. Since you specified Ashanti Region as the area, I don't think this should be too challenging for you. Finally, because you already know what proportion of attendees will sign up to join the Cardano community following the first workshop, it would be beneficial if you provided the exact estimate for these two workshops as well.

The students and youth will also know about cryptocurrency because currently cryptocurrency knowledge is very little in the country and in the continent as a whole, I for one only got to know about this a few weeks ago and so I think all these are some of the ways to get a lot of the youth that are in their hideout to know about Project catalyst and cardano ecosystem which will bring some liberation on to our tertiary students and the youths as a whole in Ghana and in Africa at large. The team also intend training youths or young people in marketable skills to boost their chances of escaping poverty and also training them in another way which will include technical and computer skills, these and many others are the reasons for the proposal and this I think if funded the proposal will be carried out successfully by the proposer and her team.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has made it clear in the proposal that she has been a proposer and her proposal was funded and that she has run the program in a successful way which is still ongoing with that experience in the first workshop of her  'Ghana Youth Onboarding Outreache' she stand tall to make this program a success if funded again.

How many sessions are you planning to hold with the funding of 5500 USD? This has to do with planning and execution. As well as the necessary resources (mainly human resources). What I am wondering is, if the number of sessions is small, will it have a significant impact on young people in Ghana? I will be satisfied if the results of this proposed phase 2 implementation are at least the same as the phase 1 you have implemented before. My view is that if you can organize as many seminars and youth community exchanges in Ghana, the better it will be for the development of the Cardano community and ecosystem, as well as the amount of knowledge. on Cardano, Catalyst will be more transmitted. Regarding the challenge and risks involved, I am pleased with the way you have worded the risk and how to overcome it. It is true that the deployment of Cardano in a continent with a low population still faces many obstacles.

From there, filter the data and know how successful it is after the seminars, meetings, and knowledge sessions are over. Finally, you can clarify the details: \"During this phase 2, Yoroi wallet will be opened to the participants, thus addressing the key metrics of the challenge\". I understand the role of the Yoroi wallet in the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem. But why does the Yoroi wallet resolve key metrics when it is opened?

Getting Ghana's student environment to know the ground rules of Cardano blockchain technology will open up a whole new world of solutions and challenges in tackling poverty and socio-economic injustice. Empowering these young entrepreneurs with intellectual and economic resources might change their actual real communities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is the continuation of the first Ghana Youth Onboarding Outreach project which is proud to share their 200 registered students. The enthusiasm shown by students inspired the team to design this second course. Given the already achieved success by this experienced team it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully, taking in account they know the groundfield they are working with and the Cardano Catalyst dynamic and functioning. Plan presented in the timeline and budget breakdown seems consistent and clear for an efficient implementation. It is also to highlight the value of continuously working on a solution problem for our Cardano Community as this is the only way to make real transformation and achieve our goals. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Number of registered students and applications is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal although it might be interesting to share with Cardano Community feedback surveys where we can get to zoom in into Ghana students' challenges and impressions. This kind of quality data can be so fruitful for our internal dynamic. It can also be interesting sharing some audiovisual content in a strong social media strategy in order to expand exponentially Cardano Catalyst outreach and widen our horizons and opportunities of drawing in a wide range of newcomers. Auditabilty might be efficient with the information this team has already delivered and as communication channels are already set up, Community shouldn\u2019t find any hurdles in this field.
