This will enable health providers to automatically schedule vaccinations, implement personalised monitoring of the vaccination process, management of medical files and financial transactions in ADA. The scope of this project is to reduce the mortality rate caused by low vaccination numbers or other untreated hereditary factors.\nWhile I find the scope and implementation of the app very powerful and noble, after doing a bit of research I found out that less than 50% of the people in Congo have a mobile phone. While the adoption rate is rising faster than in other countries, I feel it is still extremely low and when in relation to this proposal, I am wondering how much of an impact it can have on the population, if the majority won\u2019t be able to use it? However, I imagine that in cities the mobile users are of a much higher percentage than in rural areas. As such, if the project were to be implemented in a city first and then gradually extended to the rest of the country, perhaps by that time the percentage of phone users will be a lot higher.\nAnother risk they haven\u2019t discussed more in-depth is how can they raise the vaccination rate for people who refuse to take a vaccine shot based on their personal beliefs. Since this is a known problem in western countries, I was wondering how the team would be tackling this situation.\nHowever, I consider the proposal to fit the challenge brief well and to potentially have a wide impact upon the Cardano community.

The plan is a very detailed table with checkmarks, timeframes and details arranged in chronological order. As such, every time a task would be finished, the team would be able to check it on the table, and the community would be able to verify that as well.\nThe budget, on the other hand, is not as detailed as the implementation plan. I appreciate the fact that each task has a clear amount attached to it, but there is no number of hours or hourly rates provided. As such, I am unable to judge whether the amounts are sufficient or reasonable in connection to the development of the project.\nThe team is composed of 4 developers, front, back and full-stack. They have only provided their GitHub links, but in their case, those can offer more info than a LinkedIn profile. The number of commits is large, proving that they have been actively working up until now. As such, based on the details provided, I would add that the team looks capable of implementing the project. \nI will rate this section a 4, since the budget is not exactly complete, but not incomplete either.

Regarding this detail, we found good capital allocations that even take into account the project's marketing. However, as this project aims to operate in the health market and various regulations will be encountered along the way, it would be interesting for professionals from other areas, in addition to development, to also be part of the project team.

The budget is well broken down, expenses are identifiable and within an acceptable range.\n\nThe proposal could be improved if the detailed plan explains more in depth the phase of the integration of blockchain technology, for example the activity of handling payments in cryptocurrencies I want to understand that it is in Ada although it does not specify it, I am not clear which cardano wallet can be used, if the platform will have a connector wallet or if the platform itself will have the functionality to create the wallets for users, how will this onboarding be, etc.\n\nFinally it is important and I recommend to have an additional plan in case additional funding is needed, if the team believes that the probability of that happening is low it is also good to explain why they believe that, these details contribute to a better score and to me as a PA it helps me to have more certainty of the probability that the proposal will be implemented successfully.\n\nIn conclusion it is necessary to address the workload issue due to other proposals submitted, to detail more technical aspects regarding the integration of blockchain technology and to have a plan if more funding is required.\n\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability in catalyst refers to how easy it is for the cardano community to see the progress in the implementation of a proposal, for this it is necessary a clear description of the problem, the proposal meets this point, then a clear description of the solution, this point is also met, it is important a roadmap with identifiable milestones over time, and given the format of the detailed plan also meets this point.\n\nNow it seems to me that there was some confusion on the issue of metrics or how the progress of the implementation of the proposal will be measured, the team argues that they cannot provide this information because it is confidential, but the metrics to measure progress are defined by the team and can be both quantitative and qualitative, these metrics depend on the type of proposal and what the team is interested in measuring depending on how they see the success of the proposal.\n\nIn that sense I could give some examples of metrics, I clarify that I do not have the knowledge or experience in the field, but reading how the team sees the success of the proposal, some metrics could be:\n\nNumber of reminders from the system that prevented missed vaccination appointments, this does not require confidential information just that the user gives feedback on whether or not they attended the scheduled appointment.\n\nThe time a doctor takes to identify a family medical record.\n\nAnd related to Cardano adoption, there can be metrics such as number of new wallets created, number of transactions made with ADA, etc.\n\nIt is important to place metrics to measure progress and also tell the community how this progress will be communicated, as I could not find in the proposal any text referring to communication channels, town halls, websites, social networks and taking into account that the metrics are not described, it is very complicated that the proposal can be audited satisfactorily.\n\nOf course the team would have thought about how to communicate the implementation but it is essential to describe it in the proposal and not omit it.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2575", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Good and fair evaluations.

I like that this proposal seeks to fill this gap. \nThis definitely has a huge local impact on the African health system.

With ideas like this already present in many other ecosystems, they still suffer from a few problems related to governments, medical facilities, third parties taking control of production health sector,... so activities have not yet been brought to life.\n\nReturning to this proposal, the proposal would create an application for (both website and mobile) Management of the prenatal and preschool consultation process (vaccines), detection of the medical history of the ancestors for appropriate treatment, I appreciate that the team did a bachelor's thesis on general injections for women and children (I appreciate that). But the team must define and describe the idea of \u200b\u200bthis application clearly to the developer team, must at least have a report on the activities in the application, the required features that the proponent wants ( for example, manage immunization schedules, medical information, patient records,...). I repeat again, this idea is very humane, but to create a suitable application and achieve success, it is necessary to clarify the plan description, with just a few short paragraphs describing how the solution is The proposal presented will not bring success from application development to communicating people's awareness and making them use this application.\n\nI rate 2 stars, the idea meets the requirements of the challenge, but the plan is not sufficient.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This team surprised me quite a bit, because when the proposal was presented, I still thought that the member of the team was in the health profession and especially related to children and maternity, there was even a thesis about Bachelor's Project on Immunization for Women and Children. However 4 members providing profiles here are programmers and developers, I think the proponent should provide more information about the thesis. This is an advantage, so that we can test our experience. If team members are developers, this is an advantage, because they understand very well the feature requirements needed for an application medical apps (but still need to check their relevant experience) github links can only check experience that they are skilled in application programming, and experienced medical or other related experience cannot be verified.\n\nBefore viewing the source of revenue and profit, I will have a little criticism of the budget. This is a humane idea for the people of Africa, if it doesn't request fund for a proposal, the team can still crowdfund or request for a local budget (if possible), but why is the plan implemented? must begin in September, collecting the necessary data for the system. While waiting for the fund approval, the team can redo a report that fully describes the causes, problems and solutions, and also build a website with basic information (vaccine medical problems please propose to present), or you can include articles that demonstrate the knowledge and importance of vaccines for children and pregnant women,... there is a lot of work that can be started right away, why did the team start planning in September?\n\nIn addition, the vaccination will have to be certified by a doctor at the hospital or not? The proponent needs to show how this app will reach hospitals and convince the agencies to agree to this app work? The construction and implementation of the application will have a time limit of 4 months, in the 4th month (December - here the proponent wrote the wrong route) there has been activity for User tests of the functionalities carried out on the mutual health insurance (previous period) and put online, but the proponent has not mentioned such activities (where does the user come from, how will this application be introduced to the people of Africa...) .\n\nThe budget is nearly 27,000 USD, almost 80% is for application development, it is recommended to clarify the roles of the four d?eveloppers, who will be responsible for what application criteria, how long it will take to complete into, Health Insurance fonctionalities - what does this feature include? The Cryptocurrency budget part is $4250, I don't understand here what it represents to support the application, the proponent needs to clarify this section.\n\nThe plan and budget are having unrealistic and interrelated issues, so I rate 2 stars.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I disagree with the proponent's point, \"At this time, we are not prepared to make this information available because of the confidentiality of health information.

However, it is essential to provide the progress proposal (this application) to reach the health ministries, this certifies the developing proponent and introduces their ideas to the needy parties (hospitals are where children and pregnant women, and they also need information about vaccines and follow up on their medical records or timing of vaccinations).\n\nI strongly disagree with the proponent's point of view, as there are a lot of metrics, information, or activities that can be published so that the community can track progress.
