Web 3.0, NFT and digital economy livelihoods aren\u2019t easily accessible nor comprehended. ", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.6666666666666665, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1680, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is very interesting, and it certainly aligns with the objectives of the challenge. The proposed problem is that many artists in Africa do not have easy access to Web 3 technologies, nor do they understand them. As much as Africa is a giant economic power, with about 13 billion dollars being added to the global market in 2018 (data provided by the proponent); and also that some of the continent's countries, such as Nigeria and South Africa, are avid consumers of NFTs, these difficulties are still real. Therefore, to circumvent such problems, the proponent suggests a kind of mentorship, as I understand it, for local artists. A platform called Art Suite would be created, where a person who understands about blockchain and NFTs (the so-called agent) would educate the artist in question about the opportunities of digital art. Some of the jobs these agents would do are described by the excerpt: \u201cLocate and educate any suitable arts agents in Africa who recognize themselves in the Cardano spirit / Creating educational material that African artists\u2019 agents can use in any meetings or workshops they may organize / Agents coaching in online meetings\u201d. With this, it is expected that this artist can enter the Cardano community as a creator of CNFTs, generating income for him and contributing to the popularization of our blockchain, which meets the objectives of the challenge. However, I have some observations to make regarding the impact of the proposal. First, what would the Art Suite platform look like? It is not clear if it would be a website, perhaps a physical space, some kind of online exhibition\u2026 I would like more details to be given in relation to what this technology would be, after all. My second observation concerns the work of agents. It is briefly described what they would do, I think more explanations are in order here. How would educational materials be created? We know that there are already several materials on youtube teaching about Cardano, what is blockchain, cryptocurrencies, NFTs and etc. What would be the differential of the materials generated here? It would be interesting if the proponent had attached an example of material to the proposal, so that we could understand what language he intends to use, in what way (writing, pictures, videos) he intends to pass on the content, in which languages \u200b\u200bas well\u2026 I would also like to know about accompanying the artists. Would this workshop be given and then would some kind of assistance be made available, later follow-up? I think maybe they can understand the theory but have problems putting it into practice, so it would be interesting if a contact could be maintained. For these reasons, I think the idea is very relevant and fits the challenge well, but a little more detail would be nice. So I believe that some of the direct objectives of the challenge will be met, such as \u201cNumber of proposals addressing the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa + Number of proposals offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns + Number of new Africa-based users onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups) + Number of new Africa-based Catalyst members (proposers, voters, CAs) + Number of new African projects seeded in 2022\u201d; although yes, some improvements could be made.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of the script, it lacked detail. We can see this in the way the phases and KPIs are explained in a very short and brief way: \u201cPhase 1 (one month): Advertising the new job opportunity and setting up job interviews to find the right candidate + Phase 2 (2 weeks) : Provide training to the selected candidate + Phase 3: The new employee will start their job of looking for and training artist agents. The deliverable/s and KPIs will be: To have created employment for at least one person in Africa as Coordinator for Africa Artist Agents for The Art Suite. + Artist Agents in 10 African countries to begin with.\u201d. Then, only what would be done in the first 3 months is provided, but I believe that the project would last much longer than that. Therefore, it would be important for all months to be explained in the roadmap, and also for the level of detail to be greater for each month. For example, in month 1, disclosure would be made for the agents' job vacancies: how would this process take place? Through which media would the disclosure be made, and what criteria would be chosen to choose the future candidate? Speaking of training - wouldn't it be interesting to hire someone who already has knowledge about blockchain, specifically about Cardano? In the third month, how would the searches for artist training be carried out? How many would be selected, and how long would they be trained? It is said that artists would be sought in 10 countries: which ones? Anyway, in my view, the project development process is reported in a superficial way, the way the information is passed we only have a basic understanding of what would happen, without the appropriate degree of specificity. Now talking about the budget, it is said that the monthly expense would be 1250 dollars, with 1000 for the agent and 250 for operating costs. To understand whether the asking price as salary is fair, it would be important to have a sense of how long this person would work for the project. What would the operating costs be? Why does it cost 250 dollars? If we divide the total amount requested, of 15,500 dollars, by 1250 (amount of monthly expenses), we arrive at 12.4. That is, a year and little of guaranteed financing. I was in doubt about what goes beyond the amount of the 12 months, would it be a kind of reserve? In general, the budget part should also be better detailed. As for the team, I thought that was the best part of the feasibility, as we know a lot of information about each team member. We are given their names, a detailed curriculum of what they have done so far and also pages where we can have more direct contact with them, such as linkedin and twitter, as we can see in the example: \u201cAlfred Moesker - Co-Founder & CEO, One of Cardano's renowned OGs is Alfred Moesker. In 2017 his Hotel Ginebra in Barcelona was the first business in the world to accept ADA as payment, a website is attached here. Stakepool operator of \u2018HOTEL\u2019, 25 years experience in the tourist business, managing and network skills (\u2026)\u201d. My only suggestion is that it be more defined who would do what within this project - we see that we have people who are very knowledgeable about Cardano, people from different areas of training and performance. Therefore, I think the feasibility is ok, having some points to improve, mainly in the first two topics, which are not properly detailed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Finally, thinking about auditability, it is said that a description of progress would be made with the help of partners (Money Society and The Art Bank). This is very clear in the excerpt that opens this part of the proposal: \u201cThe process will be easily audited by describing the progress we will be make in connecting in Africa with the help of Monet Society, The Art Bank, and our other Cardano ecosystem connections based in Africa, then searching and finding candidates to interview, and finally employing one such candidate\u201d. However, it is not said how this report would be made, nor in the sense of who would write the updates; how often; and where this material would be made available. I wish the proponent had been more specific on this point as well. Ideally, in my view, he would have detailed how this follow-up process would be done, for example: at the end of each month, all updates would be gathered and detailed in a written document, both in relation to the work done and the partial results obtained in the month - for example, in that month 1 agent was formed and managed to manage 3 artists. There, some information about the artist could be passed on, so that we would know about his trajectory and the advances that would be achieved through this project. Would it be important to define where updates would be posted: through community communication channels, such as telegram and discord, for example? Or maybe through the project's own website, if there is one? How could the Cardano community have quick and easy access to these reports? Finally, speaking of final results, the success is summed up in terms of the number of NFT artists from Africa that were integrated into The Art Shuite platform with the help of the agents; and also with the constant recruitment and education of artists about. In my view, this study should be further studied. How could we ensure that the people involved were actually becoming active members of the community? How to ensure that the project was a watershed for them, in which they started to have a more constant and more profitable income? How can the consequences for Cardano be measured - how many new CNFTs are being minted on our blockchain, are being sold on Ada? Are artists creating digital portfolios and investing in the technologies of our ecosystem? I think these and other issues should be analyzed and a final survey should be done and made available to the Cardano community. One idea would be to present this in some room after Townhall, for example. For these reasons, I think the suggested auditability is still insufficient, needing several improvements to make it adequate.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2821, "q0": "\"This idea provides a small impact on the requirements of the challenge, the main goals of the idea in this proposal are: scaling the artistic NFT on top of Cardano, however in the presentation. still not clear, it is difficult to understand what the proposal will do to achieve the goal.The proposal states that it will train selected candidates then those candidates will go to find and train artists for jobs. I don't think this is good, this way the team can combine more existing materials or video series for a more diverse approach and there is another important thing that has not been mentioned by the team in this presentation. that's the potential of NFT, it's not just an aesthetic aspect, it can be put into practice for the people of Africa by showing off their agricultural products or something they have to the world. and buy when you want to own them, this will make the NFT trade bigger as the solution idea suggests, it will help scale up the income for the people of Africa on a large scale.\n  \"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"The stages outlined in the roadmap section I find difficult to complete in the time proposed, which is: phase 2 trains candidates for two weeks, which I associate with the team has collaborated with some other ideas based in Africa but the cooperation is not because of their training, but the team needs to train a new community of candidates directly, so the time of two weeks It's not yet possible for a new candidate to fully understand and master the steps like minting or connecting that NFT to a wallet or encrypting it, and how many candidates the team needs to be able to complete in two weeks.\n  The detailed budget table of the proposal is not yet transparent, because the team has not basically provided the work that will consume the total amount of the request for funding, what the proposal provides is only a short amount of money. Expected salary for coordinator and operating expenses per month is $250 but what is this cost for. and if in the future the income from sales is not guaranteed, then if you want to maintain it, where do you propose to get the funding to pay the coordinator's salary, so that they can continue to find and train more artists? island. \"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "there are a lot of goals stated by the team at the end of the presentation but that is the roadmap for the future.

That means you have done good work for the artists and the community of Africa. This is not a proposal that has a direct impact on the development of Africa and its impact is indirectly on the spiritual value through Art Suite. But it certainly increases the value of the Cardano ecosystem, because it works on the Cardano blockchain platform. I have some doubts about the formation and development of the Art Suite. As well as the ability to scale the proposal to address future challenges. In my mind, some of the projects that have developed NFT today are trending, following the hot topic of the community. Maybe it will fade away shortly when the proposals no longer maintain their real value and long-term interoperability for the community. But anyway, this proposal is at least useful for artists (increase the spiritual value of society) and beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem, if NFT artists are sold for money, that money is used to support society will benefit African society. I have a question about why the team doesn't use Cardano blockchain technology, NFT... applied to other problems of African society. For example, NFT is related to agriculture, import and export... Maybe those things will be done by the team shortly, not just developing NFT for artists through Art Suite? I think that you can make better choices in developing a proposal that benefits the community and the Cardano ecosystem. I was hesitating between agreeing and disagreeing all the time. I vote 3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I was impressed with the members of the team. They are all experienced professionals in information technology, Cardano blockchain, and NFT. Along with that, the identities of the members are also made public on social networking sites, which increases the credibility and feasibility of the proposal for the community. I very much welcome this and wish all proposals in Catalyst were so publicly identifiable. Regarding the budget, the team's way of dividing the budget is simple, but tight and reasonable with the goal. The proposal has a clear plan and implementation method and has the necessary resources to implement it. However, I wish the team would explain the technical and technological aspects more clearly so that the community can understand better instead of just giving a general technical concept of the Cardano blockchain and NFT. I think this is important because it contributes to proving the feasibility of the proposal. The more detailed and detailed a proposal is, the more it is evaluated for feasibility and auditability. I have read the team's risk presentation, the risk you mentioned is exactly that of not finding an artist agent. But in terms of auditability, how can you prove that you can't find anyone to act as an artist agent? How to show the community that? Can it be represented by any number or other evidence? I want you to answer this question satisfactorily.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has well listed the work milestones that need to be completed during the implementation of the proposal. However, I would like a clearer roadmap associated with the months of the year. This increases the auditability of the proposal. This is also my advice. You can consult. Regarding KPIs/Metrics, I'd like to know how many people the team aims to have in Africa as the African artist agency coordinator for The Art Suite? I know you already have one now. I want to know how many people do you want? I understand that this person plays an important role in your proposal when it comes to practice? So can you share more standards to recruit and train this person? For the rest, I approve of the team starting with artist agents in 10 African countries. As a PA, I am satisfied with the team clearly describing the problem and clearly stating the solution to solve it. You collaborated with two other Cardano digital art projects called The Art Bank and Monet Society, which are based in South Africa accompanied by actual evidence and videos in the proposal which further increased the auditability of this proposal. For the above reasons, I believe in the auditability of the proposal and believe that you will be able to successfully implement it in practice if funded.

Compared to other regions of the world, Africa has a much lower level of education and exposure to Blockchain technology, and artists are no exception. The goal of the proposal is to establish Art Suite artist agencies, which act as a bridge to introduce and support and educate artists about Cardano knowledge, so that more and more people understand and know about the ecosystem. Cardano attitude, especially artists often have a large number of fans, the speed of spread is faster and faster, moreover when they have knowledge and understand the nature, they can one day help others understand the Cardano ecosystem, this is how to grow sustainably. When the artist world understands that collaborating with Art Suite to mint NFTs based on Cardano's block chain, sell it, and have artists extract a portion of it for social work, it not only opens up opportunities, but also creates networks. Cardano's digital economy, which provides livelihood through artists, agents and NFTs in Africa, but also has great humanitarian value for the community as it deducts a portion of the revenue from the sale of NFT topics. doing social work in Africa. In addition to acting as a commercial model, the agency will receive 20% of the revenue from the sale of NFT, further encouraging the growth of future agents, the more artists participating in the agency. platform, the more money they can and will earn, the stronger this relationship will be, the more developed the cardano ecosystem will be, of course, it is possible to clone agents in places where there is internet in the world. gender.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed team has come up with a clear detailed plan, implementing each phase in order, they have divided it into 3 phases around recruiting and training coordinators for agents, corresponding to the specific requirements. The phases are specific attached timelines that make it easier for the proposer team and the constituency to track the success of the project. The team has provided documents that introduce the capabilities and experience of the ArtSuite platform and community, although they are new, they are already active and have had a product that has been positively received by the community. Website and youtube channel help increase the prestige of the group. The proponent provided members' profiles with very clear experience and working skills, suitable for successfully implementing the challenge via twitter/linkedin. The budget given for 1 year includes salary and operating expenses, in the context of high inflation and escalating prices I think it is reasonable, the proponent was very active when making a commitment to find sponsors for the coordinator position, once an African Artists Special Agent Coordinator is recruited, will be published on The Art Suite portal, showing the breakdown of ggawngsvaf being proactive at work. The proposed team has assessed the risk impacts and proposed measures to reduce risks, in order to successfully implement the proposal. In particular, the proposed team has worked closely with two other Cardano digital art projects called The Art Bank and Monet Society, based in South Africa, both of which have development teams. experienced and known by the Cardano community, thus reinforcing the trust of the voter community.

Web 3.0, the NFT and the livelihood of the digital economy are neither easily accessible nor understood.\"\nTo address the challenge, the proponent came up with the solution is the Art Suite platform, a proven concept of artist agencies that can operate from anywhere around the globe, showcasing local artists to the Cardano community with the goal of expanding our network in at least 10 African countries. By providing strong evidence and arguments and describing the solution in great detail and clarity, I fully agree that the team's solution identified most of the problems of the challenge. It is important not only to educate people about the Cardano technology that can change their lives for the better but also to help them understand the guiding principles so that they can one day help others change their lives with the tools the Cardano ecosystem provides. This is a steady-state coefficient of positive ripple effects.\nThe team identified the main risk in undertaking the project as the initial difficulty in identifying the right people to become an artist agency.
