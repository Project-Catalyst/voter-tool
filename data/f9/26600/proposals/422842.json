The proposal clearly provides precise solutions to the problem of the challenge. Goodwall\u2019s proposal is to continuously develop an educational program about blockchain and its applications for social impact targeting youth all over Africa. Goodwall runs educational programs to over 2M youth on its platform this is  something which is already imparting the lives of Africans and it is commendable. \nThe key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings. Furthermore, the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges such as  empower youth in Africa who are keen to learn about blockchain applications, create opportunities, and advocate for its use for a more decentralized future. Through the creation of these meaningful events online they are able to bring onboard many youth in Africa on the Cardano ecosystem. The proposal clearly articulates a plan for the project's future sustainability. That is, it will select 5 ambassadors per theme a total of 20, create 1 million impressions, organize 30,000 engagements, take 1,000 video entries, and take participant feedback to know whether they are very positive towards Cardano and blockchain.

Goodwall according to their writings works in full transparency and will provide extensive reports based on the projects and objectives. They have also provided a well-thought out Metrics/KPIs.  There is also a clear understandable description of the targeted problem which is youth engagement in Cardano.  The solution will be to engage more youth in the Goodwall platform which has over 2M people to work together and address the problem.

There is no specifics and metrics of each allocation. For example there is a mentioning of digital marketing plan, but not given specifics what are those digital marketing. This happen through their budget section, it's as if the Goodwall team is asking us to trust in their established reputation. This though is not a good example for other proposals. It allows for complacency for newbies. Word of wisdom to Goodwall team to please adhere to the writing standard of Catalyst School.\n\nBesides that discrepancy, other metrics are clearly stated but some metrics are not known how will these be reported.
