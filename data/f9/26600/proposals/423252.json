Having a university backing this knowledge will make the community grow and, moreover, will bring further development of Ghanian society in education area, firstly, and possibly in several other fields. Therefore, this proposal aligns with the challenge.\n\nAll the success/goals targets exposed align with the challenge. \n\nThe continuation of this proposal after the money timeframe is possible since the statistics HOD is backing it. And I imagine that every semester has more students entering and graduating the university, therefore the hub will always be renovated and the continuation is easy. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To facilitate the feasibility evaluation, we can divide this topic in some measures:\n1 \u2013 Team: Since there are 2 WADA components and a CKT-UTAS professor, I imagine that the team won\u2019t have any trouble accessing and having permissions to continue this project. It is possible to find the team members in the CKT-UTAS website (professor) and WADA org.\n2 \u2013 roadmap: The presented roadmap is simple and it defines the weeks in which each task will take place, which seems sufficient.\n3 \u2013 tasks: It could have some more information here. Exemplifying: there is a task of renovation of centre and setup. However, here we could use the information about why, in an UTAS university, there is a need to renovate the centre, or buy computers. Are there an intention to build a new lab instead of using the existing one and, if so, why? Another aspect that could be added are the topics to be addressed during the training sessions.\nTherefore, adding these kinds of information could increase the transparency of the proposal. \n4 \u2013 budget:  There is a need to further explain some topics such as renovation of the hall (which renovation, what does it need?), miscellaneous, etc. Moreover, I think it must add a note explaining why there is no possibility to use an already existing lab in the university because the expenses to renew one and buy all the material accounts for more than 70% of the budget asked. That being said, I think it would be good to add some explanation note.\n5 \u2013 Self fund/scalability: There was said that the proposer will return to the fund and gave no second plan of self-funding. However, there is a possibility to transform the hub into a  JEC (Junior Enterprise Concept), which is quite common in several countries in the world. It works as a enterprise which solves problems to other industries, enterprise, people, anyone, being directed by students (with a professor as mentor). The JEC charges for the services a value just for their maintenance (of course there is a profit, however it returns to the students in courses, e.g.). This might be a solution to funding and for scalability (other universities might copy the format).\n6 \u2013 Risk management: It wasn\u2019t stated any risk, however there is the scalability and continuity of the process (not necessarily it\u2019ll be funded every round and, therefore, the continuation of this proposal might be affected). Implementing what was said in topic 5 might mitigate this risk.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s quite possible to implement this proposal, however it is missing some information that must be added.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "We can evaluate auditability by its:\n1 \u2013 roadmap and milestones: The roadmap seems feasible, however it must be added some check points, allowing us to follow its progress. Like in the 1st month, there is no milestone or checkpoint, there are just some tasks to be completed.\n\n2 \u2013 own channel: There was not presented any channel to share information. Maybe adding in the CKT-UTAS website or even create a separated one. \n\n3 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: All the metrics and KPI added evaluate the success of the proposal and always aligning with the challenge.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 2, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3773, "q0": "The project detailing does not address the challenge of growing Cardano in Africa.The objectives stated are to be a cardano hub and provide education and resources in the university of C.K Tedam in Ghana but this does not need much of a resource if the plan is to only educate people on how to use the blockchain.The college was founded in 2020 and the website shows 12 professors and less than 3000 students being graduated on 2020.This shows the exisisting infrastructure is not good enough to create any sort of network effects to attract students from other universities or even from their own.To begin with creating a hub for hackathons and resource materials they would need technically sound professors who are skilled and equipped enough of the underlying programming language utilised by Cardano in Haskell which clearly seems to not be the case here.The foundations on which this hub is being created adds even more to the worry as proper metrics regarding the existing infrastructure of education being provided is unavailable to assess for future growth metrics.The project is a long way or from being sustainable", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The team mentioned here does not have any relevant exposure to Plutus or with being a professor related to depatrment of Computer Science.The majority of funds being requested seem to be to renovate halls and purchase basic equipments like Computers in the college,the lack of wherein is worrisome indicator of the existing unreliable infrastructure in place.No specifications in how would they create sources of training materials,hackathons and how they would create the learning materials even required in the first place and the timelines of developing them within the first month is another major red flag.The first thing to do would be to hire people with sufficient expertise and consult them on how to lay the frameworks and foundations for a longterm well articulated hub that would indeed enhance growth  and productivity.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The auditing of this seems to be manual and lacks for clear metrics and signs of progress and requires trust assumptions which could be faked upon pretty easily.No clear growth monitoring metrics and goals are provided henceforth the success of the project has no clear definition and requires trust assumptions which could potentially be manipulated.

Popularizing the use of Blockchain in educational and learning institutions is an issue that the founders of Blockchain companies are aiming for, it promotes society to approach Blockchain applications quickly.\n\nThe impact of this project is quite large, the solution of this proposed idea is great, it identifies almost every problem to be solved in this challenge, besides the author's argument through a description that is truly reasonable, clear, and complete. Having a continuing education center on the Cardano ecosystem within the CK Team University of Technology and Applied Sciences (CKT-UTAS) located in the Upper East Region of Ghana is a good solution, it serves as an illustration. Noting the development (though slow but steady) of Cardano in Africa in general, it is a place for students and researchers of Blockchain to have the opportunity to receive a lot of information from the industry as well as the benefits from Catalyst, from the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe description of this proposed idea does not measure the risks of implementation, I look forward to seeing the addition of risk management details in the next Fund if the concept is still alive. The introduction of Blockchain into a university for education will have the following primary risks:\n_ Is it legally recognized in the host country? , as some countries are not yet fully open to Blockchain and Cardano.\n_ What are the risks when operating a blockchain education center? solutions to reduce that risk.\n_ Risk of personnel: there are enough members to jointly maintain the operation center? how long is the operation center expected? what is the effect it brings?\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This project provides clear and reasonable timelines for implementation and completion, compared with the information provided that this is completely feasible to implement, but the goals are not specific compared to the potential that the project brings.

For example, in the first week of completing the center renovation and setting up, the second week of completing the network infrastructure and setting up, etc. The more details, the easier it is for the community to check the project's implementation progress and direction to Cardano's self-governing stage.\n\nThe required project budget is less than 20% of the total funding budget of this challenge, compared to the information provided by the project, all expenditures for the project have been clarified, and explained very clearly and transparently.\n\nHuman resources to carry out this project have been assigned specific jobs for each item, the members' experiences show that it is completely suitable for the project, but the identity of the members is also difficult to verify. clearly.

The establishment of such a hub is indeed a way to promote and disseminate Cardano in the region. However, the hub proposed seems a little limited in terms of local impact and scalability. The KPIs defined in the end of the proposal marginally align with the challenge core ideas. The focus of the challenge is to spread the knowledge about Cardano and blockchain technologies to the general public and not only to a university universe niche. Apart from that I have not seen in the proposal any thoughts on reaching a self-sustaining target where they won't need project catalyst funding anymore.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The only link provided (http://www.ctiel.org/) to back the experience jotted down was not working when I tried to visit the site (checked on the 1st of July). Even though they haven't explicitly stated the number and type of members that will be required the three persons appointed in the \u201cwho is the team\u201d section probably can take the tasks described in the previous section with the plan laid out. The budget, in turn, has been broken down into identifiable items but I have found some of the amounts a bit excessive. USD 1500 for snack and lunch of one ceremony for example is clearly disproportionate. The timetable, even though it sounds reasonable, is too shortsighted. There is no plan beyond the three-month threshold. Besides that, the proposers claim they are not aware of any risks. This makes it sound like a limited proposal. To make it more robust they could have discussed the challenges of not arousing enough interest in their hub or not being able to acquire all the setup they desired or even suffering from restrictions imposed by the university, for example.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposer has provided a short-term roadmap (only 3 months) and the milestone described for month 3 sounds a bit generic. They claim they will \"continue training\" but do not mention number of people they intend to train, number of training sessions per week they are planning or even what will be the content of those sessions. The KPIs are defined in the \"what does success look like\" section instead of the \"how to measure progress\" section, but a part from that most of them make sense inside the idea of the proposal. As I have mentioned before they are focusing only on the impact inside the university which I find limited. Also, the last KPI, \"stepping stone to other universities\", is not well defined as it is extremely hard to measure that. All in all, even though the intention is good the solution does not seem to be very effective as the impact for Africa as a whole will be too narrow. Finally, they have not provided any public channel to keep the community up to date with their progress. I suggest they set up a social media account or a blog page for that.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4238, "q0": "The Cardano Hub in CKT proposal addresses the challenge objective of accelerating Cardano adoption in Africa well. By establishing the Cardano hub in CKT-UAS (a technology focused university in Ghana), the Cardano ecosystem in Africa can benefit from research, innovation and future events (hackathon) which will lead to increasing Cardano adoption in Africa. The proposal has a very good potential to scale in case it is implemented successfully and the other institutions of higher learning see it as a prototype to also partner with Cardano and introduce it to the wider audiences. Although the proposal hasn't mentioned about risk of completing the project, there could be some blockages in delivering the project. The examples of possible risks are its reliance on the collaborative efforts of many parties and also  declining in interest of students who are the major focus of Cardano adoption in this proposal. The proposal could be improved if the proposer would include possibility of such risks and how to tackle them in order to deliver this project successfully. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal has high potential to be implemented successfully as the proposer team members have reputation/ credibility from academic background and should be familiar with the process of setting up the blockchain center in the university. The proposal should have included their profile links that shows relevant skills and experience needed to carry out the project. The budget is reasonable and outlined clearly. Also the proposer could improve this proposal by listing the number of hours and pay rate/hour when it comes to variable cost items like production of teaching material, making brand paraphernalia and the key note speakers, etc. The timeline of 3 months are realistic to set the right basics for Cardano hub in CKT. The project roadmap and milestones are clear from the onset which tasks are required to bring this project to reality. It is possible that the proposer will seek future funding from Catalyst and it is recommended to be more specific in term of responsibilities of each team member (who is doing what) as this project size is relatively big and involves many parties.

The team aims to make this Cardano hub in CKT as a role model/stepping stone to other universities within the region and the success could be measured in term of number of students showing interest and getting involved with Cardano. It could take longer than 3 months as the project is comprised of many target groups (5 categories of Cardano fans   which need constant support and building rapport over time) to deliver the successful and long lasting impact to these groups. The proposer team understands the challenge brief well and has an effective solution to tackle the problem of Cardano adoption in Africa deploying education as the main strategy to increase future Cardano adoption.

Hubs are always positive environments for such purposes. This can really help to create a blockchain education center in this university. The proposal is also taking this one step further and plans to create some training materials and learning opportunities. Anyone working in this hub will also be working with Cardano and in turn may contribute to community.\n\nThe proposal does not list any risks for their idea. In any other proposal I would consider this as team is not taking the proposal seriously. However, when I think about it I cannot find any major risks either. This proposal is really risk free and directly related to challenge setting. This challenge can help this university and Ghana to become a leading force in Cardano adoption in coming years.

I have checked if professor Suleman Nasiru has research papers about blockchain but there was none. If I understood correctly he will be helping the team about their communication with the University. With more time passes, he might also start to have more active role to incentivize other students. Other team members, Adenankyage and Baani, have more experience with blockchain technology and communities. I have checked their Twitter pages and also what WADA is working on at the moment, they are both very active in that community. Especially, I saw that Baani has already started to inform the young public in Northern Ghana in a program called \u2018Mass Cardano Education\u2019.

This proposal can start a very useful movement first within Ghana then other countries. They are also planning to host Cardano team to their hub and this is also a great example to engage more and more students. I sincerely believe that this proposal should be funded and Catalyst should help this team\u2019s ideas to spread to more people.

Establishing a hub in CKT will serve as an avenue for discussing blockchain issues, educating students about the opportunities available in the cardano blockchain and training students to put their innovative ideas into proposals to seek funding to implement those ideas to solve problems in their various societies in Africa. Training and educating these students will therefore means integrating them into the cardano community to contribute in roles like PAs, VPAs,proposers, referrers and many others.
