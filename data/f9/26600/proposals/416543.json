This centre, according to the proponent, will develop a series of activities, including for example free education on Cardano, NFTs and Blockchain; a comprehensive teaching curriculum with experts that will help local people understand what use cases Cardano may have in South Africa; in addition to several other activities, such as \u201cEvents Hosting / Exhibitions / Announced Training Sessions / Awards / Other Cardano-Related Events (meetings)\u201d. This all aligns perfectly with the specific objectives of the challenge, since here we are seeking to finance projects that can benefit the African population, presenting the possibilities of income and work that involve the various technologies of our ecosystem. I notice that in this specific case, a portion that will be greatly benefited will be the artists, as several topics about NFT will be addressed (What is an NFT, not just a JPG, and what is the value / How to open a wallet / How to mint an NFT / How do I get my art on Cardano / What are drop sites / What programs do I use / etc). The proponent argues very well why such a center should be created in Cape Town: South Africa is the continent's third largest economy, yet the unemployment rate in the country is estimated at approximately 46%. In other words, it is a place with a lot of potential, but currently suffering from the unemployment crisis, and the existence and activities provided in this community center will certainly present work opportunities that the local population may not know about. The proponent also states that there are no places where people can turn to get guided, oriented towards blockchain technologies. Certainly, too, the community center would bring many benefits to Cardano, I believe that these interventions would generate a new wave of active members to our community, increasing the number of Ada being bought, sold and delegated; greater participation in Catalyst projects, by people from the fields of technology, law, accounting, design, etc.; an increase in the number of CAs and later on VCAs in this location\u2026 In short, a greater participation, in short, of this specific population in the Cardano community. The proponent points out some problems that may arise with the development of the community center, and also how they could be mitigated. In addition, he explains in a long and detailed way several of the activities that would be developed there. Overall, he believes that in terms of impact, the proposal is perfect, aligning very well with the proposed challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal roadmap is satisfactory, activities are divided based on months and numbered sequentially, but I believe that a greater detail of each activity would be beneficial for a more specific understanding of the development process. For example in month 1, we have several activities proposed, one of them being \u201cproducing marketing material and starting a campaign\u201d. It would be interesting to understand how the attention of the local population will be drawn, since people correspond to the core of this project (what is a community center without a good amount of people, right?). It would be interesting to understand how stakeholder and community engagement would be done. The details get more superficial as the months go by (we see that the amount of activities listed for month 4 and month 5 is lower than for month 1, for example). I would like the same level of specificity to be maintained throughout the script, as we can see at the beginning: \u201cMonth 2: Improvements/Staffing, Design, Complete drawings/plan for design and fit-out of the chosen space. This may include refining plans for painting, signage, carpentry, lighting, audio, furniture, and other equipment, Procurement and Fitout, Complete procurement and fit-out work, Hire staff, Training gurus x 1, Service x 2, Cleaning and maintenance x 1\" etc. The following parts, budget and staff, provide us with very basic information. Starting with the budget: the total amount requested is very high and is divided superficially. For example, $35,000 would go towards location costs such as rent, security deposit, utilities, renovation, etc. How much would go for each part? Which place would be reserved, would the rental price be too high? How many years of rent would that money cover? How would $31,200 be split between two full-time employees? How many months would they work, what would their work routines be like? For the marketing part, $12,800 is reserved, but this amount is also not well explained, despite the fact that the proponent divides this part into some smaller parts (Videos, Short Documentary, Twitter, Discord, Traditional Online and Print Media). Finally, thinking about the team, we know who is involved, their names, roles and linkedin profiles. However their descriptions are very brief, we don't know much information about their CVs. In my view, it would be important for more details to have been given, more examples of previous work, how they relate to Cardano, why they are considered experts (in certain cases) and so on. In general, the feasibility is good, we have the necessary information to build a general notion of the 3 topics; but, especially in the last 2, more detail would be necessary to have a more solid understanding.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Progress can be measured by many KPIs, as the proponent cites: \u201cTotal number of CCC visitors per week, New wallets signed up per month, Number of NFTs minted by new artists, Completed surveys submitted, The number of positive comments (or overall rating) comments, via Yelp, etc.), Number of followers on social networks, Number of events held\u201d, among others. Two comments that I think are pertinent in this case would be, in addition to the aforementioned quarterly reports on open source, would we be able to provide tangible feedback to the community more frequently? It is said that a newsletter will be made, but we don't know the content that would make it up or how often it would be published. So, I was in doubt, when reading this part of the proposal, if the proposer would also include how the behind-the-scenes activities would be developing, what is behind these numbers, for example. However, I think he's taken a lot of care and attention in this part, we know how very detailed how various aspects of progress can be measured. We also have to consider that our roadmap is detailed enough to cite activities in chronological order, and from there we already gave a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the development process itself would be like, the work routines. So, as much as there was a little doubt about whether these different types of information would be provided, confidence is passed that we will have many updates on the project. A suggestion I would like to make is: set a social network so that updates are posted at least monthly, it would also be great if the feedback from the local community is collected and taken into account during the continuity of the project. Speaking of final results, success would be seen as creating an operational model for CCC (Cardano Community Center), a business model that can be replicated by other African countries; and also with the local CCC becoming a meeting point for members of the local Cardano community, and being a place of visit for other community members visiting the city. Everything is well exposed in the excerpt \u201cSuccess is proving the concept, with open-source evidence speaking for itself. In turn, creating the first sustainable operating model for Cardano Community Centers into a replicable business model to be deployed across Africa and potentially the rest of the world, etc etc\u201d. In my opinion, it lacked that more study was suggested in relation to how the teachings supported there influenced the lives of those involved. What were the changes observed after the studies, artists started to produce CNFTs, tech people started to participate in Dapps projects, people in general started to participate in Catalyst, would the local population be acquiring more Ada? In my view, the audibility is good, small adjustments would be necessary for it to become ideal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 9, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 12924, "q0": "The proposal floats the idea of establishing the Cardano Cape Town Community Center to facilitate the participation of the Cardano community, building an environment for learning blockchain and cardano knowledge. The idea made a lot of sense in Cardano's development in Africa. The implementation of the idea of bringing Africans together to exchange knowledge about Cardano/Blockchain is in line with the Challenge. The proposal has implications for the Cardano community in South Africa to increase user expansion and development. Users are infused with knowledge such as about NFT, How to open wallets and use ADA, are instructed to create NFT works, build Dapp, their projects on Cardano.

The team has provided all the resources necessary to implement the proposal, members of the group have experience in Cardano, Maketing, NFT, event management, etc. The advantage is that the local (Capetonian) should be well aware of the customs and conditions at the place where the cardano Cape Town Community was founded this is what is remarkable for the successful element of the proposal. Hr sources have clearly divided the work done so that the proposal is done well, the information about the member is introduced on LinkedIn. The roadmap of the proposal in 1 year is reasonable to show the advantages and ways to implement the proposal successfully when the plan is divided into small parts by month and can operate steadily from the 5th month when funded. The budget table is detailed and complete for each category the required amount accounting for 20% of the capital for challenge is enough.

Professional research papers but it shows you've invested a lot in research.\nThe organization of exhibitions and awards is very suitable for the community to access NFT works, thereby understanding Cardano better because of its attraction. I like that you try to develop CCC into a go-to gathering place, that minimizes the constraint because most people are overwhelmed by new technologies, so let them have different perspectives through communication between individuals. multiplied by the individual.

There are many previous proposals on Africa that set similar goals, but most of them were not funded. I hope you will have a new and breakthrough view.

Firstly, it is important to have a real-life location, which willboost the feeling of community, and boost efficiency and output, as it is always more efficient when people meet face-to-face. It will help reach the technology disadvantaged communities, as the center will provide computers and wifi. Though real-life engaging, fun and dynamic events, they can attract people who are currently completely unaware of crypto and cardano. Having a location where people can productively create and ideate will help bring innovation, and dynamism to the cardano ecosystem.

They seem knowledgeable in the crypto space, so they can guide newcomers effectively.

There is not yet a detailed plan on how this community center will generate enough revenue to be self-sufficient after the initial launch, and keep the quality of operations for the years to come. Will the community center hold crowdfunding events? Will the members of the center contribute financially for the upkeeping of the center? Is there a budget set aside for potential slow operations, where no revenue is directly generated by the center?

Experts in the legal realm knowledge of the up and down sides of NFT's, NFT's are a growing industry and are just getting adoption. Real use cases on NFT's have not been realized, the curriculum should be tailored to NFT's from an African perspective, how African can use NFT's for their benefit besides Art NFT's also introduce the concept of utility NFT's. Once African adopt real use case for utility NFT's this would lead to the wider adoption of blockchain, an NFT as Art may not be the catalyst to adoption but if I can use NFT for something more valuable that gives one the appreciation for such technology. This proposal has potential to grow and can be replicated across different cities and countries in Africa, additionally this community center can also be used for developer training/Hackathons and act as a launchpad for African builders to build real world applications for Africans. Additionally this program can also branch out to mobile community center for a more rural outreach, vehicles equipped with everything required to bring such training and initiatives to rural based people who would otherwise be left out because they do not live near a city such as Cape Town more of copy a Doctors without borders approach. the community center being the hub.

Followups can be done with different participants to measure the impact and how long lasting it is.
