These communities are full of talented people, but they are scattered.\u00a0", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.125, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3370, "q0": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I think that this proposal does not fully address the objectives laid out in the challenge setting. This proposal aims to guide at least three teams of participants to \u201cput their business ideas into a realizable and scalable business model, and guide them to find the proposer investment through decentralized funding.\u201d This underlying goal is something that I believe addresses the challenge setting, but only if the projects that are incubated by the program are built on the Cardano blockchain. From what I read in the impact section, it does not seem like the proposers made any specific mention that the projects would be on the Cardano blockchain. I assume it is implied, but still could have been worth mentioning to clear up confusion. \n\nThe proposers have broken down the plan into multiple phases. In the sourcing phase, they plan to create a system where people are incentivized to create content to build interest in the program with tokens of some kind. There will also be some hackathons where the winning participants will qualify for the Catalyst program (as a part of the Catalyst phase). In the Catalyst phase, the proposers will create a DAO where teams\u2019 ideas can be incubated. Advice will be provided to the teams during this phase. Then, the incubation phase involves the incubation of 6-8 projects that are voted on by the DAO. Experts and mentors will provide the team with advice. Then, in the funding phase, community members can stake their tokens to their chosen projects. 50% goes to the engaged community rewards, 20% to the experts and mentors, and 30% to the program partners. The projects are funded by the DAO once they reach their funding soft cap. I do have some feedback on this section of the proposal with regards to clarity of the objectives. Firstly, I think it is confusing for the proposers to use the term \u201cCatalyst phase,\u201d especially when this falls within the context of Catalyst on the Cardano blockchain. The catalyst phase referenced in the proposal does not seem to have any connection to the actual Cardano Catalyst, except for name. This superfluous feedback is more of a semantics thing, which does not factor into my rating of this proposal. It made reading the proposal more difficult, so I am pointing it out to the proposers. Also, there was no mention of how the DAO will be developed or how DAO funding will be obtained. \n\nThe proposers listed some good challenges that they may face, but I don\u2019t think that their solutions to the problems are fully sufficient. For example, \u201cCommunity growth and management\u201d is not a mitigation strategy for \u201cAbility to bring together a community on the DAO.\u201d There would need to be much more information in the solution in order for me to have confidence that the proposal can address its future challenges. How can the proposers grow the community to overcome the challenge of struggling to build a community? Actionable steps are needed here.\n\nOverall, this proposal could add value to the Cardano ecosystem, but there was no explicit mention if the projects incubated will be built on the Cardano blockchain \u2013 all that was mentioned was that the incubated business ideas would be decentralized and that the proposers would promote the Cardano blockchain throughout their 4 stage process. I think the key difference is implied versus stated. I can\u2019t infer too far away from what the proposers said (because I don\u2019t want to make false inferences about the proposal), so my assessment is mainly based on what is and isn\u2019t said. There is potential, but I can\u2019t jump to any conclusions since I can only go off of what was said in the proposal. The proposal can align with the challenge setting because it can bring in new Cardano developers or entrepreneurs from African countries, specifically Tunisia where the project has connections but also in other North African countries where they hope to expand. However, since not all of the characteristics of an impactful proposal were addressed, I can neither agree nor disagree that this proposal meets the impact criteria. (score given: 3)\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the information provided, I don\u2019t think that this proposal will be successfully implemented. Even considering this proposal in conjunction with the context of one of its past proposals in a different challenge setting and looking at their slideshow that was only linked in the comments section of Ideascale does not give me confidence in this proposal because there are still gaps that were never explained. There was no place (ideascale, the proposer\u2019s website, the comments section of Ideascale) where DAO formation and funding were never fully explained. How will the DAO be governed? I know that governance is very challenging so how will voting on the incubated proposal work? Are there interfaces for those processes? How will the DAO be sustainable? How can the DAO scale in the future to address challenges as they come up? There are many questions that I have that, if addressed, would greatly help me rate the overall feasibility of this proposal. \n\nThe lack of DAO information aside, the proposers did include a roadmap for one cycle of the 4 stage program from start to finish. It should take approximately 6 months to complete, and it is easy to tell when certain tasks should be completed, such as completing ideation and application submission on October 10th, 2022. I think the tasks are laid out at a reasonable interval, so they are likely to all be completed on time. There is a good budget breakdown for the funds required for the education around Cardano to grow the Cardano community. It is easy to see where funds will be going, such as $9,600 for educational videos, $1,800 for content research and schedule, etc. The budget ($25,0000 total) seems fairly reasonable given the scope of this proposal. For all of the tasks listed, it is unclear who will be taking on what roles. There are four names listed in the proposal, but I can\u2019t tell who will be conducting which roles or if any roles will be outsourced to third parties. The proposers also mentioned that they will return to Catalyst to receive more funding in the future since this event will not be a one-off event.\n\nAll four of the main proposers (Mohamed Mnif, Jaafar Saied, Zeineb Kadhkadhi, and Salmen Slimi) all have years of experience in business development, blockchain technology, and consulting shared between them. As a result, I think that they do have the necessary skills to provide support to the teams that will pass through the program.\n\nIn conclusion, since this proposal is missing some very critical information about the implementation of the DAO, I can only give this proposal a rating of 2 for feasibility. In the future, I would encourage the proposers to provide some more detail in their proposals and link all relevant documents so that they are easier to find. Some more elaboration on the details of the DAO and how it will be governed are definitely necessary in order to give a better rating for feasibility. (score given: 2)\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I do not think that this proposal is fully auditable by the Cardano community. The proposers explicitly listed metrics that are for the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano challenge setting instead of metrics of success that specifically measure success for this proposal. Also, the metrics that are listed are not even metrics of success. Simply listing \u201c2 educational videos, 1 conference, 1 webinar,\u201d etc. with no context are not actually metrics of success. Is the proposal successful if these events are held and the videos are posted? Metrics of success for those would be more like \u201c1000+ views on the educational videos\u201d or \u201c20+ participants in the conference.\u201d In its current form, the proposal is missing more true KPIs. The only two metrics listed that I think qualify as a true metric of success are the 200-400 people educated through the workshops/webinars/hackathon and the three teams guided through the program. Those are goals that can be measured by the Cardano community. There is also no page or place where progress checks can be shared with the Cardano community. In order for me to give a higher rating for auditability, I would recommend that the proposers add more KPIs that are specifically related to the proposal itself (metrics that track success for the 4 stage plan that the proposers want to implement). Since these kinds of metrics were mostly missing, I can only give this proposal a score of 2 for auditability.
