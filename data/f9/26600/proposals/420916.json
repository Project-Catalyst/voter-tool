Through caricatures the proposer can more easily grab the attention of the people and arouse the interest in subjects relating to blockchain technologies and the Cardano ecosystem in general. That has to come equipped with a robust and consistent marketing so the caricatures reach the biggest audience possible. The way the proposer described they will decide the topic of each carticature is by using ideas of the own community by listening to people in townhalls for example and by gathering with Wada, which is a group focused in developing Cardano in Africa. That is a nice solution to this particular issue. However, I believe the marketing part is as important as the caricatures themselves and this point has barely been touched in the discussion. They only mention Raz and Cole will be responsible for it. This point is especially important because is through the marketing that the team will be able to scale the project in the future.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer has provided enough evidence of the team's skills and experience. They have provided links to previous works and LinkedIn profiles of the members of the team. The budget described is comprehensible and the amounts adequate for each identifiable item to reach the goals of the project. Their timeframe is closely related to the goal of producing twelve caricatures, one each week, which total twelve weeks of project and this is pretty reasonable. The plan is sensible, they have accounted for the tasks beyond the main one (designing the caricatures) which are brainstorming to define the subjects and editing the website to add a growth of Cardano section, for example. They have also discussed and raised two risks of the implementation: setting up a storyline for the artistic creation and being able to generate revenue so the work is long lasting. Additionally, I would add another major issue they have not focused and that I believe is extremely important, the risk of the impact of the project being less than anticipated. In other words, they run the risk of their caricatures not dragging the attention and not attracting as many people as they desire to the Cardano environment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap described has clear milestones and time horizons, one caricature each week. The KPIs proposed are not that clearly explained but can be inferred to be number of media channels and number of views in social media. Particularly I think impressions generated would be a great KPI (gathering all of their social media) and an obvious one is number of caricatures of pieces of art produced. The latter is more focused on the project itself and the former on the context of the challenge which is to disseminate Cardano around Africa. From the proposal it can be seen the problem is understood but I'm not so sure if the solution is very effective (because of the risk I described in the feasibility section). Finally, they have set up a public channel to regularly update about the progress of the project, the Shlomo website and have also mentioned they would also update their social media. However, they could have provided links to their social media for more convenience.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5497, "q0": "The ramifications the above proposal could bring are ample. It is a brilliant idea put forward in a simple yet elaborate manner. We have seen proposals trying to inculcate knowledge amongst the young minds of Africa through courses, videos, workshops, and many more academic ways. But the author of this proposal tries to do the same in a more entertaining way that may not be boring to any. Caricatures are an excellent way to instill concepts into the minds of readers which might trigger further learning interests in them. The author also mentions collaboration with WADA, which already has its roots deep across Africa. The caricatures may reach more individuals at a faster pace and the marketing and outreach factor is already sorted to an extent. If the initiative catches wind, there is the possibility that this can be made to reach a much wider audience, hence giving it a global touch in terms of its impact. But the only challenge that I as a community member can think of is the extent of acceptance from the African community and other viewers. The caricatures are a very sensitive way of communicating information, they are often considered only for humor rather seriously.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The milestones and the detailed plan provided in the submission look plausible and viable. A successful implementation would really be fruitful for the community as a whole. The team put together to get the project implemented looks paramount. The Caricature artist himself has made a name for himself at the global level. Association with WADA makes the entire proposal more credible. The deliverables are also in alignment with the challenge's expectations. The sense of educating African citizens is still kept intact even though the proposal looks more like an entertaining one. Therefore, I strongly believe the proposer and his mates are completely capable of making this proposal triumphant. The budget requested however feels to have gone a little overboard in terms of the pay for each week. Hence, I would deduct a point for the same. Anyway, monetizing this initiative through NFT or some other means as the author says would be a whole different ball game, making this proposal a great one in every sense.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Despite having concerns regarding the impact and feasibility to some extent, I have no concerns whatsoever regarding the auditability aspect of the proposal. The proposal's outcomes are well outlined and measurable and are based on a properly defined roadmap. The KPIs are all clearly defined and highly auditable. The customer interactions on the posts of caricatures would be a great way to assess the acceptance of the initiative and consistency of the team in posting new caricatures and different subjects are reasonable enough to track their progress. The success of this venture would be the outreach of the proposal, in turn motivating a lot of newcomers to start using Cardano and become a part of the community.
