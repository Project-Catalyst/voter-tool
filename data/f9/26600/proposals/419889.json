Blockchain in general and Cardano in typical, is an innovation of the world. It takes time to grow and spread so that more people will understand how it changes our life in a positive way. It should be adopted by both men and women, however, due to some barriers many young females especially in Africa are not aware of the Cardano blockchain technology and its opportunity. For warning the problem we have stated, this proposal is suitable to be delved into to find an answer for Cardano adoption in Africa. I must say the solution we have for this is not outstanding yet realistic and highly applicable under our circumstance. It is to host educational events in universities in Ghana and invite speakers to educate ladies on the Cardano blockchain and its benefits. I believe that this solves the lack of female's knowledge and interest in blockchain (Cardano), support funds for building their ideas and be financially independent and not least, on a wider scale, more African countries know about the Cardano ecosystem, and gain many outstanding people to contribute to make value for it. Through that, more Ghana young ladies will find themselves interested in Cardano and contribute new ideas to Catalyst Funding, as I have mentioned before, this benefits them and the ecosystem as we are together moving forward. The proposed solution creates a new/right mindset and I have strong belief that the project can grow bigger in the future when African (Ghana) people are aware and understand about blockchain and Cardano as new knowledge always leads to new opportunities. On the other hand, there are always risks lying under the plan and we stated that \u201cfinding space to host events on Campus\u201d is our risk in this situation. I agree with that obstacle and the way we solve it, which is connecting through a wide university network to find venue space, satisfied me. I just wonder if we can state the solution in a clearer manner, how exactly would we approach them and what we can trade off to convince them to allow us to use their venues? When we dig deeper into the risks, we will find a plan B for the risk or even figure out the other risks. The below are some that I have discovered. The bad reputation of blockchain due to Ponzi and scam cases affects young ladies' intention to join in the event. This does appear, we have lessons from previous cases. I suggest to run social campaigns to educate what is legit and what isn't. Moreover, running a social campaign helps us approach more females, not just within the universities\u2019 ones. Besides, we are witnessing a mass financial  decline which can happen to any form and ADA is no exception.  ADA slippage can cause the shortage of fund, therefore I recommend that we have a reserve fund or transfer ADA to specific fiat when being funded. In conclusion, this includes some beside risks but it is a potential initiative and my rate for it is maximum.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's script is not quite conventional, but in the end, what is necessary for us is to know with solidity how the development process of this project will take place. Firstly, the one-time events are hosted in 2 months happening right after being funded. However, it would be clearer to have a specific event\u2019s number as it affects the way we break down budget and resources allocation. The timeline for the project is created following weeks, each week contains different tasks to do. In this way, we have a very solid view of what is to come and are able to understand the entire process very accurately. Regarding this part, I believe there is nothing to punctuate, it is perfect. However, I was wondering if we can explain the 7th-8th week task - Event day. I wasn\u2019t clear with how many events would be hosted as I have stated above, it would affect our resources allocation and budget whether there are too many events or too few events happening in 2 weeks. So, I need an exact amount to evaluate the feasibility in a more particular manner. Besides, I\u2019m also curious about the criterias we choose speakers and how many speakers are invited for each event. We stated \u201c3 Keynote speakers\u201d and I was thinking whether we organize 3 events, each speaks at one event, 3 speak together at events. The criterias and amount of speakers affect our events\u2019 quality therefore I suggest we take it into consideration carefully. The budget is explained in a simple way, easy to imagine with expense for each task detailly based on the general roadmap. It accounts for 4.4% of  the total fund. With this percentage, I believe it is suitable compared to the scale and tasks included.   Beside that advantage, there is an unclear point if we don\u2019t state the number of times each job is repeated in two months therefore I recommend we adjust the budget based on this: task - $/event x times. About the project team, there are 4 people involved. We have experience in CA and vCA, voter, and director in a female organization, all aspects relating to Cardano or blockchain will be assured to be clearly informed. We also have the base of IT, who I believe helps us with the technical problem occuring during the event. One of us is also a co-proposer for the other initiative relating to informing blockchain to people. This impresses me as it shows the commitment to the development of the Cardano ecosystem. We public our profile links like LinkedIn, twitter and have our own org website, which is transparent and a means to check the authenticity. In conclusion, the proposal is not bad in this part, but it needs to be better explored. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "From the auditability perspective, I find this proposal quite auditable. Based on the number of attendees, new people onboarding project catalyst, new project catalyst accounts created, people creating Yorio wallet, there will be a full image of success. Regardless, I expect a different measurement instead of new project catalyst accounts created, people creating Yorio wallet. These 2 measurements partly tell because they reflect a system-wide, not within the framework of this project anymore. Meanwhile, the reach and engagement on social media of the project, number of people watching records uploaded on YT reflect better the project. Using social listening tools to measure what participants talk about the events are a particular way to measure. On the other hand, I was wondering if it is uploaded to \u201chttp://www.ladiesnef.org/\u201d which is inaccessible or if we have somewhere else to track. With those, I suggest we have our progress uploaded to Sheet or Miro, or more specifications about the proposed application and the figures to track the success are required to help the audit easily and also help the community to track its effectiveness, everyone can witness and trust more in our feasibility. Because there is no statement about checking progress therefore, I rate this part the least impressive one compared to the first 2 parts. Overall, I receive enough information with specific quantitative data to judge this is an impactful proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3750", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1298, "q0": "The proposal aims to organize educational events focused on ladies in Ghana, with the goal to provide education regarding Cardano blockchain and its benefits. The proposer is describing the problem as in-proportional poor/wealth when comparing genders in Ghana, and that only 6% of rich, and 67% of poor are women. This is the base assumption that drives the proposer to make a change \u2013 and hopefully to provide education to women that could lead to decrease the gap between men and women. The meetings will be in a form of networking, on the topics \u201cCardano and its oppoturnities\u201d, and regarding the content of these meetings -> educational content -> keynote speakers -> networking. Although it is a nice idea, it is not stated how these attendees will be selected \u2013 will it be for everyone, without any technical knowledge, or it will be aimed for students, or possibly women in business? It would be nice to see some examples, that it will be beneficial even for those who is having e.g. no internet access nor technical knowledge. Nevertheless, after the meetings, those that will show interest will be invited to African Town hall to foster relations, and possibly to form partnerships and eventually (I assume) end up making some proposals. From my perspective, education is the key, and it applies to all proposals.

The budget requested is 4 456 USD in total, and it is also broken down into identifiable items. The highest items are 600 for 3 speakers, 500 for team fees (organization), and venue 553. The team is currently consisting from 4 people, when we have a bio provided along with linked in/twitter profiles.

Metrics that will be measured are number of attendees, number of people who will be on boarded to catalyst, and number of people who will create yorio wallet. I would also add a metric to actually assess, who will remain active member after few months after joining \u2013 by simply sending some questionnaire, whether the people will respond or no. The proposers will be also providing video recording from these meetings and uploaded to youtube channel.  Regarding the success of the proposal, it is to have at least 100 attendees on the first upcoming events. Next, it is stated that \u201cmost\u201d of them will create catalyst accounts \u2013 so 50%+ from the attendance? And I agree, that what we want to see in the future \u2013 proposals that emerged due to these meetings.

It is clear that if we seek to expand the wide-scale adoption of Cardano in the African region, we cannot do it without the inclusion of women. We are privileged to experience great job being done by some women like Mercy, Allison, etc and this indicates that if more women were empowered and given the chance, they will surely deliver good jobs and hence the need for a project like this to be funded by Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The details provided are clear.

This is for the reason that, for them to really understand the Blockchain and get involved, it needs time and assistance for better results. if not, we will not get the change we want from the women in the ecosystem and it all boils down to zero. So hosting the event three times within two months will be a great idea. Having this budget will help do more for the women in the community for the successful implementation of the project.
