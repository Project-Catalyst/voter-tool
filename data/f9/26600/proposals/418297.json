The practicality of the proposal is reflected in the benefits to African farmers through growing cashew trees and identifying the origin of cashew trees when exporting and doing business in foreign countries. This is a problem that needs to be solved because it is a common situation in the whole of African agriculture that is struggling because prices, verifying the origin of crops, and low income leads to difficulties. in the lives of farmers. If this proposal is put into practice, it will improve the economic lives of African farmers, have a very good impact on the agricultural economy of Africa, and it will work very well to make adds value to the Cardano ecosystem as NFTs are created and circulated regularly in life. I think it is possible to scale up and solve the future challenge for African agriculture and even for the agriculture of other continents when this model is widely replicated. I hope through proposals similar to this one, see the potential for further building a community to drive the adoption of the Cardano blockchain in the region.\nTherefore, this proposal has a significant and obvious impact on the agriculture of African countries and the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. I greatly appreciate the impact of this proposal. It would be right to vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "What I see most clearly is the experience of the proponent with 20 years of working in West Africa, collaborating with African farmers' sponsor organizations, so you have a clear understanding of the agricultural situation of this continent, production and business situation, and farmer's life. This is a very valuable experience when it comes to developing agricultural land and through this, the community can see the feasibility of the proposal when it is led and implemented by such experienced people. However, regarding the documentation shown in the proposal and the disclosure of the team's identity, I do not find it very clear. Only Emile shows the link on Discord. For the rest, Ronald and the development team are unidentified. In my opinion, the team should publicize the identities of all members, along with a link on social networks for the community to look up and follow. This is a great way to demonstrate the feasibility and increase the credibility of the team. It is a pity that the number of members of the team is also not disclosed. This makes the community more suspicious of the proposed transparency. Therefore, the team should heed my advice above. Your budget has been broken down by items and is reasonable with the goal. The calculation method is quite new but still ensures accuracy and logic. I have a question regarding the budget, if not funded by Catalyst at Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal as planned? This question will partially demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal.\nRegarding the plan and implementation method, the team was wise when making a plan and implementing it methodically in chronological order, with the main operations being to create NFTs and smart contracts. transparent, this is convenient for monitoring by the community and convenient for conducting audits. I strongly agree with the team's intention to create an NFT for managing and trading crops - it is not only beneficial in terms of economics, and saving costs, but also beneficial in terms of promoting product images and company, country of origin, country of origin, and other relevant information... because this NFT is expected to be a significant step forward with the Cardano blockchain technology.\nAs for the resources needed to implement the proposal, I'm sure that in addition to core members Emile and Ronald, many other collaborators are taking on different parts of a broad proposal. so big. Once again I would like to reiterate my advice about making the identities of as many members as possible. There are some stages in the implementation that require core members to directly participate because they have expertise in technology, namely operations related to the Cardano blockchain, NFT creation, NFT management, smart contracts, etc... Even the key members of the team may not be able to meet them because the workload requires too much high technology, when faced with such a situation, I would like to give advice. that the team has access to outside experts, especially outsourcing experts with Cardano blockchain expertise, access to experts is very helpful because we can select the best in the world to take on their professional work, through which we can learn many useful things from them about technological knowledge, applying technology in business and life.\nThe team has raised the risks associated with implementation, which I find quite convincing. It proves that the team has had close and specific concerns, anticipating possible risks when implementing this proposal. However, have you taken into account the legal risk of running smart contracts and NFTs in your business? Are these things allowed by the national government or the local government? Another risk I'd like to bring up, is access to high technology by everyone involved in the business? If they have technical difficulties (identifying, using NFT and smart contracts, is the team ready for the job of training and guiding people so that technology is no longer an obstacle for them? advice on adding team member identity, I agree on the feasibility of the proposal, and I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The milestones set by the team are specific to the work, but not clear in terms of the roadmap associated with time. I think this affects the transparency and auditability of the proposal. The community will have difficulty determining the timelines by which the team will complete the work, and it will be difficult to gauge the progress of the proposal. I strongly recommend that the team try to present the work progress at a more specific time. The example attaches each task to a specific month of the year (January, February - this is simply my example given). We all know how important specific timelines are to the assessment of a proposal's transparency and auditability. So I hope the team will fix this issue as soon as possible. The team has provided a key performance indicator (KPI) of living below the international poverty line, I wonder what other KPIs are based on the 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nations? I regret not knowing the key metrics of the proposal. If the proposal shows additional key metrics, that's great for defining transparency and auditability. In return, the team has made it clear what success is, with the standard being determining the fair price of a crop through the \"my crop\" NFT. I completely agree with this. Thus, in addition to giving suggestions for the team to revise the proposed milestone roadmap closely with time, I agree with the transparency and auditability of this proposal. I look forward to the proposal coming into practice soon to improve the lives of African farmers and contribute to the economic growth of the entire continent in the future.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2552", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10833, "q0": "First, I think the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal is very good.

Since the team is described as living in another country, but no further details have been provided as to their skills and involvement, I find that the mitigation has not been properly assessed.

Not being a developer myself I cannot judge the amount presented in an exact manner, however, having the experience of being an NFT project creator and having worked with developers myself, I find the timeline to be reasonable. Perhaps, I would have added a contingency scheme of at least a couple of days for unforeseen complications. But, nevertheless, the plan is reasonable.\nThe budget, however, is not sufficiently described. There are only two amounts for each of the main divisions, development and \u201cother effort\u201d with a total number of days and a total amount of requested dollars. But since we don\u2019t have any description or links regarding the development team (or any team member at all) which is the one doing the most difficult and important task of the project, I cannot judge the budget accurately, as I don\u2019t know how many team members will be needed for each task and if the requested funds are sufficient. \nGiven the amount of vital missing information, I find I cannot judge this section accurately and advise the proposers to resubmit the proposal in a future fund with the needed details.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress of the proposal is hard to track given the measures provided.

A given number of African farmers that will be using the dapp after X amount of time would be an example of a specific KPI related to this proposal.\nAlso, the number of trades on the platform, how many buyers and farmers have been connected through the platform etc would be some additional KPIs as well.\nGiven the missing details, I find I cannot evaluate the auditability accurately, and as such, I will rate it a 2.

This technology helps to manage and trace the origin of crops, growing areas, and farmers by using NFT and QR on the packaging.

This will help more people in Africa realize the value of Cardano through the application of Blockchain technology in agriculture.\nThis idea, if successful, will help increase the value of crops, the reputation of farmers, and consumer confidence in crops in Africa.\nI appreciate the impact of this idea.

However, the writing style of the project is quite confusing. The proponent should improve the writing style of the plan to make it easier to understand and clear.\nSome tips on how to present to the proponent hopefully help the proponent to have a better proposal in the next Fund.\n (1) First, it is necessary to give the necessary implementation time (in this proposal, 77 days, equivalent to 2.5 months) and the implementation stages (if there are multiple development stages).\n(2) The work items for each month (if possible, it should be specified according to work per week)\n(3) Time required for each job\n(4) KPI per month\n(5) Notes (number of people, notes)\n\nIn terms of budget, the budget makes up 8% of the total Challenge budget. The cost categories are stated in general. It is worth noting that the project implementation time said in the budget is 207.75 days, unlike the time in the plan table, which is 77 days. The proponent should list the cost items corresponding to the work items stated in the plan for easy management and checking the reasonableness of the cost. If possible, the proponent should write down a simple formula for calculating cost items (e.g., number of hours performed x unit cost of labor per hour = total labor cost for the job).\n\nRegarding project development team information, only two names of people working with the \"development team\" are available. There are no details of experience, proof of expertise, or work content in charge of the project.

And, the proponent should attach a link to the website or channel to update the project progress so that the community can follow it more easily, and at the same time increase the effectiveness of the project's marketing.\nI see the proponent mentioned using an independent auditor to check the transparency of the project.

However, they have asked for 40k which sounds reasonable for the type of app. I also recommend to the proponent to add links to prove the skills of the team members.
