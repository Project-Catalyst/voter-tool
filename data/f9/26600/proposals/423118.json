He intends to build a proof of concept for remittance payments from the Kenyan diaspora living in New York to their families or businesses in Kenya. The connection to the receiving can safely be established. The Bank of Kenya has a KYC considered safe by other International entities. On top of that, there also exists a telecom company that enables mobile payments - Safaricom - which has proven to be very popular, not just in Kenya but in some of the neighbouring countries as well. \nWhile the basis of the proposal is clearly established, the details that would complete the project are not very clear. The proposer seems to have given a lot of thought into this, has a lot of knowledge, and definitely seems very enthusiastic about implementing this product, but I am unclear about some of the implementations of the project, its timeline, budget, and other details that I will also be providing feedback upon in the upcoming sections. I think the idea could have a great impact, it\u2019s geared towards a very specific target population, that would probably be very willing to try it out. And since Cardano is very safe, fast and has low transaction fees, I don\u2019t see why they wouldn\u2019t continue using the product. But, the missing details and perhaps a more fluid text drafting would benefit this proposal. I would really hope, that if this proposal doesn\u2019t get funded in this round, the proposer should try and resubmit it, and hopefully incorporate some of the feedback he will have received from the PAs.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "While the main pillars of the project have been described, there are no additional details or timeframe given in which each of the steps would be developed. For example, what does it entail for the first step to be completed - \u201cBuild proof of concept service that works with Cardano\u201d. What steps and developments would be necessary, and how long would it take to develop these? How would they be tested or how many people would be needed to build them and so on. Providing answers to these questions would not only enable me to better assess the feasibility of the project but would most probably help the proposer in his work. The same questions apply to the other two steps.\nWhen looking at the budget, I find it to be confusing. First of all, there is no timeline provided and the number of hours needed to implement each step. Then, the proposer writes the budget as having monthly costs ranging from 0 to a specific number. If the number is zero, how does it all add up to $10000? The proposer has written a sentence in the impact section, that might be relevant in this context, namely \u201cTo avoid laundering and seizures, we'll not even plan to touch the ADA until the environment is less hostile\u201d. So here might lie a misunderstanding from the proposer's side, the amount he will be requesting will be used to pay for services, subscriptions or salaries to the people working on this project, himself included. If he intends to develop this alone and doesn\u2019t intend to sell his ADA, he is absolutely free to do so. But, if he requests an amount of dollars, then he should provide clear details about how that will be used, even if he only writes a specific number of hours needed for development and an hourly rate expressed in dollars.\nAnd for the team description, this is a section where he would need to present every team member needed to implement the project. If some of the members haven\u2019t been identified yet, then only the skill description is sufficient. Otherwise, a name, a short description of skills and possibly, even a LinkedIn profile link would provide a PA with all the needed info to help assess if the people involved are capable of successfully implementing the project.\nBecause of all the missing details, I can only rate the feasibility section with a 2.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I highly appreciate the proposer\u2019s honesty when answering the first question of the auditability section, namely the one regarding the progress of the proposal. It starts with \u201cI would like advice on this\u201d. I know from experience, that getting feedback for a proposal is sometimes difficult, so the best you can do to make sure you do, is to submit it and wait for feedback from the PAs.\nI am personally not familiar with Azure DevOps, but from taking a look at it, I would say that it looks very similar to other Kanban boards, and as such, it would probably be intuitive for anyone to use it for verifying the proposal\u2019s progress. I see that you can also connect your Github to it, as such, having them connected would be a very good method of keeping track of the project. What I would suggest, is also having a public link to the board, as to facilitate the community\u2019s ability to access it.\nI find the first paragraph of the success definition question to be appropriate in regards to the proposal and also reasonable. If the institutions in East Africa would also find ways to benefit from this, that would prove to be an even greater incentive for them to adopt it. \nIn the second part of the answer, though, I found that I couldn\u2019t exactly grasp what the proposer meant - \u201cit would be natural for the the stakeholders to have an equal voice, if not greater, and direct the project with their own ideas\u201d. Perhaps if there will be a resubmission of this proposal, he could possibly elaborate more on this?\nOverall, I find the auditability section to contain a reasonable amount of information and as such, I will rate it a 5.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 13, "ne": 4, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2446, "q0": "We see that the main objective of the project is to create a financial integration to facilitate transactions, involving Kenya at one end. With this, we can say that the proposal is aligned with the purposes of the project in which it is located. But we have that little information was transmitted about how this integration will be formed, and even though it is a project initially in a concept establishment phase, it would be interesting if more information had been transmitted about the methods used for these concepts to be established. In this context, we cannot confidently say that the budget being requested will be correctly used, in the same way that we are in doubt about the possible impact of the project.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In accordance with the aforementioned, for the construction of a project that involves international transactions using new technologies, we have that more details could have been informed. However, in the action plan that we found, we have a general citation of steps that do not provide us with much information. Furthermore, a project that aims to achieve the intended magnitude will certainly need to circumvent possible legal barriers, but we did not find people with this specific qualification in the project team. In fact, in this part we also find a very generic description, it would be nice if CVs of the people involved in this proposal were made available, to have greater confidence in relation to the feasibility of the project. We also note that the budget breakdown does not describe as well how the division of the total budget being requested is occurring.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We noticed that the perception of success being transmitted is consistent with what was said during the development of the project, however the metrics that would be used to understand the evolution of the proposal are not very clear. We only noticed the citation of possible tools that would be used, but we were not able to understand well which parameters would be measured during the process. Even though the project is still in a pilot phase, some indications such as a number of new ideas and concepts discovered weekly to be implemented could be interesting.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4235, "q0": "The US-Kenya Based WOT Remittance chain proposal seeks to address the challenge Grow Africa, Grow Cardano by establishing the trust-chain for migrant community to send remittance to regions where sanctions are common (US-Kenya is proposed as the pilot model). The proposer has set his sight on the proof-of-concept focusing on the remittance senders to Cardano solution.  The proposer suggests the risk of this project as his limitation in technical skill, lack of key point contact in Kenya, and the necessity of received ADA to stay on chain.  The project has some potential to scale provided the outcome of this proof-of-concept goes well. However, the proposal should take into account cost, speed and security when it comes to the remittance service. More studies should be conducted on how to scale this project and put Cardano at this lucrative market of remittance service. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal needs more succinct timeline and key milestones. The proposer understands main tasks to undertake this project but need to pinpoint the tentative project duration. As the proposer admits himself that he needs the advice on setting reasonable timelines and goals, I would suggest the proposers to approach the catalyst school to seek advice in drafting the proposals or approaching the technical community for coding related tasks. There is no explanation as to why the total budget is set at $10,000 but the proposer plans to spend it on promotion for adoption. However, there could be better ways than spending the entire budget on marketing or acquiring partners and there would surely be cost of setting up the trust chain. Also the proposer should provide his linkedin or github profile so that the voters would know who is working on the proposal. Should the proposer needs help in software and concept, there are a few community organized groups which he could explore by attending the first townhall in each funding round to understand more on the ecosystem. The project concept originates from the good intention to facilitate the cross border payment although the feasibilty of this project in term of team member, budget and timeline is yet unclear. Also when it comes to branchless remittance service, the proposer should also consider KYC & AML compliance. Usually the remittance service provider will have to do KYC on their clients which involves disclosing their personal info and this could prove to be a challenge between 2 jurisdictions. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer plans to use Azure DevOps and Kanban board as the tools to track project's progress. Github is also mentioned as the project resource sharing tool and public channel for delivering regular updates to the community for auditing progress. The proposer should define how he deems the project as a success ie. number of users, number of remittance transactions, number of countries in East African region that adopt this remittance chain solution. The identifiable measures of success provided at this current proposal is not sufficient for full auditability. The proposal has some good understanding on the solution that will need to facilitate the blockchain remittance service but there are still some missing information on market size of migrants, technicality, team and potential partners that need to be researched well in advance and taken into account when crafting the KPIs.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2525", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9251, "q0": "The proposal presents a good idea of the problem that it wants to face and for a problem that represents a strong challenge for the target audience of the solution, therefore being well correlated with a real need.\n\nI believe that in describing the proposal as a whole, the author has a good conceptual presentation of the problem and based on his expertise as a Computer Scientist. A suggestion to make this solution proposal more consistent would be to approach professionals with extensive knowledge of the global financial market. Thus, it will be more palpable what are the pains and challenges of this process from the point of view of the legal restrictions of this sector.\n\nFinally, evaluating scalability, the proposal, as thought by the author, has good potential to expand to an even more relevant audience and transform them into heavy users of the system.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, one of the major limitations that the author presents is a clear notion of the team needed to fulfill the mission, both in terms of skills and amount of involved people.\n\nFrom its concept construction, it would be interesting to see this proposal pass through the hands of experts in software development, in the global financial market and in the Kenyan local market. I believe that this complementary knowledge would add a lot of value in the construction of the proposal.\n\nJust as the proposal lacks technical data for implementation, the structuring of the action plan and budget also ended up being somewhat superficial, disregarding important developments to put the project on its feet.\n\nOn the positive side, the author himself considered these points in the risks involved in the project, which shows that he is aware of these challenges and limitations.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the project progress monitoring information, the author stated that he needed advice to follow the best path. In this case, what I can advise, following my experience as a project manager, would be the adoption of common tools in agile methodology, both to guarantee evolution and to give visibility to the community.\n\nClear structuring of the steps is essential, considering the people involved and the budget required. In addition, the author can develop a timeline, giving visibility to his deliverables. Finally, something relevant to the community would be an accessible report containing a consolidation of achievements.\n\nAn interesting point of the proposal is the good notion of project success that the author demonstrates.

It is assumed that he has no experience in blockchain building, thus, I believe based on his experiences alone it is insufficient to implement said proposal. As for the plan in the proposal, it is very limited and short of what is said to achieve in the proposal. Only 3 things exist in the plan: 1. build a proof of concept service that works with Cardano, 2. Build a similar service that works with Safaricom API and 3. A shared library should be minimal, as a simple contract that binds the two, and lives in both projects. The plan is not sufficient for the task that is set.

This cannot be measured in a short time after the completion of the proposal thus it is not an ideal measurement to assess the audit the success.
