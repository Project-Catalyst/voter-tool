I would like to see this project again in the next Foundation if this proposal is not Funded in this Fund. Not only in Africa but other regions of the world need skilled Blockchain developers, which is one of the dilemmas in the field.\n\nThe solution of this idea is good, it identifies a few problems of the challenge, and the author of this idea argues in a logical, neat, and creative way. The solution creates schools for ethics. Creativity is a long-term step, not only raising the level of expertise for future generations but also a sustainable and long-term solution. With TECH-E and its first trial in Senegal with free educational programs, it is anticipated to benefit the Blockchain market here and in Africa in the future.\n\nThe project has a detailed description of some implementation risks, in addition to some suggested solutions by the author to overcome them, but the community needs to be informed for more solutions to these problems. . That risk if the Scheme is funded. On the other hand, funding risk, or more precisely financial risk is just one of the general areas of the project when it is funded to deploy, the author needs to list more than other risks such as personnel risks. (long-term with the project or quit), The French support staff is not a risk, and should be listed in the list of personnel needed to implement the project. solutions to limit these risks and those risks.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal to introduce unclear and detailed work implementation timelines compared with limited implementation resources will affect the project audit process. The proposal only estimates the time to complete the project and the goals achieved in general, the community needs a more detailed implementation plan corresponding to the implementation timeline, the author can refer to the Microsoft Project tool Management for more detailed and methodical support.\n6 months of implementation is not a long time, so the author considers dividing the implementation progress by week.\n\nThe proposed project budget is less than 20% of the total budget of this challenge, compared to the information the proposal provides, some project expenditures need to be clarified if it is to be funded. Example: 25 Calculator: $250 * 10 = $6250 - This one I find no logic in the math formula. ?!. Therefore, the author needs to check and revise to suit the necessary funding to implement the project.\n\nHuman resources to implement this project have been assigned specific jobs for each item, and the experience of the members shows that they are completely suitable for the project. However, the identities of the members are also difficult to verify. clear. The author of this project is Bineta NGOM providing a reputable identity verification link like LinkedIn, ... for the community to verify identity easily and practically, partner Ousmane Ndome: Developer, YouTuber I also need to provide that information, besides Youtube channel information, I can't identify anything else.

With 150 students at the beginning, 40 students, and 5 people completing the training, ... this is one of the metrics that are very easy to measure and check through a Youtube channel page.\n\nThe ideas of this project have not been proven successful, and have not been tested in practice, but it is a good idea. In my opinion, this project succeeds when the community sees how many students are trained to master blockchain development and how many students can build innovative applications on Cardano, not the general population. such as: \"increasing the number of Blockchain developers so that they can in turn train other young people\"\n\nBrand new idea information on Cardano platform never received any funding from Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2489", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7436, "q0": "Solution with the desire to create a blockchain school to train young people in Senegal, an African country. Help them access smart contract knowledge, deploy applications on Cardano. Based on the above 2 things, the project is completely suitable for the Challenge\nBlockchain is a new technology to the world, this is an opportunity for African countries to grasp, approach and develop in parallel with countries in other continents. The project understands this and wants through the project to present blockchain knowledge to the younger generation. With the above orientation, the project should detail the process of developing training content, reference sources, operating structure, standards for faculty recruitment, local laws on blockchain education, etc. is at the core of building sustainable schools, educating students and creating a thriving community.\nAs for the risk that French is the main language in Senegal, I completely agree with the mitigation option, the Cardano community is really strong and diverse. Regarding the operational cost risk, the project proposes to offer the course in English for a fee, which is not really feasible, because at risk 1, English is a barrier, the number of participants will not much. I would like to add the following option: the project considers that it should not build a physics school, can ask for support from universities and high schools with available facilities, computers, and networks. Thereby converting construction costs into operating costs. Optimizing team strength. I rate this part 4 points\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The blueprint is sketchy, the community doesn't have enough data to confirm. It is recommended to list specific steps, such as knowledge synthesis, reference sources, teacher selection criteria, curriculum promotion, site search, equipment procurement, selection students, training process, contests if any... Accompanied by an estimate of the number of labor hours needed to complete, making the project more intuitive.\nThe detailed budget is quite complete in terms of construction and procurement. However, as mentioned in the above sections, the project should spend the expenses on realizing the content of learning and training the team. That helps good teaching quality, which is the premise for sustainable development. As for refreshments, I think it should be converted into another more effective cost, in the sense that it is a personal expense. The total application fund is 45,000 which is 9% of the whole challenge, this is a large number that, when used appropriately, produces great results.\nThe team has 2 members, in my opinion, it is quite thin to complete the project, there are many stages that need diverse expertise, such as school construction, learning content design, recruitment, training, academic advisors. training, operation, marketing, etc. Although the project is expected to recruit human resources, all have not had a specific plan, and the community does not have enough data to evaluate.

Tech-E is going to be a locally based Senegalese technology school that will train people especially the under privileged and girls on blockchain technology (with Cardano being the face of the program) and how it can impact their lives and the lives of others in Africa. The goal is to have a future generation of inspired developers with insightful ideas to impact the catalyst community. The proposer also talks about how language has been a barrier in previous programs since Senegal is a French-speaking country and most of the training materials are in English but the plan this time around is to link with people in the ecosystem to assist in the delivery of the program. The team also plans to have paid English courses for their members to enhance their capacity to deliver content in English.\nWhat makes this proposal different and interesting from other proposals with similar ideas is how the focus will be on the underprivileged and mainly, girls.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "According to the plan, the project will spread over six months, with the activity for each month stated. However, each activity still lacks details. Month one to three(1-3) lacks clarity. Month one deals with \"Prospecting for the loan of schools\", the team fails elaborate on how this process will be done. Month two also deals with \"Student recruitment\", since the main focus of the project is centered on the underprivileged, and girls, it would have been ideal to know how this selection process would be carried out.\nThe budget is properly laid out and detailed. I still recommend that the community provides an expert to verify the figures. The team also has the right qualifications and experience to carry out the project. Information on each member is provided along with their social handles for easy traceability. The team plans to also recruit temporary members with knowledge in blockchain especially Cardano, to help in the teaching process. \nWith a little more details on the plan, the team would be ready to go.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPI's stated are very realistic, simple, and measuring.

The problem you posed is reasonable, the countries that are behind in most technology have the opportunity to catch up, which is to have access to new technologies such as blockchain. The vision of blockchain is revolutionary for the world and its early mastery will greatly accelerate the development.\nI think the proponent needs to be more specific about the educational strategy that the project will adopt. Because the difficulty is budget, you need to come up with a process or plan on how to optimize the budget as much as possible, it helps me believe in the quality of education more, especially Free courses will face a lot of difficulties leading to reduced quality. I think the most useful solution to this problem is to raise the self-study spirit of students, nothing is effective and simple by making them really interested and passionate about Blockchain. This can be done by increasing the frequency of exchange sessions between students, encouraging research on Blockchain's revolutionary articles, and continuously giving examples of its application during training. You could invite some of the experts who have had considerable success and in-depth knowledge to share their views on the field. Or organize small events like NFT creation, this activity will be very effective in getting acquainted with Blockchain. Promote students' creativity and curiosity. You will focus on collecting and finalizing materials for the students to use.\nI hope you will listen to some of my comments above.
