The amount asked is reasonable, however, the cost breakdown seems vague. For example Website Redesign - $2500, Social Media Manager - $1500 USD, and Initial Awareness Campaign / Contest - $2000 USD. Despite listing these amounts it's unclear if it would be a single individual or a team that will carry out these tasks. Looking at the Telegram channel there are no pieces of information already posted that members can start to interact with things like what is Blockchain, how is Cardano different from most other blockchains in terms of how it's constructed, and how to acquire some Ada.

The proposal aims to enhance the adoption of the Cardano Blockchain and raise awareness of Cardano in one of the top nations in the world with one of the highest percentages of cryptocurrency users (Nigeria).\n\nThe team seeks to organize periodic incentivized contests, giveaways, and Cardano meetups. These meetups, giveaways, and contests will increase the number of new Africa-based users being onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups), increase the number of Africa-based developers on Cardano's blockchain, and also increase the volume of transactions being performed on the blockchain in Nigeria.\u00a0\n\nIf funded, I would recommend that the team partner up with other organizations and companies in Nigeria so as to reach a wider audience, gain extra funding, and become self-reliant so they won't need to return to Catalyst for additional funds.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience provided, I cannot confirm whether the proposal will be carried out successfully or not.

Indeed in Africa, Nigeria is well known for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology participation but there is less knowledge and adoption of Cardano. This proposal seeks to establish a hub that will help Nigerians participate in activities and interaction to learn and earn. I like the idea about learning and earning since it will motivate participation. This proposal if well educated will lead to awareness and massive participationa and adoption of Cardano and ADA as a cryptocurrency of choice among participants.

A possible solution to this, would be to provide the necessary support documentation in terms of links and reports to the recent trend of employment in Nigeria by age category reported by the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics and the news media.\nBelow are a couple of links to the report and website of those organization I highlighted above. \nhttps://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/\nhttps://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/nigeria-unemployment-hit-35-in-2021-agusto-co/#:~:text=Nigeria's%20unemployment%20rate%20rose%20to,rating%20agency%2C%20Agusto%20%26%20Co.\nDue to the fact that the problem statement is poorly articulated by not addressing a real challenge in the Nigerian context, a priority judgement cannot be ascribed.

Technology business incubators are great catalyst in socio \u2013 economic development of talents and skills on the African continent. \n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The fact that DripADA is solely presented by a single person, shows the lack of experience in terms of the required human and financial resources needed to successfully implement this idea. A probable solution to this would be to research the structure and organization of the Technology Business Incubator model. Also required is the recruitment of other professionals who have some experience in writing business plans for such incubators or are skilled at the organization and implementation of hackathons and other technology related student/community activities.\nThis newly proposed research should also extend to the current remuneration packages given to employees working at an incubator in the country. This will be of tremendous help in restructuring a new budget for submission to be made by the launch of Fund10.\nAlso, to point out that the impact statements are poorly articulated as the proposed solution does not show future growth potential that will scale the adoption of Cardano activities in Nigeria or Africa in greater context. This is also seen in the proposed risk and mitigation measures of the idea.\nThe idea timeline and milestones should also be reappraised beyond the impact of social media promotional activities to include other onsite and offline related community engagements that will foster the development of local talents in the country. A new timeline should also reflect the acquisition and location reconstruction or design for a community hub that will aid the delivery of talent development activities.\nThe budget as proposed hasn\u2019t considered the purchase of technical software and hardware packages needed to effectively engage its community. Also missing from the budget are cost allocation items for activities related to the facilitation of training programs and their instructors, which is required by every community that builds talents.\nAnother item that wasn\u2019t in the budget is the purchase and service fees for the provision of internet facilities should a hub location be decided upon. This is also an essential item needed by the hub management and the community members to effectively interact with the Project Catalyst global community,\nPower generation and supply remains a key challenge in Nigeria. This facility is required for inclusion in a new budget. Its provision will relieve issues of intermittent power supply in Nigeria.

These new KPI\u2019s should include hub process and performance indicators with cost benefit ratios in relation to startups and jobs created through the program.\nOne major advantage of this proposed project is that the proposer has a great ability in using social media to the advantage of publicity of this initiative. This should be supplemented by the creation and recruitment of other required positions in a new organogram that will lead to a better implementation of this idea.\nA new assessment of the problem statement and its solution will resolve a lot of the doubts associated with this project in this assessment report. \n", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3800", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Dripada will be a Cardano focused Grassroot Community Hub that will play a great role in the enlightenment and foster greater adoption of Cardano in Nigeria through meetups and learn to earn programs.", "experience": "Dripada is currently a one man idea, it's the brainchild of Amaka Asouzu, an experienced web blogger who has had years of experience managing and running smaller online communities.\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiamaka-asouzu-186941235/"}
