This would allow people who want to learn more to attend the entire session on 4 days and be able to start operating in Cardano.\nThis proposal aligns with the challenge objective since it may be an opportunity to onboard new members, to expand Cardano and to scale it up to business and individuals beyond the local community participation.\nMy rating is a 5 star\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers team is formed by people with different and complementary professional background.

Since the team have been funded before by catalyst, they have had the exposure deliver on the task. The work plan is brief and have important contents that would drive the understanding of blockchain. These milestones and schedules are not that ambitious to deliver but one that has clear roadmap for success. \n\nThough the budget is quite concise and detailed, it is important to reconsider the travel to Portugal for the translation into Portuguese. There should be local translators to undertake this exercise to reduce cost or translation can be done in Portugal and sent via mail for printing without necessarily taking flight. The travel to Portugal is what is making the budget a huge one. This will be important to divert the funds into a more blockchain literacy works.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has put in place a number of KPIs to guide the progress of the proposal.

The team proposed a solution to organize a practical workshop in Luanda to attract funding and promote opportunities and work through local relationships. Geographically, Luanda is the capital and largest city of Angola. Is a country in South Africa. Has a population of 2,572 million (2020). Geographically it is convenient to proceed with the proposal and development of Africa. Propose detailed description and specific solutions. The workshop will translate for 4 days into Portuguese. The educational material will be divided into two parts (4 days). The first day will introduce Blockchain technology, the second day of the Cardano ecosystem, the third and last day: Cardano practice. The seminar days are arranged closely according to specific time. The workshop with the impact of helping people raise awareness about Blockchain in general and Cardano in particular. The training will be held locally and delivered by experienced professionals in the financial and technology sectors.

In addition, the team provided a draft schedule presented for two months. And in those two months, the work needed to complete the project was also analyzed and explained thoroughly by the team. The team gave a very clear roadmap, we know all the work that needs to be done, how and at what time. Next is the budget. The proposal asks for $22,946, less than 10% of the total challenge budget. In my opinion, the requested budget is appropriate and clearly explained. The team has come up with a budget table that is broken down in detail through 3 contents: Translation, travel and event logistics. Budgets are allocated to tasks in a clear and coherent manner. Defined specifically for each specific hour, space and time. The team analyzed the Portuguese monetary budget (EUR) and converted it to dollars. Finally, about the team members who will be involved in working on the project. The group has three members and each member has a written introduction about them. We know their identity, skills, experience are suitable to perform the work on the project. At the same time, there are many attached links, they can understand more about their background, past and present work. Especially Dmitry, who will translate the conference content, has many years of experience in the field of technology, financial markets ... active on the Cardano and Cardano Stack Exchange forums, runs the stake group on cardano, is a contributor to the Cardano Developer Portal... all attached with links to access and demonstrate what was presented.

The solution resides in the organization and translation of a 4-Day   workshop into Portuguese to attract local partnership and development of the blockachain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. To develop a framework through which individuals, businesses and government can partner to push Cardano in Africa.\nThe proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through networking, partnership, training and development of the skills and knowledge of people in the Cardano ecosystem. \nFurthermore, the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges by already translating whatever goes on there to other native speakers in Portuguese to undersatnd and follow the same guidelines to also have the same knowledge and training.

The other participants have experiences in marketing some sectors such as telecommunications, banking, oil and gas and services. In conclusion, this team have good competence to implement the proposal. Regarding the challenges, the writer consider the risk of Covid-19/ war impact leading to the absence on the workshop days. However, as for me the writer should also consider the risk people may not enter the workshop when the media does not work well.

We need to expand the Cardano ecosystem and benefit Africa and indigenous peoples. The team that came up with the solution is the organization a field workshop in Luanda and translated a 4-day Workshop into Portuguese for the purpose of attracting funding and promoting local networking opportunities. I strongly support the view and believe it is a good idea to contribute to the development of the African diaspora in Cardano The team will translate the educational content of a 4- to 8-day workshop from English to Portuguese The content of the educational material is the basics of blockchain and Cardano (first 2 days), hands-on learning how to interact and build on Cardano (last 2 days) seminar to educate the Angolan community, the group effectively tackled the challenge The team proposed to increase Cardano adoption in Africa by discussing the use cases for blockchain and Cardano with local participants and businesses. In addition, the proposed group outlined the schedule of 4 seminars very clearly and in detail from time to content presented in the workshop. The project has identified the desired outcomes.

Each timeline outlines the tasks and work items to be completed in great detail. In my opinion, the team should add to the proposal specifying the positions and the number of personnel to complete the work. The budget plan is divided into sections corresponding to the items that need to be invested (translating content from English to Portuguese, Portuguese / Angolan tourism, event logistics). Expenditure items are mentioned very clearly and in detail. However, I think in order to increase the transparency of the proposal, the team needs to clearly state the amount of funds used to pay salaries for how many officials to implement the project. The aim is to give the community a better overview of the actual costs of the project. The team members have diverse experience that can make the project a huge success. I can say that the proponents provided evidence (references, links, etc.) of relevant skills and experience required to implement the proposal. The team has done similar projects in the Blockchain space and that is something to be commended for. Therefore, it is very likely that this proposal will be successfully implemented.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding the suitability of the proposal, I think it is very well written. This proposal provides sufficient information to gauge progress in achieving the stated objectives.

The team mentioned reporting with the following KPIs will be generated at the end of each month, but I'm looking to see how they will go about their reporting.
