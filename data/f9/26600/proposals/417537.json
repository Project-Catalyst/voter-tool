The team has done well putting the proposal at the right challenge. The problem within the challenge which needs to be solved by this proposal is over 90% of African businesses are SMEs and lack access to legal services and the solution the proposer proposes is to expose Cardano and the blockchain ecosystem to the larger market using students of European Business University (EBU) to train them as developers to build smart contract solutions for some of these local businesses in Africa because majority of their students are in their certificate impact program. \nThe proposal clearly articulates how it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem through their hackathon and internship program, businesses will be able to have smart contracts implemented which will create  \nthe potential for job opportunities that emerge from this smart contracts thereby will create a demand for the skill encouraging more people to take on Cardano development. Also, the key metrics and goals of the proposal align with the outlined challenge settings which is positive. And the proposal is able to scale to address future challenges  as it will become a main course for subsequent stidents who are attending EBU to also have the opportunity to learn and come on board the cardano ecosystem.

I realize that most of the proposals in this challenge aim to educate people about Cardano, so that from there they have new income opportunities, for example. This is important, but there are already several initiatives in this direction, so investing in more innovative things is really necessary. This is the case here: the problem portrayed is that \u201cover 90% of African companies are SMEs and cannot afford traditional business protection through a lawyer. This factor puts them at risk of losses in case of breach of contract and non-commitment\u201d. And to address this, the proposed solution would expose \u201cCardano and the blockchain ecosystem more to the larger market and our student developers have built smart contract solutions for some of these local companies.\u201d This would be done by the European Business University - Luxembourg (EBU), a university that has 85% of its students coming from African countries, as the proponent reports. They already offer a course on Plutus/Haskell, which is based on teaching material provided by IOG itself; In this course, students need to deliver a practical project to be approved. The idea here would be, from what I understand, to give impetus to this initiative, through the organization of a hackathon for each period. As a result, more students would be educated about Cardano's technologies, and would be encouraged to produce more and more smart contracts. The idea is that successful students in the hackathon are directed to internships in partner companies of the university. This certainly achieves 100% of the challenge objectives. On the one hand, many young people will be instructed to work with our programming languages, which will open up opportunities for them to get involved with the most diverse projects of Cardano; thus, they would have an opportunity to grow professionally, have their careers boosted and generate a good income. On the other hand, skilled labor would be generated, which is increasingly a need within our ecosystem. As Catalyst progresses, more projects need more developers, even interns, to put their ideas into practice. With this program, both Africa and Cardano would fully benefit; in addition to students, companies would also benefit, as their actions would be better protected through smart contracts. With this, I believe that several specific objectives of the challenge would be met, such as \u201cNumber of proposals addressing the fundamental issues preventing Cardano adoption in Africa + Number of proposals offering solutions to infrastructure and education concerns + Number of new Africa-based users onboarded onto Cardano (wallets, platform sign-ups) + Number of new Africa-based Catalyst members (proposers, voters, CAs) + Number of new African projects seeded in 2022\u201d.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal roadmap could be more detailed. For example, let's look at the following snippet: \u201cMilestone 1: Organizing the Hackathon. During the first occurrence, organize all past successful students to form groups, and work on their projects based on a problem statement. One week later, the students present their working projects during the hackathon. Have the projects assessed by the EBU team and the Plutus/Haskell course instructor\u201d. What is said is, in a superficial way, what would happen in the practice of the project. However, more details about each part could have been attached. Starting with temporality: we don't know how long each milestone would take, what time is expected for each result to be achieved. For example, milestone 1 would be based on organizing the hackathon; we know what would happen (\u201cduring the first occurrence, organize all successful alumni into groups and work on their projects based on a problem statement. A week later, students present their work projects during the hackathon. Have the projects evaluated by the EBU team and the Plutus/Haskell course instructor\u201d). In this part, the level of detail is much better than, for example, in milestone 2, which would be the internship program itself. We know what results would be expected, but for example: how would the contact with companies that need the solutions being studied and created here be made? How would students be introduced to these corporations, how would they be supported to start working in the institutions? I believe that what we have is a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat would happen, but the level of specificity does not allow us to solidly understand each step that would be taken. Speaking of the budget, in my view the asking price is quite fair, it's 28 thousand dollars. The value is divided into some parts, some of which are better explained and simpler (such as the prizes for the winning teams of the hackathons, the money destined for the interns, etc.). However, the final part of the explanation is a bit confusing. $10,000 is set aside to \u201crun the program each period to create more demand for Cardano smart contract developers as well as increase our reach.\u201d How much would go for each part? How would the range be increased, how would that be done? Perhaps a marketing process, to publicize the program, so that new students and companies would be interested in the program; but it would be important that the use of the $10,000 be explained more precisely. The team is also presented in a superficial way, that is, we know little information about each team member. We are usually told their names, roles and linkedin profiles. But it is always interesting that we have a more in-depth knowledge of each one, that a slightly more extensive curriculum is attached to the proposal itself as well, to better understand their professional background and how they are qualified for the project. Overall, feasibility is not bad, but all topics could be better detailed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent presents 4 KPIs that would serve as ways for us to understand whether the desired progress is being achieved: \u201cKPI 1:\nThe projects developed during the hackathon (\u2026) + KPI 2: The number of students incubated as interns for the development and implementation of smart contract solutions needed by these corporations/businesses. + KPI 3: The number of students offered job opportunities within these corporations to progress with the development and implementation of more smart contract solutions within their operations. + KPI 4: Development of EBU Hubs as a result of larger masses taking interest in the use of the Cardano blockchain technology\u201d. However, I believe that in addition to the partial results, we must understand what the work behind it would have been like. For example, we know that the first KPI is based on the projects developed during the hackaton; How can we verify if, in addition to the projects, the learning process was adequate, if the possible doubts were solved, if the students really made the best use of the knowledge provided here? How can we understand that the internship program, suggested in KPI 2, would be as beneficial as possible, both for students and for companies? And how could we monitor the work done by the team members, by the university team, behind each of these small successes? The proponent also lacked an explanation of how this information would reach the members of the Cardano ecosystem. Would there be reports, so the community would be constantly updated? Perhaps through social networks, the university's website, through the participation of the team in Townhalls, how would this contact be established? For these reasons, I believe that auditability is well underway, but not yet adequate. Speaking of the success scenario, that is, the final results, what are suggested are very clear ways of realizing if the project would be achieving what was planned: \u201cstudents build great projects during the hackathon that solve the problem statement / have more students sparks interest in learning Plutus/Haskell and enrolls in the course as a result / students get internships and even job opportunities, applying their new knowledge and skills to real business applications / EBU Hubs development starting in Kenya, where they come from most of our students, and eventual expansion in Africa and the world\u201d. In my view, what remained pending here was: to study in more depth the impacts generated for the companies themselves, how they would be facing Cardano's technologies, how such technologies were useful for their businesses to be preserved and their revenues to increase. In general, understanding how our blockchain would be entering the market - the observations pertinent to the students are ideas, in my view. So the suggestion I make is that these data are also studied and that all the information is gathered in a final presentation, which could be done through Townhall, for example. Auditability, as well as the other topics of this proposal, is good, needing only a few improvements.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10572, "q0": "\u201cHackathon and Internship Program\u201d is a good idea and it is suitable for the challenge of \u201cGrow Africa, Grow Cardano\u201d because as far as I know, Africa is an underdeveloped region, and many areas in this country are still limited, especially are the economic crises of recent years in Africa that make businesses unable to afford to grow. Besides, Blockchain technology is still a relatively new technology, not yet applied in many parts of the world, it has only been popularized in some regions and developed countries such as the United States and some other European countries. This proposal has deeply emphasized an issue of concern today, that is: \"Over 90% of African businesses are SMEs and cannot afford traditional business protection through a lawyer. This factor puts them at risk of losses in case of contract breaches and non-commitment\". Through this program, the proponent wants to introduce the Cardano ecosystem and Blockchain technology more to a larger market that requires students to build smart contract solutions for a larger market number of businesses in this locality. I see that this is an important issue and has a relatively large impact scale with the current situation, universities and research centers are built everywhere, which means that the number of students is increasing day by day. Moreover, this is the human resource for socio-economic development in the future. Therefore, creating a platform that brings opportunities for young people to access and experience the Cardano ecosystem is an extremely useful and meaningful idea. I think, if this project is successful, it will increase the number of participants and scale-up up the Cardano ecosystem. Besides, to ensure students continue to apply the knowledge and concepts learned, EBU plans to hold a hackathon every semester, Students will also have a chance to win prizes for their proposed method. It can be seen that it is worth mentioning that the new participants are all young people, they will have many ideas, more creativity, and a relatively new perspective on an issue that they are approached to help a lot in promoting the overall development of the whole ecosystem. Not only that, but it also creates conditions for the young generation who want to work on Blockchain technology to have a stable job that matches their interests and passions. Specifically, here students will be interning at these corporations as they build on these solutions. This not only creates potential future employment opportunities for them but also a way to solve real business problems. The plus point here is that in addition to presenting the great impacts of the project, the proponent also offers and explains the solutions in detail and is easy to grasp, the solution clearly states the purpose and the focus is that through the hackathon businesses will be able to implement smart contracts for their operations, thus building and empowering them and more potential job opportunities will emerge, increasing the incentive for newcomers to develop Cardano. In addition, by pointing out the risks and challenges that the team will face when implementing the project, which is \"Natural difficulty of the Plutus/Haskell course might limit students from completing the course which is a requirement to benefit from the program.\u201d or \u201cNot having 100% of our students getting internships\u201d. Although the challenges are relatively huge, the proponent has proposed strategies to reduce those risks. However, if possible, I hope if this project is successful with students, it will be extended to many other audiences, people who work in other fields but also want to learn more. about Blockchain technology, learn about Cardano. To do this, I think the team can build both online and offline scenarios to suit each audience's adaptive conditions.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal presented the implementation roadmap with 2 main milestones and the work and tasks to be completed for each of them. However, I found that, instead of just listing those tasks, the proponent should add a more detailed plan, such as Milestone 1: start and end time of the organization Hackathons? Where is the venue? Who will be assigned the main responsibility to control the process and the quality of each stage, etc. thereby making it easier for everyone to grasp the overall situation and control the results achieved? Regarding the budget, the proponent has also given a fairly clear and detailed outline, allotted and clearly explained the 3 purposes of using that budget, specifically the budget will be used to award prizes are $2,100 and an internship portion of the program is $18,750, Logistics and planning $5,000. This specific detailed planning, helps everyone see more transparency and rationality, and helps control costs and avoid unnecessary waste. However, perhaps there is confusion here, the total budget detailed is only $25,850 but the team is leaving a total value of $26.000. Regarding the participating team, the proponent also provided information about the full names and positions of the participants, including the Director, Technical Administrator and Support Officer, Scholarship Program Coordinator, Data Scientist, and Instructor, according to which the proponent also attaches a LinkedIn for easy access and inspection. However, in my opinion, this section should add more working experience and suitability of each member in each specific position in this project to increase credibility and persuasion.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To measure the progress and success of the project, the proponent has provided very specifically and clear KPI groups, divided into 4 parts with 4 different contents. However, in my opinion in this part, if possible, the proponent should add more specific data so that people can easily evaluate the effectiveness. The success of the project is also presented in great detail, separated into 4 stages for everyone to follow more easily. Thereby, I see that the auditability of this project is relatively high. This is a completely new project but it is not difficult to realize that the team has planned and built very detailed and methodical and reasonable, full of aspects.
