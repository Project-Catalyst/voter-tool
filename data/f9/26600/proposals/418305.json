The creation of this hub would perfectly meet several of the specific objectives present in the challenge description, increasing the number of: \u201cproposals that address the fundamental issues that impede the adoption of Cardano in Africa; new Africa-based users integrated with Cardano (wallets, platform subscriptions); new Catalyst members based in Africa (proponents, voters, CAs); new Catalyst members based in Africa (proponents, voters, CAs); African projects launched in 2022 and finally from African developers\u201d. Proponents argue very well for the need to translate content into French and Arabic, since most of the population in several countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, etc., speak these two languages, and it is It's an old problem that most of the content related to Cardano is in English and that means a big problem of accessibility for people who don't speak the language natively. Proponents also argue how large the number of people will be reached: around 255 million. My observations, however, are that the proponents could have been more specific in some explanations. For example, in the following two passages: \u201cWe propose the creation of a community center in Arabic and French to help North Africans embark. Biweekly meeting with educational content will help inform about the Cardano Platform and Catalyst projects\u201d - what would that educational content be, exactly? Would it be something created from scratch, or would they translate previously existing content from Catalyst School, or even from well-established youtube channels like the IOG channel and Catalyst Swarm, for example? In the other excerpt: \u201cwe also propose to translate introductory educational material into Arabic and organize events on Cardano and Blockchain\u201d. It would be very beneficial for them to explain more about this introductory content. What would be the specific issues addressed and through the approach they would be commented on? How could we make content that is often predatory, simple and accessible to our target audience? Returning now to the positive points, it is quite valid that the proponents have already thought about the main problems they may face (the lack of funding and the lack of engagement of new members) and have already proposed solutions, I think it is quite coherent to ask for a smaller amount of funding so that they can succeed more easily and get the project off the ground. In general, the proposal is highly impactful (but the explanations I mentioned would complement even better what is being presented).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The topic is great and will receive full marks, but I would like to offer some constructive criticism. Speaking specifically about the script, I believe that the information is not conveyed very adequately. The timeline is not so clear, how long is the project planned to last? 3 months, how long would it take for the next fund to be established (between the release of results from f9 to f10)? It is said that some meetings would take place every fortnight, but as I mentioned in the impact part, it is not known exactly what issues would be addressed, nor do we have information about the pre-production process of these meetings. It would be important that some more details were explained, such as: who would participate in each meeting, among the members presented in the team; how the meetings would be publicized, how the North African community would be informed whenever there was a new event; how the organization of these meetings itself would be (how long would they last, if by chance the first hour was for exposing content and the second for questions and answers, for example\u2026). Likewise, could more details have been provided about the other parts of the roadmap (planning meetings, what content would be published on the blogs, how support would be provided - individually or in group sessions? In my view, the way the roadmap was presented to us, we did manage to have an understanding of what will be done, but this one is not so detailed. Speaking of expenses, the asking amount is very affordable compared to other Catalyst proposals, and it is divided into two large parts: the costs for maintaining the site and the zoom license and the incentives for the team; from what I understand the workers' hour would cost 50 dollars, but for example in the translation part (that would be 6 documents translated, right?), and in the management of Telegram and Discord, it could be explained better how this management process would take place. From what I understand the cost would be 100 dollars per month, but it would be important for us to understand the role of this pr professional in the project. When it comes to the team, we have Elias and Ayoub as active members of the community, which is super important. I believe that more basic information about who they are is passed on. I would like a slightly more extensive resume on each. However, trust is passed on, as we know the most essential thing about each of them, their linkedin profiles and who has some kind of previous experience with our blockchain. With this, I believe that the proposed feasibility is good, and can be improved in the aspects mentioned above, so that our level of understanding can improve even more about all parts (especially in script).", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Finally, thinking about auditability, the proponents tell us some really useful and valid data, but not my view that still need to be worked on better if we are looking for perfect auditability. Talking first about how we could monitor the periodic progress, the suggestion would be through \u201cMeeting recordings + Community members + Number and quality of translated content\u201d. In addition to understanding how many meetings would be held, I would like us to be able to monitor the pre-production process of these meetings, that is, what would be done to make them possible. In other words, the team planning meetings, the content translation process, etc. The use of funding would already be demonstrated to the community, which indicates that the proponents already have an intention to keep all of us updated on what is happening, so I believe it is necessary that we also know what is happening in relation to these other two variables (the pre-production process of the meetings and about the meetings themselves). That way we would have a more complete monitoring. Such information should be reported to our community, I believe, at least at the end of each month. About success, this is explained very succinctly as the integration of new members (North Africans) both in the general community of Cardano and in the catalytic project; and the goal is for 20 participants to attend these fortnightly meetings. In addition to analyzing numerical data, a direct survey could be carried out with the target audience so that we could understand how they were relating to the various parts of the community. Would they have joined project teams, would they have been using Dapps, would they have registered identities at Atala Prism, would they have been participating in other groups such as the Catalyst School, would they have become PAs, vPAs and so on? In other words, it would be necessary for us to be able to understand the most tangible results of this project both for Cardano and for the North African community, so that we could be sure that the objectives of the challenge were indeed supported. Having said that, I think the proposal is indeed auditable, but some points could be improved, especially in relation to the analysis of the success scenario. More careful research could be carried out and the result of which should reach the knowledge of our entire community (for example, a debate could be opened in some breakout room, post Town Hall). Therefore, I will give a score of 4 for the auditability of the proposal, as it is good, but not yet excellent.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 451, "q0": "As the headlines suggest, this proposal is straightforward, it seeks to provide a hub where it accommodates the regions in North Africa. Before dwelling deeper, a basic geographic education should be continuously reminded to the Cardano community. Africa is a huge continent, it is not correctly displayed in our typica globe, we must understand that Africa's land mass is enough to fit in the U.S., China, India, Japan, Mexico, and many European nations, COMBINED. That is why having multiple African hubs is crucial. That is why this proposal is important.\n\nAlthough it only seeks to create an online congregation for North Africa and nothing else, it is a must needed start. Eventually through the collaboration with other various Town Halls/Hubs, the effectiveness of this hub will exponentially increase.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the goal is to create a hub, a critical experience needed would be involvement in a community building effort which one of the team members have. That team member is the Arabic Team Leader of African Town Hall. One other core team member that would be need is a person who technically understands Cardano, whom can always be a trusted reference on the latest updates in the Cardano ecosystem. Lastly, again at the very least, there should a dual speaker, either Arabic and English or French and English. These bare minimum core team requirements are are existing.\n\nThough, these core team members do need more collaboration with other Cardano communities, most specifically the Catalyst School. How the structured this proposal does not help them at all in receiving good assessments from Proposal Assessors (PAs). The structure is more that of a article than a proposal. PAs are forced to shuffle to all data.\n\nWith that said though, in comparison to what the core team wants to achieve with the budget asks of only $3,950, we could say that despite all it's writing inadequacy, this is such a small risk to take for such an important onboarding proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The information provided is borderline bare minimum for what a community hub should prepare for and what they intend to deliver on. One aspect they could improve on is to be more detailed in terms of explaining what to expect in these bi-weekly meetings, what education materials will be created and in what format to future efforts to develop this hub after identifying the potential risk it may face, such as difficulty to recruit members.\n\nAs an experienced Arabic Team Leader for the African Town Hall, the proposer could have coordinated with at the very least Catalyst School to have workshops in this hub. Catalyst School and all it's teaching is an effective early onboarding tool.\n\nIt terms of roadmap, information provided is a stop-and-go structure where there is no explanation of the continuation of this proposal. Though it is not mandatory, it does send a signal to the community that these individuals are committed. Such as the attitude of the LATAM community. Even though not funded last fund series, they have continued to maintain their hub, this can then be a persuasion tool to the voters to vote on them in future funds.\n\nIn terms of budget and their usage, it is as earlier mentioned, straightforward and clear. Though, it would have again, be beneficial for the proposer to be more detailed therefore making accounting easier to achieve. For example, the proposer mentions budget for translation, translation for what exactly? Although it is implied briefly in another part if this proposal, it shows how this proposal is not structured to be PA friendly. I myself is quite patient but not all PA's might be the same as myself.

A region in which the demographic is considerable, around 255 million population, and on average, formed by young.\nThis initiative would definitely be aligned with the challenge objective by onboarding new members, but also make more people adopt Cardano and share information about the ecosystem to get it known by more and  more people in the region.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "By providing information about Cardano and the blockchain in Arabic for people in the Nothern region of Africa who mainly speak that language allows them to be exposed to that information and access it.

On this, the team of proposers is formed by people who are familiar with the project catalyst and has been involved for a while, with various background in technology, customer service, web development...However an important aspect of the proposal is the translation of cardano and blockchain information in Arabic, what it's difficult to specify is whether among the proposers if there's a translator, since this may be needed to have those tolls to be well translated. What's presented, it's, team members who are multilingual which is not a guarantee that those people would be  able to translate. It would be more efficient to get some translation expertise from internal or external; and if there's from within the team, it is not clearly mentioned.\nThe team is planning on converting the fund in stable coin, what's less clear is whether is it the funding that will be converted, and if yes, in what type of stable coin? \n6 sessions in 3 months, 3 educational blogs on Cardano and a Telegran channel as results of this proposal are ways to spread the information about Cardano, but also this would help to onboard new people.
