In addition, as mentioned, this situation was further aggravated by the supply crisis with the war in Ukraine, which makes the search for innovative ways to align blockchain technology and the optimization of production techniques in the agricultural chain even more urgent. Clearly this is a very large problem to solve, but we noticed that skilled people are involved. With the success of this proposal, we will have both the improvement of a historic problem on the African continent and an increase in the visibility of Cardano's technologies to solve problems of this nature.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned before, we found highly qualified professionals and organizations behind the project, which increases our confidence in the chances of success of the project. The professionals involved are strongly related to the search for climatic and ecological solutions, especially in regions with a not very high degree of development. In addition, their CVs were made available so that their experiences could be verified. Another very positive point is the understanding of the breadth and number of agents that must be involved to improve the production chain. In line with this, we note that at this moment the focus will be on conducting research and establishing partnerships so that more specific solutions are implemented in the future. In this context, we can see in the details of the budget that most of the capital allocations are aimed at establishing partnerships and publicizing the project, which is quite consistent. The only thing left is the observation that it might be interesting to allocate a little more capital to the IT infrastructure and maintenance of the database, since a large amount of information will be handled. We also note in the budget breakdown, the total budget is higher than previously described.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to monitor the success of the project, we have that relevant indicators and metrics have been established, especially the number of relationships built and local partnerships formed. However, it would be interesting if goals were established to better understand the level of engagement that the project achieved. With this, it could have been defined, for example, a number of partnerships to be conquered after a certain period of time. Furthermore, it would also be interesting to indicate the tool to be used to transmit the results to the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4062, "q0": "This is a well-intentioned proposal but it has weak ties to Cardano. It seems the team is trying to use the project catalyst to leverage an already existing project that originally had nothing to do with Cardano by adding some slight touches of Cardano in the proposal. Indeed, there are some intersections in the subjects discussed such as impact investing, but they don't go much beyond that. The goals of the campaign are to spread knowledge and adoption of Cardano in Africa, to increase the number of African projects seeded, to increase the percentage of contribution in the project catalyst coming from Africa-based members and to promote innovations that will tackle unique challenges faced by the continent. On the other hand, the main goal of the team's plan is to allow easier and quicker access to microcredit funding for entrepreneurs in Africa. However, they never explain how that will be done or how Cardano will be used to help achieve that.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team described in composed of Antoinette, Bianca and Elise. All of the three are co-founders of SHE Changes Climate and have relevant experiences which are supported by evidence provided in the LinkedIn links in the proposal. The budget is broken down into reasonable and identifiable items and the amounts requested for each are sensible given the project duration and number of people involved. However, the total amount in the budget don't match with the requested funds in the beginning of the proposal. Also, the timetable described is realistic and the total duration estimated of the project is six months. Additionally, the plan described is sensible and conductible, they explain what they will be doing every month or so. Finally, the proposer has discussed three major risks the project faces and also how they intend to mitigate them. They are the risk of not delivering what they have promised, the risk of the targeted people not wanting to take the microcredit opportunity and the risk of not reaching the desired outcome. For the first one, for example, their solution is to partner with the Rallying Cry, which has a lot of experience in the space of microcredits in Africa.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team didn't highlight the milestones of each stage of the plan, but have provided good explanations of what will be done at each phase. It's not a big fault but as a suggestion to enhance the proposal I would add explicit milestones in the plan. For instance, in the September phase they could have defined a milestone of publishing the open letter. Additionally, in the metrics they could have defined more precise KPIs. They used local impact and local partnerships formed as suggested in the campaign, but the impact referred in this case is user activity in the Cardano ecosystem which is something the proposal neglects. The same goes for local partnership, they don't really explain what Cardano-related partnerships they could foment.

The team should reduce costs and should give an exact figure, not an approximation because it represents transparency.\nThe participants in the project were reviewed by the team and selected qualified people.
