We emphasize once again that the problem does not seem to be the central objective of the proposal, but the amount of capital being required for this purpose. And even at this point, we can see in the budget breakdown that a portion of $11,000 (approximately 38% of the total) will be going to the community building effort. But we have that this does not seem to be an expense consistent with the effort of the proposal to hold a day of lectures.

It brings innovative ideas, ideas that contain creative solutions to the challenges facing Africa and the Global South. This is the key to lifting Africa out of poverty and underdevelopment, I believe. It was clear that the team had determined that the problem to be solved was that Africa was lacking advice, lack of ideas from which to develop, and put ideas into practice to solve economic problems, society, etc... existing in African countries. With the presence of members in the Cardano ecosystem, especially crypto advisors, the Cardano blockchain will bring concrete value in terms of investment and change the status quo of Africa and South Africa. Global. Although the advisory input is in the early stages, preliminary through the annual COP27 seminars, if implemented and implemented well it will add value to the Cardano ecosystem and more specifically, help Africa develop - getting out of the long-existing image: the continent of poverty and backwardness.

They have a lot of experience in the field of the environment at the national and international levels. Because they have many years of working in this field. What I like is that the team has made its identity completely public through social networking sites, mainly Linkedin. This is considered a very good way to affirm the credibility of the team and reinforce the feasibility of the proposal. A detailed budget sheet that presents the budget is broken down into sections and aligned with the goal. Those are expenses for long-term community-building, summit preparation, IT support, monitoring, and management. These are all expensive parts but will be well spent to make the event a success. I have a budget question: If Fund 9 has not been funded by Catalyst, will the team continue to implement the proposal as intended? As an environmental organization for many years, does the team have other funding sources to implement this proposal? These two questions are intended to clarify the budgetary feasibility of the proposal. My question is meant to contribute positively to the proposal and the community. I think one of the resources for the team to implement the proposal is financial resources (playing an important role - awaiting funding from Catalyst). In addition, human resources also made me ask: In addition to the 3 key members who are good at the team's expertise, are there any other members who support the team in implementing the proposal? Through the proposal, you said that some members of the team are working on other proposals in this Fund 9, so is it possible to ensure human resources implement parallel proposals at the same time? Will that affect the quality of this proposal? Hope the team explains this clearly to increase the feasibility of the proposal to the community. I see this as a proposal with a relatively large amount of work, so I think that team members need collaborators to support implementation. I would like to contribute: The team can fully utilize the human resources from the collaborators in the Cardano ecosystem around the world, you can even fully mobilize the collaborators from the community. Cardano Vietnam to join hands to implement the proposal and contribute efforts to COP27. Just my constructive opinion. About the technical aspect, the proposal requires the team to take advantage of the skills that the team is very familiar with to organize events in the past, I have no opinion on this aspect. However, if needed, the team can consult with Cardano blockchain experts and other experts around the world to build the most perfect project. Exposure to experts is very beneficial for the team itself because they are the best in their area of \u200b\u200bexpertise and they take on it - I understand that key team members are also experts on environment and climate. I agree with the team's comments on the implementation risks listed in the proposal. I like the solutions the team has outlined to prevent and overcome potential challenges.

What I agree with here is the presentation of the roadmap for milestones that are tied to specific months of the year (January to December). This makes it convenient for the PA community to evaluate the transparency of the proposal along with its auditability. The KPIs raised by the team are very clear and complete, I find this to be a valuable thing that not all suggestions are shown by other teams. Key metrics are specified with practical numbers (expect 1,000 participants, attract 150 million people, etc...). The combination of KPIs and key metrics highlights the auditability and transparency of this proposal. I am very satisfied with this. In addition, it is a coherent, easy-to-understand description of the problem and the solutions are clearly stated throughout the presentation of the proposal. I wish all proposals in Catalyst are made clear and specific, to be practical, and easy to apply in life like this proposal of the team.

By bringing together experts from around the world, the awareness of blockchain technology in addressing CC-related solutions is likely to spread globally, which is one of Cardano's core pillars. The proposal's solution addresses the current challenge directly by emphasizing the role that cardano may play in future investing and technological development - the proposal also mentioned the challenge-specific KPIs that may be effected by the event.

To begin, the proposer and team members have extensive experience disseminating sustainability, nature, and CC-related issues and solutions, including previous TEDx talks, working as advisors in United Nations, NGos, and so on, all of which are required for addressing the proposal's objective.

Mainly for this reason, I do not think that the proposal aligns well with the challenge, even having a global impact. In addition, what the event is proposing is a round of discussion and putting people in connection - and in the way Cardano leaders. Even being an considerable step, only the connection does not bring practical mitigation of the problem presented in the challenge, such as the fundamental issues preventing Africa from adopting Cardano or number of new Africa-based users onboarded onto Cardano.
