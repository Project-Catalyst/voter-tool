This in turn would allow more Africans to have access to green and affordable energy while those who are able to produce some can sell their excess of electricity.

Also, the deadlines estimated seem realistic and shouldn't be a burden to be completed in time. In their website they exhibit a timeline of the project as well. Moreover, the plan described is conductible and is explained in detail. Finally, there were some risks raised concerning the implementation. Volatility of their cryptocurrency could be an issue but they will allocate some of tokens to balance the liquidity pool and the treasury fund will be backed mostly by stablecoins. There are also economic and political risks intrinsic to the African continent.

If this proposal is successfully applied, it will help Africa grow gradually and gradually get rid of poverty and lag behind the rest of the world. Especially when this proposal is implemented according to high technology based on the Cardano and DAO blockchain. The team calls it Powerchain. I find it very interesting that Powerchain is an energy data encryption platform that enables P2P energy management and renewable energy certification.

The amount of salary required is appropriate for the work intended to be performed. I wish all proposals in Catalyst had a clear, detailed, and logical presentation of the allocation budget as the team did on this proposal. The plan and implementation method are also quite detailed like the allocated budget aspect, it includes 8 steps. Through these details, I commented: This is a team with high professionalism, and good expertise, exactly what the team listed about the experience in the proposal. If we have not received Catalyst funding in Fund 9, will the team continue to implement the proposal?\nI wanted to take a closer look at the resources required to execute, I have no doubt about the 4 core members' ability, but to execute on such a high-impact and large-scale proposition I think the team needs more members. Does the team have collaborators whose names have not been made public on the proposal date? I would like the team to be able to publicly identify as many of the participants as possible to implement the proposal. When doing that, means that the feasibility of the proposal will increase and the community believes in the team more. That's also my advice to the team in terms of the resources needed to execute.\nIn terms of technology, Lightency uses the Cardano blockchain network and also issues Token Light. I know that investors can buy and hold the Light token long-term with a high-interest rate of up to 31% APY. I wonder why the interest rates are so high? This is a very attractive interest rate. Can the team explain more about the interest payment mechanism so that the community can understand it better, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal? I fully agree with the token creation and release to the community.

Through the KPIs, the team has come up with a specific number - 10 people participating in the treasury fund and having at least 1 energy certificate on Cardano.

The proposal said that 2 out of 3 Africans have access to electricity which is woefully inadequate comparing with the Global expectation that by 2030 all countries electrification should reach the highest of all communities in the world.

The timeline for the project is 3 months and half, that is 14 weeks 4 days. Project management and coordination, time estimated is 2 weeks. They intend to create tokens unlock tokens, they also intend developing smart contract to create a mint tokens, they want to develop smart contracts to create unlock tokens and also want to do test invalidation. The proposer and his team are also intending to connect and create wallets, interact with cardano SDK to connect wallets these and many others are some of the milestones and  they expected to use to 1,2,3,4 weeks depending on the length of the project if funded. I think with the aforementioned project they are expected to carry out, the proposer and his team deserve commendation. They have also provided a budget needed to be able to execute this program they have taken the pain to break the budget down into identifiable bits which correlate to every activity they intend to carry at the end of the day if funded. It's interesting to note that the proposer and his team saw the challenge and made time with it and their knowledge and expertise to carry wholly if funded ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal is one of the shortest but problem solving. The proposer and his team has provided information which is sufficient enough to aid in the auditing of the progress and success of this project. The proposer and his team intend to use KPI as a major tool for auditing and this is attracting Cardano holders to participate in the treasure funds get at least 10 participants in the Treasury.

What does success of the project look like, the proposer and his team are optimistic that the project will be considered successful if the treasury funds gets bigger exponentially reaching out to $1milion dollars after 12 months, is a target the proposer and his team has set up internally.

For all that has been listed above these are all tangibles that one can trace and track to monitor the progress and success on this project with ease.
