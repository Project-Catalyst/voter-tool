In addition, with the success of the project, we would have greater visibility of Cardano's technologies, opening space for future similar projects to use NFT's to relate real-world products to the crypto world. In this context, we have that the budget being requested seems consistent with what is planned to be built at that moment and the amount of $15,000 if well used can bring considerable benefit both to this footwear brand and to Cardano's ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite the innovative concept propagated by the idea, we feel a lack of details on how this project will be executed. Regarding the timeline, the activities mentioned are consistent with what you want to achieve, but we note that very clear time frames were not established to know how long each stage will last. Thus, it is not possible to know whether a greater amount of time will be devoted to the most important activities. Likewise, regarding the budget breakdown, we see information about what the hourly wage of each professional will be, but we also do not find details about how many hours of work will be performed by each person, or what methodology will be adopted. About the team involved in the project, we have that their skills and experiences seem quite relevant to the execution of the proposal, but it would be nice if CVs had been made available so that these experiences could be proven.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the ways chosen to measure the success of the project, we also have that more information could have been provided. As an important part of the project development is related to programming, it would be interesting to indicate which development methodology would be used. In the same way, sprints could be defined, as well as the duration of each one of them and which tools would be used so that the progress could be transmitted to the community. The metrics that were defined, by themselves, do not follow the progress of the proposal so well. Equally, it appears that more details could have been conveyed about the perceived success of the project. In addition to the characteristics mentioned, it seems important that other objectives were also aimed at, such as understanding the impact of the project on social networks.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2994, "q0": "ith the idea that most CNFTs lack a clear roadmap and are just hype. From Defi to GameFi I believe Cardano NFTs have a considerable amount of use cases. The EON brand has been in operation since 2017 in a country of over 200 Million people and has sold just under 500 pieces of footwear, it is hard to see the impact it will bring to the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, when a CNFT is purchased on the secondary market do I also get an Eon Slide shipped to me? or it is only given to minters? If it's the latter what are the incentives for me holding the CNFT and are there any plans for adding future utilities to the CNFT?  I can't find how the EON brand plans to be sustainable without seeking more funding. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "When dealing with CNFTs that are tied to real-world assets, in most cases the building is done simultaneously. In this case, the project doesn't clearly show this. Additionally, there are no ideas raised that would suggest that when funded they will increase their EON slides sale margin as this is what will drive adoption of the CNFT with the low sale volume of just 300 pieces dating far back as 2017, it is evident the focus is on the CNFT side of the business. There are no Haskel and Plutus Devs on the team. Will the minting be done via sending Ada to a designated address or through platforms like NFT-Maker?\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Usually, projects like this have one Dev that is familiar with Haskel and Plutus, that will be able to provide key metrics and KPIs on the development. There are no provided social channels that can be used to track the progress. I suggest providing evidence of shipping receipt as a mintable CNFT can also be added on-chain and adding unique new wallets, these should increase the ability of the community to be able to track the progress. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2381", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4612, "q0": "First of all and to be honest, it seems to me that it is good for the ecosystem that firms approach and try to contribute, adopting the technology in their processes, it is important because the firms in the first place have a direct relationship with the people who are currently unaware of blockchain technology and cardano, now a point that touches the proponent is to give a use to non fungible tokens (NFTs) different from the uses that are commonly given.\n\nThe proposed approach is fine but realistically I am not sure that it can achieve a significant impact on the adoption of the people of the continent, the impact that the proposal can have depends largely on the amount of shoes that can sell and that metric depends on many other factors within the organization and not only the use that in this case is intended to give to the NFTs.\n\nI am going to dare to recommend to the team to explore a little more the use of non fungible tokens in the industry in which they are, in my personal experience working with non fungible tokens and native cardano tokens I can say that the potential of this technology applied to the footwear industry is incredible, to give an example, currently improving transparency and traceability has become a priority for the garment and footwear industry to increase its ability to manage the value chains more effectively, identify and address labor and human rights violations and environmental impacts, combat counterfeits, and handle reputational risks, while embracing more sustainable production and consumption patterns.\n\nNFTs and especially Cardano's NFTs serve this use case, help bring transparency and traceability to supply chains and are of great value to brands that use them, help reinforce brand integrity, promote sustainable sourcing, and enable greater customer trust and loyalty. I invite the team to do a thorough research on this topic and reformulate the proposal by making NFTs provide transparency and traceability to the customer, of course being proof of product ownership as well.\n\nI am sure that by having that approach they will be able to have a competitive advantage in their industry, be pioneers in the continent using the Cardano blockchain for that use case and then have a significant impact in the ecosystem and in their industry.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal shows the team that will be in charge of the implementation, although it indicates what each member will be in charge of, a way to improve the proposal in that aspect is to provide more detailed information about the experiences and skills of the members, you can add links to external sources such as Linkedin, twitter, github, etc. explain in more detail what previous experiences they have in tasks such as those assigned to them in this project, how much they are involved in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nAs for the detailed plan, the proposal specifies the tasks that have to be executed, here it is important to understand that the detailed plan will first allow voters and PAs to have a clearer vision, remember that it is about evaluating the probability that the proposal is implemented successfully, unfortunately in this case a time line is not specified in the detailed plan, there is no start and end date for each task, so it is very complicated to assess the feasibility, the plan shows what is done, but it does not detail the how, who and the resources needed in each task.\n\nThe budget provides information on how the funds will be used, the way it is written is open to misinterpretation, it shows a total of 150 hours and a total budget of $15k, which indicates that it is $100/hour, but there are several tasks with a different rate of payment, so 150 hours will be used for each task, i.e. 150 hours for backend, 150 hours for frontend, etc.... It is necessary to explain this section in more detail, make a recommendation to the team to include a contingency fund for unforeseen events, and a plan if additional funding is required.\n\nIt is important within the feasibility of the proposal, to explain technical aspects relevant to the proposal, for example, what tool will the team use to mine the tokens? Within the implementation it would be interesting to talk about how to address the challenge of using the technology for people outside the ecosystem, how will the wallets be created? If the target are users who already have wallets, then the adoption and impact will be lower.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this proposal it is complicated to evaluate the auditability because there is no roadmap that includes the time in which each task must be done. How do you audit something ? if there is no deadline in which it must be completed.\n\nThe team has proposed the metric of the number of users engagement in their community to measure the progress of the project, this metric is interesting to evaluate the interest of users in these NFTs, it needs to be described a little more and how to measure that engagement specifically as well as how to communicate it to the cardano community, I think that in the project there could be other ways to evaluate the progress of the implementation. \n\nFor example make meetings in the cardano community or present in a town hall to present their progress, maybe present the website when it is ready, or present the prototypes they plan to build, there are many ways to communicate to the community how the implementation is being carried out, it is very important to make clear the milestones you want to achieve and also the form and channels of communication.\n\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2575", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5098, "q0": "This proposal comes across as a sham to me for several reasons which I will explain. First let me say, though the proposal in my assessment does not address the Challenge in any form. The $15,000 request is to print NFTS for a shoe (slide?) made in Nigeria. Somehow having this Cardano NFT is going to elevate Cardano. The Challenge is about growing a Community of people in Africa and seeding the Continent for future growth. This does not address any of the criteria.\n------------------------------------------------------\nNow why do I think this may be a proposal on a slippery slope? First, the brief states that Eon Footwear (the proposer) is part of Genz footwear founded in 2017. And, that Genz footwear produced over 300 pair of Eon footwear. Obiageli Okafor lists herself as CEO of both companies.  There is no listing, web or other listing of a Genz in Nigeria or really elsewhere. The search for Eon footwear hits an Italian firm. The Twitter LInk provided in the Proposal has 39 followers, while the Instagram link does have pictures and over 1200 followers but no information about the company or its policies.  Additionally, there is no bio or doxxing information for the proposer herself.\n----------------------------------------------------\nSeveral other issues that concern me is though Genz is listed as a 2017 born company the proposal states in the Risk Management section that this is an initial funding ask to start development. Continuing my thought process and assessment this is a proposal for slider (shoes?) and nfts on Cardano. The budget (skipping ahead) has listed     Development Rates:Backend Developer - $50/hr USD\n Frontend Developer - $30/hr USD\nUI/UX Design - $15/hr USD.  NFT ART Creator: $5/hr USD. Total Hours: 150\nTotal: $15,000\nWhat is the ask for a front end, back end and UI/UX design have to do with shoes and minting NFTS?\n------------------------------------------------------\nMy assessment of this proposal is a 1 (strongly disagree that it meets the objectives laid out in the Challenge) star.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "While there is an outline of stages to be done for the project, there is no timeline, Implementation plan, Roadmap or timetable of any type to reference. The skills and/or experience of the three team members are not explained and there is no method I could background check or Doxx. The listed members include the CEO, a frontend designer and a backend designer. I believe the CEO (no Doxxing) would handle the shoe design but who is designing the NFT and again why the backend and front end designers for a shoe company? The budget has hourly rates but no explanation of how the time will be spent or utilized.\n----------------------------------------------------\nMy assessment is this project is rated as a 1 ( strongly disagree that it is likely the proposal would be implemented) star.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "This is the weakest attempt I have seen at an Audit structure.

My suggestion to the Proposers would be to understand you are asking a community to trust you by rewarding your concept and proposal idea with a certain amount of money. The community would like to understand how the money was applied and what the results are from investing in your project.

And this NFT won't just be a token on the Cardano blockchain, it will also represent an actual real-world product, which means that NFT owners can own Eon footwear. A pretty good and meaningful solution.\n\nIf this NFT project is successful, it will help the community see that Blockchain and Cardano have real value and are associated with daily life.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project implementation plan of this proposal is quite rudimentary, there is no specific timeline, the work to be done, and the results of the evaluation of the work completed.

This part is quite vague so this budget is not reliable.\n\nThe project has 03 participants but there is no link profile to verify and the information about experience and expertise and described quite general.

These are important details that need to be documented in order for voters to have a clear sense of what is needed for a project to be successful. \n\nLastly, the budget estimates put forth seem to be incongruent and off-balance. Your cost estimates for development seem too tight. I would suggest doing more research on what is entailed in building a solid NFT-based project. This will give you a better sense of what the actual costs will be.

I also have doubts about how this will help in the seeding, growing, and adoption of Cardano in Africa in 2022 and beyond, since this is just going to be a one-time project as stated clearly in the proposal.

By funding African business and their ideas, such as Eon Brands, the number of new African-based users onboarded onto Cardano could increase, as well as the ADA transactions. Besides, a new local partnership would be formed and, if successful, other companies could apply to other fundings and scale the project. \nHowever, I think in this proposal the impact is more local than global.
