Other musicians/artists from around the world can refer to this proposal if it is funded and implemented. With Web 3.0, Cardano is truly a new publishing opportunity, verifying the exclusivity of the work is a convenient transaction of the work.\n\nThe solution of this idea is good, it identifies a few problems of the challenge, and the author of this idea argues in a logical, neat, and creative way. Streaming musical compositions through Cardano to music students at universities in South Africa and musicians in Nigeria are simple and effective steps that will expand the Cardano network in the future.\n\nIt's great that the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal presents so many risks when it is implemented in practice, and the idea's author has outlined solutions for all of them. That not only keeps the project on schedule but also helps the community manage risks from the project when it is put into practice, thereby considering whether to vote in favor of the project or not. with ideas. The impact of this proposal is enormous. In summary, the number of risks (short solutions) that the author has listed very fully is as follows: Not funded (Self-managed to have enough capital to develop the market), Difficult to attract/recommend musicians Africa (Cite one-time example or some musicians achieved success), Difficult to develop community/customer base (Strategic partnership with other projects), Difficult to attract people from blockchains other (Strategic partners with projects on Cardano and other blockchains), ...\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal to introduce unclear and detailed work implementation timelines compared with limited implementation resources will affect the project audit process. The proposal only estimates the time (12 months) that the project will complete and the goals it achieves in general, the community needs a more detailed implementation plan corresponding to the implementation timeline, and impact Authors can refer to Microsoft's Project Management tool (or a similar tool) for more detailed and methodical scheduling support.\n\nThe proposed project budget is less than 20% of the total budget of this challenge, compared to the information the proposal provides, some project expenditures need to be clarified if it is to be funded. Budget requirements are usually summarized by the author. A detailed budget should list hourly wages for local workers, corresponding to the tasks of each employee in the project team. the project, and the community needs to know that, which helps in better transparency of the project.

Author Quintin Bray-Stone and colleagues are also the owners of this other proposal at F9 in another challenge in Asia (Onboarding Musicians from Asia https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420563) show that this is a good team and strong enough to take on the project if funded, however, if both proposals are funded, I wonder if the author and collaborators have enough time and Enthusiastic to do 2 projects at the same time?. and the author please provide more reputable identity verification links such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord, ... for an easy and practical identity verification community.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This project provides KPIs for accomplishing project goals, all of which are easily measured thanks to the metrics provided by the project.

The ideas of this project have not been proven successful, and have not been tested in practice, but it is a good idea. Since the content is just copied back and forth, I wonder if the author spent too little time on this proposal?!\n\nHere's a brand new take on this challenge, recommended by an experienced Catalyst author.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2489", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4050, "q0": "This is an interesting proposal that aims to use the Cardano infrastructure and web 3.0 to leverage African musicians. It will provide educational content and incentives to attract these musicians to publicize their songs and monetize them. This in turn, not only spreads awareness about Cardano and blockchain technologies in general but also cause a local impact. Besides that, fomenting an active ecosystem increases the chances of forming new partnerships and having new projects seeded. The goals of onboarding musicians from South Africa and Nigeria and establishing internship programs in a south African university align with the challenge goals of increasing Cardano awareness and adoption. However, the proposal does not have concrete plans to scale to address future challenges or to reach a more sustainable stage. Instead, they may use future fundings for this.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer describes the relevant experiences of 12 people of the team and shows evidence of these experiences for roughly half of them through links to the companies they found/participate. The budget is broken down into skills needed/ tasks required to be completed, but the proposer could have better explained how they reached those amounts required for each topic. It is not clear if they estimated number of hours required and cost per hour and multiplied them or if they did it in a completely different way. The proposer has also not explained how each of those tasks (mainly developments and translation) will be implemented. From the description it sounds it could be done in way less than twelve months and if that is the case the budget would be overpriced (that's the importance of a detailed plan with key milestones). Without a sensible and conductible plan, it's hard to say it is a feasible proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap is badly designed. The proposer basically stated milestones they want to reach in twelve months but never described what are the stages of the project, when each deliverable is expected to be reached and how each milestone aligns with the goals. Besides that, twelve months sound way too much to reach the first two milestones of onboarding seven musicians from South Africa and four musicians from Nigeria. With a total amount requested of USD 65k+ their milestones should be a lot bolder than that. On the other hand, the targeted problem of the lack of tools and visibility for musicians in the Cardano environment is clearly identified. When defining the KPIs they basically copied and pasted what they had written in the roadmap section. Instead, they could have defined KPIs such as number of musicians introduced and onboarded to Cardano and number musicians able to monetize their music in the SoundRig.io. Additionally, another downside of the project is the lack of a public channel to update the community about the progress of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4391, "q0": "With the goal of the Challenge, does your proposal solve the goal set? However, in I think the impact there is not much. Why did you choose the audience as African Musicians and not others? Of course, this is good because it adds value to the Cardano ecosystem and these musicians will influence describing several other musicians along with people working in the music industry. I completely agree with this proposal and do not deny its impact. The team identified the problem to be solved. If in Africa musicians have a great influence, then this proposal, if successfully implemented, will have a wide impact on the community. The team is taking advantage of the current trend of web 3.0. This is a quick development, I hope it works. If this proposal is successful, you can develop Cardano and web 3.0 in many other groups of society, not just the musicians of Africa.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I am very impressed with the team members. They are all people with a lot of experience and expertise in the field they are in charge of. When the group owns these members together with the clear presentation of the proposal will make the community not very confident in the feasibility of the proposal. However, I think it would be ideal for the team to have members working full-time in the IT sector specifically in Cardano, Web 3.0. As for the budget, I think you can list it more specifically, in more detail. For example, which small actions each money is earmarked for because the more details are presented, the more confidence the community will have in the feasibility and auditability of the proposal. With the currently listed budget, I do not see the reasonableness. Therefore, the more detailed the list, the more the community will understand the rationality of using the budget. This is very important for the proposal that wants to win the trust of the community. You already have almost all the necessary resources to perform, especially human resources. Regarding the plan, and how to do it, I don't have much opinion, but I want you to be more specific about how to do it because it is related to the required budget. In this proposal, the group has clearly stated the risks and challenges faced along with solutions. I only have one additional comment in this section, is that the question you were anticipating the challenge when the community didn't pay much attention to the music of the musicians involved in the proposal? From there you can survey the role of music and community support for music, especially with musicians playing music related to the Cardano ecosystem. In terms of technology and technology, Web 3.0 is considered a new technology today, so I hope the group can explain more about Web 3.0 so that the community can understand.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I found the proposal's roadmap to be sketchy. I wish the additional team was more clear on the roadmap because that's an important factor in demonstrating auditability. Specifically, the team breaks down the roadmap according to the work progress, for example, divided by time is monthly or quarterly. The proposal is generally good, but it is necessary to add details of the work schedule. The proposal is clearly described and easy to understand with the solution, but one more part I want to contribute is KPIs. I don't see a KPI in the proposal. You already know that KPIs are very important to evaluate job performance. That's why I mentioned KPIs and wished the team added them.

This is important because, musicians have lots of followers and using Cardano to onboard them would trigger the onboarding of their followers. giving endorsement to cardano bring trust to the entertainment community to buy, hold, and also leverage on the opportunities in the catalyst circles. \n\nThe team have concisely elaborated on the solution to use the cardano to mint products of the musical industry. \n\nHowever, the team has two different solutions in one proposal. That is, educating university students and engaging musicians at the same time. This is quite ambitious and the team should focus on one of them which I recommend the musicians. This is evident that, there is no elaboration on how the students could be onboarded and facilitate the adoption of cardano. \n\nThere also exist wide range of risks but the team have made clear resolutions to insulate themselves from them.

There are no timelines guiding the implementation and no activities, showing how the musicians could be onboarded. \n\nThe details of the budget is not enough to understand how the funds would be used. The information on the budget is not sufficient to determine the appropriation of the funds a successful implementation of the project", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal has important measurable KPIs which could easily help the auditing process.

The proposal presented a problem, which was: \u201cThere is no easy path for Musicians in Africa to be onboarded to Cardano with Web 3.0\u201d. I see that Cardano is a very potential ecosystem and the application of this ecosystem to the community is increasing. Therefore, it makes sense to work with musicians, record labels in South Africa, and universities in South Africa to teach people to mint and sell their music on Cardano. It will bring people closer to the Cardano ecosystem, promoting overall Cardano adoption in a struggling economy like those in Africa. \nThe solution proposed by the proponent I found identified most of the problems of the challenge. The proponent presented the solution clearly and specifically, by showing the current situation to show the impact of the problem. \nTo successfully implement the project, the proponent also anticipated the risks. The risks indicated here come from the following causes: unable to get funding, difficulty to attract/introduce African musicians, difficulty to develop community, difficulty to attract users from other blockchains, or risks in cross-market compatibility. However, each of those risks is prepared in advance with solutions to overcome.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal presented information regarding the implementation roadmap, budget, and project participants. However, in my personal opinion, the proposer should divide the roadmap into smaller timelines. The proponent is providing a 12-month schedule with 4 specific tasks. In my opinion, if possible, the proponent should divide 12 months into 4 specific timelines, such as 1st and 2nd month: \"Onboarding 7 Musicians from South Africa\", 3rd and 4th month: \"Onboard 4 Musicians from Nigeria\", 5th to 9th month: \"Establish an accredited internship program at a South African University for students to mint their music project on Cardan\". From 10th to 12th month: \"Recruit a Sound Rig Ambassador for South Africa and Nigeria\". By dividing and assigning specific tasks to each milestone, it will be easier to control the progress and completion of the proposal, avoiding the case where a task is delayed for too long, affecting the stage after. Regarding the budget, the proponent presented how to allocate and use each budget, but in my opinion, this section should have a more detailed plan, the budget should be attached to each milestone implementation time to be able to evaluate the efficiency of capital use of each period. Thereby, it will control the budget, increase the budget for the potential period or reduce the cost for the period with bad results, in order to avoid wasting the budget.

This is a good idea and has a lot of good impact on the community.

Besides, it is also proposed to create more popular web3.0 courses on Cardano for young artists.\nThe proposal outlined practical difficulties that may be faced such as finding funding, convincing musicians to cooperate, attracting users from other ecosystems. They have really come up with the right solutions to deal with them.\nI believe if this proposal is successful it will help increase the number of transactions on Cardano.
