Definitely, if the number of Yoroi users increases with a transaction flow, then it means the Cardano ecosystem is seeing some great impact of growth. The problem indicated in this proposal is a valid use case that needs to be given attention. However, speaking from the Ghanaian perspective, I see it may be very hard for a successful implementation even though a good solution has been written in their proposal submitted under the DApps, Products, and Integration challenge.\nThis proposal is complimented with some key metrics that will help the community to measure not only its success but the impact it will have on the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano ROI. From my perspective, the information provided aligns with the majority of the campaign brief and thus making it impactful.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Despite the fact that this proposal is well written and possibly will be receiving nice accolades from my fellow PAs that I may possibly agree with, I would like to take the pain in the ass to point out some critical concerns that need to be addressed by the proposing team just so they are able to improve on their draft for possible successful funding in subsequent funding rounds ahead of us and if not this time.\nThe fact that this proposal is reliant on successful funding and implementation of the proposal put into DApps, Products, and Integration raises some concerns that were not addressed with alternatives in this proposal. \nFor instance, what happens to this proposal if it's funded but the other one doesn't get funded? \nHow will the team account for what they've won? \nWhat happens if both proposals are funded but the technical team is not able to deliver a successful implementation of the MVP within the given timeframe as stated in the roadmap of the proposal?\nDid the team perform any on-grounds research to confirm the feasibility studies of this project? You may want to rely on some research done by some group of people some time ago but the truth is, people's behavior changes from time to time especially when there's a difficulty.\nDespite the fact that the idea may sound laudable, and of course, it's laudable, these concerns need to be given attention to ensure a successful implementation.\nDue to the lack of answers to these concerns in the proposal, I am uncertain about successful implementation.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient for a successful auditory process by the community but what is lacking is exactly where this progress can be tracked by the community aside from the monthly reporting form. The team does well to provide 3 working links to nice websites of which one is under-development. I think it would have been awesome for the team to just indicate in this proposal exactly which of these websites can be used to track the progress of this project. Even though it was stated that the findings of this project will be documented in a GDoc and shared publicly. This is a great initiative but where would the community get the link to this GDoc? This is where the website becomes useful.\nI do agree with every other information provided under the auditability criteria of this proposal except with what I feel is lacking as described above and hence my score of 4.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2518", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5084, "q0": "This proposal addresses the \u201cMVP testing\u201d only. The MVP for this parcel delivery itself is stated in this proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416992/, which is submitted in Dapps, Products & Integrations. This testing proposed here is very crucial for this project, because locals would be both senders and transporters, and hence the users of the platform. The proposer even connected with both WADA and Ariob, which are both operating locally-oriented. The challenge is chosen good, because the testing would be based in and benefit Africa. The only problem I see here is, that people who would be testing would probably need ADA (for the deposit), and I hope that this project does not make financial advice about what the test-persons should do with their money, because ADA is a highly volatile asset.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The problems I see with feasibility are first and foremost that the delivery of this proposal depends on the delivery of the other one (MVP dApp), and I ask myself what happens if this one gets funded but the other one doesn\u2019t. Also, there\u2019s a DAO mentioned but I don\u2019t get the purpose and integration of it. I hope the proposer has a good look into what DAOs exactly are and do, and whether that would really benefit the operations of this project. Also, you could open management to decentralization anytime you and the project are ready, you don\u2019t have to integrate it from the start. Furtherly, there are many risks listed, and I am very pleased seeing this critically reflecting thinking. It\u2019s very assuring of the proposer\u2019s competencies \u2013 but also, the solutions seem not complete. I feel like there will be a lot of progress and re-alignment as soon as the project starts forming. Apart from the concerns, the budget looks very feasible, and I trust the proposer because of the meaningful connections already made. Even if the way the project goes may become a bumpy one, I am excited to find out whether the project works for the locals. It seems like a super cool idea, and I would love to see it have the possibility to give it a go.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability is ensured through a Google Docs, which I figure (and hope) will be accessible through the project\u2019s webpage.

By engaging this service on the Cardano Blockchain, trust issues are dealt with it also creates awareness of the ecosystem. This may lead to participation in Cardano and project catalyst and adoption of Cardano/ADA as Blockchain and cryptocurrency of choice among users.

The suggested solution is to create a new approach to the delivery service in Africa. Leaving the traditional centralized postage system and replacing it with a peer-to-peer approach based on Cardano's blockchain. This is necessary since African countries' postal services are difficult in many ways: expensive, unreliable, slow, inefficient, etc. In this way, the proponents ask for funding for the study and elaboration of their minimum viable product (MVP), and it aims to collect different types of data (quantitative and qualitative), understand how the design interface would be built, understand the application of the technology blockchain in that use case and etc. Honestly, I thought it was a very good and innovative proposal, I don't remember seeing another one in the same area (post office).

The use of funding could be explained a little better, in which case the parts themselves should be more detailed. In period two why would each hub need an investment of 2500 dollars?
