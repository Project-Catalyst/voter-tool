It offers a solution to education concerns and provides an opportunity for further Cardano adoption in Africa.\nAs mentioned in the challenge brief, the impact of Cardano gaining traction in African markets is worth a potential $1 trillion. Through this proposal, training and equipping up to 1 million students on blockchain and cryptocurrency in the next 4-5 years, has an enormous potential impact. Through the detailed proposal, the proposed method of education is through university clubs, at accredited universities. Beginning in Kenya, where contact and plans have already been laid, then developing to scale throughout the region.\nBy providing this educational framework, students who may not have this exposure currently in their university undertakings may be motivated to learn more, investigate blockchain or join Cardano communities. This in turn will build the skills and understanding of the community as a whole. As these students graduate, enter the workforce, business or politics, they bring this shared understanding of blockchain to their communities and employers. Although a rather lengthy process, targeting students who are most adaptable, looking for future success and motivated to learn guarantees a good prospect of future uptake and connection for Cardano.\nAs well as the direct university program, the proposers plan to work with strategic partners of an online learning management based system. Once materials, and programs are tested and confirmed, this will allow the project to scale exponentially and allow students in regional or remote areas (with internet access though) to learn and contribute to the project. The project itself, and this possible outreach help achieve at least 3 of the main SDG goals, and many more of the subgoals listed.\nOverall I give this project 5 stars for impact. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The detail given within the project timeline, budget breakdown, team member biographies and even the impact risk assessment, lead me to feel confident about this proposal\u2019s feasibility,\nThe project timeline gives specific details for the 6 month long program, broken into two key milestones. The initial seemingly achievable goal of 5 universities, online modules completed and applications developed may be a little ambitious. However, with the team of 9 people listed, each with impressive and complementing skill sets, I believe they can achieve this goal.\nThe second three months of the timeline sees 10 additional universities added and the initial students from the first phase \u2018graduate\u2019 from the online course and are awarded a certificate. It\u2019s excellent that they acknowledge these students will continue to be mentored after \u2018graduation.\u2019\nThe planned budget appears to cover all areas needed, I\u2019m assuming that the \u2018Salaries for secretariat\u2019 refers to the team\u2019s salaries. A modest contingency of $2,000 is included, which is vital for unknown expenses, definitely the case when living and working in East Africa. Having spent 4 years in Tanzania, and traveled numerous times to Kenya I have first hand experience of difficult situations that needed contingency. However, for the proposers they have the substantial backup that they can eventually deliver the course content virtually online, possibly even asynchronously to avoid the nightmare traffic that often plagues Nairobi and surrounds. \nFurther information from the team notes their plan later to enroll non-university or fee paying individuals to increase the sustainability of the program. This leads to confidence in the long term vision and ability to scale this proposal.\nOverall, I rate this proposal 5 stars for feasibility, due to a dedicated team on the ground already, with experience in all the necessary areas and a thorough plan to begin immediately. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal team has supplied outcomes and measures of success to allow the public to accurately audit the development of their program. They have certain deliverables, student enrollment and success data that they will publicize through a website and social media.\nWithin the deliverables, the learning management system, including web, iOS and Android apps will be required early on in the project. This will be obvious from the developments online, and the beginning of the classes.\nThe proposers have listed detailed student data they plan on collecting, to analyze success and completion rates of the courses, but also events and meetups to further build the Cardano community. In addition, they plan to document partnerships with NGOS, the private sector and academia.\nOne addition that would be beneficial to this proposal would be a clear plan for financial accountability. It\u2019s not mentioned, perhaps they plan to have an expenses reportting sheet, or Github linked, but it would be a confidence boost for potential investors to know that the money that\u2019s been earmarked for specific items has been spent accordingly. Also, to know how the contingency money is distributed, and in case of future funding needs (as they have specified they might need) it is good to have expenditure clearly accounted for publicly.\nLastly, their \u2018end goal\u2019 for auditability will be having 1 million + students complete the course, and hopefully many of the alumni students emerging from Africa as future blockchain and cryptocurrency experts.\nOverall, I rate this project 4 stars for auditability.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "Auditability:\nFor financial accountability purposes, we plan to provide to the community a google link with quarterly updates on expenses."}, {"id": 3397, "q0": "Target the university students by providing them a possibility to take a course on blockchain and cryptocurrencies is the main idea of this proposal.\nAfter completing the course, the students will be become the Blockchain Ambassadors, and part of the AYB (Africa Blockchain Ambassadors) to promote, use, play a role, support the ecosystem on various capacities. The proposal teams plan on promoting this within universities with a goal to reach 1+ million by 2027. By reaching out this number of people who would take the course, would be a great number and some of those will get involved, which is one of the objectives of the challenge.\nScalability and globality, the proposal is designed to start with 5 universities offering the course, and then 15 by November 2022, and this will increase as time goes on. This may reach out to many other universities in Kenya and beyond.\nThe project aligns clearly with the challenge ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The success of this project is possible and its large-scale implementation. However they are few factors to be taken into consideration:\n- the goal of the proposers is to have reached around 1 million students by 2027, but this should start gradually by targeting, even a least 1 university for the pilot phase. A university may count thousands of students who may be interested. This would help proposers to minimize the resources, and make a focus on evaluation of the outcomes, and be able to adjust for the next phases;\n- the sustainability of such initiative would be well planned ahead of time to allow evaluators to have a projection on short, mid and long term success\nThe budget breakdown is general on various sections without giving enouth details on how the funds would be used.\nThe proposers team is formed by people from diverse backgrounds, which is an asset. Also, the ABYA website is up and some work going on that can help to promote this new initiative.\nEven if the idea is feasible, it's success may be challenging based on the elements as currently presented with these same goals.\nI'll rate it with a 3 star and would like to see proposers decrease their intentions to be more realistic.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The audit mechanism presented is feasible where the community may be able to follow the progress through the ABYA website, but also the course materials would be online.
