Please do contact Robert O'Brien. He is working on something like what you are proposing but more advanced. Please note, his project is ongoing meaning he might not have a slot for a new team member. But what is encouraging for you Bradley, he is a strong believer of the \"Why\". Which means, you already the perfect candidate for this project.\n\nWith that said, knowing what this proposal is all about and what they seek to achieve, in terms of the greater strategy of Grow Africa Grow Cardano, this proposal is too advanced. For at this current stage, education on Cardano, creating developers is more essential. You could say, the \"How\" is still more important than the \"Why\".", "q0r": 3, "q1": "From the credentials given, the proposer seems to not have the soft skill needed to achieve his intended target, which includes coordination with village elders and such. Though the proposer did mention that he will collaborate with SWC, it is not mention where this delegation of responsibilities takes place. It is unclear who does what, who is the team leader, who is the coordinator and etc.\n\nThis is essential for as mentioned above, having similar experience in my local community, approaching village elders potentially involves emphatic cultural nuances. Which I assume should be initiated or at the very least brokered by the SWC team.\n\nPerhaps this is just a matter of proposal writing but it does unfortunately effects on how the likely outcome will be.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Besides the issue of task delegation, the other metrics provided are in place.

The team intends to capture these unique stories in a genuine way, to be able to transmit the authenticity through the recordings as much as possible. They have devised a plan on how to accomplish that, by frequent visits to the selected villages and \u201cofferings\u201d of food and celebrations to the elders, as to gain their trust and approval.\n I think preserving traditional knowledge is vital to every local community, and blockchain is definitely the best way to achieve that. NFTs have the power to bring people together, familiarise them with new ideas and create involvement within forming communities.\nAs such, I find the proposal to be well within the challenge parameters and to have a positive impact upon the local communities, by offering them the chance to have their stories heard around the globe and upon the Cardano community, by offering a new and exciting NFT project that provides valuable information.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation plan is divided into the two main developments of the project: \u201cThe Story Bank platform\u201d and \u201cThe Pilot Program\u201d.

The Pilot program is non-technical and revolves around the social part of the project, in which the team will be gaining the trust of the elders of 3 different villages, over a period of 4 months and on the 5th they will be able to gather the recordings to be used on the platform.\nIn conclusion, I find the plan to be well structured and presented in a clear way.\nThe budget is also clearly described. The platform development will have a total cost of $12000, as the proposer evaluates the time needed to implement it at 20 hours/week for a period of 6 months, with an hourly rate of just $25. From my knowledge, the hourly rate is very small for a blockchain developer, however, the proposer is the one who will be building the platform, as such, he is free to estimate whatever amount he is comfortable with, and probably wishes the project to succeed more than anything else. \nAs for the costs for the pilot program, the budget looks reasonable. Each meeting has its unique requirements, there is a small budget set aside for the project manager as well. Overall, I find the budget to be reasonable and realistic.\nThe proposer has provided some details regarding his experience and skill and the NGO he will be partnering with to finalise the Pilot program. He has also provided us with a GitHub link, in which we can observe the amount of activity to be consistent with what he has been describing. He has also started working on the website for the project, that he has also provided us with and that for now looks very promising.\nAs a final conclusion, I find the feasibility section well drafted, with all the information needed to be able to assess the potential successful implementation of the whole project.

He will also be monitoring the visits to the project\u2019s website to gather data about progressions and success at the same time.\nFor the Pilot Program, he has provided a different set of progress tracking. The number of community members engaged, the attendance numbers, people employed through the project, and the minutes of all meetings held are the points he will be measuring and monitoring, all valid methods to assess the development of the proposal.\nFor the success definition question, the proposer has provided a well-drafted answer, as well. The communities recorded would be able to earn a small passive income from the sale of the NFTs and will become incentivised to protect their culture and traditions. The success of the initial part of the project will possibly lead to other villages becoming interested, not just in themselves being recorded, but in the technology of blockchain and Cardano.\nI find all the information provided throughout this segment to be thoughtfully composed and to the point.

How to even understand that knowledge?  And then to turn it into an NFT?  Then how to communicate it to the market of potential buyers, and via which channels?\n\nThese are some of the many challenges that I for-see based on my experience working in less developed foreign culture.
