The proposer with his team wants to carry out what they dubbed, The Catalyst Campus Train which is a series of events they intend to be hosted at 4 university campuses in Ghana where cardano, project catalyst is absent or not active and they intend to introduce and promote the ideal of project catalyst. A precise and strategic implementation outline has been drawn by this proposer and his team. The Catalyst campus train will be a one-day event to be hosted at the targeted four university campuses on some topics which includes introduction to cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and cardano blockchain and project catalyst. With the above mentioned topics and plans from the proposal I think if funded will open the university students both continuing and fresh students to the knowledge of this numerous blockchain businesses which will help the students become self-reliant and live a free life without too much financial burden as it has always been the case. With the activity timelines the proposer and his team intends to start the catalyst campus train in September 2022 at Tamale University for Development Studies, in October 2022 University for Business and Integrated Development Studies(UBIDS) whose campus is in Wa and in November 2022 University for Development Studies (UDS)Nyankpala campus date is said to be Saturday November 12 2022 and last but not least one is from the Tamale Technical University which will take place on December 12 2022 at 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. GMT in the lecture theatre, these trainings is expecting a targeted participant as said by the proposer and his team is estimated to be about 50 participants. The proposer has the zeal to impart in this students the block chain technology knowledge which will help break some of them from the current financial challenges they may be facing and be able to help a lot of them become economic self reliance or be able to use this fund themselves in their schooling and at the end of the day they may end up setting up their own business. Which in the end will lead to self employment and thereby reducing unemployment in the country and I am so sure with this brief but yet precise  Project proposed should be funded to aid in their dissemination of the block chain information to our universities and to widen the scope of making Africa a leading adaption of cardano ecosystem and not the usual perpetual follower.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the experience of the lead proposer who is also a hub leader WADA a global grassroots movement that aims to educate local merchants, developers and users. This proposer and his team has had an activity plan for the Catalyst Campus Train their first events is to start from September 1st - 7th. And from this will be after confirmation of receipt of funding from catalyst and from there onboard the project team and outline the event steps, from the 8th to the 17th would be setting up of social media handles, then create a Google form to invite and pre-register participants, and to share event details with flyers on social media, prepare flyers, banners, print t-shirts and Conference materials and that's in the mid months. Then they will  contact the university leadership to initiate an action plan. Then from the 18th to the 30th of the months booking venues, book hotels, for the team and arrange transportation to campuses, organising and order water, snacks and food for participants and embark on on campus marketing of the event to invite and to register students. And second but  not the least is to hold the main event last Saturday of the month and last day to make social media  post and prepare a report for the Catalyst, this is the road map of the proposer and his team. This has clearly defined a successful implementation of this project if funded.

The other tool they will be using according to them, is an excel tracker document which will contain a roadmap and timelines to deliver the project, the cardano ecosystem will become more attractive to the masses, the institutions and even to the general public as they said. The proposer and his team also believe that project catalyst will become more noticed in the crypto Media space which will give it more outreach for adoption especially in Africa and I strongly agree with them and believe that if they should be funded will lead to an eye opener of everyone to know about Project catalyst and the cardano ecosystem and other blockchain business. The proposal has also brought in some metrics and here are some, a total of 200 participants in this project they're expecting to get adequate education and understanding of cryptocurrency and block chain technology, they also intimated that a total of 200 Yoroi wallets should be created, owned and managed by participants of the events.

I will start with the timeline for delivering the project. The proposer gave us a clear timeline on the proposal. He went as far as giving us specific dates,when the project is expected to commence and end. The author wrote down an activity plan with step by step delivery dates which I found very fascinating.\nSecondly,the budget to me is kind of huge, but on a second thought,the current high inflation in Ghana must have called for it. Prices of goods and services are currently on the rise and so the amount requested is totally understanding. The budget is also broken into phases, every phase and the amount needed.i must commend the proposer because I personally  think the proposer took his time to draft this proposal. All items and services to be purchased at each stage is clearly laid out in the proposal and amounts are portioned out to them.\nLastly I will talk about the experience of the team. The project lead who is a leader of wada and has some knowledge on cryptocurrencies and cardano blockchain and has been an ambassador for cardano is very capable of running this project if funded. From his LinkedIn,we realize he runs a private cryptocurrency startup called the chosen Fintech solution where he educates and empowers people to choose cryptocurrencies for a freer financial future. There is no doubt that,this project if funded is in the right hands. The rest of the team from the description given in the proposal have the requisite experience needed,they are very much familiar with blockchain technology and also capable of handling this project effectively.with all the above said,I believe this proposal is feasible and is highly likely to be implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It is interesting to know that the proposer has some tools and methods to be used in tracking the success of this project and also as a means of reporting directly to catalyst. Having participants giving testimonies on how impressed they are of the project is a genuine and sure way of verifying the authenticity of the project. The key performance indicators are also evidently stated in the proposal on how success of the project will look like. When we have about 200 participants joining catalyst through this project,200 of them putting in brilliant and innovative ideas and seeking for funding,200 yoroi wallets opened and managed by participants then success of this project will be measured,and all these matches the metrics of the challenge. The only problem I have is that,I am not Soo sure if all 200 participants will be actively engaged in the activities listed above, nonetheless I believe the progress of this project can be audited by the community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2890", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6613, "q0": "This proposal is a great idea, Catalyst Campus Train is looking for an accessible road for students in Ghana no mattering if they are graduated or undergraduate to  boost employment and minimize the high rate of graduate unemployment giving different tools to empower them in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space through a series of meetups around different universities among Ghana, introducing the Ideals of Project Catalyst on a country that still does not have them yet.
