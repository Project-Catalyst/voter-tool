The team does a great job to provide the community with a clear roadmap that indicates exactly how the workflow is going to be and what to expect from which stage. 3 months of education in English and French would definitely help a lot of the African community members who may be struggling with understanding what Cardano and/or Project Catalyst is. We can also expect a good number of quality proposals coming through from the African region in the subsequent funds to follow. This is because it's part of the project plan to educate participants on how to write good proposals. Definitely, the impact of this project can be realized if all plans go well. \nDown the line, it is indicated that this is a continuation of a fund 8 funded project called The African Catalyst School and provided links to some of the sessions they've held already. This is a great compliment to this proposal which indicates the good work being done by the team already. However, a link to a document containing a list of newly onboarded people to the community would have been a very good mechanism to aid the confirmation of impact.\nAll in all, per the information provided, I am satisfied that this proposal will be impactful in anyways needful. I give it a score of 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information provided in this proposal makes it quite difficult for me to believe that the indicated tasks in this proposal will be implemented successfully. My skeptical reasons are as follows:\nThe proposal has a list of some community members as the team responsible for a successful implementation. However, out of the many, the proposing team refuses to indicate exactly what roles all the listed individuals are going to play to aid the successful implementation. This information is very relevant and thus helpful for knowing who does what, at what time, and the rate which is needed to confirm the budget of the proposal. Also, there's a lack of relevant links for confirming the experience of the listed team members. For subsequent iterations, I advise the team to include these pieces of information as they influence PAs decisions.\nThe proposal indicates that internet connectivity would be the utmost challenge that will hinder a successful implementation and hence their mitigation plan is to provide their participants with funds until they are comfortably onboarded. My question is, what's their alternative for participants in weak signal zones. In most parts of the Sub-Saharan region, internet connectivity issues are not only related to the cost of data. Poor or weak signal is also a key factor to consider when addressing internet connectivity issues. \nThe budget looks fine but has some concerns that need addressing at least from my perspective and expertise. My concerns have to do with the allocation for \"Support to youth groups to logged on -$1000\" and \"Administrative cost - $2,000\". It is unclear to me how many members belong to the tag \"youth groups\" hence making it difficult for me to confirm whether or not the allocation is enough. On the other side, if the tag \"youth groups\" refers to expected participants, then I think the proposing team could have done a good job by providing some data on how much they intend to spend on a participant for data subsidization. This could help confirm the budget allocation by multiplying the amount by a number of expected participants by the number of events to be held.\nAlso, no data is provided on what the $2,000 is to take care of. What kind of administration? Does it in other words refer to incentives for team members for their efforts? If so, how much is a team member entitled? Is it sufficient for the workload? Or, the administration is for tools like Zoom, G-Suite, etc that will be used for successful implementation? \nAvailable information to clarify this would have been a great compliment to the financial feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient for me to determine whether or not this proposal if funded, can be tracked successfully by the community. The roadmap of the proposal is well written and points out milestones that can aid the community in determining what success looks like. The metrics provided set the right expectation for the community. At least, the community knows what to expect at the end of the first, second, and third months post-funding. \nIt is stated in the proposal that the team would fall back on Catalyst if they need to continue this project. I partially agree with this as far as project sustainability is concerned. The team can think of setting up a stake pool to ensure that even if their proposal is not funded, they can still go ahead to deliver a good impact.\nSince there are YouTube links in the proposal that leads to work already done by the team, I think the community can track the progress of the project from that angle even though it was not stated but was supposed to.\nAll in all, I agree with the auditability criteria of this proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2518", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 439, "q0": "There is the Town Hall, a virtual place to congregate and then there is Catalyst School, a virtual school to learn everything about Catalyst. Through Catalyst School one can learn how submit a proposal, understand all the processes of governance in Cardano and of course receive compensation by being involved in assessing the future of Cardano in the form of community proposals.\n\nGrowing Africa, Growing Cardano all starts from education. Although Catalyst School does not educate directly on Cardano, it constitutes as one of the low bearing fruits where the general public can start to involve themselves into Cardano. From there the general public can continue their journey however they feel comfortable. The goal here is opening their eyes to everything Catalyst.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As this is a continuation of an previous proposal that did achieve their KPI's, with their initial experience one can expect continued and refinement efforts of their services. Add to the fact that this proposal is heavily inspired by the initial Catalyst School proposal -another successfully funded proposal- , the potential of success is very high.\n\nA suggestion to the team, is to consider efforts of regeneration and event marketing, to anticipate the saturation of their current pool of talents. Having that stated would assist in gauging the future progress of this proposal. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Since this is a reoccurring proposal, it would be helpful and convenient to the larger Cardano community if past achievement metrics were also stated therefore we can also gauge the effectiveness of the team. As it is a proven platform, shortcomings would most likely fall on the specific team.\n\nThough in this proposal, to my recollection there are new metrics that if my memory serves me correct, the initial proposal did not have. There is a specific number of participants they seek to achieve and a specific number of classes to achieve. Add to this, each classes are also recorded and uploaded onto YouTube, making auditing easy.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2088", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 1, "ng": 11, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11761, "q0": "The idea of establishing the Catalyst School of Africa perfectly aligns with the goal of the \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" challenge. This proposal was submitted at Fund 8, unfunded, and continues to be present at Fund 9. The authors raised an important issue that needed to be addressed is, a lack of understanding about Cardano in Africa, an area that Cardano considered a strategic goal. In the new proposal, in addition to the region-specific Catalyst stance solution, the team also added new content - the provision of an Africa-oriented Catalyst boarding service for students. The aim is, to help keep the Catalyst Africa Town Hall motivated in the local community and to support African PAs/Proposers to participate more effectively in Catalyst. I noticed, that the new proposal has quite a few changes. The information is much more complete and supplemented by the authors than in Fund 8. In it, the role of running and providing a high-quality on-boarding service is also specified \u2013 which will be led by a team of experts from the main Catalyst School, Catalyst Africa Community Experts, and Cardano Ambassadors in charge. The team aims to \u201clocalize Catalyst\u201d to make our Cardano ecosystem more accessible to the people of the African region. This helps to increase the number of regional PAs/Proposers and turns potential ideas into effective proposals. This is a good solution. Because according to some interesting research by Chainalysis Insights, Africa is becoming the most dynamic and interesting region with crypto adoption rates of some countries in the top 20 in the world. The African crypto market in 2021 also recorded a 1200% increase compared to 2020 (https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/africas-grassroots-cryptocurrency-adoption). I agree with the authors' argument about the need to develop a targeted and specific Catalyst approach for the African region due to the peculiarities of: language habits (English, French, Arabic language goes hand in hand), differences in culture, education, etc. of the region. However, I suggest the authors need to carry out a small and medium scale survey to identify who will be the target audience of Catalyst Africa School (occupation, age, qualifications...). Without survey data, it will be difficult for the community to understand who wants to participate in Catalyst Africa. Here, in the proposal, the authors propose to approach \u201cyoung people in universities, workers and business owners\u201d to raise awareness about Cardano, but they lack a convincing basis for why choosing these options in this object. The proposal also takes into account the risk factor of the high cost of the internet affecting the success of the proposal, and in Fund 9, they have also added a $1000 budget to support youth groups to log on. A randomized study I did showed that people in Africa pay approximately 10% of their average monthly salary for internet service. South Africa is the most affordable country to connect to the internet, equivalent to people paying $7 for internet access for every $100 of their monthly salary. The highest, Mauritania Internet charges up to $ 4726, while the average monthly salary of residents is about $ 60. Therefore, I evaluate, the solution of training live sessions that the group offers is suitable for the specificity of the region. My score is 5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation progress of the proposal in Fund 9 has not changed compared to Fund 8. Total implementation time is expected to be 3 months, with division of work by week/month. The authors also highlight the solution's ability to expand beyond a funding cycle. The training content is designed with live sessions and the themes are designed to repeat every month. The language of instruction in the first month is English and French will be added from the second month. Each event is expected to attract 25 participants. However, I could not find relevant information about the authors' calculations for where the live sessions will take place. Personally, I think this is necessary information, since all the teaching sessions are held live, the venue will contribute to the success of the event. I suggest that the authors should survey the meeting area (where, why choose this location) to optimize the number of potential reachers. Regarding the budget, in the new proposal, the team has increased the budget by $1000 compared to the proposal at Fund 8, due to the addition of the \"Support to youth groups to logged on - $1000\" section. Unfortunately, in the proposal of Fund 9, the team still did not clarify the unit prices and component costs of the items. For example, the translation cost $3500 should state the unit price of $/hour of translation*hours, internet cost and administration fee of $1500 for how many hours of access/week * number of weeks? How many people does it cost to manage $2000?... Regarding the team, I have a specific list of members but completely missing links to each member's social profiles. I also consulted the link https://www.wada.org/ but couldn't find any information about the team. I don't have enough information to be certain about the feasibility of the proposal. My rating is 3 points, minus -1 point for budget lack of detailed unit price, -1 point for lack of reference link to team member profile.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In terms of auditability, this is the highlight of the proposal. The team provided very clear and specific KPIs to measure success. Thanks to that, the community can completely audit the expected results of the project. The commendable point here is that the monthly KPIs have very clear growth targets. Specifically, January is expected to have 3 training courses attracting 20 students, February is 4 face-to-face sessions with 25 students, the number of trainees will increase to 30 people in the last month. Another important indicator of the proposal, is that 20 classes and workshops will be held. I suggest that the authors need to add some platforms to help the community easily monitor and evaluate the success indicators such as: The Africa Catalyst School's Youtube channel, lecture material repository... My rating is 5 for the auditability of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3279", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 4, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 11636, "q0": "The Proposer has done a marvelous job by glancing and outlining key issues about the problem and placing it in its right challenge.

Their determination to have a catalyst School set up in Africa to promote the agenda of making Africa a leading adoption of cardano ecosystem and project catalyst is laudable idea, this proposal has lay down key ideas as to how they intend to carry out this project successfully to get the needed impact on the African Society. It is a desire of the proposer and his team that most newcomers  to project catalyst have experience the challenge of understanding the entire cardano and catalyst framework and how it operate. To participate effectively in any role whether proposal assessor, veteran proposal assessor, proposal.  The Catalyst School has been  very active in onboarding new people onto cardano and catalyst however Africa's participation in the Catalyst  schools activities is quite low for a couple of reasons including which this project seeks to address.\nFirst and foremost, many people in Africa have absolutely no idea or knowledge of cardano and catalyst community. The large francophone Community of about 141 million people and growing and Arabs speaking community of about 140 million people which largely are not engaged.\n Secondly people struggle to understand some live and recorded sessions because they are unfamiliar with the spoken accent of the presenter. As a solution to these challenges the African Catalyst School will provide the following Solutions. Outreach to the youth and tertiary institutions, workers and business men and women and the general public to promote and raise awareness of cardano ecosystem and project catalyst. The proposer and his team also seek to provide onboarding to new entrants through live and recorded sessions facilitated by Africans in English and French for a starter and eventually to the Arabic language. The emphasis is on Africans to facilitate in order to remove the accent challenges confronting the African community. The proposer and his team are also expecting to prepare courses on all the topics currently handled by the main catalyst School that is introduction to cardano blockchain and catalyst, how to be a community advisor, how to be a veterans community advisor and how to be a voter and many more if funded.\nWith the above determination and foresight on project catalyst and it impacts on the African Community I deemed this project a results-oriented one hence it should be funded.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With the experience given and plan presented it is highly likely the proposal will be implemented successfully because the proposer and his team are made up of experts who have been part of cardano as far back as fund four(4) all the way to this fund nine(9) and so stand a chance of executing successful Project if funded. A number of activities the proposer and his team are expected to carry out in the course of the three-months timeline they're giving according to the proposer and his team catalyst is constantly changing and evolving as well as getting new members on-boarded as such there is a need of continuous education and so the reason the Catalyst African schools importance and the major role it is supposed to be playing over here to turn around the fortunes of cardano and catalyst in Africa. The project is expected to run through 3 months timelines and you know this month there are projects and programs that are outline to be carried based on weekly basis to see the success of this project. \nIn month 1 the proposer and his team are expected to conduct live session in English once a week the first week will be dedicated to localised and adapting assistant course materials to the African context as well as preparing content for new courses. Week 2 would include introduction to blockchain, Cardano and catalyst, week 3 would also include how to navigate the Cardano ideascale.com, website. \n\nMonth 2 almost have same programs as month one as most of the programs are repeated to enhance the understanding of the participants.\nMonth 3, the proposer and his team would be conducting the following live sessions once a week in English. Week 1; how to be a veteran community advisor\n week 2 how to be a voter week 3 brainstorming and Q&A session. \nweek 4 how to turn idea into an effective proposal on ideascale. The proposer and his  team has elaborated on fantastic ideas brought forth to change the face of Africa through cardano and catalyst African School. The proposer and his team on the other hand also presented a sound requested budget and of which they took their time to break the budget into identifiable bits according to activities they expect to carry in the course of the weeks in the three months of which the budget requested tallies with the projects they expected to carry out day and night. In the area of the people the proposer and his team are intending to work with, a lot of them are members of wada and other prominent blockchain technologies whose details and links have been provided in this proposal for easy verification and identification and if possible tracing. In the area of risk the proposer and his team bemoaned the inaccessible electricity and expensive data which may discourage the youth to participate in the cardano and catalyst African School and so with the experience of the proposer and his team they have kept measures in place to cushion these young men and women until they are fully on-boarded onto project catalyst and cardano ecosystem.

In particular, in the first month, besides conducting in English, the proposed team also prepared for French sessions. To prepare for these sessions, they will leverage the feedback they collect from the English lessons and incorporate them into the content for the French sessions.
