From educating students, developers, business people and politicians. They are all connected. Take for instance politicians, although some might be socially drive, in the end it will usually boil down to the potential financial benefit blockchain can provide to the government or country.\n\nAfrica seemingly does not have a strong financial operating system, this would be indeed the right market to focus on this very moment and for the future.

LinkedIn profile is not an end all be all requirement, but it does help verifiers to connect the dots of the social circle of a person.\n\nAgain, persuading governments is difficult and it does not help when the second proposer credentials are as a freelancer in blockchain for 8 years.

The KPIs proposed do translate if the proposal will be successful or not. They aim at policy makers and government official but indirectly they have a potential to impact whole communities which aligns with the objectives of the campaign. Nevertheless, they miss a very important point which is how to scale their solution after an initial successful implementation.

Despite that, the experiences themselves seem relevant (they range from cryptocurrency knowledge and Cardano initiative participations to journalism and policy). The total amount of the budget is within acceptable limits, but I believe they could have described better the destiny of the resources. For example, in traveling costs they could have described the locations they are planning to visit and how many people is considered in each trip. Inside the publication and translations services they could have given us an idea of roughly how many publications and pieces of translation they intend to do with that budget. The timeline in the roadmap seems modest and short compared with the budget requested. They could have planned more events and workshops in the following months and not just the two first after funding. Finally, I believe they have not done a thorough analysis of the risks they face.

Of course, the inability of policymakers and market shareholders to adopt blockchain technology and its solutions is a major problem that needs to be solved.

Kudos to the team for being able to detect this problem when it seems to be on the blind side of almost everyone. The described solution is a perfect way of handling problems like these that hinder the adoption of a product. Even though blockchain requires permission from no one to operate, certain projects that are being implemented on the blockchain certainly require that these entities do understand and intimidate them in no circumstance hence the idea of sensitizing these entities to erode the preconceived negative thoughts they have about the blockchain technology would really have a positive impact on general blockchain and Cardano at large.

I feel this is great but I am also beginning to think if 2 months are enough for such a workload and engagements. It is usually hard and takes time for one who has issues with a product or brand to shift their paradigm. Unless the team already has done these arrangements with the various shareholders and policymakers and refused to include the proposal which is not ideal, I think a minimum of 5 months could have been the best timeline to prevent any unwanted pressure. But as for the information provided in this proposal, the roadmap points out key milestones that can be measured against the performance of the team.\nA question was raised about the clarity of the project aim in the comment section which of course the proposer did well to attempt a clarification. From the clarification, it's indicated that this proposal would make use of \"workshops\" and \"seminars\" to redefine Africa's digital economy through blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. However, there's some sort of confusion here. In the roadmap, only \"2 workshops\" that are scheduled to take place in the second-month post-funding are captured. There's literally no mention of \"events\" in there. But in the budget, I see an allocation of $3,000 for \"Workshops & Onboarding\" as well as $3,000 for \"Events hosting and planning\". This renders the budget infeasible for me since I feel unsafe about it. Looks like some money will not be accounted for. Else, the proposer should have indicated details of the \"events\" in the proposal. For instance, how many events are going to be hosted, where is it going to be hosted, how many participants are expected, etc.\nIt is quite unfortunate that Daniel D. Lezu who is the proposer is the only person I could verify his expertise. The links provided for the remaining team members didn't work no matter how much I tweaked them. This makes me uncertain about the team.\nI am sorry but will have to disagree with the feasibility criterion of this proposal.

Unfortunately, this link is not working and may be due to the fact that the proposer refused to extend the expiration date to \"never expire\".

I understand the team is trying to find a solution to improve this. If this can be improved, it will be of great benefit to developing Africa, but that will take time.

Because it determines the perceptions of policymakers and market stakeholders, these two actors are important to the African economy. If they are not aware of the role of the Cardano ecosystem, they will not participate and make it difficult to apply the Cardano blockchain in Africa, and the development of Africa - especially the world economy. Africa that lacks the key leverage is the Cardano blockchain. On the other hand, if this proposal is handled well, it is possible to scale up and solve other challenges in the future.

Regarding the detailed budget analysis, you have included all the items along with the proposed funding amount. This is acceptable to me. However, I still advise the team, if possible, to analyze, break down, and more closely the items with the budget to clarify the feasibility and create the community's confidence in the proposal. The plan and implementation are meetings, seminars and through the media to propagate the role of the Cardano blockchain in the development of Africa. The implementation is very good, but I recommend that the people involved in the propaganda must be those who have really good knowledge about the Cardano blockchain platform to be able to convince the community and especially the opponents. image with a high level of education and high position in society (Policy makers, Representatives of local authorities, Operators of Traditional Banks). I hope you guys have the knowledge to do this well. This is also related to the necessary resources for implementation, which are quality human resources with good knowledge - broad understanding. In propaganda seminars or meetings, it is necessary to explain the technical aspects of the Cardano blockchain, and its role and mission of the Cardano blockchain. And that has to do with the technology used to make this proposal. Next, I will analyze the risks and challenges associated with implementation. I see you mentioned the challenge risk that some African countries have banned the use of blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies. So, I would like to contribute ideas to reduce the risk of this challenge: Team members when implementing the proposal in reality must be able to convince and demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of Cardano for customers. all aspects of Africa: from economic to social, environmental, cultural traditions, related to spiritual values, people's knowledge of all African countries, etc...

I still have the opinion that if the team can explain more clearly and more clearly the steps, it will increase the audit applicability of the proposal. In addition, the steps are attached to the months of the year for the community to easily monitor and evaluate. How many local government offices does the team plan to reach in different regions? How many heads of different financial institutions will the team choose to approach? Please give specific numbers.
