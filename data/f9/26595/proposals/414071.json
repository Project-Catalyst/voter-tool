The proposed proposal aims to provide customized content and features for token holders securely to businesses by logging in the wallet. At the same time, the team has also developed a portal where distributors and businesses can easily edit tokens or access as a service.\nOn the one hand, the proposal outlines the advantages and successes they have achieved. Firstly, the Company has built a successful brand, contacts and a certain position in this field. At the same time, the proposal has 1 team and 1 widely active MVP with a professional and interesting interface for users (including dashboards and projects). It integrates notifications from Discord and posts on other social networking sites as a control center. In addition, Proposal will develop a few more projects and content customization portals with a free trial and test version for customers to experience. They are also exploring and linking distributors and businesses in the Cardano ecosystem to deliver the benefits of cryptographically unlockable blockchain tokens.\nOn the other hand, members are aware of the challenges they face in the project. However, they offer limited solutions to the problem. The first point is that the team should focus on building organic followings and recognition through relevant communication channels. Next, the proposed title is still not automatically translated into English, so this is a minus point. It can be seen that English is a global and quite popular language, so it is a bridge to cooperate with businesses around the world. Thirdly, the main challenge has not fixed the timelines to achieve the goal in the stages stated in the proposal to be able to unleash the full development potential of the Perkz Token. In conclusion, in order to receive investors' approval, I think the proposal needs to provide optimal solutions to overcome the risks.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I think, with the ideas stated in the proposal, the project is enough to achieve the set goals. The proposal provided a description of the stages that needed to be done to complete the plan. However, the timeline for when the stages will be successful has not been specified. \nIn terms of budgets, they clearly state spending activities in line with the plan. For example, how to pay 1 full time developer (6-9 months) with $50k (calculated at pound rate is about 500GBP per day) or 2 part time developers (but not provided content yet). how to pay a salary). They save on normal business operating expenses, hosting & server costs, equipment & marketing will be covered so the investment will go to TokenPerkz. However, the proposal calls for funding in US dollars but calculates staff salaries in pounds. I think it is necessary to agree on 1 currency for ease of calculation and review.\n On the other hand, the proposer also clearly defines the positions in the team that need to be, assigns tasks reasonably and presents who is present in the team. Besides, they also provide professional and experienced staff to carry out the task. Specifically, Sam Clark - Designer & Brand Manager, 1 team member can design, market and build brands to find the right target audience. They have achieved such successful branding TokenPerkz.com beta has gone live and is being used by the film production company and has customers waiting to link to the platform.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project will be measured by the completion of the stages outlined in the plan such as beta development, user interface design, number of projects involved in the platform, etc. also, JIRA Platform, is a 3rd party platform also used to track and document development tasks. However, the project has not provided instructional content such as usage, address, progress tracking table, number of users, ..\nBesides, I think the proponent can also carry out advertising campaigns, media campaigns or propaganda to gain media recognition. At the same time, the team has yet to provide content on the roadmap or KPIs and how long it will take to achieve the goal. In general, I believe that if the team solves the above problems, the success rate of the project will be higher and bring into full play the potential of TokenPerkz and create more utilities for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4077", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1502, "q0": "The expansion of the CARDANO ecosystem resulted in a surge of decentralized applications (DApps), which are integrated programs that had an effect on the ADA hosting community. As the number of decentralized applications (DApps) continues to proliferate at an exponential rate, businesses will require a location to not only store and protect their tokens but also monitor the distribution of their products. Only companies that develop DApps, which are software programs designed to serve the requirements of the Cardano community, are the target audience for this proposition.\n\nWhen the team presented the challenges that were encountered by the project during the implementation stage as well as the solutions to those challenges, we thought it was acceptable. I believe that this is a significant concept that requires a relatively sizable budget in order to be put into action. This is particularly the case given that the group is not only aiming for the CARDANO ecosystem but also intends to go further with some other ecosystems. Therefore, I will award this impact five points.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Due to the fact that the writing proposal is divided into four stages, I find that I am confused and that I do not really know the exact time for each of those stages. To ensure that the community is able to keep the most accurate track of the project's development and the various stages of its implementation, you should specify how long each phase takes; this can be done on a quarterly, monthly, or, for greater specificity, a daily basis (this is my suggestion so that you can edit the project).\n\nConcerning the budget for the project: You have brought up a problem that is too general, such as $50,000 for a full-stack developer (six to nine months), or two part-time developers. Although you mentioned that the average income of a developer in the UK is 500 GBP for the community to be able to refer to, the community really needs more details about the number of working hours a day as well as whether or not your developer is really able to work non-stop during that 6\u20139 month period.\n\nIn terms of personnel, the team put out 5 people to implement the project; however, I do not see a link to each person's personal page; this is something that, in my opinion, the group ought to add in order to let the community know about the project and increase its transparency. As a result, I will award this aspect of the feasibility a score of three points.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to evaluate the success of the project and determine when it will be finished are not currently available, and neither are links to the project websites.

The enterprises will have access to fully customize these portal/hubs to offer the varied benefits they wish to their token holders. Then the token holders can connect their web browser-based wallets to the portal to access the benefits the token issuer offers. This portal or platform will be utilizing the Cardano Blockchain to develop this utility hub, which aligns with the Challenge Statement.\n\nThis portal will make things easier for the enterprises who wish to issue tokens such as loyalty or else and provide the benefits to the token holders over time. As a result, the enterprises need not go through the burden of building web-based platforms from scratch.\n\nThis portal will bring value to the Cardano Ecosystem. Many enterprises who wish to issue NFTs and offer other services based on the NFTs but are hesitant due to the technical hurdles will have the option to utilize this portal and do so. Enterprises using it will help onboard many people to the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThe proposer knows that the main risk is onboarding enough projects and wishes to tackle this with a qualified marketing executive. The beta version is being used by 'Serenity Pictures,' and some enterprises are in the process of onboarding.\nHowever, considering the vague timeframe and inappropriate budget, I am rating it four stars. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team comprises three software developers and one design and brand manager. They will hire one additional developer after Catalyst funding. After seeing the beta version and its use, they seem qualified to execute the proposal.

So my question is, if you are not sure about the time, then the requested amount will not be sufficient. \n\nThe timeframe provided is vague. However, as the phases for the tasks are laid out, it should not be hard to ascertain the duration required by each task.  \n\nConsidering the experience and skills of the team and being the Tokenperkz beta is already live, the proposal is likely to be executed if funded.

But the proposer mentioned that the proposal would likely complete in 6 to 9 months, which is vague. The proposer should update the timeframe; otherwise, it is difficult to track progress by time factor apart from other problems.\nI am giving it a four star since the timeframe is uncertain, which will cause the budget to be not sufficient.

The project will be called TokenPerkz and already exists in beta version. The community addressed in this project is the Cardano projects that are currently developing their own custom utility solutions. It is convenient that TokenPerkz is an easy solution to offer this ready-made solution. There are a few risks included in the proposal such as bringing in enough projects that will use TokenPerkz.

The budget will only be spent on hiring a developer who will work for them (6-9 months). The budget will certainly be sufficient to hire a person. No additional financing will be required at this stage. Funding will only be needed if there are more complex problems. A plan has been included with the associated phases. It would be useful if a deadline had been defined for each phase. The technical aspects that need to be done are included in the timeline of the proposal.

It would be useful if these KPIs could be shared via a social platform to encourage other people to collaborate on this project. There is a clear description of the problem and how it can be solved.

In other words, this proposal should explain wht this project should be conducted on the Cardano ecosystem and how it will bring the Cardano ecosystem closers to more people.

In addition to holding and trading tokens, token holders can also use tokens to view content exclusively for them, which brings great utility to tokens as well as increases the value of tokens. This proposal completely addresses the challenge because it will attract more people to buy tokens just to view such content, which will also lead to an increase in the number of wallets on Cardano. Other values that the proposal brings to Cardano such as helping existing projects drive loyalty from their token holders and onboarding more traditional businesses into the space are also detailed in the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team already has an MVP, which proves they can carry out the project. The budget given is also quite clear when they only use that budget to hire 1 full-time developer for 6 months, other expenses like normal business operating costs, hosting & server costs are covered by their company. The timetable they give is also quite clear and realistic. I have a recommendation that the team should add verifiable information about the working process as well as the projects done by each team member (maybe via LinkedIn) so that voters can better understand the ability of each member of the team.\n\nBeside that, the proposer also needs to describe the technologies you use to operate the system and ensure future scaling. For example, the proposal might outline how you store digital content securely, how you handle tens of thousands or even millions of users accessing the platform at the same time, and how you deliver the content to customers worldwide without congestion or lag. Streaming videos to millions of users around the world with low latency is not an easy task. When hundreds of companies join your network, there will be hundreds of thousands of customers who own the company's tokens also accessing your platform and watching millions of hours of videos every month. It is extremely important to ensure that the token holders have a good experience when viewing exclusive content as it relates not only to your platform quality but also to the company's reputation that uses the services you provide. If the system is backed by AWS cloud services, I would suggest the proposer refer to this Netflix Case Study to get some idea of how Netflix was built https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/\n\nThere are 2 developers on the team to be able to do the front-end and back-end of the dApp, but the team also needs an additional member who specializes in network design and security to solve the content delivery problem to scale this platform to millions of users.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Using the completion of the technical phases to check the progress of the project is possible for those with experience in programming or QA testing, but it is quite difficult for the vast majority of the community to check the progress.

On the other hand, some features need access permissions of the Project owner to be able to evaluate (eg Project owner login system,  Protected pages secure video add/update, etc ...) so that also becomes a barrier to auditing the progress by the community.
