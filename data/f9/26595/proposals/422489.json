Such projects exist in other chains like Ethereum and it would be a great added value to have them in our ecosystem. The project indeed alligns with the challenge's guidelines since the product is a Dapp that attempts to change classical crowdfunding method into innovative decentralized ways of funding. This project has the potential to have a global impact since the funded project are not limited by any geographical borders or other pseaudo barriers. Furthermore, the ability of the project is unlimited and would only depend on the team's ability to attract great businesses seeking funding and also attract enough interested investors seeking to reach such new projects. And from the team's experience, they seem to be able to overcome these hurdles and scale the project in an appropriate way which will bring new projects to our ecosystem and integrate them with Cardano automatically.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "According to the team's experience and their past funded projects through Catalyst and the links and attachments provided, I feel comfortable saying that the project has a pretty high success likelihood. For starters, the team has an extensive experience in space and more than two funded projects under the same group name: TokenAllies but for other purposes. The team is quite active in the community and has brought a lot of value to the ecosystem. Furthermore, the team provided a monthly plan including weekly milestones specifying what exactly will be done in the organization a development side. Also, the budget presented by the team is quite detailed and includes what will go to what and seems to be fair in terms of the value of expenses and so on. The teams determine two main risks and present a way to mitigate them which wasn't very detailed but is compensated for in the planning side which is very meticulous. I look forward to reviewing an MVP by the team.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has a history of good cooperation on the auditing side. They have at least 2 previously funded projects and have shown a great level of transparency in their development. Furthermore, The community has a very detailed roadmap that extends over three months with weekly milestones that will act like checkpoints that the community can use to see how the team is doing and the progress of their development. Also, the team provides multiple KPIs like providing a wallet connector as soon as the first month and an MVP of the ALLI platform in the second month. While these are ambitious goals the team has the required expertise to make them happen. The team has also provided time frames to provide multiple aspects of the project (i.e wallet connector, ALLI MVP,...).

The team has identified a problem very pertinent to the challenge, the difficulty of small businesses and start-ups to smoothly and cheaply access funding. And have proposed a solution through the use of a product built on top of Cardano which will enrich the ecosystem and attract potentially a lot of new users. The impact of this proposal has the potential to be extremely high and the team has explained in a clear way how it will add value to the Cardano environment. The goals they have defined of implementing an ADA wallet connector, launching the site and generating a Dex integration all align with the outlined challenge. They all move toward the direction of offering a new product to the community, attracting new users and increasing the number of integrations for a seamless experience between products. The only part I would have liked the team to discuss more is their plans for future scalability and sustainability. These are extremely important points for those who have a long-run perspective and if not given enough attention could risk the company/project continuing as a going concern.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer has provided LinkedIn links for the three members of the team and they have relevant experience in financial markets, software development and project management.

Also in this section, the necessary funds for each participant and for infrastructure items are estimated and the amounts are all reasonable. The total amount is aligned with the outcome product as well. The timeline of the project is realistic, it is divided in three phases and each of them has clear deliverables. First, they will focus on the ADA wallet connector. Second on the ALLI token site launch. And finally, they'll work on the DEX integration. In general, the plan described is sensible and clearly states the resources that will be necessary. Additionally, the team have also discussed two major risks the project has but have proposed mitigating solutions. One of them is possible developers\u2019 turnovers and the other is problems in the integration. For the first they already have contact with other developers that could be used in case it is necessary and for the second they are open to all possibilities.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team proposed a roadmap with clear milestones and achievable timetables. The ADA wallet connector in the first month, the ALLI token site launch on the second month and the DEX integration on the third month. The KPIs provided however are exactly these deliverables. It would be better if they have thought on number of users of the application, total volume of financing for the businesses and number of requests of crowdfunding on their platform. Metrics like that would be more informative and aligned with the challenge. On the other hand, they have provided a link to a site where they claim they will regularly post updates of the project. Additionally, the solution is thoroughly explained and is effective and disruptive.

Insofar as these are all publicly auditable milestones (involving nothing less than a native token launch and consequent integrations in the Cardano ecosystem), it should be regarded as eminently auditable for the community.

This has a potentially enormous effect. It is undoubtedly beneficial for the Cardano chain to bring in and onboard ecosystem businesses and products, but it is equally necessary to bring in external firms and developers by offering support in any way that is feasible. And I believe my proposal successfully satisfies those requirements. Cardano's native multi-token blockchain features make it simple to enable finance and liquidity for both the business and the investors. The author suggests creating and offering a platform as a service so that businesses can plan, design, manage, and sell their tokens in order to enable such a phenomenon. This plan will not only add new companies to the chain, but its integration with an appropriate Defi solution will make it simple for ADA holders to make investments in those companies. Therefore, if this project were to be implemented successfully, it would have a significant impact on adding new business owners and smart developers to the chain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is no question about the proposers' expertise because Alex and Lucas are well-known names in the neighborhood. Additionally, it is important to recognize the effort that went into creating the plan. The proposer offers a clear roadmap to the community and readers, complete with resource requirements, hazards to be considered, and quantifiable indicators. The team gives a very quick overview of the team and the experience they might bring to the ecosystem, along with a statement that certain developer and project manager positions have already been filled. When compared to the total budget for the challenge, the requested funds are likewise very acceptable. The breakdown also appears reasonable because the per-head pay is so modest when compared to the developers of competing proposals. Given the evidence at hand, it is clear that this idea has a good chance of succeeding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For a proposal of this caliber, there must be extremely obvious signs that money is originally leaving the ecosystem. The authors present phase-by-phase quantifiable metrics, which would simplify the auditing procedure. The proposal's auditing procedure would be completed by the launch of the ALLI token, the integration of the DEX for ALLI, and the author's identification with the greatest amount of caution. Timely updates and reports over the token_allies channels and groups could assist auditors in keeping an eye on the progress. However, establishing what would constitute the proposal's success should have been done more effectively. However, given that it is an extension proposal of a fund7 proposal that has already been financed, a reader may discover evidence to suggest that the team would ensure that the auditing process runs smoothly and that the community would always be aware of the proposal's development.
