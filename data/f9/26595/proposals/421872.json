Research that identifies the pros and cons of decision-making, products, and solutions in an accurate and timely manner. The solution proposed in the proposal is the extension of the independent media outlet Adapulse. Adapulse is a coalition of tech writers/engaged community members who create content around the innovation, projects and news within Cardano. Objective independent media coverage of updates, projects and news within the Cardano ecosystem is paramount. Given the growth, it will be necessary to start building pillars to discuss all topics outside the current institutions, e.g. Cardano Foundation and Input Output Global. Adapulse is an independent outlet made up of community members. The ideology is an informed and engaged community leading to sound decision making as they follow the path of decentralized governance. As the Voltaire era gains traction with the introduction of various governance concepts - dReps, voting on the chain and others. Adapulse aims to help anyone seeking resources to understand these concepts and participate in the ecosystem at their own pace. The proposer chooses this challenge category because the media and various challenges in fund9 were eliminated. They still believe that their proposal is well within the scope of this challenge. AdaPulse is a product of and for the community, which relies heavily on community input and communication to continue to grow and serve the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Adapulse was founded in 2021 by two SPOs who have been part of the Cardano community since 2017. Since its inception, the team has published over 200 articles on a range of Cardano-related topics and has recently started creating Adapulse News. In the proposal, all current team members are described with links to their Twitter account where you can get extra info about them. The number of extra people that will be needed for the team has also been included but is not yet known. A detailed budget analysis is available in the proposal. This analysis is divided into various items with a description of the number of hours and also cost price per hour. The total budget is USD 222,800. Financing this proposal will take Adapulse's business model to the next level. It will provide funding for operations over the next 12 months. It will also support attracting additional talent and adding competitive compensation that reduces our exposure to employee churn. In this proposal, the proposer opts for Project Catalyst funding after being self-funded in the past year to ensure that the values of what they have built remain the same. Seeking financing outside of Catalyst could potentially expose their point of sale to the influence of external factors. The environment they've cultivated at Adapulse allows creators to generate content in a way that doesn't limit their message and focuses on presenting objective analysis. This has been a winning recipe thus far as they have published over 200 articles and 30+ videos while growing viewership organically. Since its inception, Adapulse has averaged about 20k unique visitors per month with very little to no ads outside of a Twitter profile and posting to Facebook and Reddit. They have published articles highlighting community projects and proposals that have gained social traction, such as Western African Decentralized Alliance (WADA), PlayerMint, NFTMaker, Empowa, Dandelion API, and many more. The proposer expects a funding round from Project Catalyst in around 60-90 days. Roughly 5 financing rounds over the next 12 months. Publishing quality content is the norm and they will focus their attention on 30 proposals per round that they identify. They are proposals that add value to the community. In total, there will be 150 in-depth articles with proposals submitted to Project Catalyst over the course of 12 months. It is not currently intended to fund Adapulse through investors or any other outside source. Investors and many third parties provide motives and often those motives are usually not in the best interests of the wider community. The proposers are likely to come back in future rounds to solicit community support to continue funding efforts to build AdaPulse into an independent pillar of objective and accurate information disseminated throughout the Cardano ecosystem. A realistic time schedule has been set. The standard is set for more than 200 articles to be published in the last 12 months, including all content. If funded further, it will enable the team to generate and publish more than 250 newsworthy articles over the course of 12 months alone, which equates to approximately 5 articles per week. At the end of the week, this content will be consolidated into our weekly newsletter. The main risks that would prevent the team from executing its results are lack of incentives and staff turnover. As an independent media outlet, they rely heavily on the contribution of their strong and capable community members to provide timely and relevant content to educate the wider community.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There is a very detailed roadmap with milestones in the proposal, as well as a time horizon for realization. The proposal is feasible and a solution that addresses the problem described. KPIs have been determined that will be followed up. These are very clearly defined. A weekly newsletter with at least 4 content/news articles will be published. Each Project Catalyst Financing Round Adapulse includes 30 different proposals. Two videos per week will be uploaded to Adapulse News on Youtube. The goal is to increase the audience by 100% over the course of 12 months (from 20k monthly unique readers to 40k). If this project is successfully implemented, then the metrics listed in their proposal will be surpassed as they grow their audience organically. They expect to generate more than 400 pieces of content around the Cardano ecosystem over the next 12 months. They expect to meet and possibly exceed these expectations if funded. Another indicator of success is growing the audience. On average, the Adapulse website has between 20k-25k unique readers monthly and about 150 views on each video uploaded to Adapulse on YouTube. Expanding the reach by doubling the viewership in the next 12 months would certainly be an indicator of success. The petitioner has clearly stated that the need for objective coverage of topics within the Cardano ecosystem is paramount. The solution proposed by the submitter is the extension of the independent media outlet Adapulse. The expansion of Adapulse clearly addresses these problems. A variant of this proposal was previously submitted in Fonds8 but did not meet the voting threshold to receive a subsidy. The current proposal will certainly do this.\n\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3308", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 560, "q0": "The problem statement of this proposal and the problem solution directly address the challenge question. Independent media coverage of the Cardano ecosystem is important for driving adoption and spreading awareness to new users. Many people in the Cardano community have noticed an anti-cardano bias in many crypto media outlets that have been spreading misinformation and biased opinions about Cardano. (For example: https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-cardano-s-july-hard-fork-prevent-ada-price-from-plunging-60) Therefore it is important that new users searching for information about the cardano ecosystem can find a wide verity of alternative and independent information sources. Much of crypto sentiment and investment dollars are driven by media narratives, and the impact of crypto media publishing cannot be understated.  Jeff with Swag stakepool and his team of contributors have already had a significant impact on the Cardano space with AdaPulse, and they have created a valuable resource for the community. Funding for future development and expanding their reporting will help to drive adoption. This initial funding will allow the AdaPulse platform to scale and reach more people as the ecosystem grows. As governance becomes more critical to the success of Cardano, truthful and objective media and education for Catalyst/Voltaire voters becomes more important for decentralized governance to thrive and to help voters to make well educated decisions. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team has already proven their competency and ability to deliver in the past, so it is very likely they will deliver on this proposals vision. I have been following the contributors listed in the proposal since the early days of Cardano, and have always appreciated the professional work they have contributed to Cardano.  They have been valuable contributors for a long time and it is important that Catalyst is able to fund quality work with a proven track record. I consider this proposal very low risk due to the teams proven experience, and the detailed budget and plan that is outlined with a realistic timeline. The risks the proposer has identified of employee turnover or lack of incentives will be mitigated by funding this proposal, therefore funding it is likely to result in successful delivery. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics for auditing this proposal are clearly defined in this proposal with a roadmap and clear timelines.

I strongly agree that such a solution is paramount to the community, and with scale, the solution will offer the community better and more reliable alternatives over current centralized outlets. As the number of Catalyst proposals continues to grow with each Funding round, and as we see our GitHub repositories grow with each passing week, the pieces are in place for this solution to scale and deliver a much needed resource to the community. A maturing ecosystem deserves a trusted and objective source of information to provide an alternative narrative where appropriate.  It's a point of frustration for me, personally, to not have a space where unbiased opinions are not welcomed, let alone uncelebrated. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information about the team reinforces that the team has a breadth of experience as users of the Cardano network, and applicable experiences as technical writers. The proposer communicates that the project has delivered on hundreds of objective articles covering Cardano year-to-date, provides links to their outlet, and also shares links to web blogs further showcasing their technical writing prowess. The budget seems more than reasonable and matches the ambitions of this challenge and the CArdano ecosystem. As outlined, the budget is concise and sufficient, and leaves me with a clear understanding of the items that the proposer will deliver on. The proposal details a clear and conductible plan that I believe makes it feasible for the team to deliver on the solution as outlined.

ISpecifically, the measures of success offer me adequate tools to evaluate the success of the project. Of note, the measures of success are tailored towards the end users of the content the team hopes to develop, and it reflects the team\u2019s character and their purpose that is to deliver content primarily for the Cardano ecosystem to consume. The team has many public channels through which their media content will be delivered, so it will be both easy and educational to track progress, with the benefits of doing so making each consumer a more mature member of our community.  With that said, the team did not include any measures related to retaining or onboarding content creators, and I do think it is an important way to measure their ability, not just to scale, but to sustain their model and solution.

At the core of the project is the adapulse.io portal, which has existed for just a year and has already established a certain reputation in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, I lack the connection to the Challenge Dapps, as it is not a specific blockchain Use Case. Even though there is no exact matching challenge for this project in this funding round, I still feel obliged to give deductions in the score towards projects that fit perfectly into the challenge. The stated rationale on this topic is not sufficient for me. Another weakness of the proposal is that it does not describe exactly how independence will be ensured. Yes, being independent from sponsors is important, but what about independence of opinion? Precisely because we are building a decentralized system, I think it is important to promote not so much individual content creators, but rather tools and platforms that enable decentralized content creation and promote decentralized reward models (at least as part of this challenge).

Given the size of the budget (over $222,000), I think it's important to not only list what's being done, but also lay out a justification for why each component is important and if there are alternative options as well.
