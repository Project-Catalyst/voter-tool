Furthermore, by working with, and setting an example for the New Zealand Government, this could be a successful pilot project and example for other countries or populations, such as native populations in Canada or the U.S. or anywhere in the world. This could potentially become a high profile example for the cardano community, and the world, of the power of decentralized digital identity and the cardano blockchain. As explained in the proposal \"Our people being able to prove who they are, via a means which is aligned culturally to them, is a crucial element of all future interactions aiming to restore trust; to instantiate indigenous human rights; and, with integrity, live up to the egalitarian image our country has acquired globally.\" this is an inspiring initiative that is directly aligned with the overall vision and ethos of Cardano. And most importantly, it is built by, and for, the Maori people, and is not a top down solution from industry or government. Therefore supporting this proposal could have significant implications for the widespread adoption and recognition of Cardano, and the new possibilities this technology enables. As the team has said in the proposal, their vision for success for this proposal is that:\n\"Tribal communities in Aotearoa (New Zealand) will have the ability to issue Tribal DID\u2019s that can be recognized by Government, institutions and organizations as an authoritative source of identity.\nIndigenous peoples around the world can also have their human rights honoured and do the same.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team already has built a functioning identity app, and after reviewing their website and the team involved it appears to be a highly qualified and capable team.

They have provided a summary and a detailed breakdown of the budget, which seems appropriate and reasonable. The budget is also linked to each phase which includes a specific timeline for delivery. They have committed to having one of their developers go through the Atala Prism Pioneer program, which may be sufficient for this project. However, if they have not already done so, I would also recommend the project team reach out to other experienced Prism developers and co-ordinate with the IOG prism team if possible, to insure they have covered any knowledge gaps with implementing Prism into their existing App. https://atalaprism.io/#meet-the-team ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has a very clear roadmap with milestones, delivery dates, and key performance indicators and outcomes for each milestone.

The proposer is looking at the problem of  Tribal identity systems that have been in place for some time now, not being recognized by governments, institutions, and centralized identity systems. The aim of this proposal is to resolve this issue by using Cardano with AtalaPrism SDK, to integrate DID wallet features into their Dapp called \u0100hau. The government has laid out what it requires for a DID, and the team now has the information they need to make Tribal identity systems that they government can accept. This is not the case in most places on the Earth currently, so this proposal literally has an increased chance of success.\n\nThis proposal could have a profound impact on the Cardano ecosystem as well as the Catalyst ecosystem in that, if this project is successful it will be one of the first use cases where Government accepts DID's from a blockchain, and specifically the Cardano blockchain.\n\nThe other key point here is that once this is up and working, it is very easy to scale out to any peoples anywhere in the world and allowing Cardano to be the blockchain of digital identity bringing with it integration of Cardano around the globe. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is a continuation of a project that has been in the works for many years now called \u0100hau. This project has proven itself over the years to be able to be successful at what it sets out to do. The proposal itself simply mentions that Dapp, and lists a few names of people and their roles in various organizations. Further down in the proposal we are given links to each individual person where we are able to get much more detail about each person and this is very important in determining if the team can take the funding provided and actually get the work successfully finished.\n\n\nOne part that is missing is how many people are on the team? Does the proposer have a firm understanding of the number of people it will take to accomplish this solution? These are things to consider to add into any new proposals that the proposer may create in the future. With that said, the information that is provided is fair in evaluating the feasibility of the proposal in that those who are mentioned are Co-founders of \u0100hau \u2013Tribal Identity DApp & Digital Legal Systems Lab, as well as Deputy Chair, Executive Council of Digital Identity New Zealand, as well as others showing that they have successes in the past and are capable of getting the work done. Furthermore they have been working on this for some time now and have been successful thus far.\n\nThe proposer has clear insight into what the potential risks are for this proposal and has listed them nicely and has provided ways to mitigate these risks. It is clear that the proposer has taken the time to really think things through clearly and look at all possible scenarios, and has also taken the time to find solution to any problems that may arise along the way.\n\nThis proposal has very well laid out timeline with milestones. There are 4 phases in the timeline, and each phase has very good details as to what will be accomplished during that phase. From this proposal it is clear that the proposer has really taken the time to sit down and work out what each step of the project will be, how long each part should take, and what completes a phase allowing them to move to the next phase. \n\nThe budgeting of this proposal is less then desirable in the image that is provided in the proposal, but the proposer has provided a link to a full break down of the budget. This full breakdown of the budget is highly detailed and very well done. Viewing this detailed budget covering everything we need to know as far as where the funding will go.\n\nWith everything in this proposal including the links, I agree that it is very highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully if voted in.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal has done an amazing job in the Auditability of the progress and success of the proposal. They have laid out a time line with milestones. Not only have they put all this down in amazing detail, but they have provided how they will keep the ecosystem up to date on each and every milestone of each phase that they go through. They have made mention of doing town halls, sharing via their project repo, and through the \u0100hau website. They have also laid out what the success of the project will look like and it is nice to read, so allow me quote:\n\" 1) Tribal communities in Aotearoa (New Zealand) will have the ability to issue Tribal DID\u2019s that can be recognised by Government, institutions and organisations as an authoritative source of identity.\n\n2) Indigenous peoples around the world can also have their human rights honored and do the same.\"\n\nThis has been one of the best proposals I have seen so far in my time assessing proposals.

Milestones are established and specific tasks to be done are listed. A clear roadmap makes it easy to track and check project progress.\nThe required budget is $352,800. My opinion. The required budget is reasonable given the complexity of the work and the duration of the project.

However, that value is limited to a pilot as there are no more than 1 million Maori registered in New Zealand (source: New Zealand government). I was doubting if the requested budget was justified for such a small demographic, but when looking at it from a pilot perspective, I tend to agree that the impact of introducing DIDs in collaboration with the government could prove useful as a precedent in the future.
