This is an excellent idea using cardano to lower the fees offered by other remittance providers. This project will definitely help the cardano ecosystem grow and help a lot of people get their money without the huge fees. The proposal offers two times lower fees than the current remittance platforms so I'd say that gives it a fair competitive advantage.\nIt's definitely in the right challenge as it will be a dapp essentially.

I managed to verify their skills mentioned and credentials with the links provided and as a developer I can verify the feasibility of their skills to get the project to it's successfull resolution.\nOne thing that's not ideal is the budget breakdown, because It is not detailed enough compared to many other proposal. For example no specific marketing breakdown is given which brings up the question why is the budget 5k and not 1k or 20k? This comment applies for the other mentioned sums as well. As a developer 10k for the frontend and 8k for the backend seems to low, but if that's the budget they're running with, I deffer to their experties in the DRC. More details is needed on budget spending.\nOther than that I have no more notes on the feasibility of the proposal. The team members are known and verified, there's a really good explanation video with a presentation and I'd recommend for all interested parties to have a look at the short video.
