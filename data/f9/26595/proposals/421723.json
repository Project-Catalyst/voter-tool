I have a certain doubt if the proposal fits with the objectives of the challenge, in a direct way. The problem identified here is the lack of a union of the proponents' community, a place where they can support each other, collaborate, promote work and solve problems. The solution would be to create a group called Colmeia dos Proponents, which would fill in all these gaps just mentioned. According to the authors of this proposal, the solution fits the challenge because \u201cThe Bidders Hive is, in its own right, a product that we believe will address some of the key issues for bidders (particularly, lack of a sense of community , lack of support and not knowing where to go with problems). But also, through its treasury, this proposal can stimulate the creation of new dApps, products and integrations that meet the needs of the proposers\u201d. In a way, it's true, but I think the challenge in which this proposal would align with harmony would be in \u201cCardano <3 DAOs\u201d, I could be wrong, but this group sounds like a DAO to me, since it's a set of people gathered around a common issue and what concerns Cardano. Despite this doubt, the proposal is still quite interesting. Proponents explain at length and in detail why this project is necessary: \u200b\u200boften proponents do not have time to follow official community meetings (for example Townhall - and we know that reading slides is a solution for when we cannot follow the meeting itself , but even so, it does not compare with the exchange of experiences and knowledge that is participating live). There is also talk of the problem that most of Cardano's commitments are geared towards the US and European time zones, so bidders who don't live in these regions always lose out. I believe that an excerpt that sums up well what would be done here is \u201cwe need several means, both formal and informal, for proponents to be heard; including through the places they already frequent (regional municipal councils, groupings led by proponents or even Ideascale). Proposers need to be able to quickly access small grants to build their own solutions to problems with the proposal process; they also need to be able to easily raise an issue with Circle and IOG when appropriate.\u201d It would be positive if the proponents explained better what would be the means used, informal and formal, it is said about Twitter and Ideascale itself, but could there be other communication bridges? Another positive point is that this work has already started, the proposal is being submitted by the Fund 8 Funded Proponents Sub-circle, that is, they are people who already have experience, have already held several meetings and some have worked on useful information - they provide the gitbook profile where we can confirm such information, for example. We have a lot of knowledge about issues that the group has already worked on (\u201destablishing a predictable date for the release of funds; including the relevant exchange rate in the release of funds announcements; starting the research on how it will be possible in the future to accept proposals in languages \u200b\u200bother than English\u201d, etc.). My only two doubts would then be about the project being submitted in the challenge of the dApps and not the DAOs and also how the dissemination by the members of the Colmeia, in their specific communities, would be done. However, the project is very important to Cardano and has had a very high impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very viable. All topics are adequately explained in great detail. We know exactly what the development process of this project would be like, the proponents first provide a general explanation of what they will continue to do - problem identification, dissemination and publicity (I believe that for the entire Cardano community, in general, and also for the more specific to some members, for example Alex in LATAM and etc). Funding would be carried out in relation to low-budget projects, according to the proponents, this would contribute to establishing a solid foundation among the class. We know what would happen in the 1 month period (\u201c1 month after funding: we will contact all existing bidders directly, in their own first (ideally) or second (if necessary) language, and let them know who to contact to raise We will be in regular contact with bidders and potential bidders in all major prefectures and other groups such as GimbaLabs, Swarm\u201d etc); as well as the same level of detail - very rich - is used to explain the activities of months 2, 3 and 4. So there's not much to comment here, in my view this script is perfect. Talking now about funding, the money is split into two parts; the first one is for the work of 8 people, who would be the leaders of the underrepresented regions (a suggestion: all these regions could be mentioned, so that we have a very solid view of how money is being distributed. The work of these leaders would be doing \u201ccontacting new and potential bidders; facilitating sessions such as after city councils; engaging in social media; problem detection and problem grouping; small bits of translation; attending Hive meetings and reporting; helping document things via Miro and GitBook.\u201d And the other half of the budget would go to the fund's Quick Treasury, which could be used to carry out translations, events to showcase the work of proponents, dReps, and many other cases that proponents comment on. very interesting information that could be given is in relation to how many small projects would this fund be divided into? a base amount to be shared (for example, could each project take up to 1000 dollars from this quick fund, etc?). Talking about the team, I think this project is totally in good hands, as the proponents are people who are extremely active in the Cardano community, in addition to being winners of other funding rounds. For example, Alex: \u201cCo-founder of LATAM Cardano Community helping to create impact inside and outside the Latin American ecosystem and host of LATAM TownHall, served as Community Advisor in F6 and F7, with high ratings in his reviews, vCA in F7 and won several funds for his proposals, such as: F6: Proposals Mentors Marketplace, F7: Easy Engagement - New Members -AIM, F7: LATAM TownHall by Catalyst Swarm\u201d. Vanessa is a \u201cFunded Proponent and part of the QA-DAO, where she leads the Catalyst Circle documentation\u201d. Emelia is part of the CATH community (Catalyst Africa Town Hall) and etc. We have many practical arguments for why we should trust them.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The topic of auditability is fine, but not ideal like the others. We know of a number of KPIs on progress, which are about partial results and are all based on numbers of \u201cmeetings held and documented, number of languages \u200b\u200bin which we created meeting summaries and page views of meeting documentation, issues detected and in progress.\u201d which communities, products created in the form of resources, tools, platforms, translations and events to support bidders, people involved through regional communities and contributing to problem detection (e.g. at \"regional\" City Hall meetings, etc. We would also need to monitor the activities carried out by each leader of the sub-regions, those that were detailed during the roadmap and emphasized in the financing part. Another point that I would like to have clarified is how these updates would be made, which channel of communication that would be used? Proposers certainly invest a lot in keeping their internal groups connected and engaged. ados - but how could this be done in relation to the whole, in the rest of the Cardano community? Overall, this part of the proposal is good, but not ideal. And success is defined as \u201csome key issues for bidders were addressed, and particularly that were addressed by bidder-led solutions and products; proponents know how to raise issues simply and quickly in their own communities; and proponents increasingly feel like a community, and have created events and spaces where they can collaborate\u201d. How can this scenario be perceived by the members of our community? What would be ideal, in my view, is for these subregional leaders to participate in a presentation at Townhall where they could expose what they would have done and what successes would have been generated from their work in these 4 months, such as in the In the case of Alex, did the LATAM community have its proponents better connected and engaged through the project? It would be essential for us to know how the quick investment fund would have been used, which projects would have been paid for, how many, how they are, how they meet the KPIs of the challenge: \u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d.

The problem with it is that there is nothing in our proposal that suggests we are a DAO or trying to be one; and also, the DAO challenge is about building tools to assist DAOs specifically with running themselves as a DAO, and that's not at all what our proposal is about. So this is only the PA's personal view, with no evidence to back it up (which the PA themself acknowledges, by saying \"I could be wrong... \").
