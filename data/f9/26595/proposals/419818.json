The genesis of Crypto and its apparent use cases demand substantial involvement of the individual to verify all actions, particularly messages which ask for fund transfer etc. Presently discord servers are used for positive identification of project members, however even there are fake discord servers which capture not-so-tech-savvy users and make them lose funds. The proposal presents a way to leverage the existing security infrastructure in the chain to issue immutable messages which can be repudiated. The project aims to build tools to help validate the source of a message and will help to mitigate rug pulls and future scams in a way that helps the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. The proposal\u2019s idea seems unique as far as I could see in Catalyst proposals. Therefore the proposal is in alignment with the challenge.

The lead proposer had been in the second cohort of the Plutus Pioneer program and the first cohort of the Atala Prism Pioneer program.

The proposal bids $35K as pay for the front-end developer for three months. There is no other cost breakdown. It is appreciated that the proposers are planning to hire the front-end developer since they have already built the backend infrastructure. The task is well laid out and explained in detail. The cost of 35K USD seems to be on the high side and the rationale for this has not been provided in the proposal. Overall the aim and the expected output of the proposal are clear and well defined.

The budget is simple, but clear and adds up to an hourly rate of 70-75 USD assuming normal working hours. This is a fair and reasonable  claim. The feasibility is deemed high, however one question is a bit unclear. It is stated that further funding is probably required in order to complete phase 2 & 3. Will the funds solely be used for phase 1, or will the development keep running until the funds are gone? Are the funds enough to complete phase 1 with confidence? These questions bring a bit of uncertainty to the feasibility of the proposal since it is hard for voters to know what they can expect of the proposal.

By creating a different web tool to verify the message's provenance, the author of this idea is offering assistance to solve this problem and prevent future frauds and rug pulls. The tool will assist users in finding the most recent information and news about the many projects they might be interested in learning about. Because the information is coming from a trusted source, it will be completely trustworthy. The solution has a significant impact, particularly in bringing transparency to the NFT ecosystem, but it falls short in terms of how it will handle the challenge's other needs. Although the author gives a brief overview of the difficulties the team may encounter, they are operations-focused rather than design- or architecture-focused, so I would like to give them a 4 out of 5 for impact metrics because, in my opinion as a reader, not enough groundwork has been done by the team to support the solution they are offering.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While the team pledges to show results rather than narrate the strategy, they make very little effort to do so. As a result, it is difficult for the reader to determine whether the team's method is feasible without knowing the team's intended approach. The team's financial division does not provide any compelling information regarding an effective budget breakdown or the team's action plan, which is another significant absence. Although the team members' experience is fairly outstanding, it is difficult to assess their level of expertise because they are not currently working on any other projects that have received funding. Additionally, the project is broken up into three phases, and the team intends to gather money for the following phases in the following rounds, demonstrating their systematic approach. However, on its own, that wouldn't be sufficient for the community to make firm assumptions about the likelihood of the team's implementation success in the first phase.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The KPIs certainly look acceptable for a proposal of this importance. Many crucial indicators appeared to have been overlooked for the lofty plan the proposer provides us with and the enormous funds needed. A few development metrics, like a project timeline and a separate domain to report progress, are provided by the proposer. These are undoubtedly helpful, but monthly or quarterly measurable metrics that are in line with the team's established milestones and also with the challenge's key metrics would have sufficed. The measure of success is also very quickly described in terms of the number of projects employing the tool and the number of test users involved, which may not fully represent the success of the proposal. However, I have to slightly disagree that the audit process would be enjoyable and fruitful given the metrics as they are currently established. Dainty more information regarding the KPIs, in my opinion, can definitely make this proposal a heavyweight in this challenge and earn full marks.

It suggests that there is currently a challenge that the Cardano community faces. This is difficulty verifying the identity or information of team members coming from new projects. The problem stated in the video presentation is that some malicious users may create an identical profile as a team member and trick users into sending them funds or other forms of dishonest activity. The proposed solution to this challenge is the team will create a web app that will send official announcements or information to the mobile device of a user. This will also be an on-chain project. Currently, there are very few on-chain projects that send the information to a mobile device. This proposal can bring a lot of utility to the Cardano community by promoting security and allowing users to receive secure information from their favorite projects. I would love to see this idea to grow and potentially have a global impact on the entire ecosystem.

So the entire project will take 12 weeks for completion. There is also a budget breakdown that is very simple. Essentially the entire amount of requested funds will be given to the front-end developer. I would suggest including more information in this section. Although it is rather simple. It may be more important to include specifics or try to put in more details rather than just a salary. Overall, there is a lot of information included and specific information in regards to the team, the roadmap, and the plan to include the on chain nft notifications.

It is important to note that the proposal includes specific information on each team member with their skills and experience. This is important because it helps audit the potential success of the proposal. The readers of the proposal need to ensure that the team has sufficient skills and make a decision based on specific information, how likely it will be implemented successfully. There are two principles that help audit this progress. The first is a mix between transparency from the team and an engaged community. Without an engaged community, there is no one that is following the project idea. The team needs to increase a loyal community by being transparent and building trust. Once this has been implemented, there is now a community that can hold the team accountable to their proposed idea. It would be a community that looks forward to receiving announcements and updates from a secure source and being notified on the cellular devices. I would suggest growing a community and promoting this proposal so that more people are familiar with what the team is trying to accomplish. It has the potential to benefit a lot of users in the community. However, there needs to be a way to audit the progress and potential success of this proposal.

By building an dApp (one of the three areas of this challenge), leveraging standards that already exist on chain to build an app to easily verify that a real team member sent the notification, as well as  building out tools to help validate the source of a message will help to mitigate rug pulls and future scams in a way that helps the Cardano ecosystem as a whole (Product and integration). This will be done through a web app as well as a mobile version of the app for iPhone and Android. \n\nThis proposal fully addresses the challenge while being more trust to the NFT space of the Cardano blockchain.
