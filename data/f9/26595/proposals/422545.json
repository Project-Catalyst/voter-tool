And so, this project has some steps to follow, the first of which, and the main focus of the project, is to create the final version of Mouseware, which is a gadget that PwDs can use to connect with computers, cell phones, etc. . The second step is to create platforms, marketplaces, more friendly to them.\n\n\nhe problem that this project tries to solve is the reduced access these people have to technology and, therefore, the reduced opportunities they face. This reduction in access is due to the difficulty of interacting with computers, smartphones, etc., and with Mouseware the proponents of this project say they will solve this gap. And to make it easier for them to join the blockchain, more user-friendly platforms will be built.\n\n\nThe main focus of the project, which is the final development of Mouseware, does not have much correlation with Cardano. It is an excellent and super important tool for the world in general, but it does not directly correlate with Cardano's goals, even because its creation, development and operation does not use anything from the blockchain. But, it is important to say that, in order to become the most used blockchain in the world, it must think of all people and, even with them, people with a disability. Therefore, there is a correlation of the secondary objectives with the challenge at hand.\n\n\nThe metrics and objectives of the proposal are all correlated with the integration of PwDs, making them feel capable of entering the world of technology, facilitating their access to computers, etc.\n\n\nThere was no detailing of a plan to be financially self-sustaining, however, I imagine that when Mouseware is being produced on a large scale, the financial resource will come from its sales. In addition, if the marketplace is implemented and NFTs are created, there may be a constant withdrawal of funds.\n\n\nI think the biggest risks associated are with the UI. Both the gadget and the promised platforms must be very well made and really have some differential, otherwise it will not be usable. Another important point is that a larger company manages to reduce the cost of a similar tool and you lose the market.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n\n\n1 \u2013 roadmap: Unfortunately, regarding the plan and roadmap, it lacks a lot of detail. Basically, ideas and wishes were presented but, in fact, the methods, times, deadlines, members were not presented, in short, the HOW to make it happen were not really presented. Therefore, as an improvement suggestion for this project, it would be important to add information regarding all the inherent processes to finalize the project. For example, when talking about \u201ccreating a PwD-friendly marketplace\u201d, what exactly is that? What are the innovations? How are you going to create this? Who will you need? What platforms will be used? methods? What functions can be performed concurrently? Finally, having more detail is crucial to know if the proposal is feasible or not.\n\n\n2 \u2013 budget: also missed more detail in the budget. The requested budget made for the macro tasks. However, it is important to detail the details of the development of each one. To exemplify, when talking about \u201csocial media marketing\u201d, which strategies, tools will be used (there are several paid tools nowadays, so it is interesting to add information about this).\n\n\n3 \u2013 team: Although the team is already producing the BETA version of Mouseware, the proposal is not just that. Two things are missing from this part: 1) proof of everyone's knowledge and know-how; and 2) a blockchain developer (without him, how will it be possible to create all the promised integrations?).\n\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: It was talked about some risks and some actions to mitigate them. However, there are still two main risks that have not been addressed: a) competition: There is nothing talking about a patent and, therefore, there may be a multinational that \u201ccopyes\u201d the project and manages to reproduce it at a lower cost, which will do with which she wins the market; and b) User interface/experience: it is very important to be careful with this part because that is what makes the project different, both in terms of the gadget and the integration. If the user does not feel 100% comfortable using the proposed tools, it will be impossible to gain scalability.\n\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: There was no mention of strategies for monetization. However, as they are selling a physical product, I think the plan is to take it out of the sale. However, we do not have access to the costs of production, development, distribution and training to be able to verify whether or not it is viable to sell for USD 200.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: As already mentioned, the detailed plan is missing a bit of detail, with no intermediate checkpoints so that we can follow the development of the project. Therefore, adding intermediate development steps would enrich the project and allow us to have a more accurate view of the steps taken.\n\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: Metrics are good for tracking the development of the main tool. It would be interesting to add to this project some metrics that measure/track the development and engagement of PwDs with the cardano blockchain, whether creating NFTs, creating their SPOs, etc. It would be interesting to have these metrics also focused on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: It was not provided any channel in which we can follow the news and development.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Love the way the analysis been done. 1)However would like to mention that primary goal here is to integrate PWDs into web 3 and not just about Mouseware ,even though it is intergyral, cause we can strategically partner with various hardware devices in future. 2) This will uplift Cardano community in terms of credibility and new users since it will be the first to onboard this initiative on helping these PWDS. 3) We have a solid block chain developer Sangeet from konma,(https://www.linkedin.com/in/sangeet-muralidhar/) Our marketing advisers Dhruv has already worked on Huge NFT movie releases (https://vistaverse.io/team/)  4) *In terms of milestone our first month will be creating digital asserts using Dr,nonita and creating UI/Ux of the marketplace, * second month will be finishing the genesis collection and onbording more PWDS to have training, while we work on the smart contract for the market place and marketing. * 3rd month will be launching the beta type marketplace to test the useability and  advancing our mouseware functions. 4) https://yourstory.com/2021/11/iit-madras-startup-wearable-device-computers-smart-devices/amp we are a wholistic team which have experience in selling, development and execution."}, {"id": 3577, "q0": "This proposal would enable partially disabled people to create NFTs and possibly be an active part of the blockchain ecosystem through the creation of assets. This would enable them to have some income and a chance for a better life. I think this is a great proposal that would definitely have an impact on all those people. The device will provide complete acccess to perform all comuter and smartphone operations, and thus helping the users to be more independant.\nThere are quite a lot of people working on this product and the authors have already 25+ virtual and physicalk pilots diverse (testers). This is great since integration is always a big part of any product be it software or otherwise. As a devleoper I really ro appreciate the level of preperation and the effort put into this proposal because it shows it's done with a lot of care and diligance.\nI think this is an amazin proposal with decent KPIs and metrics. It will absolutely address the challenge and is aligned with the challenge settings. It's impact as metntioned will be lifechanging for a small group of people.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I managed to vefify all the team members listed in the proposal and can verify they do have the necessary skills to pull this off. I am a developer so I can only concur the skills of the developers, but that's something. I have been a part of a company where we did 3d lims and such and I know how much our help is appreciated in order for people with disabilities of all types to be integrated into society. It's a technical world out there and if products aren't build with this in mind, they become really hard to use. That's part of the reason I like this proposal and the team behind it the whole project is more credible.\nThe budget seems reasonable and the rates per hour seem between the recommended bounds so no worries there. The specified timeline seems feasible at least from a development stand point and the whole project is really well done and concise.\nThe proposers could have gone into a bit more technical detail on the specific frameworks that would be used, because I do have some knowledge of these things and could assess the whole project better if they had. I can see the people have put a lot of effort into making a minimal viable product and that also brings the credibility and feasibility of the project up quite a bit.\nIn summary this is a really necessary proposal and I hope it get's the necessary endoursement. Good luck to the proposers.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Twitter and is a good medium to keep your community informed and the metrics listed seem good enough to keep every interested party informed. The metrics will serve to track and optimize the process down the line. The rodmap is good enough to get the main idea and progress steps of the proposal.\nThere's a clear problem stated and a reasonable solution to help so kudos for pushing out the solution and fighting fot automation and integration.

That is, assuming they still have motor control of head and neck movement.\n\nBut when it comes to impact as it relates to Catalyst, the connection to Cardano is loose.\n\nWhile the primary objective of this proposal is to create a hardware device, the author also states their desire to \"create an inclusive & participative marketplace or DAO.\"  It's not clear why, in addition to the already enormous task they are trying to solve with the device, the team also wants to go through the hassle of also creating a marketplace or DAO (2 completely different models, with no clear selection or comparison) vs. using an existing one of the many that are already operating.\n\nThe opportunity to grow the Cardano community to include an underserved community of disabled persons is attractive, and align loosely with the Dapps, Products, and Integrations challenge as it relates to marketplaces/NFT projects.  However, I'm undecided if the strategy for this proposal, including art directors and \"NFT experts\" is the right approach to building on the community's strengths.  Between Soulful, Dextraverse, Mouseware, and Konma (the many brands/busiensses mentioned in this proposal) I feel like it's trying to do a lot.  And I'm undecided on how concentrated the impact will be as a result - therefore maintain a neutral rating on this proposal.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Without the marketplace element, the mission of this proposal (i.e. helping disabled people to sell NFT artwork) can be accomplished immediately without the requirement for an $82,500 USD investment - using the teams existing hardware.  In that case, the project could be accomplished by simply providing training or orientation for users of the hardware on how to create artwork (I guess this is the main challenge?) and set up a wallet to connect to a marketplace and mint NFTs.\n\nThe team descriptions are present, but the timeline is not well defined except by the budget allocation for team roles as it relates to runway.  And even though they mention that it's a DAO, there is no comment about any open source work.  In fact, the primary metrics defined in this proposal for progress are based on the number of artwork created by their customer.  A stronger argument would be to present targets for new wallets or onboarding users to the ecosystem.\n\nFinally, the proposal makes the comment that the project will require no additional funding in the future, and that revenue generation models include sale of hardware from their existing business activity - meaning there is no commercial model for the DAO or marketplace proposed, or how it benefits the sustainability of this initiative.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The primary parameter for success defined by this proposal - distribution of the teams existing hardware device - is essentially unrelated to the basis for the proposal, which is an NFT marketplace.\n\nThe further mentioned parameters of capability, equality, and acceptance of disabled persons, are all very subjective measures of success that no auditor would reasonably be able to accomplish on a global skill as it relates to this teams efforts over the course of months.\n\nThe auditability measuring factors, as presented, may provide some insight into the activity of this projects team towards serving the disabled community, but I'm still neutral on the overall ability of auditors to define success since the projects efforts are widely varying between existing businesses and efforts.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2517", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "1) this will uplift cardon community in terms of traction since it will be the first to onboard this initiave on helping these PWDS.40,000 people/year lose their upper limbs and 85% live without any solution. we can not only help them with daily usage such as ordering food or calling we can create confidence by integrating them into Cardano or web 3 ecosystem. 2) Dr,nonita https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-nonita-gangwani-201b0b187/  praveen: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravin-kumar-332882189/ , 3) in terms of milestone In terms of milestone our first month will be creating digital asserts using Dr,nonita and creating UI/Ux of the marketplace, * second month will be finishing the genesis collection and onbording more PWDS to have training, while we work on the smart contract for the market place and marketing. * 3rd month will be launching the beta type marketplace to test the userbility and parally advancing our mouseware functions. 4) we could use exsisting market place but by creating a custome designed UX/UI ( Pwds friendly) they will get a better learning curve and gain confidence to explore other platforms too. 5) https://yourstory.com/2021/11/iit-madras-startup-wearable-device-computers-smart-devices/amp  our device has been feature in reputed platforms too."}, {"id": 6052, "q0": "The idea of this proposal makes a lot of sense for people with disabilities to have access to blockchain technology.

I recommend adding a specific time period, be it quarterly or monthly.\nBudget breakdown in my opinion is not detailed, there are jobs that need more description like Market place development \u2013 $20000.

For typing, the proposal uses speech with self writing software. \nBy applying this proposal to the blockchain space, many new users who were not able to use blockchain could enter the space. This would bring great value to the Cardano network, as the network would be the given choice for people with disabilities at a low cost for the user.

The most important being integrating people with disabilities to blockchain and promote asset creation such as developing web 3 projects and minting NFTs. \nThe proposers have taken a number of challenges into account.
