This proposal is one of the three proposals regarding the same product suite (the other two products are Global Cannabis Listing Platform and Supply Chain 4 Legal Cannabis/Hemp). I assess that this individual product may have the second higher impact on the use of the Cardano blockchain among the three proposals. The immutable record is one clear use case for using the blockchain. The proposer gives informative metrics to show that the cannabis market is sizable ($80 billion globally) and growing. This app is right now a non-blockchain IOS app, but if it could be repositioned to run on Cardano, it may meet the requirement of a DApp, thus it will meet the goal of this challenge by contributing to the Cardano app ecosystem. I would recommend the proposer improve the risks and mitigation section, as currently, it is generic to all three proposals. The risks to implement a decentralized grading app should not be completely the same as the risks to build a centralized marketplace or supply chain tracking.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other two proposals in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals share a large portion of content] I agree that this proposal is feasible. The fact that the proper already has the app built-in IOS (non-blockchain) demonstrates the proposer's preparation and understanding of the business model for this grading app. The real question is if this model changes now that the proper has decided to make it into a DApp and how they will go about implementing it. The proposer provides the roadmap, requirements, and milestones for all three proposals, and it makes it more difficult for me to assess the feasibility of this individual proposal. I would suggest the proposer provide one more level of implementation concerning each individual proposal of the three ones in Fund9. For example, the implementation plan and technical requirements to build this grading app must be different from those to build the marketplace. For the budget, I have the same comment as in the other two proposals that the daily rates appear to be high, especially for the project manager role,\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other two proposals in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals have similar shortfalls] The proposal is auditable as a final product, but not so along the process. While the success is well defined (a functioning Web3 mobile app with four key features), the proposer is missing (1) quantitative metrics for the features; and (2) a roadmap and milestone for this individual proposal. Right now, the roadmap provided is for all three sibling proposals in Fund9. The proposer states that each of the three proposals \"can be completed without either or both of the others\". If it is the case, the community should be able to audit each proposal individually. A breakdown of the roadmap that comprises components for each proposal is therefore recommended.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5953, "q0": "Bringing Hemp Grading and provenance to the blockchain makes immediately sense to me as both industries are exposed to stigma and regulatory roadblocks. Legislation that varies dramatically even inside countries from state to state, and the perception of illegal use cases representing both industries as a whole have limited the entrepreneurs and financiers operating in both industries to bold, independent and visionary \"mavericks\". The \"mainstream\" is catching on and both industries have seen their share of booms and busts. I assume that there is a significant overlap in end-users of both industries' services, and also portfolios invested in both industries. Creating a strong real world use case in making grading processes that are currently cumbersome, somewhat localized, and prone to forgery and data loss more efficient by creating a global, immutable and trustless protocol on the Cardano blockchain is a win-win for both industries. This proposal has ambitious scope and plans to onboard established companies of the entire cannabis supply chain.

The highly experienced and established cannabis market proposers have teamed up and also contracted a suitable Plutus and Cardano (ex-IOHK) expert and front-end developers to make this project a reality. The main risk I see in implementing this proposal is that it is highly dependent on the availability of the Plutus developer. The proposal acknowledges this risk factor, but I have would have liked to see some more information on the mitigation strategy and wording that would suggest that this issue has indeed been contemplated deeply and not just added for completeness as it currently sounds more like a standard clause.\n I agree that it is highly like that successful implementation is possible, with or without funding of the other 2 proposals submitted by the proposers.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This proposal includes valuable steps that will be taken to give feedback to the community, for example challenge team members, and also social media channels to communicate with the community as a whole. The project work will be arranged as sprints and at least three established legal entities will be working together, which should go a long way to formalize the project management and reporting of deliverables.

There are problems with the control of pesticide use, the accuracy of the nutrient solution, the storage temperature, or the hygiene measures that must be followed.\nFor example, the manager and cultivator of a cannabis farm will verify and record on the blockchain the dose of nutrients or the amount of pesticides used; and blockchain will validate processes as they happen so that crop care is monitored throughout all stages of its lifecycle to verify results and product authenticity.\nOne of the biggest potentials for cannabis is that Cannabis has long been identified by genetic crosses whose origins are not always entirely clear, as well as by strain names drawn from the culture. massization.

All this would be done by Cardano native tokens on Cardano blockchain. This makes this app interesting to say the least, combining Cardano and cannabis/hemp has a nice potential as it would not only be used by end customer, but it will be used by everybody involved in the production.

There have been some interesting starts out there, a few insightful efforts, but for the most part, actual track and trace is waiting for high level industry standards around Atala (we are talking years of CIPs, etc....it is a game of patience).\n\nI don't know if I just somehow missed them in this space, but this consortium of proposers (3 proposals I know of in Fund 9 describing 3 independent (but integrated) cannabis technology solutions) has presented an ethos across their projects that seems to combine great insight into the potential of the technology, with real in-the-field insight into industry needs, within the context of decentralized community and shared experience.  In other words, I think this could be the first that really delivers.\n\nThis proposal specifically deals with an underrated and low hanging fruit in the industry, which is certification standards, and a dApp/protocol for businesses to onboard themselves and reap the benefits that certification can provide in highly competitive markets.  As a boutique aeroponic grower with hyper-specialization in seasonal and niche strains and advanced facility technology, I have to rely on deep relationships cultivated over long periods with my buyers to establish trust and validate my pricing and marketing.  When new distributors and manufacturers that could benefit from my product set up in my vicinity, I'm looking at years before we have our markets in sync, with one or both of us taking bottom line hits to develop our relationship (the days of \"just trust me\" are pretty much over).  What is missing is trustless third party verification, and unlike seed-to-sale, this is something the industry can implement without needing permission from regulatory bodies (does it need to inform, integrate with and account for regulation, yes.  But this is an area where regulators are practically begging the industry to help themselves).\n\nThe certification standards presented here, and the protocol they are introducing already appears to be quite robust and well defined, and this looks entirely like just the development of the front and backends to get this into users hands.  Their points about user-value can't be understated, certification is a HUGE benefit to consumable commodities, and opens up markets significantly.  Just for my business, it would shorten or eliminate the trust-chain needed to properly locate high value product on the retail floor, as well as maintain high internal standards for deciding where the cutoffs are for sending batches to manufacturing facilities rather than risking brand erosion from edge cases making it to retail (data would be tremendous here).\n\nOne side note, mostly for the proposer, it is unclear what parts of this project will be opensource, but presumably the standards they are building on and had a hand in creating are open source...it would be great if users could inform the consensus protocols around updating the standards documentation, and Web3 is ideally suited for this.  Especially when it comes to innovation in a sector that is rapidly ossifying towards financialization, providing space for innovators to be heard is critical.  I work closely with cultivators specializing in aeroponics, zero-waste, and freeze drying technologies, all in the name of whole-flower, full-profile products in the context of a holistic understanding of the consumer biome...  its a mouthful, but part of that is because this kind of innovation doesn't enjoy any standardization.  The ability to contribute in an opensource way to standards is the key to continue to capture the pioneering spirit of this great industry, and the healthy communities it should be in service to.\n\nBecause this proposal lays out a critical use case in an underserved industry that is primed for heavy adoption of blockchain on multiple fronts, I believe this proposal merits a full 5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal does a fantastic job breaking down the protocol implementation, as well as providing references for the edges of the protocol, such as the documentation on standards (which this dApp will be reliant on) and the use of on-chain technology like NFTs (which this dApp will need to work with to integrate to wider seed-to-sale solutions).  It can't be underestimated that in the big picture, being able to provide a tool for wholesalers and retailer (as one example) that is interoperable and portable to retailers and end consumers is a key piece of the whole supply-chain value-conundrum for commodities.  Even though the consumer is my final validation on my product, I don't have the option of communicating with them, but through tools like this, critical certification data can be in that final DID or NFT, and it will allow that consumer experience to work back through the chain and affect, via data or even direct feedback, my ability to create a better product.  To this end, the simplicity of what they are describing will definitely help them realize the outcomes they are targeting.\n\nThe budget is clearly laid out, and the team is described in full.  I really appreciate that the team has such a professional setup for the business side of things, while still maintaining that sense of web3 and community...the industry desperately needs these principles to gain share.  I didn't see any overlap between this proposal and their other two, and I fully expect that it will not be affected if the others are not funded.\n\nBecause the milestones and architecture for this project are so clearly described, and because the team shows experience and insight at every level, I believe the foundation for Feasibility is very solid here.  And because the multi-proposal efforts of this proposer are not interdependent, I see no reasons to reduce the feasibility score.  5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones list doubles as a KPI list for monthly deliverables, and for describing the progress of the proposal, but just to be sure, the team describes progress metrics in auditability as well that will really help pin down their reporting and show where they are on the roadmap.\n\nThe success metrics should be able to be collected within a few months of delivery of the final milestone for the dApp release, and the timeline allows for the space to collect this data.  Because they will be onboarding during the rollout, as well as communicating regularly with the community, I think the successful completion of the project is something described here in an actionable way, as I believe they will have many growers ready to put the work through its paces.\n\nBecause the team has proven to be transparent and accessible, and because they have provided adequate metrics for both the progress and success of the project, I feel that a full 5 stars is warranted for auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15251, "q0": "Cannabis is a psychoactive substance from the Cannabis plant.
