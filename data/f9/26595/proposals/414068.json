However in Cardano there exists no dapp that specializes in funding and most importantly the process of redeeming such NFTs.", "f6_no_assessments": 10, "f6_rating": 4.466666666666668, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1594, "q0": "The idea is focused on a very current and relevant problem in the community today: the lack of interfaces and valuable projects that are related to NFTs. The problem, according to the proponents, is that there is no \u201cdedicated launchpad to support the marketing and launch of these innovative NFT offerings, many projects will fail to gain traction and awareness within the Cardano community and receive funding and technical support.\u201d The proposed solution then would be precisely to create this platform, whose one of the pillars would be to support digital assets, as mentioned: PwE games, virtual metaverse products, etc.; in real-world assets such as tokenized properties, luxury items, etc. Therefore, the creation of this platform would support the launch of physical products that merge the real world with the digital, according to the proponents, allowing artists, creators and organizations to tokenize assets. A positive point mentioned here is that no coding knowledge would be required for the projects to be carried out. There would also be initial funding, I believe, to drive the development of projects, partnership with NFT Minting services, such as NFT-Marker.io Pro, taking advantage of tested and scalable APIs, so that such functionalities can be incorporated into Dapps programmed from from there. The idea is quite complex, and in order for us to have a better understanding of what would be developed, the proponents report an example of craft beer token creation, which is very positive for the proposal's readers to have a better understanding of the what is being thought. Proponents are still aware of what risks they may face in product development, such as security traps, prohibited items, and logistics. With this, a lot of maturity and preparation is demonstrated to face the difficulties of the project. Overall, I believe that the proposal is highly aligned with the objectives of the challenge, as it will provide new functionality for minting NFTs, perhaps thus attracting new users to the Cardano ecosystem, artists, companies that wish to create digital assets from their products. and etc; at the same time, a new type of support will be provided for those already running this coinage on the Cardano blockchain. That is, the number of active community members can certainly increase, and perhaps even the amount of Ada in circulation, along with new smart contracts, can be intensified. And, finally, I believe that the points that will be better addressed and that are present in the summary of the challenge are those about integrations that improve what already exists, that is: \u201cincrease the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When we analyze the proposal script, we notice that the temporality is divided into quarters, each of which has a series of activities listed, as can be seen in the example: \u201c2022 Q4: (development): Final release details of first NFT offering on Launchpad + Deploy NFT Launchpad on Testnet + Open NFT Launchpad Testnet platform for Alpha testers + Gather feedback from testers and improve\u201d. From the way this script is presented, we can have a good understanding of what would be done, but we don't quite understand how or when. For example, in Q3 2022, we know that the web app and UI would be created; as well as launchpad backend development; communication with the craft beer company would also be established (the first item in which they would generate a digital token), details would be defined such as the flavor and composition of the beer on which the NFTs would be supported for their creation... that is, we have many and many activities defined for these 3 months. I think a little more detail would be interesting. For example, what exactly would happen in October, within these various activities? What would the web application development process look like, who would work here, and for how many hours per week? How would the characteristics of beer be defined? Would there be any public surveys? I think it would be interesting if more detail had been given for each of the actions to be taken. The project is complex and involves several stages, several initiatives, but even so it is necessary that everything is well explained. Talking about the costs, now, they are asking for approximately 70 thousand dollars. The value is explained a bit superficially, in my opinion. We know that for example, $30k would be earmarked for Launchpad backend development (10k per month). But as I mentioned earlier in the script analysis, it is not clear what would be the work routine of the programmers who would be involved here. Thus, we do not know the value of your working hour, so we are not able to define whether the chosen values \u200b\u200bwould be fair or not. 8 thousand dollars are set aside for marketing, however, how would this campaign be carried out? At no time is it said which strategies would be launched, how advertisers, designers and all those involved in this campaign would act. The team, in turn, is the part that is most suited to viability, in my opinion. We know a lot of information about those involved, such as their names, linkedin profiles, which areas of professional activity and very detailed biographies about what they have done so far in their careers. All this information conveys a lot of confidence in preparing the team to successfully execute the project. Therefore, I believe that the proposal is viable, with only a few improvements to be made.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The partial results can be measured through some achievements defined by the bidders, the first being \u201cthe completion of the first tokenized NFT initial offering and the level of engagement it receives from the community\u201d; after \u201cnumber of physical assets that were tokenized on the Cardano blockchain using our service and also the response from the Cardano community (if they were well received, all were sold, was the redemption process easy etc)\u201d; and finally by the \u201cvariety and number of companies, creators and artists issuing NFTs on our launch pad will also be another measure of success\u201d. Proponents aim to encourage traditional companies to generate digital tokens from their products. I believe that these indicators are excellent for realizing if the partial results were being achieved, but apart from that, it would also be important, in my view, for us to know how the process of development of the phases would be. In other words, were the steps being carried out as planned? The activities delegated for each quarter would be happening in the expected time, how could we ascertain what would be behind such partial results? I believe that it would be very important for us to have these concepts very well defined and explained, so my suggestion is for the team to provide some kind of monitoring of work routines for the Cardano community. Some projects use gitbook sprints, but social media updates could also be provided, for example. The important thing is to maintain an active communication channel with the members of our ecosystem. Speaking of end-results and the success scenario, that would be when there is a \u201cwell-adopted and engaging platform with dozens of successful NFT offerings completed and also an active community built around Discord and social media that is engaged and engaged.\u201d using Dapp\u2019s funding and redemption features to support exciting NFT launches and redemption of cool physical assets and items.\u201d I believe what was left pending here would really be a more direct and sensitive analysis of the impacts of the project on the Cardano community. How can we prove that this platform has increased the number of active members of our community, such as companies that decided to generate tokens on Cardano? How did our blockchain become better known and respected, how did people come to understand the possibilities that the cryptographic world can offer from this campaign? In my opinion, auditability is not bad, but it is still very focused on results, and not on monitoring the processes, and important issues were absent here, so some reformulations are accurate.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6640, "q0": "The value proposition behind this proposal is very straightforward - building a platform tailored for artists, and generally creators, that can support them in the process of launching and redeeming asset backed NFTs. The first experiment will be a partnership with a craft beer enterprise in launching a tokenized beer NFTs backed by the actual bottles. \n\nThe subject of NFTs is definitely a polarizing one within crypto enthousiast communities, and the technology gets its fair share of both love and hate. Nevertheless, you don\u2019t have to be an NFT maximalist to realize that, from an ecosystem perspective, there are no downsides to building such a platform, on the contrary, the development costs can be perceived as purchasing a \u201ccall option\u201d on the NFT ecosystem and betting on its development. \n\nThere is also fairly low competition within the Cardano ecosystem for such a tailored service, and being amongst the first to capitalize on the area can be a great business move, and I believe the proposal definitely has a strong merit and connects very well with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers have done a good job at describing the roadmap of the entire project. The work is already underway (applying for funding, liaising with potential breweries). The team behind the proposal seem to be well positioned to deliver on such a project. They have extensive bios presented in the relevant section, and it would take a significant amount of time for anybody wishing to go through their entire list of past projects, gitbook libraries and general background checks. The technical team is also complemented by a compliance advisor who can most likely keep them out of trouble.  \n\nAn excellent point of the proposal is that they have done an absolutely solid piece of work in identifying and planning for risks that can affect their development. It is by far the most extensive work in this area from all the Fund 9 proposals that I have read, and can definitely be used as a good practice model by other teams. So at least from this point of view, there are very few areas where the team can get blind-spotted by external developments beyond their control.\n\nThe team has also set aside a significant portion of the budget for a third party audit (13k USD, performed by Certik), and this is a very good tactical decision. Let me explain why, while offering a bit of context. In case you don\u2019t know, IOG has recently released a video outlining the future of Cardano dapps, especially offering details regarding how their security would influence the way in which the dapps will be displayed on the upcoming dapp store. This highlights Cardano\u2019s increased focus towards greater security, and the fact that this proposal sets aside a very significant portion of the budget for a third party certification is definitely an advantage over other dapps which will soon have to compete for \u201cprime space\u201d within a dapps marketplace where being certified will matter a great deal. \n\nI perceive the budget as a rather weak spot of the proposal, and let me tell you why. The majority of the budget (with few exceptions) is constructed per person (for instance 2 x 15k USD for a back end dev, 18k USD for a full stack dev). The budget would have been greatly improved if we had at least a rough estimation of the hours necessary for the most important tasks, as well as hourly rates applicable. In the given circumstances, the information we have (total budget per person and period of time for which it is applicable) is not sufficient to assess the reasonableness of the budget, since we do not know whether the team members will be working full time or not exclusively for this proposal.  \n\nThe proposers also expect the project to be financially sustainable following launch through exclusively the fees generated. A great addition to the budgetary details would have been the inclusion of some simple financial models to back up this claim, or at least a brief explanation in words to offer us a flavor on how the fee model will work. Will it be a flat fee, percentage based, success based? Will the partners be sensitive to the pricing considering they can also decide to internalize this NFT launch competency? Any kind of information exploring these topics would have been very informative to argue for the project\u2019s financial future.\n\nOverall a well deserved five star feasibility rating, with minor(ish) improvement points in the budget section and demonstrating long term financial sustainability.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team behind the proposal is well positioned to keep the Cardano community informed. They already have Telegram / Discord / Medium / Twitter own channels, and they have pledged within the proposal to offer non-tech updates via these mediums, while the tech updates would come via bi-monthly reports.\n\nThey are also doing a good job at defining relevant performance indicators and what success looks like for the project. The project\u2019s short term success will be measured through the community\u2019s response to the initial NFT launch (completion levels, engagement levels, redeemed NFT levels and trading volumes following launch) while the long term success will be gauged through their partners\u2019 desire to opt for additional token offerings and number of physical assets tokenized. \n\nSo again, five stars, since I am sure that the team can deliver great transparency for the Cardano community when implementing this project.

With experience in developing and implementing blockchain & NFT related projects since 2019, this project is convincing enough to enter the Cardano ecosystem. arguments, demonstrations of clear, specific and attractive solutions with different methods make participants see many benefits when using them.

The proposer stated that NFTs backed by assets is an exciting new area of NFT utility. However in Cardano there exists no Dapp that specializes in funding and more importantly the process of redeeming such NFTs. This results in many projects failing to gain traction, awareness within the Cardano community and receive funding as well as technical support. As much as I agree with the hypothesis, I believe the solution is relevant and adequately addresses the challenge. In detail, the team intends to develop an NFT Launchpad Dapp that handles all of the aforementioned issues while also adding value to the Cardano ecosystem's existing infrastructure and tech stack. The concept is intriguing, and it is followed by a section devoted to a detailed step-by-step plan for carrying out such a project. The author discusses the impacts of this concept, so we understand how it works and how it contributes to the growth of the ecosystem. Overall, I strongly believe that this solution effectively addresses this issue.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the information provided, it appears that this plan will be implemented successfully. The proposer has experience in backend and frontend development, software, etc. All of this would provide the team with strong fundamentals for carrying out the project. There is a timeline that explains the steps that will be taken, which I agree is realistic. I believe it covers the capacity required for the stated goals; they have also defined quarterly milestones that are reasonable and clear. The proposer also goes into great depth to describe the technical aspects of his idea, and he does it admirably. The team and effort are carefully defined, and they are in line with the required budget. The requested budget is comprehensive, explaining how capital will be spent. It is apparent that development costs will be focused. I would have preferred to have additional details presented to make it clearer the budget and the proposal in general. For example, how many hours per month will be devoted to Dapp marketing, and how many individuals will be committed to this role? How many developers will work on the backend and frontend, and will they be paid the same hourly rate? How many individuals are included in the budget in total? A $500 team expense is also a concern to me. It would be helpful to be given more information about this element, namely what tasks it covers. Similarly, I anticipate that certain costs will be higher than those mentioned in the plan. For example, the team estimates that Staking Platform Interface / Graphics professionals would earn roughly $3000 in two months. To the best of my knowledge, the market compensation for this job now is around $3300 per month. With a particular working hour, I could have evaluated whether or not the wage is appropriate.

From now on, users can buy physical products directly with crypto currency without having to convert to fiat currency, which helps users protect their privacy. Enterprises also have an additional potential product marketing channel when they list their tokenized products on launchpad. This benefits both customers and businesses. And ofcourse, when businesses tokenize their products and sell them to customers, that will contribute to an increase in the number of Cardano users as well as an increase in the number of transactions on the blockchain. Mapping physical assets to the NFT and allowing customers to redeem for real wold products makes people realize the true value of the NFT, not just inflated virtual assets. The metrics and goals they give are also very clear and inline with the challenge.

They have foreseen the risks and challenges of implementing the project including regulation risks related to which assets are allowed to be tokenized in different countries, which products are prohibited and illegal to import into countries, as well as the risk of shipping the goods to NFT holders when they want to redeem their tokens. They also have a legal advisor to prepare for those risks, it can be seen that they are very well prepared for this project.

This brings a quantitative measurement for the community to make clear judgments.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4071", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14612, "q0": "Proposal has discovered a potential problem in NFT technology that has not yet been exploited and developed by anyone. Tangent provided a solution to the exchange-related problems to support the marketing and launch of real-world assets and digital assets while complementing the Cardano ecosystem infrastructure. Proposal describes in great detail the potential audience they are targeting, which is extremely important for developers to focus on the project. Proposer mentions that Cardano is currently the third-largest NFT blockchain by volume, which will be a potential market as more and more people are interested in it, especially those institutions and creators who want to launch innovative NFT startups project. The proposal provided an easy-to-understand NFT Offering case study: Tokenized Craft Beer. Case studies have clear figures. At the same time, Tangent NFT Launchpad also provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use their Tokenized in exchange for a real asset (Craft Beer). I appreciate this description, it helps someone who doesn't know anything about NFT Launchpad to understand how it works and the benefits it brings. The proposal refers to Tangent having a good financial plan for long-term future growth from the fees generated from launching NFTs on the platform. Tangent NFT Launchpad ensures more safety in the Cardano ecosystem because before being offered for sale, the token is always tested and listed for trading by Launchpad-enabled exchanges and audited by reputable companies.\nIn the risk analysis and solutions to overcome it. I appreciate the proposer's view of the problem from a macro perspective and knowledge. The risk analysis in this project required a large multidisciplinary knowledge of security; Political Economy; logistics manager \u2013 transport\u2026 and proposer did a great job.\nProposer has raised risks that reasonably prevent the project from succeeding, but the solution to overcome the risks has not been described in detail. For example, in the prohibited item trap, the proposal mentioned that some items are prohibited from being imported into the countries (It is prohibited to transport alcohol to a Middle Eastern nation). It would be perfect if the proposer could provide a list of prohibited items and/or countries with import restrictions. This is an essential document for Tangent NFT Launchpad partners.\nIn addition, the proposal addresses the issue of Tangent, is not a logistics firm and do not wish to operate a distribution center with the related overhead expenses. That would probably inadvertently limit the huge number of Cardano users. I suggest that the proposer might consider working with a third-party shipping partner that will solve the problem if organizations/creators/artists can't provide \u201cafter sale\u201d logistical support.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Proposal provides a detailed plan, including timelines and milestones that are clear and logical. The actions marked done/doing are all important documents for future work. The work planning every three months helps to have a basis for assessing the progress of completion. Proposal also mentioned how it will accomplish those things including technology issues, programming, and cooperation with related partners.\nIn budget analysis, the team highlights the costs in a specific period for each of the different expenditures. The costs listed in the proposal are reasonable and closely linked to the detailed plan. However, for the marketing expense part, it would probably be more perfect if the proposer provided an additional advertising plan to go with it.\nProposal has provided an impressive list of Tangent NFT Launchpad participants. The members have a perfect academic background. All have many years of experience working in technology companies (for positions requiring technical expertise such as Technologist/ Software Engineer/ Coder/ Developer ...)\nIn particular, the team has a Financial Lawyer, which is a necessity for projects related to finance - technology, which other projects often ignore.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Proposer does a good job of listing the criteria to evaluate the project, these criteria also come with specific examples that show the team has a logical connection between plan and action.\nHowever, the proposal does not have an expected number of objects in the project. If the proposer can provide more specific plans on the range and number of companies, creators, and artists who issue NFTs on Tangent/ the number of crypto assets that can be achieved in the future will increase the persuasion of the development of the project.\nIn addition, the team has given the project management plan and specific timeline above.
