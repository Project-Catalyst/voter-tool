The Help2Health project was further developed in the English and Portuguese languages, the number of users who can use it could be greater than 2 billion. The solution implemented with health studies, health care for the community has a huge impact on users. Implementing multilingualism for the Help2Health app is in line with the challenge set out, expanding the future of the application's development. The cost of health care is huge, the introduction of the application with many languages helps users save health care costs. Users using the app will create a large volume of ADA transactions, directly impacting Cardano, increasing the development of the ecosystem. The app is also an opportunity to advertise Cardano's image which is having practical applications in all areas of life. Help2Health directly impacts a wide range of audiences: Patients, Healthcare Professionals, Healthcare Centers, Health Insurance Companies, Government Health Systems, Pharmaceutical Industry, etc. This impact is a driving force for the growth of the increasingly diverse Cardano ecosystem. The author provided videos and documentary links that show us how Help2Health can take care of health. With the implementation of smart contracts in telehealth makes it possible for Help2Health to meet the needs: telemedicine consultations, in-person medical appointments, prescription drugs, research requirements, etc. Implementation solutions are important for the medical industry and cardano development. The author has given 6 challenges in the field of health and 7 risks, the way to solve the challenges and risks presented is appropriate, minimizing the risks when supported by health experts, the implementation capacity of the project is also a risk reduction factor.

The implementation period is 8 months from September 2022 to April 2023, the implementation is divided into 4 stages: Translation to English and Portuguese, Development - Programming Stage, Education and Marketing Phase, finally Project Management. The stages have a meticulous implementation plan, the time to perform the work is reasonable, the language and construction structure are explained specifically, there are arguments consistent with the solutions given. Development - programming phase prioritizes security and the use of smart contracts in Cardano applies to health. Improve wallet connectivity, develop payment methods in ADA. Media marketing is transmitted through many social networks: Linkedin, youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. The content management phase has solved legal issues, operated the application and built good cybersecurity. The project has been full of members implementing the plan from F8, the Project Implementation Team has assignments in the appropriate areas, the information about them is detailed on Linkedin showing the ability to perform well as planned.
