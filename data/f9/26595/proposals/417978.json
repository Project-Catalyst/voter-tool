The proposal seeks to integrate additional wallets, direct payments and improve the user experience in this proposal. This solutions provides a simple way for someone to create an invoice for other people when they are expecting payment rather than send all of these details manually to another person or organisation. Handling more wallets and direct payments is a suitable next step in the development of this site. Other features as some suggestions could be a payment status on the invoice and also be able to print to a well formatted PDF file to export could be nice added features in the future. The deliverables of the proposal are clear, more information on the longer term intentions for the proposal would have been useful to include and the type of users the author is looking to attract in the early term as well. This would have helped to highlight and understanding of how this could be sustainable and attain early adoption to be used in the ecosystem. In a similar light it would have been good for the proposer to outline the risks of adoption for this product and how they will approach sharing it for testing and how they try to prevent it becoming a created product that never gets any usage. Another improvement could have been example users or conversations that go through the problems people are facing and why this solution will be useful to them - is this actually a useful solution right now?", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The progress of this proposal is broken down into three month stages which is integrating additional wallets and then integrating direct payments and the finishing off with improving the design.

In terms of success the implementation of the features is listed. It would have been good to be more specific with the objectives on who they will try to focus on that may use it in the ecosystem in these early stages so that the proposer can start getting a feedback loop for future development.

Therefore, the solution seeks to mitigate this process, connecting users' wallets and generating invoices that can be sent and paid by the other party.\n\nThis solution aligns with the challenge because it aims to improve the usability of blockchain and this is essential for anyone looking to be number 1 in the world.
