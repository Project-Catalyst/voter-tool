STARTVERSE is a metaverse, where everyone can build their real startups with minimum spending.", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 4.583333333333334, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 4851, "q0": "I felt excited when reading through this proposal. The idea really interests me because it is the combination of Virtual reality, NFT and game in one product, namely Startverse, the first metaverse game for startups in the world. Startverse is created with the goal of resolving problems of current NFT games in market, helps users's dreams come true with minimum spending, increase the adoption of Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Well, in fact, to understand about Startverse, it takes me a little bit of time to read as there are some specific concepts about this game. I am impressed with how the proposer and his team prepare for this project before asking for fund, which as I know, not many proposal could do such as website built, Youtube video demo of the games, Powerpoint slideshow of their project, strong communities in social media... The proposer give a very detailed explannation of how Startverse resolve NFT games problems in terms of unique concept, branded features, action to earns, free to play, and high quality & tech, and price of NFTs. A special point about this game is that the price of NFT will be automatically calculated by their features and levels, if players want their NFTs to become more valuable, they need to spend time, spend effort in-game to upgrade their NFTs. Besides, every elements of their metaverse is explained clearly including country chains, seasons, maps, games, marketplace, multiple NFTs system, co-op Infra, and social features for community so they have a better visualization of the game idea. Within the scope of Phrase 1 of business strategy, the proposer will focus on developing a marketplace portal that allows users to exchange NFTs, Stake token to earn benefit. However, I would like the proposer to explain a little more about the question \"How their proposed solution will address the Challenge that you have submitted it in\", which is not clearly explained by the proposer. But in my opinion, this proposal is suitable for the challenge as it will bring many positive impact to players, starts-up, the NFT markets; one more NFT interesting game is created for starts-up, as a result, increase the adoption of Cardano blockchain. Besides, the proposer also mentions about some risks related to market downtrend and situation when all their 3 projects funded at the same time which puts pressure personnels for project running. In short, I would like to give this proposal full mark for the details it conveys and personally, this is a very good proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well, in general, this feasibility of this proposal is okay, but some parts need to be more detailed. Through their plan script and provided link, I understand that the proposer has a vision of developing this project since Q4 2021 to Q2 2023, it means some works finished, and some works is being done. However, I am very impressed for the detail of works it conveys. First, the proposer provides a general roadmap with flow of work for each quarter so that community could have a general idea of the whole picture of the project. Then, within the scope of this proposal, the author provides a detailed implementation plan for each task for 3 month (Q3/2022) in regarding to product development, documentation & quality management, and project management. Speaking of budget, via their provided Excel spreadsheet link and proposal script, I'm more surprised of how professional the team is in calculating the project' expense, leaving nothing for any more comments. The cost for each task is based on how much effort they could put on (based on man-day, man-month). From that, we could calculate the exact cost for each item. I think this is a very smart way of calculating the cost. Now, move to personnel part, I felt a bit sorry that the proposer said \"you can check the info in the attached file below\", but forgets to give the file link that I think it is proposer's mistake as they're newbie in raising funding in Cardano. Therefore, I could only based on the introduction script, there are only 3 main people mentioned, they are all very talented with over 10 years of experience in developing games, AI, software development in well-know companies, mobile apps,...which shows their ability and rich experience in delivering the first phrase of this proposal and keep moving further in the future. If the proposer could pay more attention to the presentation, I think, their proposal would be more perfect. After all, I think I could not give them full mark for this part with all above analysis. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer gives a variety of methods in which community could follow the development of the project. Community could check their website Startverse.io as they will publish their works regularly in their blog section. Besides, the team has a very active communication channels such as Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, Youtube, Tiktok,..with a lot of current active participants for community feedback and interaction. Moreover, their roadmaps will be updated regularly based on actual situaltion which will help community to follow the implementation of project in metaverse production, comic production, comic calendar publishing... In addition, documents of the development such as game, basic design, tokenomic,.. also be a source of tracking the project. Regarding the success of the project, the proposer clearly shows their outlook for the next 6 months and in longer term vision. After 6 months, release marketplace and sell Boxes successfully, more than 10,000 users join into marketplace, and can sell first 30,00 boxes. For long-term vision, users could buy boxes, exchange NFTs, stake tokens to get profit, and could sell 1 million boxes which shows their ambitious goals. After all, I think, the auditability of this proposal is possible.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2622", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5878, "q0": "This proposal is very interesting. It creates a place where people can realize their dreams (no capital, no knowledge, no money if it fails). This is a game that can be played for free, with an eye-catching interface, including VR techniques,... it will certainly bring a great experience to players, attracting the attention of many people. . In Startverse, users not only move to earn, learn to earn, but also do anything to earn money (action to earn). In addition, it also allows users to exchange NFT, Stake tokens for profit. With the above reasons, I believe this project has effectively solved the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team information has been provided.

Besides, a detailed roadmap has also been listed, this proposal focuses only on Q2 3 4 2022. You have identified the things that need to be done and distributed them in the appropriate timelines. Besides, the budget allocation is calculated very meticulously and in detail (via the link https://bit.ly/3yr6i37 ). You have calculated a budget based on the number of people involved in each job, the number of hours worked. This is probably the most detailed, detailed roadmap and budget proposal I've come across.

This is very necessary, it keeps your project away from the bad effects affecting its long-term development.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Criteria for assessing project progress and success have been provided.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal was implicit and well detailed. Links were provided that further help with my understanding of the project. The solution has some amazing and unique deliverables most of which are actively in development for example, the marketplace design portal is completed, NFT items is ongoing, NFT smart contract (ongoing) among others. However, the roadmap/timeline in the proposal is not thesame as the roadmap in the project's website, secondly, the project's token seems to have been launched on BSC chain (Is the project a migration from another chain?) Lastly, i also notice that the proposer does not at any point mention if/how the the project will be executed on our (Cardano) blockchain even though the implementation plan was well articulated and structured.\nBudget and team details were all presented. In all, the proposal does not outrightly pronounce in any way how the project will utilize our (Cardano) blockchain for building the product and i however find it confusing to judge if it's a Cardano project or just a blockchain project seeking for funding from the Cardano community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project has some partitioned stages/phases with unique milestones for each phase, these perhaps will make it easy for auditing, also the development progress will adequately be shared with the community.

I find your project very interesting and attractive to players. I like the suggestion of not allowing the user to decide the price of the NFT on their own. The price of NFTs will be automatically calculated according to their features and levels. I like this suggestion because it avoids inflation and measures player value. Players will have to play with ability. Because if players want their NFT to become more valuable, they need to spend time and effort in the game to upgrade their NFT. This will help players fight harder. I totally agree with your suggestion. You should have more illustrative videos. In your proposal, I have seen that you present the problem very specifically, logically, in an easy-to-see form.

I agree with your progress measurement. In this section you should be clear about a brief description of the recommended development path using which software.

This project already has a working game base that doesn't have graphics comparable to AAA games, but it doesn't need them. The game I mentioned earlier, Second Life, has a level of graphics comparable to Starverse and has been and is a very successful game. Having a game of this type of characteristics in the Cardano network, I believe, could attract many users to the ecosystem. \nThe work they intend to do is very ambitious, where you can access many countries, with many areas, from gyms, stadiums, offices, bars, beaches, etc. Allowing every player who gets into the world of Starverse always have something to do. Whether it's meeting people, enjoying the weather or working. \nThere will also be multiple mini-games to pass the time with. \nThe marketplace will be very broad, because it will not have a single type of nft, as in other games. Here you will be able to buy/sell, items, land, buildings, businesses, houses, etc. You can even lend and borrow NFTs from other players. \nFor all this, I consider that the impact that this game can have is huge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team that is presented is very small, only 3 people and do not have links to any social network. I think it is always desirable that the team presents some linkedin profile or some other social network, as to provide some support for their knowledge. \nOn their website you can find information about the rest of their team, which are 7 other people and 2 advisors. I don't know why they didn't present the rest of the team in the proposal. Although they do not have links to social networks either, it is good to know how many members the whole team consists of.\nRegardless of this, they have a website where you can test the game, where you can create your own character and go through the city. So even though it is a small team they have been working a lot on the project, by the progress they have made I guess the team is more than capable.\nThey have applied to 3 projects in the F9, so if you are funded to more than 1 project, they will have some difficulties to manage to carry out the 3 projects simultaneously.\nFrom the progress they have already made I see that the team will be able to make the game. As a negative point is that they will need more rounds of funding to finish the project. Although they are looking for other financing options such as the sale of NFTs and Venture Capitals contributions.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In the proposal they have not put the roadmap, which is on their website, although it is quite brief.

And beyond this, there should be much more information provided than what is provided. \nFor example the next 2 steps are: Release (Closed alpha, Closed beta, web version, update marketplace) and Update Game (Release PC, Web version, Release Mobile version, Develop Branded Business). \nThis kind of games are being expanded and made in parts, so the future release version will incorporate many updates. When they say update game, what do they expect to update? They should have a detail of the mechanics that will be incorporated and in which times they will be done.
