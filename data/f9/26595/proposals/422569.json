By March 2023, the main net will be online, then there is a plan to support ETH, BSC and develop the ecosystem with multichain. the project plan seems feasible if the proponent undertakes only this one project. however, if they could provide a schedule of work for the other proposals they submit to this fund, the review of this plan would be more complete. in this fund, the proponent submits 22 proposals. with such a number of proposals, I don't know how they will perform assuming all proposals are funded (although this seems impossible). finally, about the budget, they asked for the amount of $220000 listed which corresponds to the stages of the development roadmap. I have information on each period they work for how much money. however, in order to assess the reasonableness of the amount allocated I ask the proponent to provide a more detailed explanation for example \"what are the 3 core modules that have been completed? what, how many engineers do each project, how long will they take, and calculate the corresponding cost for each module to be completed,...

It provides external data for smart contracts operating on Blockchain technology. However, centralized Oracles are controlled by a single entity and act as the sole data provider for a smart contract. They also represent a single point of failure, which can threaten the security of a smart contract (if an oracle is compromised, so will the smart contract). Trust in centralized Oracles is the problem, then decentralized Oracles will be the solution. However, this takes time for the system to become reliable. I find that the issue the author raises in this proposal is important and the scale of the impact is large. The problem is that \"There is no decentralized oracles solution that allows easy, instant and secure real-world data to be brought on the blockchain.\nThis proposed solution will solve that problem. SaaS3 leverages Permissionless oracle Network (PoN) to eliminate security issues to protect assets and on-chain logic. Any kind of web2 API can be deployed for free as an oracle on SaaS3.

This amount is allocated to 5 phases corresponding to the project's roadmap. However, I find that this budget analysis is not detailed and has no explanation and basis for calculation. My opinion is, for each budget section of a phase, the author should break it down by specific costs. Also add an explanation and basis of calculation, such as whether the cost is bundled or calculated as the average cost of 1 hour (or 1 month) and the total number of hours (or months) performed Work. Thus, there will be must detailed budget analysis of 5 phases and there will be repeated costs (eg developer costs, project management..etc).
