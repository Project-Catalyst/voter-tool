Thus, this proposal has a solid basis for developing a novel platform from the beginning, allowing other creative developers to design financial games on this platform, and many more experiences. Newer than the current NFT, and the proposed team promises that this will be the foundation for the development of the game industry, on the Blockchain platform, especially Cardano.\nIn addition, the risks that may hinder the success of this proposal are mentioned by the team and are directed to address them thoroughly.\nso with the documents, the problems raised and how to solve them along with explanatory examples with specific evidence, and the team has completed the first phase and this is a continuation to the second phase, like so this proposal can thoroughly solve the challenge and problem raised.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is emphasized by the group as part of the second phase, including the 6 contents that I mentioned in the impact, the group's commitment will be completed in Q4/2022. along with that the team stated phase one has been completed and some work is still in progress, and provided a link for the community to verify this claim.\nhowever, in the spending budget announcement, thanks to the team's suggestion to add a footnote to the development salary, although the team provides a link to the detailed table, the notations that are not specialized in the game industry are difficult. to determine why this proposal is committed to be completed in 3 months, but Implementation mobile & Pc has a time of 29.9 months, and similarly the costs below, if developed in parallel that would require a lot of manpower, for about 3 months, which might affect other proposals of the team,\nthe team information has been provided in full, however, via the link to information about the working group and specific work assignment, but there seems to be an overlap for the group's human resources if all All 5 proposals are jointly funded and implemented in parallel in the period of Q4/2022.\n As such, the team needs to take action to explain the arrangements if all 5 proposals are to be funded at the same time.

To overcome this, the team solves the problem by building a gaming platform that satisfies the gaming experience of crypto players and investors with sustainable business models. I think the proposal solves the goal as it demonstrates the development of a blockchain-based game platform Cardano, which is closely related to the goal set out in the Challenge: \"Dapps, Products & Integrations \". The proposition to add value to the Cardano ecosystem (even a very significant increase in value) is building a very large gaming platform with a roadmap that spans from 5 to 8 years. Project related to Metaverse, everyone involved can have fun and earn money. That is the great advantage of this NFT game and the game industry, it is in general today. I have never seen on the Cardano blockchain platform such a large-scale NFT game. Through this, we see the progress in the game projects related to the Cardano blockchain. This proposal follows and inherits the success of the previous Fund proposal. I'm looking forward to seeing how this NFT game scales and challenges the Cardano blockchain platform in the years to come. I realize, Miverse is a platform quite similar to the Cardano platform but Miverse only focuses on entertainment and it is Metaverse invested in game quality. The impact is indisputable. I am proud that Vietnam has such a large-scale NFT game. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is reflected in the first factor that the team has a lot of experience in the field of games, marketing, and communication and fully discloses its identity through social networks, websites, and clickups. I like the fact that the team has a clear identity because it increases the community's trust in the team and increases the feasibility of the proposal. The number of team members meets the scale of the proposal well, they include company leaders who are well-versed in their expertise and a team of collaborators with extensive experience in the field they have been involved in for many years. I wish all proposals had such professional publicity to list all team members. Your suggestion and the team made a very good impression on me. The budget of the proposal has been broken down by items and is reasonable to the goal. I understand that this NFT game is aimed at the core of the traditional game, requiring large enough resources. I have a question: In addition to the proposal for funding from Catalyst, has the team raised any other sources of funding from outside? Because I see that this is a big project that requires a lot of money to be able to execute and the fact that you have many opportunities to raise capital from outside, specifically here other organizations - they are also very interested in the game industry. If the proposal is built in a completely convincing way, I don't think it will be difficult to raise capital from places including Catalyst and other organizations. I know the plan you guys outlined is a roadmap that lasts from 5 to 8 years to get the project to the final stage, which clearly shows the scale of the Miverse game platform. Accompanied by a method of implementation is quite methodical and professional. Along with the current staff, I believe that the team has the necessary human resources to perform (provided that the financial needs are met). However, have you ever thought that the implementation team should be hired from other organizations (outside the team), the reason I ask is that when hiring the implementation team from other organizations, they have the opportunity to have access to the most suitable people in the world. When operating the game, will the player top up with the game's token or with ADA? Are the bonuses paid in-game tokens or ADA? Staking pool pay with ADA or game tokens? Is there a separate game token for each game region?\nRegarding the technical factor, I think that one of the prerequisites to make your NFT game different from other games is that the graphics must be of high quality, helping to increase the experience for gamers. . Therefore, if this project has access to the best graphic achievement in the world, it will be extremely attractive.\nRegarding the challenge risk, I agree with the risk factors that the team stated. If the outcome is not supported as expected from the gamers, the team will continue to research and improve the game NFT, Miverse to increase competitiveness and bring it to the top in the industry. game career? I think that's completely within the team's ability (when you try). In summary, I have had positive feedback questions - I completely agree with the feasibility of the proposal. Hopefully, the proposal will soon be funded and successfully implemented in practice. Good luck to the team. I vote 5 stars.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I love how the team shows the roadmap and milestones through the quarters of the year. This is a very professional presentation that I find that no other team can do. I also agree with the key performance indicator (KPI) related to GDP growth and informal employment. It shows that the team had a macro-level research preparation before writing this proposal. Transparency and auditability are further enhanced when the problem is described coherently with a satisfactory solution throughout the proposal. I am very pleased with the demonstration of transparency and auditability. There are details that we can rely on to further confirm the auditability. For example, determining the value of the NFT game - the team's product when running on the Cardano blockchain platform: (1) Create items using NFT; (2) Leverage the community that operates the pool (I read from external documentation that it is also possible); (3) Leverage the community of investors who are holding assets in ADA on the Cardano blockchain. I want to ask more questions, has the team ever had any intention of pulling game players and investors on other platforms (ETH, SOL, etc...) over the Cardano platform? If so, will it be transparent and convenient for the audit? Currently, the problem with NFT games, the initial cost of participation is very low, gradually this cost will increase when the game is successful and the game value is increased. What solution does the team have to this problem to keep prices stable in the long run and is there a way to demonstrate auditability and oversight for that solution? Just a few more questions, and positive suggestions for your reference. In short, at its core, the proposal contains a lot of information and is very well presented with steps. I am completely satisfied.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2552", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12616, "q0": "I'm quite impressed when you analyze the parameters that dictate the needs of today's gaming. And the opinion of most gamers is negative, whether they have played Play-to-Earn games or gamers who have never played. I have read your other proposal to get an overview, and you always emphasize your Gamefi views, the only way to keep gamers with a game for a long time is to make them feel like playing games are for enjoyment, and most Games in the Gamefi industry fail to do this. Your point of view is the same as mine, so I welcome this project.\nYour proposal is very detailed, it helps me understand your point of view, although this is not a professional article, it shows that you have invested a lot in researching different aspects. .\nI think, the main reason why Gamefi brought so much notoriety, is because it exploded so fast, the number of fomo people involved in junk projects increased, causing them to lose their assets, which caused them to have a negative view and spread the word transmitted to the community. So the main solution is to develop it slowly but surely, it should be developed slowly, the big problem it is facing is the organizations that manipulate the market, they deliberately inflate and dump. You need to be extremely alert before events like this, releasing a Metaverse with thousands of games will alleviate this situation, gamers will have more choices and no need to rush because \" fear of missing out\", they have time to make the right decisions.\nFinally, I also agree that this project tackles the challenge very effectively.
