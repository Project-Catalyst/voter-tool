The USP of the tool would be in the ability for collaborators to map in a tree-like structure any relationships within a project, organization etc that are important to the user.  Thereby it falls firmly under the category of open source products that will boost productivity and drive user growth, and is a good fit for Dapps, Products and Integration as it matches the ethos and \"possible directions\" of the challenge setting.\n\nThe uniqueness of the solution is that it could be used in almost any way that the users can think up, making it a fresh and unique alternative to the rigid structures provided by existing mapping and project management or collaboration tools.

The timeline has been improved greatly compared to the previous submission to Catalyst, and successful implementation looks very likely if the project is funded.

Definitions of success may have been more concrete than \"it works well\" but I think at the current stage of the development and given the modest budget this is acceptable.\nThe detailed discussion of risks and risk mitigation works in the proposer's favor and I agree that the progress of the proposal is likely to be communicated clearly in the spirit of open source and as a direct result of the love the team has for their project, which comes across very clearly in this proposal.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2761", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6489, "q0": "Project Catalyst is one of the greatest ways that Cardano community members can come together and participate in a decentralized blockchain experience.

By creating the Distributed Idea Management System (DIMS), users will be able to share their unique perspective and will be able to participate in this open-source, web-based tool.

I would suggest including a LinkedIn profile or another form of verification. This is because the identity behind the proposer is important in the funding process. The community should know who they will be holding accountable. There is a detailed plan that is split up into 6 months. I would like to see more information included in this section of the proposal that gives more details on how the funds will specifically allow for the proposed idea to be completed. Although it is true that these funds will be provided to pay for the proposer. I would suggest including how these funds will allow the project to be completed. Same goes for the budget breakdown. There is information that suggests where the funds will be allocated. I do appreciate that the proposer is only asking for $12/hr. This shows that the project is more important to the user than funds. The only suggestion I would include is somewhere in the proposal to include how there will be a community behind this project and who will directly benefit from using the distributed idea management system.

There can still be more information included on the team members behind the project and also in the detailed budget breakdown. This is because there are a couple factors that are very important when auditing the potential success of a proposal. One of these principles is the idea of accountability. Every proposal should provide enough specific information that they can be held accountable for the completion of their proposed idea. Typically, this is most effective when there is a loyal community behind the project. Or in this case, a group of people that would benefit from the distributed idea management system. The proposal can include information on how they plan to do this and grow a community. This will come from the team being transparent and promoting their proposal through social media and other methods. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 4 out of 5 stars. I believe that this project will likely be successful if these things are implemented. I would consider improving upon the areas suggested in this assessment.

The community is finding it hard to keep track of this data to allow collaborations instead of funding another copy of the already existing project. A dedicated knowledge management system is a probable solution for this issue. It is true that there are many such systems readily available, but nothing that is Cardano-oriented. So, the implementation of this proposal should quench that thirst and could drive a lot of collaborative work across the chain. This should eliminate the need for multiple localized solutions and maybe allow users to tweak the existing projects/libraries for their needs instead of creating an entirely new one.

Also, the budget is very minimal considering the amount of work involved in the project and the fact that he lives in Malawi and uses that to not overstate the costs must be appreciated. However, the team looks frail considering it's just the author couple working on it and with no previous venture details, it is quite hard to estimate the capabilities of the duo and their collective expertise.

Finding information quickly and decreasing unnecessary redundancies make more efficient use of time. Communities such as Catalyst may become more functional and efficient. Also, incentivizing contributions has potential to play a large role.

Now we have market based structures to facilitate the knowledge sharing directly between people and do it in an organic bottom up manner, from local to global. Collaboration is managed peer to peer in a decentralized way. An individual can freely participate with any knowledge one has and get compensated for the value created. \n\nI am also really excited about the possibility of being able to connect knowledge graphs of AI cognitions to personal knowledge graphs of humans.
