By creating a triple entry accounting system on Cardano, with the integration of Atala Prism identity, this will help drive significant transaction volume onto the Cardano blockchain.

The order of execution and expected delivery times are also included.  The proposer has included a detailed risk mitigation strategy for the risks identified as education and internet connectivity of the users. I have rated the feasibility 4 stars and not 5, because the proposing team has not discussed the technical challenges of implementing Atala Prism, or provided reference to their experience with Prism, or how they will mitigate this technical risk. While the team is experienced and highly capable of problem solving this technical challenge, I would recommend they include an Atala Prism consultant on the team to insure there are no knowledge gaps around this important part of their plan. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team will be publishing monthly progress reports on their website for the Catalyst community that will track the KPI's provided in the proposal.

Triple accounting is a great idea to bring real-world solutions onto the Cardano blockchain. Coming from a traditional finance background, I could see the potential to expand and scale this particular solution to many other parts of the real world business. The proposer articulates clearly why the Cardano blockchain is suitable for their solution (as it possesses unique governance and an evidence-based platform for change-makers) and how this proposal would add value to Cardano (as this dApp aims to provide a core solution to enhance the development of the sizable informal sector businesses in Africa, which accounts for 70% of the employment in the region, thus contributing to the thriving). This proposal meets multiple goals of this challenging setting (e.g., bring new users, drive more adoption, drive more types of on-chain activities, drive more innovation) and of Fund9's strategic goals (e.g., build a real-world solution on Cardano,  prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem). The proposer also discusses the risks that may prevent the project from developing sustainably and provides mitigations accordingly. Overall, I am convinced that this proposal will bring impact on multiple fronts to the challenge and the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that it is  likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. The proposer identifies the experience required to implement the proposal (e.g., software development in Plutus & Haskell, Accountants, marketing, research, agriculture and identifies the core team members with relevant experience, together with credentials on LinkedIn to work on this project. The proposal provides a sensible and conductible plan for implementation that shows not only what is being done but also how with supporting docs attached. They also have the website available for this project and the roadmap on this website states that the team has been working on the concept development and research for this project since January 2021, which explains the proposer's clear understanding of the solution, and its key features, and the technical requirements. The proposer has thoroughly considered challenges and risks relevant to a successful implementation and the corresponding mitigation. They also offer a realistic timetable and key milestones for delivering the project. The only reason I did not give them a 5 rating on Feasibility is that they did not provide a detailed budget breakdown. The budget is proposed in a lump sum for each function e.g, R&D, front-end development, smart contract development, etc. However, in order for the community members to assess the feasibility of their budget, I would suggest they to further break it down into the estimated man-hours and the daily rates for different roles. The total budget amount does not sound unreasonable, though.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals. First, the solution space and success are clearly articulated to address a well-defined problem. Second, the team proposes four quantifiable KPIs (# of business registered, # of users using accounting tools, # of credit ratings issued, # of downloads) and four key milestones to track each phase of success for the project (completion of the dApp, reaching at least 200 businesses, having at least 100 registered businesses, and having at least 30 users using the accounting tool for a month).

Thus, expanding financial services to unbanked and underserved markets and customers. Another positive point Blockchain stacks as a third component should ensure more transparency in accounting. Triple entry accounting will simultaneously add a third entry and post the third entry in a shared ledger that is visible to all participants.
