IT is technically involved to verify that the token belongs to a particular project. The minting policy is also difficult to interpret. There is a large number of services to verify these policies and identify the projects. The proposal is to build an open common standard for token verification. The MuesliSwap who is the proposer is also committing to support continuous hosting by charging a fee. The proposal does not include the exact modality of how the proposal will be implemented however the end state to be achieved is very clear. The trust and the comfort of the crypto ecosystem need to be improved drastically to make the environment safe for not too tech-savvy people. This proposal is very much aiding this idea and therefore it is very much aligned with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "MuesliSwap is a successful running DEX in Cardano and has a strong user base. The same team had proposed the idea and has committed to supporting it with extra money if required. Also, the Cardano Defi alliance can greatly influence the adoption of a common standard which is required to make the complete ecosystem secure. With these credentials and the clarity of the proposal, it is not difficult to assess that the proposal will be implemented in right earnest. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is for 22K USD and the project is expected to be developed in a month. The details of the cost breakdown are 10000USD for 100 hours of development including the creation of API endpoints and hosting of a server. That translates to 100 USD per hour for development. The cost also includes 10K USD for Maintenance and for supporting the server. 2K USD for community outreach. The cost for these activities is slightly on the higher side considering that there will be some revenue once the service is online and the community has accepted it. However, the complete standard is promised as open and the benefits that will be available to the community in terms of security are likely to be much more. WIth this consideration, it can be said that the project is fair in terms of cost and is highly auditable.

Would there be a risk where is the verification token is inaccurate? I hope the team would take this into account as this is a very good proposal to the Cardano community.

In any new blockchain ecosystem, there will always be lots of random projects minting random coins or as described in this proposal, creating mimic coins of other legit projects. This can trick early users of Cardano into buying a scam coin. With this new standard for token verification, it can prevent these malicious creators from harming early members. One of the worst things would be a new member of Cardano to get tricked into buying a new coin and it being a scam. This proposal addresses this challenge by creating a new standard where projects will have to verify with the Muesliswap team in order for their token to be traded on their dex.

Their detailed roadmap gives a great visual on the things they have accomplished and how they plan of completing this token verification process. There is a timeframe of around 2 months to get it all completed. Having this time frame is important because it is a suggested date that they can be held accountable for. This typically is a great indicator of how likely the proposal will be implemented successfully.

This is crucial to the success of the proposal because it will help readers see the exact plan and to hold them accountable and make sure that those potential funds are allocated to where they are suggested in the proposal.

Basically, the proposers will develop a website with a transparent verification process that would be accessible by all projects building on Cardano.  On this website, projects will submit their tokens to be verified whereas developers and end users will use the website to learn, check, be informed or check for flagged, verified, or unknown tokens.
