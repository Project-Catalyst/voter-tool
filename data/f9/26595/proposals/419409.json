Ultimately, adoption \u2013 transition from innovator and early adopter to early majority and late majority phases \u2013 depends on the provision of utility to end users.  People will be drawn to the blockchain that enables them to DO things safely with the least friction. IMPACT: This proposal fits within the challenge problem.  \n\nOne of the most promising and powerful development domains on Cardano implements the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity, which gives individuals control over which aspects of their identities they share.  The premiere platform for this line of development is IOG/IOHK's Atala PRISM's DID (digital identity).  Discord is a VoIP, messaging and digital distribution platform used widely across the globe to build communities of interest.  This proposal originates by the team building the RootsWallet and the RootsID.  It proposes a feature, Verifiable Credential, implemented by an Atala agent to validate control of Discord accounts.  Use of Discord presents risk for the unsophisticated user. Discord attracts scammers and other malevolent users employing a variety of technical and social exploits, including imposter accounts, to defraud vulnerable, na\u00efve users.   IMPACT: The problem statement concisely describes the issue. The proposal provides a rationale for how it contributes to the Cardano ecosystem. Implicitly, Verifiable Credential presents a means of validating the identity of the person with whom one is interacting on Discord, which would be a great benefit to the community, in part as a means of mitigating fraud.  However, the proposal does not explicitly present this as a benefit.  Nevertheless, this is a POSITIVE step for the ecosystem.\n\nThe challenge presents the following KPIs: 1) increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, 2) Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products, and 3) increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community. A project would be successful under the challenge if it satisfies at least one of the conditions.  Fundamentally, this project improves the quality of the Atala PRISM DID ecosystem (existing) and RootsID (existing) by providing a feature (new) that integrates with a widely used platform (Discord).  Consequently, the project serves all three KPI.  Presumably, this project could be a model for Verifiable Credential for other platforms.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team is RootsID, an Open Source development team focused on building Self-Sovereign Identity on Cardano.  The team provides a list of 12 prior projects funded through Catalyst on this line of development across Funds 6 (1), 7 (4), and 8 (7).  Five of these projects (F6 and F7) have been delivered to completion.  This project is being completed primarily by a single team member, who has previously served as a Community Advisor and member of challenge teams for Funds 6 and 7.  The team member is a first cohort graduate of the Atala Prism Pioneer Program.  In addition to this proposal, RootsID has submitted 9 other proposals in Fund 9.  RootsID raised the issue of competing commitments as a risk but claims the will mitigate by carefully allocating time to each project.  FEASILIBILITY: RootsID has demonstrated the capability to complete Catalyst commitments and to manage multiple projects within the same fund.  They are scaling at a measured rate (1:4:7:10).  RootsID is clearly following a strategy of deconstructing long-term strategies into discrete, manageable initiatives. The proposal indicates completion within 9 weeks and a modest budget of $8425. The timeline includes and order of execution in clearly delineated stages.  Both of these are modest and simple, which bodes well for execution.

The proposers aim to provide a trusted agent that issues a Social Credential proving that a decentralized digital identity (DID) has control of a particular Discord account, and any identity wallet will be able to interact and receive this type of Social Credential, and hence can be adopted by other projects that can benefit from this type of validation of a user's DID.

This integration between Discord and DIDs on Cardano is a building block that can make a huge impact on the utility of the Cardano ecosystem and the retention of ecosystem participants because of increased real-world use-case. Even better, this first integration is indicated to be a first step to easily extend compaitablity with Telegram, Twitter, email, Github, Instagram, Google, Twitch, and I\u2019d imagine many other platforms byond this. I think this section of the proposal could be more convincingly quantified by providing some kind of data on Discord usage within the Cardano ecosystem or Discord usage in general, to establish a clearer understanding of how many users would be enabled to be able to utilize this feature. In my view, quantification is a useful tool for proposals to be able to weigh benefit-cost ratio, so this is a rather minor suggestion for a low-cost proposal such as this one. It could also be a nice feature here to provide some examples about various use cases from the standpoint of NFT/DeFi projects that have communities on Discord, as opposed to the general identification of \u201caccess to additional functionalities.\u201d Without these suggestions, I\u2019m still very well convinced of the worthwhile impacts presented here.

The track record of this team participating and delivering on MANY previous Catalyst funds provides overwhelming confidence that this team is capable on delivering innovations that are advancing the Cardano ecosystem. For some additional excitement, the prospect of having this proposal delivered in just a 9 week timeframe is exciting, impressive and enables access to benefits on a much sooner timeframe than most other Catalyst proposals. There may be an argument that the $100/hr labor allocation is more on the inefficient side, but the overall cost, developer experience, and practically immediate timeframe of the project overwhelmingly trumps concerns regarding inefficiency, in my mind. I have no serious criticisms for feasibility.

While the measurability on the completion of the product links to a greater enforcement of product quality, mere completion of the product does not link to potential impacts of it never actually sees usage. This is why I think it\u2019s important for proposals to include usage KPIs in their standard/definition of success, to demonstrate to voters that impact-linked metrics are being monitored as well as completion-linked metrics. I often find it prudent to see objective target metrics for these KPIs as well, to demonstrate to voters that the team has an acute vision for success that will produce the desired impacts. Some of these metrics could include the number of DIDs connected to Discord, the number of projects integrating this tool, and/or the number of use cases developed with this tool.

Many discord users are also very technology-literate, and care a lot about the safety of their identity, so it is the perfect audience for such a project.

The scalability for this project has immense potential. By testing out on a very implementable platform, it is allowing rootsID's team to test out the extent of issuing credentials and how effective it is to prevent spam/bot accounts and reliably share information to verified discord users. The scalability of this operation can also be expanded to many other social platforms. Some of the eye-catching platforms: Twitter, Instagram, Twitch, and Github. All of these platforms are heavily infiltrated with unverified and impersonated accounts leading to many scams.

The team does intend to participate in town-hall break out rooms which is also a good place to learn further about the progress. Since this is a DApp that cross references a decentralized entity with a centralized entity, it potentially would benefit from a beta phase for the project as it could be delicate in how discord deals with this.
