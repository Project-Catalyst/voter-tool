I do have experience of being a PA since fund 6, and will probably be a good representation of a general voter that lacks deep technical knowledge. Furthermore, I\u2019ll do my best to provide any constructive feedback, to make my assessment valuable to the proposer and voters. \n\nIn my understanding, the proposer aims to create or implement a decentralized AI system that will manage financial information and data services transactions on a layer 2 Hydra sidechain (on the Cardano blockchain, obviously). This proposal is not intended to be funding the development, but the hardware (one NVIDIA DGX-A100, as stated in the proposal).  \u2028This will according to the proposer handle 90% of all the data transactions, offloading the rest of the blockchain. There are three white papers attached the proposal addressing the topics of Deep Learning Networks Based on Distributed Ledger Technology, Cardano\u2019s Hydra white paper and Deep Learning on P2P Networks with Nonhomogeneous Data. \n\nFor this proposal to be viable enough to assess it properly, I would suggest to include more information in the form of the proposers own explanations and words. We know what the proposer intends to do (Hardware required for the sidechain) but we don\u2019t know exactly how the proposer intends to do it. (Except for the added white papers that describe the underlying technology related to this proposal)\nThe intention behind this is explained basically to improve performance and functionality of the whole Cardano Blockchain, which is a wonderful idea. The proposer mentions a bit more on the future plans (RealFi, oracles, etc) in an attached youtube video, but I get the sense that it is a lot of different thoughts which would be compressed into something more easily focused (in order for it to be comprehended by the public more easily). \u2028\u2028As stated before, we need to know more on what and how the solution will work (in the proposers own words, not through a conceptual white paper), there is simply not enough information. I would however say that the proposal would fit somewhat in the challenge purely based on the topic of the proposal (at least in the later stages of the vision).\nI disagree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "This proposal is a resubmission of an unfunded proposal from previous funds (5 and 8), and from the looks of it the proposer has chosen not to change much text since the first iterations of the proposal. This leads me to question whether or not the proposer is engaged or willing enough to listen to the feedback given by the community. It becomes a bit mixed, because the proposer clearly seems very passionate about the project and its possibilities (as shown in the youtube video). \u2028The sole member of the team seems to have been a community member of Cardano for a long time, but it would be nice to see some links included that would confirm the experience, competency or expertise that could further validate this. There are mentions of a plan to incorporate developers from IOHK in later stages, and collaborating with them during the initial phase, but not much more than that. \u2028Another aspect that would be nice to have included is a roadmap, preferably under a detailed timeframe. In my experience as a PA (since Fund 6), when I see something along the lines of \u2019HODL until $3.00\u2019 written where the roadmap usually should be, I interpret that as a proposer who isn\u2019t serious or who has given much time in constructing the proposal. (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong) The idea in itself is super interesting, especially since it would come from the community, I just want to see that reflected in the time and effort spent on the proposal. \n\nThe budget breakdown consists of one, onetime cost of 200 000 USD, the cost of the hardware needed. It\u2019s quite a substantial amount, and I would once again have liked to see the amount asked for to have been reflected in the time spent providing details on team, budget and roadmap within the proposal.

Since the roadmap is absent in the proposal, we cannot know what to expect from the proposer, or when (Even though the proposer states that he will hold and stake the funds with an escrow wallet until project launch when the price of ADA reaches 3 USD). This information along with what communication channels the proposer will use with the community is vital, if we are going to be able to follow the development progress. I agree with the proposers statement that no project is guaranteed, but we can do lots of work to make the development, transparency, responsibility, quality and communication as good as possible in order to increase those chances (every action counts). \n\nA word of advice from working as a teacher for many years. If you have a great vision and idea, you need to acquire different ways of communicating that idea to different kinds of people. It\u2019s the same with languages, if I ask for a very fast blue car in German, it will have very different responses if I am speaking to a person from Germany, Serbia, Ghana or Singapore. It is the same with communication. We all need to adapt to each other if we want to be able to build something together. I sincerely believe that the vision of this proposal is fully possible to achieve, if communicated in the correct way. \nBased on the information contained within the proposal, I strongly disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "PA seems not to understand"}, {"id": 6719, "q0": "Starting with the problem statement, the proposer informs us that Cardano is in need of a layer 2 solution to handle large volumes, irregular or complex data. There is definitely some truth to that - especially for the future, when adoption rates will hopefully increase across a wide spectrum of applications and types of data stored. But right now, the network utilization rate sits at roughly 50%, with infrequent and low duration spikes. \n\nThe value proposition is to create a decentralized AI system through a cluster of 7-10 DGX A100s that will be used to power a sidechain, and the funding from this proposal will purchase one such device. There are a few weak spots of this proposal however, and I briefly mention / question some below: \n\n- being a very technical proposition, the proposer does go into the details of technical feasibility. Can such a device power a side-chain? How many devices are needed, at a minimum, for one side chain? What would be the specs of such a sidechain, in terms of speed of execution, node propagation time, latency, etc.?\n- the proposal does not detail what would be the performance improvement of such a sidechain? What additional throughput would be achieved? Are there any existing dapps that have shown interest in running on such a sidechain? \n- What is the actual need for training the AI system and why is an AI system needed in the first place to run a sidechain? \n\nThis is a proposal touching upon a very complex subject but does not make an effort into making it understandable for the average community, nor does it explain the clear added value of the sidechain being proposed. I think three stars are sufficient. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There are a number of reasons that turn this proposal into a rather unfeasible one. Let\u2019s take them one at a time. \n\nFirst, there is no team to back up the project. Drake, the sole proposer, is very passionate about the subject and you can clearly see from his home edited video that he put a lot of effort into this proposal, even preparing a speech and reading it very eloquently in front of the camera. Unfortunately he is the only person working on this proposal. Drake also mentions that the NVIDIA equipment would include access to NVIDIA engineers, which would most likely be limited to pure technical assistance and not in actually implementing the side chain, if my understanding of what post-sales assistance usually means. \n\nSecond, there is no outside help for Drake. He seeked assistance from Ben Goertzel (the founder of SingularityNET) but unfortunately he did not receive \u201ca definitive answer, as there is likely a conflict of interest in offering assistance to unfunded proposers\u201d. Drake mentions that he and Ben Goertzel are nevertheless friends on Discord, so there might be hope for future collaboration (assessor\u2019s note). Drake also  asked IOHK to \u201cmake the software mods\u201d. It would have been an excellent addition if the proposal included a statement from IOHK confirming that they are actually onboard with this proposal and that they will assist with the software requirements. \n\nThird, there are no implementation details. Drake mentions in the timeline that he will \u201cHODL until $3.00\u201d. Will that mean that equipment will not be purchased until the price of ADA reaches 3 USD? What would happen until then with the funding? Would Catalyst not disburse any amount? Or would they, and Drake would be the one \u201chodling\u201d?\n\nFourth, I am not sure that Drake shopped around for a very good deal. Being such a high tech device, price transparency for NVIDIA 7-10 DGX A100s is not that great. One website puts the price at 150k USD, compared to the 200K that Drake is willing to spend on it. There would also be the possibility of a 9k USD monthly rent - wouldn\u2019t that be an excellent start for a proof of concept sidechain? What about alternative devices which might be more cost effective? The NVIDIA product cannot possibly be the sole equipment fit for our purpose here. So there are definitely a lot of questions to be asked in terms of value for money here. \n\nTo sum things up, an excellent proposal needs to include: \n\n- an actual competent team so that the Catalyst community is comfortable in funding a 200k proposal\n- a confirmation that external partners are onboard with the plan (unlike IOHK/SingularityNET in this case)\n- proof that there is a feasible implementation plan, in the near future, not when ADA will hit 3 USD\n- a due diligence process to gain comfort on the fact that the team knows the market for suitable equipment and that they are spending the money in a way that ensures good value for the community\n\nAs you can see, there are a significant number of problems with this proposal, and I have to limit my assessment to two stars for its feasibility.
