Forking a wallet means a greater workload and in-house expertise needed to keep the wallet up to date and developing with Cardano.  This is not desirable outcome unless the team want to branch out into wallet software.\nInvestigation into a suitable wallet should have been conducted and confirmed prior to this proposal.\n\nThe timeline, team and budget all appear reasonable to complete the proposal.  The team expertise, funding amount requested and duration of the project appear achievable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree the proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.\n\nRegular reporting including KPI\u2019s such as number of votes and transactions put through the voting app should ensure acceptable auditability.\nIf the voting code integration with the open-source wallet is to be on github, the proposal should include the communication of this also.
