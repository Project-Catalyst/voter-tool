This will without a doubt provide a lot of use for the Cardano ecosystem, especially with the many features it is supposed to have and with the detailed, dedicated planning that has already been done. Since it is building within the decentralized structure of Cardano, it will be able to scale withthe growth of the network. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project budget seems reasonable and should match the task. The proposers are transparent about their background and seem competent for the task. This can also be seen from the extensive whitepaper that basically shows a concept only waiting to be implemented. The only thing that i can criticize heare ist that the milestones for the implementation are simply far too brief and lack a more fine-grained structure. What I like is that all the technicals are explained really well. Also, the cooperation with Gimbalabs makes this whole proposal verypromising and likely to succeed. What is also appreciated is both the risk/contingency plan and the contingency within the budget. With the contents in the whitepaper, overall good job, but 1 point substracted for the coarse milestones .", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Despite it all being a bit brief, some key goals, KPIs and success factors can be made out and some (however brief, as mentioned above) milestones are presented. A percentile progress tracking is state of the art project management methodology (as a project engineer I am well-versed with this method). However, no site has been provided to track the progress (consider providing a github link) and since no summary of the whitepapers deliverables is provided in a comprehensive manner, the community will have to put a lot of effort into tracking the actual progress of the deliverables against the self-proclaimed progress. There you have some room for improvement both in the detailing and the roadmap detailing as well as transparency to provide a proper tracking platform. I still consider the auditability okay though difficult.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2257", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3135, "q0": "The solution provided by this proposal is immense to the Cardano network. This will drive adoption to another level. By removing the complexity of the technology, many developers/companies can immediately hop in and start building, while focusing on their own business requirement. There are many tools/solutions/platforms out there but they are either limited features to use or centralized. This proposal solves it by being decentralized and aims to be simple yet powerful. With that, I strongly agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal's team is solid and has good track record. The timeline and roadmap are detailed out. The roadmap is a long once where the author is planning on receiving funds from catalyst in the future. This solidifies my confidence in the team as they plan the whole journey way ahead. The budget cost breakdowns clearly and it looks reasonable. The risk are mentioned and solution to mitigate them are already in place. However, I believe there could be more risk that are involved in this proposal. The chances that the solution maybe too complicated for the developers and thus making the adoption rate low. Another risk could be competitions and and user trust. I hope the team may take those risk into account, as with them addressed this could be a game changing product. All in all, with the experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal has clear roadmap and clear deliverables. The author has listed 3 main metric/KPI to track the progress of the proposal.

Currently, if someone wants to deploy their dApp they either have to run their own node or find someone else who does. The major player right now is Alchemy but their services are very centralized, think AWS. Of course there are other competitors like Ankr who will link you up with a decentralized network of node providers so this is not at all a new concept and there will be competition. What\u2019s unique is the team\u2019s go to market strategy which is to target stake pool operators who already have the hardware and technical expertise. What\u2019s even better is that the level of decentralization on Cardano is one of the highest which means this way of building a decentralized network of infrastructure nodes might make it one of the most decentralized platforms in web3. Centralized solutions like Alchemy add a single point of failure to an otherwise decentralized blockchain, and if it goes down or gets shut down by hostile governments then many applications will be affected from OpenSea to Aave to Dapper to Circle to Yearn Finance to \u2026 you get the idea, just about anything that relies on it which is a lot.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "While the proposer has a lot of experience in SaaS and you can see it from the whitepaper, GTM strategy and technical expertise, it is a lot of funding to ask for at $10,000 a month for his salary alone and this is only for 1 of 4 phases which he intends to come back in future rounds for funding and this seems headed toward a for profit business instead of open source direction, so voters might want to decide if the salary should be closer to a startup founder\u2019s salary instead, which is usually little and a pay cut from previous jobs. That being said, he should be able to get the job done though he is also working on proposals from previous rounds.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer will track key metrics like completion of the development roadmap and stake pool operator and customer onboarding. I presume these will be shared with the community but proposer should note it down in the proposal how this will be shared, is it just the Catalyst update or also through channels?

Boosting Cardano adoption and growth, and help future builders and would-be Catalyst proposers to join the ecosystem is held back by how difficult it is to write and test Plutus smart contracts. By inviting all the existing successful Cardano developers to offer their solutions on a single marketplace would be very useful, low-risk and modular. The project itself will be delivered as open source, so apart from the cost of the cloud services and ecosystem solutions, there is not risk of any party gaining too much influence in this possible solution to the problem of scattered tools and low discoverability. Feasibility and Clarity of the goals will be discussed separately.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is a well written proposal with a slick deck, demo video and whitepaper. I would have liked to see a lot more detail about the proposer RBM.dev, the company Saor Technologies LLC or the collaborators, as without assessing the skills required and existing, successful delivery of this ambitious project is extremely hard. More information about the 2 large SPOs already onboarded should have been shared, and the role of SPOs in the platform discussed in a lot more detail. It is my understand that the main objective of the platform is to dramatically lower the barrier of entry for dApp development on Cardano, but most of the details provided cover the tokenomics and marketplace incentives. What is needed in my opinion for the community's and voters' confidence in this 100k funding project is the necessary understanding of the UTxO model and knowledge of Plutus smart contracts, Cardano integrations and wallet ecosystem and partnerships with the payments and web dApps community.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This project appears to be a proof of concept that will produce a testnet alpha. From the auditability information provided there are no clear deliverables on the tooling it may onboard and lack of details about the usefulness to dApp developers. Those are at the core of the problem and solution provided and used in the voting app, so for this funding amount the quality of the alpha version limited to SPOs at this stage would need to be a game changer and make voters want to fund the further roll-out over future funds. This could have been backed up nicely by providing clear, measurable steps across each sprint or monthly milestone, and broaden the scope and number of collaborators considerably during this initial stage. In its current form, the proposal does not provide all the information I would have liked to see for assessing the success and feasibility of the entire long-term project. All that I would be able to track for this proposal from the information provided are the success of the SPO onboarding, i.e. number of SPOs out of 5-10. Surely, it must be possible to define success for a Platform as a Service that promised to \"takes care of the complex technical concerns for you\" much more specifically.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2688", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9744, "q0": "The Cardano blockchain is a decentralized platform that enables developers to build web3 applications.

This proposal identifies a real need within the cardano ecosystem, and has a clear roadmap of how to implement their idea.
