Furthermore, this will also encompass a study of how to provide Full Cardano native token support \u2013 which is critical for a full adoption of the Cardano financial ecosystem and its tokens. Another key element will be to explore possibilities for implementing a Cardano DApp browser on Ledger Live. The impact of the proposal is smack bang in the centre of this challenge. It is also expected \u2013 in my view \u2013 a great boost for the staking component of Cardano, as users of the hard wallet will no longer have to go through hoops and alternative solutions (that would compromise the security of their ADA holdings) in order to safely stake their coins held on Ledger hardware wallets. As the share of staked ADA increases, so does the security of our network \u2013 so I see an additional security benefit for the Cardano protocol from this proposal, especially as large holders are more likely than not to be using hardware wallets such as Ledger to store their ADA. This is a proposal that is well aligned with the challenge, especially as it also has the seed for developing a DApp browser component \u2013 which will help a lot of developers to reach ADA holders who use the Ledger wallet. If implemented, this project will also open the way for many Cardano developers to create new applications & platforms on the Ledger device", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is being implemented through a partnership of three important groups in the Cardano ecosystem - Strica, Vacuum Labs and Cardano ambassadors, as well as Ledger itself. These are tested players who have already delivered the Ledger Live integration. The competencies of the team and their references are super high, I am especially happy to see the Ledger team on board as well as the guys from Vacuum Labs \u2013 who are a very high profile team in the Cardano ecosystem. The likelihood of achieving the results that they set for themselves with the requested budget of $330,000 is very very high. The team has provided a budget breakdown that is accompanied with a timetable that will see the delivery of results in quarter 4 of this year. I commend the team for utilizing part of the budget for further research, which is excellent \u2013 as it will prepare the integration of the DApp browser in Ledger Live. However, I would have liked to see more details on the budget. Some lump sums seem overly generalized \u2013 such as \u201cAdvising & consulting, External coordinations & collaborations, Bounties & additional Community Engagements\u201d that requires 50.000 USD in Ada. This proposal is requesting a relatively large chunk of the budget \u2013 in the sense that it is large enough to require a more detailed budget breakdown with cost estimates in more detail, in order to further the transparency of the funding. We do not see how much of the budget is going to which partner, nor do we see anything but a birds-eye view of the budget. I think that if this proposal is resubmitted in the next Fund, a more detailed budget breakdown would be welcome. Why? Because the large amount of the budget means that it is difficult to assess whether the budget is reasonable to achieve the set goals \u2013 is it too large or just about right? It is difficult to assess with the information that was provided. Other than that, very good. One more comment about feasibility \u2013 the team specified \u201cAs we envision further development for the Ledger Live integrations such as NFT enhancements & voting, this proposal may most likely return in a future funding round to Project Catalyst\u201d \u2013 I presume that this was a mistake and that the \u201cproposal\u201d will not return for more funds, but instead it will be the \u201cproposing team\u201d that returns for new projects and proposals related to new Ledger Live capabilities. The Leger team has even specified the names of their own people who will be in charge of this deeper integration between Cardano and Ledger. The names include QA Engineer Michael Coursier, Senior UI Designer Brian Scholving, Ledger Live Tech Lead Hakim Aamar and the Blockchain Product Owner - Roman Beyon-Grataroli. Clearly, this is a boon for this proposal \u2013 as the Ledger side is already committing specific and compotent people in advance. Fab. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability information provided by the team is good. The team \u2013 and their subteams \u2013 are very present in the Cardano ecosystem through many media channels and townhall and other events, so there is ample room for advertising/disclosing the progress of the project. The development of the code and integration will be trackable via the included github link: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live There is a clear timeline and horizon for achieving this integration, especially due to the direct involvement of the Ledger team themselves. The proposal specifies that the Ledger team \u201cwill provide technical and product experts to make sure this project gets integrated on time and with a high level of quality\u201d. With this guarantee from the Ledger team \u2013 and the added qualification that the Ledger firmware and security teams will also take a deep look into how to make token support generic to ALL Cardano tokens \u2013 I think that the auditability of this proposal is a given while the importance of this proposal extends even to the future stages of further integration between Cardano and Ledger.
