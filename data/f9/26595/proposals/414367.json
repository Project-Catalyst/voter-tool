Here, we seek to create Dapps that are positively impacting the Cardano ecosystem, increasing the number of active members in our community, the number of digital wallets being created, smart contracts being formed, etc. In my view, the fundamentals that would be better served based on this project would be \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products\u201d. This platform would work very well on these issues, since the idea is to create a space that can assign, as the proponents themselves say, an impact score based on the good deeds of users. This score, from what I understand, can generate crypto rewards (I believe in Ada). They also want this platform to become a market for ethical products in the future, that is, products that are sustainable or contribute to a social cause. The Cardano ecosystem would benefit greatly as all this data would be minted on our blockchain. Another very relevant point here would be the future tool that would allow users to make loans among themselves, without intermediaries. These transactions would be smart contracts, containing interest, and the risk of the loans would be calculated based on the reputation of the borrower. In other words, there would be several tools coupled to this interface, using Cardano's technologies so that they can be executed. One point that I would like to comment here, which was not so clear to me, would be how the Atala Prism DIDs would be associated with all this. However, I think that this project can bring many benefits to Cardano, since it seeks to create a kind of social network that measures the good deeds of those involved, that works to generate rewards for them and also contributes to a sustainable trade and system of less bureaucratic loans. I think for the project to be successful, it would need a lot of outreach and broad community adoption, as it's an interface geared toward many activities that multiple users would need to be using. A question that came to me when reading the proposal was how, exactly, these good deeds would be linked in user accounts. How can we be sure that they are actually doing those actions and gathering \u201cdots\u201d from that? Apart from these issues in general, I believe that it is a proposal that is very much in line with what the challenge seeks and even innovative, since it intends to boost this wave of good deeds, through direct benefits to users and involving cryptography.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yes, and here are some valid explanations of how the plan could be successfully implemented in practice. Talking about the development process (script), the first three months are very well situated, we know exactly which tasks happened in each, I believe they were also said in order. This is very important so that we have a solid understanding of how the development process will take place here. However, in the following months (from the fourth to the sixth month), the level of specificity about what will be done drops significantly. We know that bidders will \u201cmonitor KPIs, prepare technical documentation and deliver the final report\u201d. But in which month will each of these activities take place? Or would the 3 happen in parallel? It would be important for us to have better clarity on this point. I would also like to know how they would follow the aforementioned KPIs, how would this monitoring of the interface be, how would they understand if the operation is going as planned, how would this information be studied and then passed on to the final report? In my perception, the script starts off perfectly but lacks a little detail in relation to its second half. We also have a series of tasks listed, it would be very positive for those who read the proposal that these were delegated to a specific professional. For example, who would be responsible for \u201cgiving users an impact score\u201d? The deliverables and technical aspects are fundamental for us to solidly understand the different facets of the proposal, what worries me a little is that in the blockchain part it seems that not only Cardano would be used, and the project is quite expensive, so in my view ideally, it would be fully developed on our blockchain, so that the benefits fall 100% on our community. The Milkomeda sidechain would also be used, and from my research this project links Cardano with Ethereum, forgive the technical error if I misunderstood. The budget division of the proposal leaves something to be desired because we know the price of the hour of work for certain tasks, but not how many hours the professionals delegated to them would dedicate to the work, which does not allow us to have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhether the amount requested is it fair or not. I would like proponents to identify exactly how much time would be spent for each cited part. In general, the information is passed from a basic one when it comes to financing, since we have a table at our disposal, but the information cited in it is not so well developed. And finally speaking of the team, I think this part is perfect because we have a lot of information about the team members. We know their names, their roles in the project, their linkedin profiles and a short biography, so a lot of trust is passed on. With that, I think the proposal is viable, having only a few points to be better clarified.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of monitoring progress, I think this part is perfect. Proponents allow us to understand various metrics that would be used, both qualitative and quantitative, to understand if the project was being done right. We have some deliverables such as \u201cthe Atala PRISM integration code deployed and available on GitHub\u201d and \u201ca full demo video\u201d as well as numerical data regarding registered users in DIDs and number of transactions that affect the impact score on our blockchain. In addition to knowing very well what would be measured, the proponents establish very solid bridges with the Cardano community: they claim that there will be monthly reports and also a final report, as well as participation in community meetings, Towhhall and etc. Not enough, they make clear some tools that will be used to monitor the activities, such as the Agile methodology, Trello, Github and etc. That is, we have several ways to verify if the process and the desired partial results are being obtained. Therefore, there are not so many comments to be made about the process, since the information has already been provided in a very adequate way. Speaking now of the success scenario, this part is less detailed, unfortunately. Proponents point to two key indicators (ProofSpace/Atala PRISM is integrated into the existing Socious app and the Impact Score Calculator is developed and deployed so users can start visualizing their social and environmental impact). I believe these indicators are very focused on the performance of Dapp itself, but maybe they don't point out so well the impacts of this for our blockchain, our community. It would be interesting for them to do a study pointing out how many digital wallets were created, profiles in Atala Prism, how users of this application would relate to Cardano, in general, that is, if they became active members and why. In a simplified way, I believe that it is also important to understand what was generated from the Dapp, and not just the success in its performance. A targeted study with the target audience should have been carried out, so that we had a solid and verifiable view of the consequences of the development of this dApp for each member of our community. More to these issues commented at the end, the inclusion of details is never too much, in my view, so it would be very positive if the proponents had included as much information in the auditability of success as was included for us to follow the steps and the partial/small advances.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2770, "q0": "\"There are many tasks in this proposal but the main idea is to move towards a decentralized environment that can watch the social community voluntarily perform good deeds with environmental and social impacts as well as ethics.

In my opinion, this project is highly relevant to the challenge \"Dapp, Products & Integrations\" as its unique Impact Score has many use cases to Cardano Ecosystem and will significantly increases the adoption of Cardano. For example, users could be rewarded in THANK tokens, access to investments, or exclusive economic opportunities such as financial products. And in the future, this Impact Score system could be used to facilitate users to progress in their impact careers, connect with like-minded people, buy a variety of sustainable products, lend and borrow THANK token,...Moreover, this project will increase the number of integrations with different products such as Atala PRISM, Milkomeda, ProofSpace and ERC-20 compatible wallets,..For example, this Dapp will use Atala PRISM for facilitating KYC compliance, impact score certification and asset transaction with trust and transparency. I think this project is explained simply and clearly by the proposer for community understanding of their project with given Socious website, Github link, and video explanation of Atala PRISM for reference. As far as I know, this Dapp is completed to some extent as I could download this Dapp from my mobile phone and experience it and see what I could contribute to the environment and get Impact Score. From what I know, only those who have an impact score above 700 are issued verifiable credentials. So I just wonder and I would be appreciated if the proposer could explain a little more about how could new member contribute to get \"Impact Score\" on the Dapp? How will the Impact Score calculated? Does it based on any criteria? I suggest that the proposer could make a video to show how a member could contribute to environment issues from the Dapp. Regarding the risks of delivering this project, I agree with the proposer's opinion, Socious will work with Atala PRISM/ ProofSpace for integration with existing mobile app, therefore depend on ProofSpace/Atala PRISM capacities, and working time difference between Europe and East Asia. And a good point from the proposer is that by predicting these risks, the proposers have idea on how to mitigate them. After all, I fully support this proposal and hope it could get funded. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has quite detailed plan for delivering this project to the market within 3 months of approval of funding from September to no later than the end of 2022 and will monitor the results and submit the final report in the sixth month. For each month, the proposer lists out some main tasks which make it easier for community to visualize what the team is doing on the Socious project. A good point from his plan is that the proposer knows exactly each step for carrying out his project, clearly show the breakdown of tasks for \"Workflow between Socious and ProofSpace\", show what deliverables need to be given, mentions about technical aspects and clearly show the link for the workload management of Socious and ProofSpace. However, I think, there are some parts in the proposal need to be explained a little more. For example, for marketing, I do not know who is in charge of the marketing task (as 4 people are mentioned in your team as a Founder, 2 developers and 1 designer); I would be appreciated if the proposer could give breakdown of marketing task too. Also, the proposer mention about monitor KPIs, I just wonder about which indicators in KPIs will the team use to monitor it? And if possible, I would like to know more about the long-term vision of developing Socious after 2022 release?. Regarding the project's expense, I am impressed about this part because the expenses for delivering each task is clearly calculated by the proposer: I know exactly the total budget's cost, how many hours needed for each task, the number of people will be in charge of that task, the As I know, the hourly rate is $100 which I think is quite reasonable for professionals.Finally, I believe the proposer and team members are qualified and experienced enough for carrying out this project successfully as I know their name, position, nationality, education background, expertise and motivation for sustainable development with technology,..Moreover, with the Dapp are completed to some extent which show their seriousness and evidence of what they could do in reality.

The proposer clearly tell us their four deliverables as proofs of completion: the code of Atala Prism and Impact Score Calculator deployed and available on Github, demo video, members sign up. Therefore, it is possible to monitor the success of this project. Also, the team has specific KPIs for this project: 2000-4000 users registers with DID, 6000-12000 transactions that affect impact score recorded to the Cardano blockchain. In addition, they also measure project development based on Milestones & Deliverables plan which will be reported monthly and in the final report for Catalyst.

Atala PRISM facilitates KYC compliance, impact point certification, and asset transactions with trust and transparency, ensuring traceability and transparency of transactions/action points dynamic using blockchain technology. Thereby user actions will be recorded on the Blockchain motivating everyone to realize their full potential of the positive impact increasing the reliability of resources in the ecosystem.
