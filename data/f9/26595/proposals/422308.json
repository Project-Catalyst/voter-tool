And its solution is to build NFTs on Cardano into an Augmented Reality adventure platform that can be played anywhere outdoors on iOS/Android mobile devices. There is clarity about the problem, the solution, and how they relate to the challenge. The proponent will provide an AR game platform that will allow users to both plays and create outdoor content. These experiences can be enhanced while creating real-world utility for Cardano by implementing scarce digital items and other state tokens that can be validated on-chain. Implementing NFT will drive Cardano adoption naturally as it provides a useful way to experience NFT natively in the context of an AR game that users already enjoy. A clear and understandable solution was provided in the proposal to clearly describe the targeted problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately, as the feasibility of the proposal is very low, we have little information on the roadmap, budget, and team. It can be said that the proposal has no roadmap. What we do know is an explanation of what will need to be done, and what activities will be developed. However, this is not in the form of a timeline, there is no phase division or concept of time here. The proponent will need to break this explanation down into smaller, project-phased parts that will need to be linked together. Ideally, these phases will include a list of tasks and each task must also be set for a specific month and be told how long it will take to complete. Therefore, I disagree that there is a good picture of the process here. Next comes the budget, the proposal asks for a pretty hefty $300,000, and explains that $240,000 will be used for 2 developers, and $60,000 will be used to further fund content creation, marketing, and the underlying digital infrastructure. The above information cannot at all convince us that this is the right amount. We need to know how long these 2 developers will be working on this project, their hourly wages, what is the marketing campaign of the proposal, and how much it will cost to implement. With such a large amount of money, I think a detailed explanation of the budget is necessary.\nFinally, about the team, we were also provided with the information of a few members, we knew their names, areas of activity, and LinkedIn links of some members. Of course, this information is not enough to know the capacity of this team to carry out the project. I think the proponent should provide some more information about each person's role in the project, their experience, and their involvement in the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Because we don't have a roadmap, we don't know exactly what to expect from the development of this project. The proponent has some metrics to track how NFT impacts the way users:\n\"-Are these players moving on NFT-generated assets versus non-NFT-generated assets?\n-Are these users looking for NFT outside of our platform and are they adopting Cardano for other use cases?\"\nHowever, with that said, we couldn't visualize the process of the project, so my suggestion is that this roadmap is elaborated, then the proponent and his future team will come up with an overview of how activities are going each month, not only of the partial results obtained but also of how they work hours, is everything going according to plan?

Though somehow never mentioned in mainstream (crypto) media, Cardano is the best blockchain for NFT since it does not require any smart contract, transaction, and fee determinism, and of course, cheap fees. The proposer team has come to the right blockchain. The proposal basically wants to tokenize the items in their open world-AR game into Cardano NFT so it has real value outside the game that can be utilized in real world. This will make playing their game worthwhile, possibly advancing the Play-To-Earn niche. This undoubtedly will impact Cardano in terms of greater adoption and utility of its blockchain technology.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team looks solid with some right expertise in general business, videography, developer, and legal area. They also shared their LinkedIn profile. Company was just founded recently so there is not much can be said regarding the track record. 90% of the budget (USD 240,000) will be used as the salary for 2 primary developers, each will get USD 60,000 annually for 2 years. The hourly rate will be USD 28 for each of them. Considering their expertise, I will say it might be a fair price. The rest of the fund (USD 60,000) is allocated for content creation, marketing, and basic digital infrastructure, which is also probably fair.\n\nMinting NFT itself in Cardano is not too hard (I have tried it using Cardano cli) but integrating it with the rest of their game will be the challenge. As of now, looking at the limited capabilities of the team I am not too sure about the outcome. There are companies in Cardano specializing in NFT that might be able to help them such NFT-MAKER.io and I am sure they would love to work with a good idea proposal such as this one. Otherwise, they can go to incubators or launchpad in Cardano such as GeniusX or Kick.io to familiarize themselves with Cardano ecosystem and tech stack, refine their idea, and probably get some assistance with Catalyst or even securing alternative funding too. The proposer also outlined that NFT implementation might not be user-friendly enough to encourage more adoption of the platforms. Unfortunately, the proposer has not mentioned any action or plan that can mitigate this risk.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The AR platform is in beta and will be released in US this year and worldwide in 2023. Since in the budget breakdown the proposer mentioned 90% of the fund will be used to commit the 2 primary developers fulltime until the project release. In my opinion the timeline of 2 years is too long for a single Catalyst proposal. My suggestion and often the best practice here is to scale down this proposal into smaller budget and define shorter goals and less complex, more concrete and realistic deliverables. I cannot find the Github of the primary developers so it makes things more difficult to ensure they have the capabilities to deliver the idea of the project and implement this proposal. Still, the metrics measured are acceptable to be applied as the success indicator of the project and the success itself is sufficiently defined as well.\n\nFor now, I wish the best of luck for the proposer and his team.

This particular proposal combines Augmented Reality and NFT collecting to allow users to create \"experiences\" for others and award potentially valuable NFTs through the proposed platform. This might be a good idea to combine fitness or entertainment apps with the Cardano blockchain and serve users that currently use popular apps like Samsung Health App or even Pokemon Go. If implemented well, this has the potential to bring CNFTs to users outside Cardano, or even outside the crypto world. To have impact, successful implementation to a playable/usable beta would be necessary, and while the proposal promises this limited to a local roll-out, the proposal does not provide sufficient detail about the user experience or app mechanics or how this platform could provide usability to other apps or developers. The key element, AR, would benefit from a much more detailed description to allow the voter to gauge the possible impact, either by comparing it to existing apps or platforms, or by providing a clear vision, for example with mock-ups, a demo, sketches, anything to convey the direction with possible use cases and some hints of the targeted UX look-and-feel. In its current form, the proposal may fail to create meaningful impact and does not fit the challenge setting, but I see the potential in the core idea and hope that the proposers will provide much more detail and share some their enthusiasm about the project with the reader of the proposal - either on their website or in a future iteration of this proposal. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal is highly ambitious in that it plans to create an AR activity or adventure platform that awards NFTs for successfully solving puzzles that other people could create. Unfortunately, I personally fail to follow the vision that the proposers have, as a lot of details are missing and instead rely on buzzwords. The proposal could have been improved a lot by elaborating on vague terms like \"experience\" and \"adventure\" - would the proposed game look more like Pokemon Go, Axie, is it geotagging or a fitness app? What kind of tasks would NFTs be awarded for, and what skills do the developer expect people to have to create \"experiences\" for others? The submitted information is quite brief and lacks mock-ups or a detailed vision of the optics or mechanics of this app, the website is \"coming soon\", but given the large budget I would expect something quite immersive and at or beyond MVP stage to deliver on intent. Collecting and trading NFTs seem to be part of the proposed platform, but the proposers are very light on detail. The team does not currently possess AR skills or blockchain development skills that would be sufficient to carry out the project successfully, and the majority of the large budget would be required for freelance work, which could threaten the long-term viability of a project this ambitious. It should be expected that a detailed timeline is provided, especially for the size of the budget requested, and milestones (at least 3, ideally 4 or 5) would have given a much better picture of the development process planned.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal lacks any quantifiable metrics to measure its success. The budget is broken down into only two parts, $240k for hiring freelancers, and $60k for other items/team. This is not sufficient in my opinion, not for any proposal but especially not for this kind of funding amount. The proposers state that they are passionate about the project and have worked on it in their free time prior to proposing (and I like to believe them) but no evidence of any prior work is presented, maybe it was not considered important or too confidential.

According to the author, these NFTs might be utilized as identification for a number of game elements and sections, which would encourage players to purchase and take part in order to win these NFTs. Because it offers a practical means to explore NFTs natively in the context of an AR game, the author expects that this will organically encourage the adoption of Cardano. This is a localized rather than a global solution because the proposer makes no effort to explain how this could benefit the ecosystem as a whole as opposed to merely enhancing its own platform. Perhaps a lot more value would be added to the chain if the feature were released open-source so that everyone could utilize it. The risks and obstacles also appear to be somewhat understated; with a little more investigation and clarification of the integration plan, the team may have received full scores for this part.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of viability measures, the roadmap is inadequate to support such a huge ambition. The assessors have relatively little information at their disposal to analyze the feasibility indicators. The fact that their main platform is already in beta testing and they intend to release it by 2023 would be a plus to consider, assuming the validity of the plan. The other sections, though, are difficult to understand with the naked eye. There are no fixed deadlines or clear milestones established for the addition of NFTs to their platform. Given that the funding is requested to support the operations of two of their developers for the duration of two years if the feature integration is also taking them two years, first of all, that is a huge time gap between the initiation and completion, and the author could likely raise funds in a phase-wise manner instead of asking for such huge funds at one go without anything to back up the claims. As a reader or voter looking at their first-ever proposal, it is difficult to develop trust. However, their team members have a good collective experience, making it difficult for me to decide whether to agree or disagree on this section.

The community must track the development with the greatest degree of transparency and proximity given the seriousness of the funds asked for in this proposal. However, the author falls considerably short of offering such trustworthy measures to evaluate the proposal and project's development. The author only addresses the issues he believes the platform will address, but once it receives funding, the community will be more concerned with the process than the result. Therefore, regular reports and updates as well as access documentation and prototype releases could greatly aid in auditing. Perhaps frequent updates to their webpage would be beneficial. Additionally, the KPIs take on even greater significance in the absence of clear milestones. However, it appears that the author did a respectable job of describing what the proposal's success would entail.

Starting with the proposal framing, I find the problem statement to be far too general that this proposal does not uniquely solve for. The idea of the problem statements is to give voters a sense of urgency and uniqueness for the proposal that leaves the impression that the proposal aligns with Cardano\u2019s mission statement to pursue the highest levels of community innovation. In this case, there are many projects in the Cardano ecosystem that are addressing this exact problem statement, so it starts this proposal off with a lacking sense of need. Especially given the extraordinarily high amount of requested funds (amounting about 30x the average Catalyst proposal cost), this proposal has to provide an extreme uniqueness that has transformational potential. Here\u2019s where I have some skepticism. I have a lot of experience with AR games fron Niantic, as I was a beta tester for Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (bit of a failure) and I was a competitive tournament player in Pokemon Go (which makes $1 billion a year and $6 billion all time earnings - which would\u2019ve been decent modeling evidence for this proposal). In Pokemon Go, they had attempted this feature of implementing 3D renderings of real-life landmarks into the in-game map. This feature hasn\u2019t seen any success in the 2 years since they started development. This technology has still seen fruitful innovations come out of it but this feature of creating digital content is a challenge that even the most popular AR game of all time has had a struggle developing. Niantic has recently seen some heavy layoffs recently, which likely has more to do with the global recession instead of the popularity of AR games but I still thought it was worth mentioning. Having seen so many AR games try (and fail) to build something to emulate Niantics success, I need to see unique gameplay mechanics (other than just NFT integration) to be able to generate a sense of optimism. I don\u2019t feel like I get enough substance about this game to make a proper evaluation on the possible impacts. This section needs added detail, quantifiability, and demonstrable uniqueness.

On this team we have an MBA in finance, a video/photo content creator, web developer, attorney, and a unspecified developer (no LinkedIn). This team is missing professional experience in blockchain/NFT development, 3D design/artist, game development/programming, and a sound engineer to fill all the minimum necessary roles for a quality game of this caliber. Based on the capabilities of the core team, there is a question of feasibility. The roadmap doesn\u2019t provide an organized/bulleted roadmap like voters are used to seeing, rather it explains the intent to fund 2 years of operation before full worldwide release in 2023 (currently in beta testing). It goes on to explain that this budget will mainly be funding two primary developers for the 2 year period but does not layout exactly what the developers will be doing or which aspects of the project that they will be working on. With such an expensive budget, voters will definitely want to be knowing what exactly the approved funds will be paying for. The budget reiterates the 2 year intent with an added mention of $240k going to developers and $60k used for content creation, marketing and basic digital infrastructure. In order for voters to properly evaluate efficiency in spending, the section needs to see details like breakdowns of hours of labor (w/hourly rates), the type of content being produced, methods of marketing, costs of digital infrastructure and some brief rationale as to why each of these expenses costs the given amount.

Other external metrics could include social media engagement, amount of content created, number of content views, and general community development. The best Catalyst proposals provide target goals for each of the given metrics and some take the extra step to set progressive goals for different timeframes of the future of the project.
