The solution given to this problem is MENTAIN which will help bring real-world asset returns to the crypto world for affordable, transparent, and safe investment. The problem started and the intended solution presented in the proposal fit the challenge clearly and logically. The author also very clearly presented his solutions, and how to make MENTAIN successful, helping us to be more confident about the problem in question. It also establishes possible difficulties and challenges, demonstrating readiness to deal with adversity. If this succeeds, it will be a big step for Cardano to become popular in some respects, fully achieving what is sought in the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap is divided into 4 milestones associated with specific goals and a defined period. And we understand what activities will take place. In this project, as I understand it, these activities will follow each other, i.e. when one activity ends, another will be performed later. And we also understand what the result of each milestone is.\nNext is the budget, the proposal asks for $100,000, and the proponent has reflected the budget very thoroughly, this is a highly qualified team that will spend a lot of time on this project, driving the development of existing tools and conducting research on the field being studied. We know how the money will be divided into small portions and each of them is clearly explained. In other words, we have a very precise vision of where that money is going.\nAnd finally about the team, in general, I find this section to be excellent, as most professionals provide a good level of detail about their profession, exemplify previous experiences, and provide affiliation about them, about how we can get to know them more directly. In addition to the 6 key members, the proposal also includes a 15-person advisory team, some members of the advisory team are also provided with detailed information, increasing our confidence in the team implementing this project. Therefore, the feasibility is very good, we know in detail all the background information about the scenario, budget, and team and so we can understand for sure the development process of this project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided is sufficient to assess the progress and success of the proposal. The ability to check the progress of the project is very good. The provided KPIs are very clear:\n-Acquired the web dApp at https://metain.io\n-REIT NFT on Cardano.\n-Signed contract with Deloitte (financial and tax audit).\n-Signed contract with CBRE (asset assessment).\n-Notice about custody and property insurance of the Bank Trustee.\n-Complete NFT license agreement (August)\n-Start selling First Chance Trusts (as REIT NFTs)\nWith the information provided, we know what specific goals are expected here and which are related to different areas of the proposal, not just one-sided. Regarding the testability of the project, the publisher says that it will provide a fully managed platform for the Cardano community, so I believe we can track the progress of the project easily.\nAnd finally talking about the success of the project mentioned by the author as \"REIT NFT exchange and ecosystem in Southeast Asia with more than $1.3 billion in corporate assets including investment portfolio Real estate is valued in the stable currency for 5 years\" the author is very aware of the success of the project, which is good because it gives us insight into what needs to be achieved. Therefore, I strongly believe that this proposal if funded will bring great results for the Cardano community", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4248, "q0": "Metain stands as a valid alternative to the current centralized real estate investment funds.\nMetain aims to create a solution that makes real estate investments with cryptocurrencies accessible, transparent and safe.\nReal estate tends to be very expensive and many investors cannot afford to take an underlying position in real estate. In addition, many of the current real estate investments that use cryptocurrencies are not clearly regulated.\nTo carry out this project, Metain aims to purchase assets in the Southeast Asian real estate market to be tokenized (represented on blockchain), for the first sale of REIT NFT,\nREIT NFT which will be issued as a security token. The sale as a security token implies that the NFT is considered as a security, as such the sale will be subject to the laws and regulations governing financial products.\nTokenization also makes cross-border investments easier, while a distributed ledger offers the benefits of secure transaction records and transparency.\nMetain follows the REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) regulation, assuming the sole role of asset manager, while the titles of the properties or assets are managed by a third party bank trustee (write who is and check), who does not own the asset o the property at no time, as this remains the property of the NFT shareholder.\nTherefore, even in the event of Metain's bankruptcy, the assets (under the Bank Trustee's agreement) will be sold by the Bank under the supervision of the law firms Morgan Lewis, DN Legal and following all the protocols of the legal and legal authority to return all funds to our investors.\nSome of the biggest benefits of a REIT are that it can provide both ongoing dividend income and long-term capital gains. Ongoing dividend income can often come from leases which can offer a predictable revenue stream. At the same time, the value of your shares in the REIT may improve as the value of the properties held by the REIT improves.\nThe APY of the NFT is therefore estimated based on the historical value of the asset and two main components that affect the APY include the rental yield and the appreciation of the market value of the asset. The appreciation of the market value of the asset is reassessed annually by CBRE, an international third party (which is / the largest real estate consultancy company in the world).\nTo ensure financial transparency and full compliance with all tax obligations, Deloitte will conduct audits at Metain twice a year. It is a leading consulting and auditing company, the first in the world in terms of revenues and number of professionals.\nOne of the biggest changes in the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) space is that the sector has become highly specialized. When the industry first emerged, the trust would buy virtually any property.\nover time, the industry has realized that the risk-return profiles of each of these investments are different. Therefore, companies have begun to specialize in one of these types of properties. Today, most Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) will only state the type of property they invest in and the risk benefits that accrue as a result in their investment brochure. Investors therefore have more control over where their money is invested.\nIn the case of Metain NFT it is also DAO to increase the decision-making power of investors, who will have the opportunity to vote for the property screening proxy before buying / selling, renting or selling.\nInvestors therefore have more control over where their money is invested than traditional REITs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent provides evidence (linkedin) of their skills in startup development and clearly and precisely defines the number and type of team members needed to implement the proposal.\nFor each team member and / or consultant, the relevant linkedin is provided. The team shows grounded experience in various sectors; maketing, investment banking, financial and real estate investments, wealth management, technology and blockchain. By examining the linkedin, the skills of the members are confirmed by other experts in the related sectors.\nThe budget requested by the proposer will be used for the development on Cardano, while the operating costs are already covered by investments by companies and financiers.\nOn the Cardano development side, additional funding may be requested in subsequent funds for some implementations (wallet app + plug-in, smart contract optimization, metain ecosystem).\nThe budget is divided into identifiable items, there are small discrepancies compared to what I was able to find online, some items require slightly less others slightly more but overall the total required is more than reasonable.\nKey milestones, technical aspects are identified and achievable and verifiable delivery times are provided.\nAmong the main challenges identified by the proposer for the implementation of a successful proposal is the lack of REIT knowledge on the part of the cryptocurrency community and the property acquisition process which must be rapid to avoid other competitive models", "q1r": 5, "q2": "There are milestones with identifiable measures of success and a well-defined time horizon.\nHowever, the key performance indicators are very general and do not specifically measure the added value to the Cardano network. In this regard, it would be interesting to see the evolution over time of statistical data such as:\n-Number of users who own NFT REITs\n-Total value locked in real estate\n- Exchange volume of NFT REITs\n- increase in property cost / rental income", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2531", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 1, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4352, "q0": "Issuing a real estate NFT is a relatively new idea. I think in the Catalyst community there are not many ideas related to real estate investment and management like this. This idea is considered in line with the goal set out in the Challenge \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\". There is a reality currently happening in Vietnam that is: Many projects call for investment but are fraudulent tricks, some other projects call for joint investment but regular investors. lost money or the value of the property has been inflated and no one has verified the value of the property. Before that fact, the proposal has identified the problem to be solved and the solution is the use of NFT - considered a fund certificate (even with annual interest when using NFT - a platform on joint investment) has been increasing the value of the Cardano ecosystem. I think the proposal has a relatively large impact, especially in the real estate market in Vietnam because it contributes to solving the inadequacies in this market (if it is applied in practice). . Scaling up and addressing the challenge is possible but it will take time in the future for the team to develop its proposal to the next level. I like this innovative idea, and see it as a high-tech product related to the Cardano blockchain. I vote 5 stars.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have commented that the number of members in the group as well as the proponents have certain qualifications and especially you have done a great job, one thing is to clearly identify the members through the links of social networks. association (linkedin, twitter), along with accompanying documents to make it easier for the community to identify and trust the team implementing the proposal. This is an important step to increase the feasibility of the proposal. Accompanied by advisors with extensive experience in the field of real estate, marketing and communication. I highly recommend this team and consider it a necessary resource to implement the proposal (5 founding members all work full time for Metain). I realize that most of the money you apply for is used mainly to hire Haskell programmers, train programmers, do audits... It seems the team has taken action to lay the foundation. so a professional organization can make long-term use of not only this proposal but also other projects. I think it makes sense in the same way as the team's plan and execution. I have a question for you: From a technical point of view, is the issuance of NFT based on a decentralized platform? If it is decentralized, on what basis does the team say that it is decentralized when there are still lawyers, banks...? How many NFTs is the team planning to release? And what is the basis for NFT valuation? I ask because it makes it clearer for those who want to learn about the feasibility of the proposal. In short, technically, the team can clarify through my question. Regarding the risk challenges associated with implementation, I am quite convinced with the risks listed in the proposal and add my thoughts: If the project fails or house prices do not increase as expected, Where will you get money to pay investors? Maybe when investing you will choose real estate in the city center, the real estate price there is always high and the possibility of loss is very low. But in fact, there is always the possibility of loss even if the percentage of loss is very small. But if you still lose, how do you compensate investors? Where to get money for compensation? Overall, I am satisfied with the feasibility of the proposal presented by the team. And to confirm the transparency of the proposal to the community, I asked some more questions like just now. Hopefully the team will have good preparations to put the proposal into practice (if funded).\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "You have clearly stated the four milestones that you intend to implement under the proposal. I completely agree with this process. It shows the professionalism and understanding of the market and technology of the team. I have an additional question to verify the transparency of the proposal: I know that there will be intermediaries (law, banks) participating in Metain, so the participation of intermediaries will be possible. Publicly let the community know or not? And is this publicity reflected in specific smart contracts? In terms of performance indicators, the team did what many other proposals did not, which is to provide KPIs. I find this index quite reasonable because the growth rate of household spending and per capita income are closely related to the market, including the real estate market. And finally, I have no opinion on the description of the problem, because the team's proposal is quite clear and easy to understand, along with the solution offered to be satisfactory and reasonable. I love it and encourage the team to continue to build on what has worked well. I completely agree with the transparency of the proposal. However, as you all know, I still have some questions so that if you can, you can further refine your proposal on all 3 aspects: impact, feasibility, and auditability.

Asset-backed NFT can help solve the problem, but it requires a lot of effort and trustworthy parties to put in place. I completely agree with this statement. In order to address this problem, the proposal\u2019s aim is to build the real-world asset-backed NFTs with compelling interest of 15%-25% APY. Following REIT regulations, NFT is SECURITY TOKEN. DAO votes for property screening delegation before buy/sell, for rent or listing. If such a project were to be implemented on Cardano, it would not only revolutionize the housing market in general, but it would also attract one of the world's most profitable businesses, since the real estate market is unquestionably one of the most profitable. Similarly, I believe that both the problem and the solution are relevant, and that the success metrics offered are both appropriate and in line with what this challenge is seeking. Despite the fact that the project is ambitious, the team carefully divided it into four parts, allowing the community to assess the impacts the team expects to make in each step.

Likewise, a detailed, itemized breakdown of the budget is presented. At the same time, it would be great if the proposal provided more analysis and discussion about the funds required to achieve stated goals so that the community can accurately evaluate the budget fairness, for example, $7000 is requested for Project's community building for Cardano in 6 months, as this covers the salary of a community manager and moderators, and other costs such as advertising, seeding, Social Network fees; The hourly rate and projected contracting time must be included, as well as the ways via which the team intends to market. Also, a more detailed description of the team members in each role (who will do this and who will do that) would have been helpful in visualizing how this idea will appear.

The proposal has the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating NFTs that are open for sale to attract REIT participants, creating NFTs for land assets will not be suitable, real estate is an irreplaceable asset just as NFT is unique. The issue has not yet shown a real impact on the Cardano community as well as the development of the Cardano ecosystem. REIT is a form of individuals entrusting their money to invest in real estate, so the assets will have to be valued from a third party, which affects the \"decentralization\" of the proposal, it doesn't align with what Cardano is aiming for. The proposed risks are the lack of REIT knowledge in the e-community, the competition of other models, and the community's confidence in the proposal. The way to deal with risk is not really convincing, for investors to have confidence, the proposal needs to show its true potential, financial ability and ensure that investment sources are not lost. In addition, the proposal should take into account the risk of legality, in Vietnam there is no protection for cryptocurrencies and other forms of investment related to cryptocurrencies.
