This added value is conscious and well explained by the team. The KPIs are really well detailed and correspond in large part with those of the challenge.

The community will be able to follow the progress of this initiative through the platform, the website.

By doing this proposer will be able make people aware about blockchain and crypto.

That said, this will be impactful in reaching the overall fund goals of improving the ecosystem and increasing and preparing people to become members in the Cardano community.

So, an introductory course of this will be appreciated by many.  \nThe team is going to provide live and recorded classes to those who enrol in the program. This will allow the participants to learn at their own time, and the live classes will lead to more interaction between the students, which is a major aspect of a decentralised community. \nHence this project is clearly in lines with that of the challenge.

Also, the design and creation of the educational content is done in the early stages of the plan, hence there is plenty of time for improvement and polishing it as it is the most important piece of the whole project. \nA monthly breakdown of the budget is also provided by the team.

It would definitely take a solid 6 months before students can actually enrol and study the course. So any reports or documentation of the progress in this time is much appreciated by the team.
