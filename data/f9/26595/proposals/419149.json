New worlds can be discovered if the explorers are bold and the team behind Milkomeda (dcSpark) is one of the teams that has been researching and exploring and building layer 2 solutions for Cardano. The Cardano blockchain cannot and is not expected to process all transactions, as some of the traffic could and should be pushed to Layer 2 solutions. Milkomeda is a L2 on Cardano that serves a bridge to other protocols, such as Ethereum, but Milkomeda bridges are being planned for Solana and Algorand. The challenge brief calls for proposals for integrations that can be built in the ecosystem which will provide more opportunities for users to interact with the Cardano blockchain. Well, the crux of this proposal is to allow all Cardano users who migrate to the Milkomeda L2 solution to not lose out on their staking rewards. Two key benefits are evident \u2013 and well summarized by the dcSpark team \u2013 the first of which is that the proposed solution will be a standard for Milkomeda to allow its users to keep earning Cardano staking rewards. Crucially, the team stated that it intends to share the approach publicly so other L2s / sidechains can implement their own variation. I see this proposal as fully aligned with the Challenge and it is clearly able to scale and improves the prospects for the Milkomeda L2, by ensuring that Cardano users benefit from staking rewards while using a L2 solution. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is being implemented by a stellar Cardano ecosystem developer team that consists of dcSpark employees \u2013 who are led by the former Emurgo employees Seb and Nic and Rob Kornacki (head of research at Emurgo) \u2013 Emurgo is one of the three key foundational players that established Cardano, together with IOHK/IOG and the Cardano Foundation. DcSpark \u2013 has been relatively lax in their approach to writing proposals (fortunately, their rate of delivery of functional, unique and valuable solutions - is completely the opposite. Hence, we need to read their proposals in the wider context of their practical experience and well-known commitment. The proposed budget of $100,000 seems realistic for a complex proposal of this type \u2013 we know that these complex architectural solutions on chains are an expensive game to play. The budget breakdown is provided in the form of key components that will be beneficiaries of the overall budget. These components range from implementation of the UTXO selection logic modification to handle the rebalancing, to audit implementation (Solidity/Plutus/Cardano) and last \u2013 but not least \u2013 the blog post & content detailing the solution to help other protocols that also need to implement liquid staking. I commend the team for ensuring that they will use 3rd party auditors. The breakdown could have been broken down into components, but due to the complexity of the task ahead \u2013 the budget was probably given as a lump sum. However, Catalyst rules are rules and I will have to reduce the score for the failure to provide any estimated costs of external audits, external Plutus code contractor, hourly rates / estimated hours to work on the project. This could be avoided in future funds \u2013 if the dcSpark team provided at least a general framework for calculating overall project costs. Without this framework \u2013 lump budgets such as $100,000 seem to be guesstimates to the uninitiated voter or proposal assessor and it harms the feasibility of the proposal. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Wow, reading the proposal and the three steps until full implementation was a learning experience. I would like to commend Sebastian and the team for presenting such a well explained and focused expose on how the staking solution will be achieved. The auditability information provided by the team is excellent. The proposal reveals three steps to achieve the final solution, which are incremental improvements. v1: will see the implementation of the protocol with a single stake pool run by the Milkomeda Foundation. This is the first step that allows Milkomeda users to gain some staking rewards. The plan calls for a next step that will allow delegating to multiple fixed stake pools\u2026. And the v3 of the solution (probably to be financed later) will see what Cardano users are used to on the main chain \u2013 choice \u2013 in the form of delegating to a dynamic set of stake pools voted on by the Milkomeda DAO. The team has a public Github repo for the code and is very active on social media with a strong twitter and Discord presence and are often on Youtube. The proposal would have benefited from a commitment to a regular cadence of updates on this specific proposal \u2013 like a fortnightly regular update on progress or something similar. Fortunately, the team has provided such a clear and effective solution that addresses the problem (and kudos for identifying the problem itself) \u2013 that it will really help with auditability \u2013 as the proposals success/failure will be evident through a solution that either works or not.

In the near future, the Cardano blockchain has many other sidechains (Orbis, Mamba, etc.) launched, the competition to attract users between sidechains will be fierce. Not so, dcSpark will still share this standard publicly so other L2s can build their own variations.

This is one of a series of standards in the whole to improve and develop Milkomeda so the ability to complete this proposal will be within their reach. With a budget of $ 100,000, the proponent also determined that the development of phases V1, V2 will be completed in the third and fourth quarters. When this standard is developed to V3, the funding requested in this proposal may not be enough. They will have another proposal in the next round of funding. Along with the above roadmap and budget number, the proponent also publishes a detailed allocation table for each job.

This proposal creates a technical benchmark at runtime if there is a potential risk that will directly affect user ADA numbers. I appreciate the thoughtful preparation of the proposal team when having a detailed description of the real solution as well as identifying the risks that will be encountered.

The proponent cannot ask the community to wait for the product to come out and then test its success, you must have your own standards, the job of the community is just to test and monitor the completion Work.

In this case, the project is for enabling liquid staking on the Milkomeda sidechain which they built.\nThe purpose of this is to encourage people to move their ADA there, because L1\u2019s cannot scale infinitely, so in the end, people will have to move their operations to L2\u2019s as well. The proposer argues that in order for that to happen however, staking (which can only happen on the L1 momentarily) must be enabled on L2\u2019s so that they are competitive.\nThe technical details are presented in a satisfactory manner in my opinion and I encourage voters to go through them in the proposal, as they are too much to reiterate here. It\u2019s obvious that a lot of research still needs to go into this liquid staking approach before it can be implemented, but this is what the proposal is for, after all.\nRisks related to network congestion were identified as well, although there does not seem to be a concrete plan to mitigate them. It\u2019s good that the team is aware of them however, since that\u2019s the first step towards avoiding them.\nI agree that this proposal effectively addresses the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge, as developing technologies of this type are necessary to scale Cardano and help it evolve.

The 100.000 USD budget is broken down into separate tasks, but unfortunately, these are not further broken down into work hours and it\u2019s difficult to understand what costs how much. What is clear however is that this is not a simple task and it will take multiple experienced developers to get it done. These will of course be dcSpark employees, the same people who built Milkomeda in the first place, so they are well equipped to build this feature. Additionally, the funds will also be used to pay a 3rd party auditor to verify the code after it is written (I think it would have been good to be transparent and mention which company this is).\nConsidering dcSpark\u2019s experience and the details they have provided, I fully agree that this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.

Staking is the heart of Cardano\u2019s decentralization and security. It should always be encouraged promoted at every level and by one way or another. Layer 2 scaling solutions and sidechains such as Milkomeda will envitably grow in term of numbers and adoptions. This is evident with the emergence of projects such as Mamba and Orbis in Cardano and the existences of Polygon, Optimism Arbitrum, Gnosis, Loopring, Starkware, etc. in Ethereum. Therefore, a liquid staking is one of the solutions necessary to be prepared promptly as an effort to preserve Cardano\u2019s decentralization and security.\n\nA successful and satisfying implementation of this liquid staking will drive more protocols and projects in Cardano ecosystem to gain adoption, impacting the ecosystem positively with great multiplier effects and also inspiring other  cases of possible utilizations through novel protocols and business models that would have been impossible without the more powerful implementation of liquid staking in Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The theoretical and methodological framework on how to do the proposed liquid staking is sound and plausible. Moreover, this schema has been proven in account-based model Ethereum through Lido staked Ether (stETH). The protocol is also usable for staking Solana (SOL), Kusama (KSM), Polygon (MATIC), and Polkadot (DOT) native. In other words, we already have a viable Proof-Of-Concept (PoC). There are still questions about the delegation of ADA liquid-staked in the Milkomeda but some progressive solutions have been derived and will be implemented in 3 upgrading versions. There are few mentions of risk such as rebalancing and downtimes due to technical constraints such as lack of tiered fees or fee markets and/or unexpected congestion during epoch transitions. However, this can be addressed later when Cardano is having the necessary upgrades to tackle or remedy these issues.\n\ndcSpark team\u2019s prowess in building infrastructures, tools, and products in Cardano has been proven in many occasions. The combination of experience, knowledge, and skill will speak for themselves. Too bad that the timeline, key milestones with action plans, and budget is lacking in details and explained too loosely for a proposal requiring higher-level of technicalities and understanding.

Success is defined by users of Cardano sidechains or layer 2 such Mamba and Orbis could continue receiving rewards while using the L2s thus helping Cardano scaling without compromising the Cardano mainchain security and decentralization through the total of ADA staked. These measurements are fair in my opinion.\n\nMoreover, the results and finding from this proposal will also be shared (maybe open-sourced too) with the Cardano community and other similar sidechains projects through blog post, social media content, and Github URL.

The proposal's success criteria align with and resolve the problem. Moving ADA to sidechains will have a negative impact on the entire Cardano network because the total percentage of ADA staked in the network will be reduced, which is critical for Cardano's safety. Additionally, when ADA is moved to sidechains, the staking rewards should be greater than 4% APY. Otherwise, convincing users to migrate sidechains will be difficult. As more people migrate to sidechains, more projects will be able to be built, and computation will be able to scale outside of the base layer.
