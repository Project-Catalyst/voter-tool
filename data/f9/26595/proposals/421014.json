This proposal is so emotional, a community of over 15,000 doesn't have access to internet and computer facility to enhance teaching and learning.

Success of the program also look more brighter as it were, you curtail the movement of young men and women from North East Region precisely Nalerigu to other areas in search of ICT knowledge.

The proposal points to a lack of an ICT center in this part of the region. There is little or no room for the teaming youth in the area to have access to basic ICT skills and resources. These opportunities for interested youths to learn modern trends with the use of ICT tools is lacking.
