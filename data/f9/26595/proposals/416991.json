It is also aligned with challenge as it creates a product (platform) to faciliate Cardano integration amongst its part (challenge kpi \"Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products.\").\n\nHowever, proposer could better ellaborate on the problem statement, to make it clearer what is being solved and what value it has. The problem statement of this proposal is actually the solution already.\nThe platform communiation and marketing strategy could also be better explained. This is imporant to increase the number of users fast. \nLast, as more of a suggestion for future proposals, a screenshot of what the portal would look like (even if just a concept/idea) could be provided to make it easier to undestand how it will work.\n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Starting with the plan, it has a good level of details with deliverables and the activities necessary to develop them. It is time-framed and divided by month. Its nice to see that the platform will be validated tiwh key users as it is being created. an agile life-cycle can help a lot on this.\nBudget breakdown is sensible and encompasses the whole plan. It also contains a good level of details.\nThe team seems to be composed of 4 people with a lof of experience in Cardano, marketing and software engineering. A good level of description is given just as linkedin links. However, it would be nice to understand the role of each person in the project and how it related to the roles in the budget. For example, budget breakdown says that there'll be one back end developer and one front end. it would be nice to see in the team who will perform each. This is speacially imporant because the budget seems to have more people in it than the team here stated. In the 'managing workload' part, it says that they'll have 7 collaborators working with them, but no information is provided about these collaborators so its hard to evaluate their competences.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proposer provides plenty of good kpis for auditing project and they all have targets, which is really good for assessing whether platform have met the desired goals. Reports will also be available in their site (Cardanos feed) and feedback for improvement is considered. My only suggestion would be to include also the product backlog in the reports in case an agile framework is adopted\nAll in all, I strongly agree that the elements provided are sufficient to track progress and measure success.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 1, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3673, "q0": "From the team\u2019s description of the project, it seems like they are trying to build a sort of Linktree for web3 projects. For those unfamiliar, LInktree is one type of those \u201clink in bio\u201d startups where creators on Instagram for example put a link in their bio. Clicking on that link will bring you to the creator\u2019s main link page which contains more links to the creator\u2019s other works which could be their tiktok page, linkedin, onlyfans, websites and anything with a link really.\n\nBut there are multiple implementations of this \u201call-in-one\u201d link and the team did not show any examples, so some visual mockups would be good. Some web2 implementations literally only have links some have pictures acting as links, so it would good if the team could show what they want to build in more concrete terms.\n\nIn terms of impact, this could be big. Linktree became a unicorn just a few months ago and it is easy to see how a web3 version could benefit web3 creators too. It would be easy to see and follow a creator\u2019s projects across different blockchains and platforms, across both web2 and web3 which might span their NFTs, tiktok, Instagram, websites, DAOs etc. Reducing friction for creators and their fans would onboard more people into web3 and cardano. It could also evolve to include use cases we have not dreamt of yet.\n\nOne downside is that web2 versions would out compete a web3 version in the short to medium term as most eyeballs are still in web2 platforms like tiktok and IG. Whereas web3 social media is quite undeveloped in comparison and may not get a lot of users and thus less usage for web3 all in one links. The team also did not articulate how much added benefit a web3 version of LInktree could bring over a web2 version since it only contains links which web2 can handle as well. Also would creators really value the decentralization enough to switch over given that these link in bio startups have pretty good uptime too and they are free to use while the team here wants to charge a fee. Nonetheless, web3 is growing quickly and novel use cases might evolve hence it's still getting 4 stars.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The timeline for the project is well laid out, though like in most proposals this should be taken more as the best case scenario and not enough proposers factor in allowance for unforeseen delays.\n\nThe amount of funds requested seems to be reasonable at first glance and most of it comes down to salaries with 2/3 for 2 software engineers, but given that this type of project is likely to be profit seeking instead of an open source implementation or public good, are these salaries justifiable? Voters have to decide.\n\nAlso, on the aspect of self-sustainability, the team indicated that no further funding from Catalyst would be needed as they could charge a fee for using their all in one link. But it seems doubtful at best as web2 versions like Linktree are free to use and the team did not articulate why creators would want to pay for this.\nOtherwise, it seems like the team has enough experience over a broad range of categories from software engineering to marketing to journalism and content editing and have experience running Cardano Feed which seems to be a yahoo like interface for all things Cardano. They also indicated that they have more people they know who can help and this might be needed given that the team is also working on previous projects from previous catalyst rounds so they might be a bit stretched.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has committed to publish a monthly report on their website Cardano Feed. While there are clear and good metrics to measure their success and impact, it should be noted that unless the data is on chain, voters would have to trust the team to report the metrics honestly.

Finally, the members join the group. We know about the identities and roles of project members. The members are all people with appropriate skills and experience to do the work in the project.

Specifically: Number of visits to the website: 50,000; Number of subscribers: 3,000; Number of Web3 wallets connected: 3,000... This helps us understand how big the project is becoming.

However, some of these things can be more specific and understandable for all readers. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars.
