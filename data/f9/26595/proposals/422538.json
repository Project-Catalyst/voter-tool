From rugpulls to true pieces of art that gain a lot of praise, virality and active trading, the range is very broad, but we need to agree that good art requires financing, logistics, marketing like any other business. Use cases for NFTs are plentiful, and not all of them are for collecting and trading (an NFT could just be a deed on your house in the future, or your resume for the blockchain), so this proposal I think focuses on the meaning CNFT = collectible art NFTs. on Cardano. Creating a job portal on the existing platform of jpg.store, a popular and fully evolved NFT listing and exchange platform, is a good direction for the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge.\nI agree that giving artists more options to build into quality NFT collections and making it easier to use Cardano for cNFTs would indeed benefit the wider ecosystem. A very good match.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Timeline and budget breakdown are on the side of being less detailed, but the links provided give a good picture of the team's experience and existing body of work.

As the project implementation phase is very short, it is slightly less crucial to have a very detailed auditability and process communication as a third to half of the budget will probably be tied to a successful close-out report. The quantitative goals of number of postings and applications may benefit from some sort of qualitative element to filter out spam, but I like the use of a 30% minimum success matching rate. This does sound ambitious and it would have been nice to see some examples from existing dev-specific jobs boards how these measure their success and what kinds of matching rates they are reporting.

In order to safeguard the standing and integrity of the Cardano NFT, it is expected that services and products meet certain quality and offer customers a top-notch experience. There have been numerous instances of projects paying a significant amount of money to find and onboard the best staff. In the form of a job board where developers may list themselves and project managers can employ, the author offers a solution. As a result, users and companies developing Cardano NFTs would adopt it more widely. The author also proposes standardizing criteria to make it simple to screen applications and identify intriguing opportunities. The author also proposes using JPG profiles for people to sign up and specify their areas of expertise to make it easier for seekers to find jobs. Additionally, the author mentions using Twitter and Discord identities to give the entire plan a comprehensive and authentic appearance.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's combined experience is astounding, and given the stellar reputation of the name jpg.store, they appear to be able to launch this project. The timetable provided, despite having more one-liner milestones, is self-explanatory and provides enough information for a reader like myself to understand their strategy. The budget, however, comes to about 26000 USD and appears to be slightly overestimated, but the team makes a great point in stating that the entire team will be supported using this fund and would not be limited to just paying the two main people working on it. They also mention hosting and support as overheads, which demonstrates the team's connection to their project and their intention and passion to work on it. However, a more thorough description of the budget would have benefited the readers.

Although timely reports or announcements could be helpful, there is no quantitative metric available to the community to track the impact the product might have after it is complete, except for the fundamental agile project development activities and ongoing beta testing. Although the success criteria and results are fairly clear and instructive, it is impossible to say whether the success of the product would be measured along the same lines as the campaign's success metrics. Being a terrific initiative and a relatively recent suggestion, I believe the auditability portion should have been better and more justified. Despite the criticisms mentioned above, the team has received funding and implemented projects successfully on a number of occasions, and they already have a top-notch website.

The NFT market constitutes a huge part of the Cardano ecosystem. Despite its mushrooming growth and enormous potential which indicates strong supply and demand for the NFT market, there is yet a \u201cNFT Job Hunting/Recruiting Site\u201d available in Cardano. This limits the ability of NFT project teams to scout for talents who can be a part of the team. For people interested to be part of CNFT project teams, the lack of a job site hinders their participation as there seems to be no official way of being recruited as part of the team. In order to bridge the gap, the team has proposed that a NFT job board serves as a tool for project teams to open job positions. \n\nI believe the proposal has identified several huge relevant impacts from this proposal as a result of the creation of the NFT job board. Essentially, the proposal describes the impacts in a concise manner, consisting of the mechanism of the job board and how it helps growing the CNFT space. I am able to ascertain the relationships between the mechanisms and their associated advantages. \n\nThe metrics and key goals indicate great potential in this proposal, while being aligned with the challenge. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the team\u2019s remarkable track record of forming Cardano\u2019s leading NFT marketplace, I am certain this proposal is feasible. From the formation of JPG.store to its current operation, it showcases a reliable and highly capable team. \n\nHowever, what the proposal is lacking in terms of feasibility is its lack of explanation on ithe team behind this proposal/project. The only information given in this regard is \u201c1 full stack engineer and 1 UX/UI designer\u201d. It lacks the details of the team behind such as qualifications, experiences, their roles in this project and their familiarity with Cardano. Hence, the team did not address one of the most crucial aspects determining the feasibility of all Catalyst proposals. Without a clear explanation on the team, it becomes hard for readers of various backgrounds to ascertain the team\u2019s actual capabilities in delivering this project, hence negatively impacting feasibility. I also have the same issue with the budget breakdown of this proposal. \n\nThere is also a lack of clarity in budget breakdown. For example,employee costs of $5,200 / week. How will the allocated budget be distributed amongst employees? What will it be used for, has it accounted for the possibilities of requiring extra staff? Ideally, we would have a breakdown of pay rates of all members involved for better judgement of feasibility. \n\nRegarding timeline, I think it is reasonable, given the project itself does not present overly-complicated technical aspects. Again, I would suggest the team to provide more clarity in their timeline. For example, under core functionality development, what would be done, when it would be completed, who would be in charge, and how it would be done? Such information is essential for readers to gauge the scale of this proposal with more objectivity. \n\nI think the team has identified the appropriate risk concerning dependencies of email which Web 3.0 is void of in the name of anonymity. While circumventing the use of email, how can we ensure the actual identity of applicants, members merely through Twitter and Discord verifications. This is an area to be tested by the team. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I believe there\u2019s clarity in the description of the problem and its solution in conjunction with the proposal. \n\nThe identified metrics/KPIs are very appropriate for this proposal and challenge as they are great indicators to track the success of this proposal. \n\nHowever, the roadmap has no clear deliverables and milestones useful for the community to audit. Readers can only find vague mention of \u201cTesting & QA - 1 week\u201d. Without further explanation, we will not know what events would take place and why they take place. So, there is no confirmation on what would take place and whether they would be monitored.

I still can't figure out what each member's face is like because the avatars are all NFTs. I think an information site like LinkedIn will be more convincing. In addition, the targets should be specific numbers to accurately measure the progress and success of the project.
