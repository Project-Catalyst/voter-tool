By providing information through engaging courses and tests about blockchain technology, it is evident that it wants to have an impact on Ghanaian youth and aid in growing Cardano acceptance.\nThis idea has the potential to have a significant impact on the ecosystem of Cardano and the catalyst community by promoting growth and fostering a favorable atmosphere for digital solutions. The challenge matches the issue that is outlined in this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team's credentials have been disclosed, and they show that they have the necessary knowledge to design and build this dApp as well as establish connections with the intended audience.

Perfectly suitable proposal Challenge\nThe dApp is aimed at universities, where students are the future of the country. At the same time, Ghana is an African country with an open government on the blockchain, which is also the continent that Cardano always aims for, this is a suitable orientation to increase the probability of the project's success.\nPlease suggest more clearly the roadmap for dApp development. For example, what language is the design in, running sidechain or mainchain, what parts of the knowledge are provided, and reliable reference sources? Please interact with the community to clarify this part, as this is the core element of the project\nAs for the risk, the project is afraid of government blocking.

For the project to succeed, I think it is advisable to associate with a dApp developer who specializes in the real Cardano ecosystem, they will be responsible for working and have expertise in building dApps.\nMembers participate simultaneously in other projects in the fund and in previous funds.

Build an educational Dapp with concise, easy-to-understand content to introduce Blockchain to Ghanaian youth. Problem solving is consistent with the formula in F9, the Dapp has a good effect on the participants. Learners can search for topics of interest about Blockchain and access Cardano through brief lessons on Dapp. Continuity of knowledge helps learners to grow and change the way they view Cardano and Blockchain. Dapp is an application for learners, helping to develop Ghana's young generation, educational Dapps help increase the number of developers in Ghana who actively contribute to the Cardano ecosystem. The solution has a full understanding of the direction of the Blockchain education platform, learners can check their learning results based on smart coins, which is really attractive when learners have incentives such as badges or ADA. The proposal has targeted long limits to increase the percentage of Ghanaian youth who know Blockchain/Cardano and increase transaction ADA. Extend the future goal of Dapp binding and have the effect of increasing the Cardano ecosystem. The author has seen the effects of mainstreaming when there is a deterrent for learners to come to crypto. The workaround is to match the Dapp to be operated with the Company with the subscription activity. I have an opinion about the lack of funding when implementing, the increase or decrease of ADA may cause a shortage of funds for implementation, the author needs to reserve funds for this risk.
