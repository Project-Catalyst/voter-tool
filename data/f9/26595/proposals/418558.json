It would track even yield farming opportunities and NFTs value, which are very popular on the Cardano blockchain, so that users can have a 360\u00b0 visual of the value of their holdings in a single place.

In the problem statement, it talks about the challenge of users tracking all of their assets throughout the ecosystem. Whether this is lending and borrowing, staking, or even value of NFTs. They propose adding additional features and integrating with the top 8 dapps. I think that this project could be extremely useful to investors trying to track all of their different assets in the ecosystem.

These two factors alone do a great job in suggesting the likelihood of the successful implementation of this proposal. There are more features that help support this. The first is the detailed roadmap. The team gives a 6 month timeline that shows exactly what they will be working on each month. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that shows where the requested funds would be allocated if funded. These two sections of the proposal are important because they implement the idea of S.M.A.R.T goals. They are easily measurable because of the specific timeframes given.

There can be more implementation of accountability. The team will help the team reach their goals of following their roadmap. The team will also be more likely to keep the community updated if there are any complications.

The proposer has developed the the DefiYield.app to integrate different protocols; several Cardano defi apps have already been added i.e. SundaeSwap, MuesliSwap, while supporting all the main Cardano based wallets. These can be seen in the video provided (https://youtu.be/buUDds3peJ8). This proposer has built an impressive dapp that takes advantage of multiple blockchains (EVM and non EVM) and hopes to add more protocols within the  Cardano ecosystem, giving user's the most up to date portfolio as possible. As NFT collectors and investors in the Cardano community grow at a rapid pace, it can be rather difficult and overwhelming to track all your assets & tokens. This is a critical feature for the continued growth of new users coming to the blockchain for different dapps and services, or just NFTs alone. Using these protocols to view all of one's assets and potential gains is something many have been waiting to see be implemented on Cardano since the first CNFT marketplaces launched. The proposer's solution to the problem has incredible potential to expand the Cardano ecosystem by the use of this application which brings multiple protocols together from many different blockchains. The rationale for Impact is a 5 based on how useful this solution will be to the Cardano community seeking such a tool.

If these members were to have any LinkedIn profiles or socials available, it might help voters feel more confident in the proposal's validity, but at this time that information is difficult to find. That said, the proposer has included a number of other documentation from what's been accomplished thus far in regards to their existing functioning application, found here (https://docs.defiyield.app/welcome/readme). The plan to integrate this solution as fully operational on the DefiYield.app is broken down into a 6 month timeframe which seems more than reasonable to produce a secure and working product without rushing what's important. The developer's cost (2), which is said will be rotated based on skillset over the course of the 6 months is where 90% of the budget will be allocated from the funds requested. A project manager will be on board, notably Anton Kosiak as the Technical Lead, to oversee the team and their progress.

Tracking the progress of the proposed solution and when the milestones are of the proposal are met, is somewhat vague from the proposer, as it'll be up to the community member's to see what new features are released & available on https://defiyield.app/. It was stated by the proposer that documentation will be submitted, but it would be ideal if and when the described milestones on the roadmap are completed, Project Catalyst members can clearly see these detailed here: (https://github.com/defiyeld-app/api-docs/blob/main/README.md) for the utmost transparency.

This will help investors conveniently monitor profits and control risks. Especially in the field of electronic money - a financial sector that is very attractive to investors around the world. However, coupled with high returns, the risks in this market are huge. From that, I see that the proponent raised a very important issue and a large impact scale. The Cardano ecosystem is expanding and thriving, Cardano's community is global, but it's hard for users to find all the opportunities and keep track of their portfolio.\nThe solution proposed by this proposal solved that problem. By creating a dashboard (DeFiYield) to integrate all of Cardano's top protocols, the aim is for users to be able to track all their investment portfolios, including tokens, ADA staking, pools, vaults, lending and borrowing, and more, even pooling multiple addresses together. All Cardano NFTs will show up on this dashboard, helping users keep track of what NFTs they own and how it's performing in the market. Additionally, this app will extend the discovery engine for Cardano. The author described his solution in great detail and argued closely and logically. Using illustrations and providing short videos to describe the solution makes it easier for readers to visualize and quickly understand.\nI found this proposal to meet the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge. Since it creates the application on Cardano, the integration of dApps and the Defi protocol makes it easier for users to follow and discover more.

Reading in the whitepaper I see that the project has a token issuance (DEFI) and there is information about Tokenomics and Governance.\nThe project's budget accounted for 1.12% of the total budget for Challenge. This budget breakdown is very detailed. The amount has been split into 5 parts (developer, project management, documentation, marketing, and community engagement). Each part is explained and calculated in detail and clearly.\nThe author has described the information about the team members very fully and in detail.

This proposal brings some practical benefits to fulfill the aim of managing users\u2019 assets.\nFirstly, one click-dashboard has been developed on a variety of blockchains that have outstanding growth in the number of dApps and users. Thus, this tool will greatly help not only users but also retailers or professional management companies. Furthermore, the development on the Cardano network and dApps, which have integrated more than 20 blockchains, can guarantee the quality of dApps. For this reason, the idea provides an opportunity to attract more users and widely advertise Cardano to other communities.\nSecondly, dApps are considerably improved when they enable users to track NFTs and tokens. NFTs is an indispensable trend, in some cases, the volume of NFTs may be greater than the volume of tokens.\nFinally, the decentralization of the dApps is a notable feature that I want to emphasize compared with apps used by traditional banks. Consequently, the transparency of dApps will increase significantly. In the future, if it is possible to integrate asset transfers between different blockchains and optimize transactions, the dApps will really help the users.\nI will score 5 points for the impact due to these above advantages.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All asset-related indicators will be updated by the dApps in the most detailed and accurate way because the proposal expands the one-stop-shop model.\nI notice that the current website and products are presented very smoothly and have demonstrated the quality of previously integrated blockchains, so the proposal looks promising for larger expansion in Cardano and bringing a smooth experience to the users.\nA good point of the proposal is that the team enables users to continuously keep updated with APR/APY data, NFTs data, and display the asset value with corresponding USD value. Moreover, the team also creates tutorial videos and has version updates for the users.\nThe proposal provides a good tool for the community to closely monitor the transparency of other projects, including dev wallets, investor wallets, and whale wallets. Any changes or movements that contradict previous statements will be immediately noticed by the community.\nIn addition, there is another risk that has not been mentioned in the proposal. This tool also creates conditions for hackers and scammers to track wallet addresses that have a great asset to attack. To deal with this problem, the proposal should create tools such as sending notifications to email or phone numbers when there is a suspicious transaction. Furthermore, I suggest the proposal should develop a support team for the community, and this service can expand to trial and premium versions with more in-depth features, thereby creating a sustainable development business model and attracting developers for Cardano.\nFor the above reasons, I will give 4 points on the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Generally, the dApps are able to track the asset, the number of users, and their feedback. These metrics help the team to easily assess how successful the project is.\nFirstly, the proposal was developed by an experienced team; in addition to Cardano, the website promises that it would link many other blockchains; the team's skill has been partially verified. Furthermore, the features of this project can be easily checked by users due to the publicity of blockchain.\nSecondly, the tool also displays the amount of activity in the community, as well as the level of asset interaction between platforms, or in other words, it is a temporary on-chain assistance tool for users. Moreover, the tool can evaluate the efficiency of capital use of the ecosystem and the level of asset turnover, thereby contributing to attracting cash flow from other ecosystems. In the future, it will be more competitive due to the fact that multi-chain is inevitable. There is a possibility that this model will sustainably and stably develop when earning revenue because asset management is an essential demand.\nInitially, the proposal stated that the dApps would focus on accuracy since any error harming users' finances would cause distrust in the community. I think the team should concentrate on monitoring and developing the total asset metric due to its importance to the users; it could also reflect the accuracy and trustworthiness of the proposal.\nAltogether, I decided to give 5 points for the auditability of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3368", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We would like to thank the reviewer for their careful reading of our submission and providing a very clear and motivated assessment.\n\nRegarding the Feasibility section, we would like to reassure the reviewer.
