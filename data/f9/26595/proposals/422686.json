The project is not a governance system per se, but a platform focused on resolving disputes. The fundamentals of \u201cincrease the number of integrations that unite existing solutions for a more integrated and connected experience across different products\u201d and \u201chigher quality of existing products and integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased community use\u201d, present in the challenge summary, are also achieved, even if (again) indirectly. I say this because the dApp suggested here can improve the integration of existing solutions while there is this conflict resolution, and if these solutions are properly proposed, this can in fact integrate and better connect our community. Which, of course, would increase the quality of the products/community involved in the situation. To better understand what the idea is, the proponent uses the Catalys proposal evaluation system as an example. To combat what he calls risky social interactions, a form of organizing disputes would be developed. He says these resolutions would be based on community values, which I believe might be abstract concepts - who will define them? This reminds me a little of the question of defining what are the parameters of governance of the Cardano community as a whole, when we undergo changes that are proposed by the company that finances the Cardano project. Therefore, it would be interesting to understand if there would be any research so that the values \u200b\u200bof each community could be defined in a more democratic way. Talking about the use of the dApp itself, the proponent goes on to explain how a conflict resolution would be done based on the activities of the PAs. The values \u200b\u200bdefined here would be: giving high marks for good evaluations and low marks for those that would not be financed = this would correctly conceptualize the activities of a PA. And if a PA had his assessment removed, he could file an appeal in a kind of court, where other parties could have a voice to say what would be done in relation to this case. I thought it was very interesting that he gave an example that is common to all of us, but I think that the parameters that would be chosen would vary greatly by situation to be resolved and also by the community with which we work, and it would be important to be sure of how would be defined. The idea itself is very good, and if executed correctly it can represent an effective and alternative way to resolve conflicts in our community. Despite this, the idea is not exclusive, as a company that has already been financed by Catalyst (Loxe Inc.) develops a similar project: \u201cLegal Technology / Mediation / The win-win dispute resolution market that helps resolve disputes in days - not in months\u201d (concepts that can be found on the company's website). Other than that, it's not so clear how blockchain technologies would be used: would each party have a decentralized identity? Would smart contracts represent decisions made? Would NFTs be generated somewhere in the process? For these reasons, the topic is fine, but not perfect.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is viable, but some parts could be a little better, as I will explain in my comments below. The script presented is very good, I believe it is the best part of the feasibility. We know what would happen in a lot of detail and the defined stages are not very large time intervals, which helps us understand what would be done and when. Despite this, the information is still passed in a very technical way, from what I understand we are told which technological solutions should be available according to the passage of time; for example in stage 1 they would be: \u201ccourt \u2013 Economic implementation: procedural fees, compensation of incentives; Automatic Assignment and Judge\n+ research and development law framework to make them more transferable across jurisdictions and compatible with a wide range of real-world cases + reputation research and development engine to allow evaluation of different types of entities in a customizable way\u201d and etc. . So it would be very interesting if, in addition to these final definitions, the proponents had also commented more exactly on what must be done behind, the daily work that would result in these partial successes - I will touch this topic again in the auditability part. A compliment I would like to make is in relation to the roadmap provided in Notion, I found it very practical, ergonomic and beautiful. In general, the information given here is good, but it is not 100% ideas because it does not allow us to have such a clear view of the processes. Now talking about the funding, the amount requested is very high, at $295,890, and it is not explained in such a detailed way. We have some fixed parts like: developer salary, marketing, design, administration, services, unexpected expenses and etc. The problem is that each of these parts is very high and needed explanation. Mainly the developer's (or developers') salary: in stage three you are asked for 50k dollars, how would that money be shared? How many professionals would work on this part and what would be the value of their working hours? What would the marketing campaign look like and why would it cost $39,700 on its own? Why is so much money ($26,890) asked for unexpected expenses? What would happen to this amount if it was not used? In my view, funding is very expensive and is above the amounts that I usually see requested in Catalyst proposals, and for that reason, it would take a lot more detail and argumentation so that we could understand the need for such a high investment. The team's presentation also leaves some points to be desired, as apparently no one on the team is very experienced with Cardano (no one claims to have much involvement with the community and has already developed other projects). Some people provide a brief description of their professional activities and also their linkedin profiles, others just explain what they do (it would be better if all of them give us links to linkedin). It would also be positive if the CVs were presented at length, so that we could get to know each stakeholder better. That said, I think this topic is generally ok, but it needs to improve, we have positive points like the script, but more detail is needed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Yes, the proposal is auditable, the proposer tells us various ways in which we can chart and monitor both progress and success, but I have a few observations to make. In the progress part, we are presented with several KPIs, it is very positive how they are quantitative (number of users, cases, cases/day, of structures in Cardano that decided to use YJ, of interaction in a certain social structure and the number of interactions ); but they are also qualitative (quality of interaction in a given social structure). In my understanding, the suggested KPIs say a lot about the partial results, but not so much about how we could monitor the progress and the activities that would be behind the construction of the parts cited in the roadmap. With this, it is necessary that the team, in addition to providing us with what can be checked periodically, also provide us with reports that detail their work routines, at the end of each month, so that we can understand how each stage is being built. . It would also be important to perform an accountability, we know that Catalyst funding is released gradually, but we don't know how to control if these payments are being used well, as promised. And in the case of extra expenses, for example: if they are not necessary, how could we audit their use? For these reasons, I think that while the proponent has provided us with great KPIs, a more complete analysis could also be provided on the phasing and small advances. Regarding the success scenario, my comments will be similar as an ideal scenario is drawn (\u201cYJ's reputation has become a valuable resource among Cardano members, stakeholders in different parts of the Ecosystem are using YJ's reputation to make decisions, communities rely on YJ as a standard instrument for dispute resolution and mediation\u201d and so on); but it is not clear how the Cardano community could prove that all this was achieved. I also think that a more careful study needed to be done on how all this would have impacted Cardano, how we could verify if the challenges of the challenge had been achieved and so on. So my suggestion is 1) that the team do a research that demonstrates how dApp contributed to the resolution of conflicts, in a precise and practical way (with information that can be verified in reality); 2) to study the way in which people using the platform would be engaging in the community and would have become active members. Finishing the reasoning, in my understanding we do have good ways to audit the proposal, these improvements could be made so that this monitoring becomes even more palpable, accurate and achievable.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6741, "q0": "This proposal definitely targets a very important and untapped market niche, but I also feel that  it has cast too wide of a net and it is not very easy to distinguish its core value proposition. \n\nStarting with a very broad problem description telling us the world is unfair in many ways, the proposal is to build a web3 reputation layer. Immediately good news is that the proposal is complemented with a mock-up video as well as a landing page that has (limited) functionality into how it would function, and the extra photo pop-ups here and there definitely make its understanding quick and easy. Good job! \n\nHowever, drilling down into the details, the model seems to necessitate a fairly high level of input from users, who will need at some point in time to populate the platform with \u201csouls\u201d which right now are probably added centrally by the team, and then proceed to upvote or downvote these souls. But the process doesn\u2019t end here, since adding this event is not the end of it - there have to be witnesses and judges involved in order to modify one soul\u2019s reputation. This seems an overly complicated model, especially since it aims to be used for persons and businesses alike. So it won\u2019t only act as a social reputation platform, it will also be an alternative court and dispute resolution mechanism. A very tall order to start with. \n\nI am also not convinced that a blockchain solution would be cost effective - those offering reputation and making actions would basically have to subsidize all of their peers\u2019 social scores. Also, the team does not mention at all transaction costs and network utilization. Since it will be a blockchain solution that means a myriad of mini transactions have to be recorded perhaps: upvotes, downvotes, new profile, challenges, witness actions, judges actions, etc, all of them with minimal interference for the end users and seamless integration. Despite this challenge there is nowhere in the proposal any meaningful discussion on necessary throughput, transaction costs and the adequacy of the Cardano ecosystem for this. \nI would have really appreciated for the team to sit down and come up with a very targeted niche in mind, something that would be meaningful, easy to implement and cost effective, and something of value to a wide range of people, or a white label solution that can be implemented off-the-shelf for various applications.  \n\nIn its current state, I feel the proposal lacks the specificity needed to be turned into a viable product within the Cardano ecosystem, and deem three stars as sufficient. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A very poignant first impression about the team is the fact that they have a very focused Russian geographical presence, with the first person on the team being Timur Artemev, an angel investor and co-founder of a Russian mobile phone retailer Euroset. This in itself is certainly not an issue, merely a point of reflection given the current geopolitical context and potential for prolonged sanctions and disruptions to businesses and free flow of labor and capital.\n\nThe project itself is divided in three stages, each including a number of activities, features and estimated time to deliver. The timeline is complemented by an external link with an even more in-depth timeline, however which does not seem to have been updated lately and does not offer visual cues as to what is finalized and what is in progress - and this should have been the case since the project already has a functioning website application. \n\nThe budget is very briefly described in an embedded photo (small table) that is split by stage and type of activities. While not entirely bad, a proposal asking for 300k USD should have definitely included more details on how the budget would be consumed, and definitely needed to have hourly rates applicable and estimations of time needed for completion.\n\nA rather worrying point is that the team does not drill down into the financial details, although it claims to target sustainability after 4-5 months of mainnet launching due to various monetisation models: commissions, legislation, emotion marketplace, etc. I find that treating this subject in such a light manner is rather detrimental and takes away greatly the project\u2019s merits, since it is overly optimistic to make such claims and not back them up with hard evidence, projections and a really strong case for being able to stay afloat after such a short time. \n\nConsidering all the elements above, I have to again maintain a neutral stance and only offer three stars for this proposal\u2019s feasibility. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team wishes to track the project\u2019s activity through a number of indicators: users, cases, volume of cases, types and numbers of interactions and percentage of disputes. Success on the other hand, would result in the application delivering a valuable resource across Cardano members, with reputation being sought after - in a similar fashion perhaps to being a well seen Amazon retailer, or as a restaurant having good reviews on delivery apps. The approach is fairly sound and I can\u2019t find much fault here, and so I am going with four stars - since five are definitely out of the question considering the very complex and untested business model and the uncertain financial sustainability in the long term. Also, the team makes no mention of aiming for an open source architecture that can benefit the entire community. An audit of their smart contract is however briefly mentioned, but not specifically accounted for in the budget. Considering all of the above again, four stars are sufficient.
