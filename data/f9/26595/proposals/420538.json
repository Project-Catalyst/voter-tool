After all, the competition from product and service providers will always benefit the consumers and end-users in the end. The Bashoswap is promising rapid, non-batched transactions with improved trust, reduced latency, and no extractable value. Moreover, the swap-verifier service from this transaction-chaining model will also offer new business opportunities for our Stake Pool Operators and Input Endorsers, which is a very desirable bonus for the community especially during this bear market. Overall, I believe there is no reason not to build if we have the resource and capabilities, so I support the implementation of this proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I see no concern about the ability of the proposers to deliver this proposal. They have the experiences and skills to deliver based on their respective track records in business and project management, product design, developers, and marketers. The budget is also well-detailed, transparent, and easily understandable, and also more importantly, is reasonable for the premier service of MLabs. Possibility of future funding is also mentioned which is acceptable since the project has been self-funded so far but still have grassroot/community origin.\n\nNo team is better to deliver and implement the idea of this transaction-chaining DEX other than MLabs who have helped build Liqwid, SundaeSwap, Ardana, etc and other flagship brands of DeFi dApps in Cardano. Some risk related to implementation have also been outlined and addressed but too bad that mitigation plans are not clearly mentioned yet. Lastly, since we have already seen a working on-chain prototype in Milkomeda, that adds further conviction to me that this project will deliver and achieve sufficient success.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I have minimal worries too in the credibility of the members since they provide necessary LinkedIn, Github, and social media accounts which are open to be followed and tracked by anyone interested. The website of the company and functioning dApp prototype also helps the auditability aspect. Progresses and developer updates will be made into content such as blog posts and demo videos. Public Q&A sessions and AMAs with the community are also the way to go.\n\nDeployment in the testnet is also the right step to take. Lastly open-sourcing the smart contracts and other resources so other developers can utilize similar solutions across the Cardano ecosystem is very respectable and highly appreciated.

On their first stage, the team will create a simple centralized swap verifier service. Later on they will decentralize this design. One way to decentralization may create business opportunities for SPOs and Input Endorsers. The solution will enable everyone building on the chain and enable user experiences as we make progress on the chain together.

This is a high risk endeavor and failure is not unlikely, either by finding flaws in the underlying logic that make the new approach not feasible at all, or by difficulties in overcoming design challenges that make the project peter out without much more additional funding and know-how thrown at it. A lot of work has already been put into this project over the last half year without Catalyst funding, and this proof of concept / research stage proposal to bring it to the next level seems a highly worthwhile albeit risky experiment if it can be carried out with necessary commitment and resources.

The CEOs LinkenIn profile is listed and shows 7 \"present\" jobs, including CEO of Bashoswap. MLabs are listed as part of the team, but have (not yet) added Bashoswap to their clients listed on the official website. As the individuals working on the project apart from MLabs do not claim to be skilled in Cardano development or Plutus, the hourly rates for development seem too low for work required by MLabs and there is no clear implementation time horizon. I see all this as risk factors for the successful implementation of the proposal. Just too much of the project's success depends on what is apparently \"external\" development, and no confidence is instilled by risk assessment, risk mitigation, or a roadmap and development goals that would showcase how the somewhat slow documentation process over the last months could be streamlined once the project is funded.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposers make good use of their own website, Gitbook and Youtube to communicate their ideas and progress. The proposal does not provide a detailed timeline or milestones sufficient to track its progress over the implementation period, but is intended as a proof of concept where this would be quite difficult. I would recommend using some kind of project management tool or Github to communicate what is going on with development, and also break down the project into some periodic testing and reporting check-ins to make the voter more confident about the feedback and rapport from the proposers. I would really like to see the proposers firm up the commitment from MLabs to co-propose or provide evidence for their involvement in the development process, and  for example invite the community to share their progress on Discord and Github.

The language is technical at some parts and the ease with which the proposer is convening his message is indicatory for the experience and the deep understanding in the area.\nThe proposer has worked through Q1 and Q2 of 2022 on this project, and currently has a working onchain prototype capable of executing swaps. For this the proposer presents a video.\nThe proposer considers risks related to the first mover with this new way of creating dexes.

As far as the team says, this will be a first implementation of such a transaction model, but it would have been useful perhaps for the team to expand on the difference between their new model and the way in which Sundaeswap works (which is also an automated market maker style DEX, in contrast to Muesliswap with an order book).\n\nThere is thus a very good connection between  the proposal and the challenge, as well as scalability potential since the solution will be open sourced and can be used down the road by other developers. Five stars.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I will focus on a few pieces of information that, taken individually, are only small flags. Together, that should be up to every individual voter to decide how important they are. \n\nFirst, the development will be outsourced to Mlabs. MLabs has a team of over 80 devs and as a company that are an IOG Plutus partner, they have already been involved in plenty of Cardano projects, with the most known ones perhaps being Sundae swap and Liqwid. Mlabs appears consistently in many proposals in this funding round - and without deep and intimate knowledge of their pipeline, actual and planned resources, it is impossible to assess whether their workload in the future will be affected by many of the many projects they have pledged to take onboard if successfully funded. So this is just a question mark regarding their capacity to deliver in the future, on time and within budget, all their ongoing work. \n\nSecond, Ahmad, the CEO of Bashoswap, is also involved in Joghar - a Fund 9 proposal that was largely left unfinished, and is simply a small flag regarding his commitment to the projects that he is part of. Is he fully dedicated to Bashoswap or is it one of many, and risks turning into another Cinderella in the near future? There is no way to know this at this moment. \n\nThird, the team states that the budget shows \u201cconservative numbers and it is likely that the project will be seeking additional funding\u201d. Should the voters read this as a \u201cwe\u2019re not sure we can deliver on our promises with this budget\u201d message or is it simply a poor choice of words?\n\nFourth, just to quickly go through the development numbers - 900 hours estimated in total, charged at 70 to 90 USD/hour by Mlabs, without a clear deadline or milestones. Bashoswap / Mlabs could have definitely done a better job at providing more details regarding the timeline. \n\nI shall err on the optimistic side here and subtract only one star for the project\u2019s feasibility. But subtracting two I think would have also been a sound judgment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It\u2019ll be so easy for the community to audit an open source project, so no big worries here. On top of this, the team also promises updates through social media, video demonstration and FAQ sessions with the community. For Bashoswap success will represent a successful smart contract that proves the concept of transaction chaining, improved throughput and reduced latency compared to batching. All of these should be fairly easy points to demonstrate if somebody will decide to run an on-chain comparison of Bashoswap vs. other Cardano DEXes, when trading volumes will be sufficiently relevant.

Because current DEXs follow the same DEX development mindset as on ETH. While ETH's accounting ledger model is very different from Cardano's eUTXO accounting ledger model. This delayed the development of a DEX on Cardano.\nIn this proposal, the author and team presented a very new technology for building a DEX on Cardano. I have read the description of this technology and it seems possible. This is a new approach to the technology of trading between buyers and sellers on Cardano. Maybe it will be a big leap to help DEX on Cardano in the future grow even more.\nThe author presented the solution very clearly and described it quite easily in terms of technology. I really appreciate the author's ability to express.\nRegarding risks, because this is a new technology, it is difficult for the author to anticipate problems in the implementation process.

That is the number of people using the application, the number of transactions generated from the dApp.\nThose will be the clearest indicators of the proposal's success and how it meets the challenge's requirements. If possible, the author should give a specific number to have a clear commitment to voters what this proposal will achieve. That will give voters more confidence in the proposal and help it get more votes.\nIf the author wants to see if the generated dApp has met and satisfied the users of the dApp? The author should make a survey to get user opinions. This helps, the author knows the problems of the dApp and has solutions to overcome.\nIn this proposal, I only have concerns about the performance of the team.
