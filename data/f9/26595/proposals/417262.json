It creates a real time system which enables freelancers or volunteers to pick up a shift and also to swap shifts when they need to. When payment is due, their working hours would be easily identifiable as well as the roles they have played during those hours. This creates transparency in payments of salaries, wages and payments and can be replicated in any business involving full time staff, freelancers or volunteers. More broadly, this project also brings benefits to many stakeholders. Help improve the meals of the disadvantaged, protect the environment, cut CO2, help add value to Cardano. It is for the above reasons that I believe this project has effectively tackled the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team information has been provided. They are a strong team, they have all the knowledge, experience and skills to carry out the project. Links to LinkedIn profiles are also provided. This makes the information more transparent. However, the main purpose of this proposal is to build an NFT, so it would be great if you provided information about the people who would do the work. This is very necessary, at the moment I can't find any information about who will build the NFT.\nA detailed roadmap has been provided, specific tasks and timelines are listed. However, that seems like a common route for the whole big project. This proposal is only one aspect, so I think you should define a route that focuses on the problem of building NFTs. As for the budget allocation, it needs further clarification. How long will the social media and promotion take place? How many people will be involved in the work? How long will the documentary video be? It is also necessary to have specific metrics to evaluate the progress and success of the project. This will make it easier for PAs to track and evaluate. I have a few suggestions for you: the number of shift swaps is 500 per month, there are 1000 NFTs sold on the CNFT market every month,...", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I understand, this is a small aspect of a big project. Therefore, you must clarify it, making it separate from other aspects. That will make the community recognize and add confidence in the project. The information provided is not really complete, but I have learned about your big project and I believe this proposal will be successfully implemented. It brings a huge impact to the community, especially promoting the growth of the Cardano ecosystem. In the future, if successfully implemented, I hope you will handle the risks and challenges that you will encounter as what you have provided.

The solution addresses the problem greatly and I can see how it\u2019s aligned with our challenge. The proposers have delivered their idea very thoroughly. In my opinion, this proposal will bring a huge impact in the real world as it promises to give work to people who are in need, solve food waste problems and on a bigger scale \u2013 the increasing CO2 emission problems. Technologies will be applied appropriately to help with arranging schedules and payments. The proposers have gone way beyond to show us how the project is going to benefit every party, from the stakeholders, and blockchain community to every individual and family. This project carries a lot of humanity and I think it\u2019ll also help to somehow change the negative idea about blockchain by its potential great impact. With that being said, the project will add so much value to the Cardano ecosystem and can be a leading model for any other project of its kind. With such a detailed description from the team, we can easily how this project is going to run as a completed product. The team has a detailed vision of their work in progress, every aspect and step is being considered. A pool of key metrics is available for anyone who wants to measure the process and those key metrics are very specific and fully support the project\u2019s scope. The communication is already ongoing and there\u2019re certain interests from every party, that land a solid foundation for the project when it is launched. Not only have a short-term plan, but the team also commits itself to address future challenges in a long run, and I think it\u2019s a valuable point for us to count on the potential of the fund being spent. I\u2019m also very impressed that the team has considered a completed scene of risks. Not only pointing out the risks, but they also show how they don\u2019t underestimate any risks from the pandemic, volatility of ADA to the misuse of the system and have serious solutions for all of them.

I highly rate the detailed plan is provided with specific working hours so that everyone can keep track of the project progress and we can also accord to it to justify the requested fund.

And I\u2019m very interested in having a chance to come and see how the whole project works out since an invitation is available. However, to define the success and how effective the project is, I think it\u2019s recommended to set a goal or time-related KPIs for each key metric. The community has the data, but to audit it and see how it works out, we still need a specific measurement.

This project provides a management system that controls the freelancers for various purposes. In this proposal, the purpose is to deliver leftovers to those in need. First of all, the proposal deceives the problem thoroughly and points out the necessity of the management system. By taking advantage of NFTs, the project will classify freelancers into different roles with a specific working time so that later, freelancers can trade their shift and role without any third-party interference. As can be seen, this is a meaningful project that not only help the social community but also the Cardano community itself. These benefits are specifically described in the proposal which targeted directly to each group of users: Stakeholders, Blockchain community, Stake Pool Operator, etc. in short, \u201cThis project will have a positive impact on the Cardano system because it will enable any business to effectively manage their freelancers and volunteers in a cost effective manner, with minimal or no disruption to the schedule\u201d. Another notable thing is they also bring up several key metrics to measure the project impact such as Number of food packs distributed per day, Number of NFTs handled of each role by freelancers or volunteers. Lastly, the risks of the project are also described specifically. Those associated with increased fuel price, Volatility of ADA ,etc. However, the proposal has successfully mitigated these obstacles with a reasonable solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project plan is clear. Since this is the developing phrase, most of the work is focused on contacting the relevant partners and completing the NFT solution. Moreover, they also list a series of KPIs to measure the development. However, they should include a specific timeline for each period to track the progress more easily. As for the budget, it is also thoroughly distributed. Most of it are salaries of the staff. With reference for the member list, it is completely detailed.

A system would be created to establish transparency among the members of a work team; they would be freelancers and their work hours, roles, shifts and pay would all be available and traceable through the blockchain on that platform. The general objective is to combat food waste as well, the proponent explains how some food is wasted in certain countries and people's work could allow them to eat food that goes beyond the basic received (rice, lentils etc). In my view, the proposal has a lot to do with Cardano when it proposes to create a dApp that records data on the blockchain, and it can be a way to bring together new members in the community who are not necessarily interested in the cryptographic world, but in the service.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The first month of work is extremely detailed, the degree of specificity drops a little as the months go by, but in view the roadmap is still very, very informative and allows us to have a proper understanding of the development process.

Success is defined very richly in detail, there are several objectives, such as \u201cAbility to increase our beneficiary locations Ability to increase our donor base of individuals and companies that come to us to donate their surplus food for parties and events\u201d.
