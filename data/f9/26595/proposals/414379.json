It is easy to understand the proposal's idea that Adiuvat is a Daap helping people find locations such as shops, cinemas, malls, salons, sports centers and other fun and recreational places which force people to have fun and go out. This makes a change in their behaviors, from a sedentary to an active and powerful lifestyle. I believe that Adiuvat is an interesting and useful product that can be built in the ecosystem, raising the reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations. The idea of the proposal is presented apparently. However, there are some additional considerations for the proposer to write in the proposal which helps make the proposal more convincing and reasonable with the challenge setting. The first one is existing products or integrations. The writer should say whether there is another dapp in the ecosystem that has a similar function with theirs or not. What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem? Or how the dapp of the team can integrate with the existing one and give the ecosystem a great combination. Those emphasize why Adiuvat needs to be built. About how the proposed solution will address the Challenge, the information is repeated with the situation and idea presented in the first part: \u201cThe typical user has become used to a sedentary lifestyle . His debt has grown and due to this as well as inflation and scarcity of resources he is stuck at home and unable to go anywhere.\u201d Those are not enough to persuade the voter.  In this part, the proposers should show what results the project would give and how suitable and aligned they are with the KPI/Key metrics of the challenge. And after the project is completed, what can it contribute to the Cardano ecosystem? With that additional information, the proposal can be highly appreciated by the voters. In the risk part, the proposer mentioned the inflation and scarcity of resources producers, increasing prices and reducing the consumption. This seems to be the problem that happens to the people for the dapp Adiuvat to solve. However, it is better for the proposer to talk about the risks when the dapp is built, are there any bounders that prevented the projects to be successfully built. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I don't think the proposal is feasible enough. Proposal has no detailed plan, no timeline or key milestones for delivering the proposal, no detailed budget breakdown. It is better for the proposer to impress the apparent roadmap, milestones of the plan and the results that the project will give in each milestone. Also, the budget should be added in the proposal as well. In this part, details of the costs that the team needs to build the app. This can be the budget for Human Resources or the necessary assets for the project completion. In addition, it is vital for the writing to include details on the people who will work on the projects. The information on this proposal needs to focus on the people so that it can answer the question of who leads the whole proposal, who completes the work in each time of the process, and what is the strength of the workers. These are to prove that the talents have the ability to contribute to the success of the project. Whereas, the data that the proposal gives is the explanation about Maslow\u2019s pyramid.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I don't think the proposal\u2019s auditability is explained transparently. The information is repeated so it is the same as the previous parts (impact and feasibility). It is better for the proposer to focus and explain more details about the project\u2019s auditability. I think it is difficult for the community and voters to follow and assess the process of completing the project. After being funded, the team has to report to the community regularly. So it is important that the proposal shows how to evaluate based on the key metrics or transparent KPIs in each period of time like number of users, which part of work the team has completed, traffic, \u2026 This makes it clear about the results and the definition of the project\u2019s success.

In fact, the problems mentioned are recurrent and are part of the lives of many people belonging to different socioeconomic realities. However, it was not so clear what would be the differential in using Cardano technologies in this application. Likewise, we could not easily understand which innovation would be brought by this application, despite the pertinent questions that underlie its creation. In this context, it is not possible to say that the idea is aligned with the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself. In this way, perhaps the budget being requested is also not adequate since we are not confident about the possible impact of the project.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the described ways on how the project should be carried out, we could not find much detail. In this section, it would be interesting if the main activities to be carried out were described, as well as the motivation for their execution and the instruments used, however, there is a lack of this information. Regarding the details of the budget, it seems interesting that the capital allocations for each activity were described, to make it clearer how the total amount being requested was defined. Additionally, it would be legal to make available the CVs of the professionals involved so that we could understand whether the range of technical knowledge is consistent with what we want to accomplish and with the budget that was requested.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "In the auditability section, it would be interesting to demonstrate some parameters that would be used to understand if the project is moving in the expected direction, such parameters could be, for example, the number of users registered in the application, as well as establishments. And in relation to the perception of success, although a promising scenario has been described, it would be possible to establish quantitative goals to see if the project achieved a good projection, goals such as the number of users to be reached in a certain period of time after the launch of the application.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6797, "q0": "Recently, life has become so challenging that we almost forget to have fun, socialize, watch movies, have family time, get a hair cut, visit the beach etc and when these things go out of our daily lives, we become totally far from life itself. The proposal objectively fashion out these pain point in our daily lives and tries to bridge the gap.\n\nThe proposed solution intends to develop/build a robust App that will enroll various social and fun event centres like clubs, bars, restaurant, cinemas, pubs and other categories of similar fun services and users will be able to customize their preferences and receive notification of events happening in their preferred areas of choice. The proposer will leverage the Cardano blockchain to build a DApp that can be used for payment using ADA and other CNTs for services offered. These will open multifaceted opportunities for businesses as well as unlock real world usecase for Cardano.

It is expected that by the beginning of Nov. 2022, the website should be ready, public gitbook and native tokens although some dates provided in the proposal are conflicting but yet the proposer has an articulated, objective and a realistic timetable for execution and a conductible implementation plan. \nThe proposer is requesting for a sum of $8936 but there is no budget breakdown that explain how that amount was arrived at although he claims that the proposed sum is to bootstrap the project but i suppose, an explanation will only better clarify the community. Also teams information is absent and void. I therefore have two concerns (No budget breakdown and no team details) which the proposer should try to make available in case they apply in future funding rounds.

These are the problems that still exist and I think your project idea is quite relevant to the questions. , my concerns above. Your proposal would be to register bars, clubs, restaurants and venues in different categories to invite people to hang out and have fun.

I have not seen how well you analyze your work progress measurement.
