The problem of NFT transactions always has to go through an intermediary, so artists have difficulty building their brand and reputation. A platform that allows artists to create their own NFT store without depending on an intermediary would solve this problem. So I welcome this project.\nSince your NFT store doesn't require any cost to create a store, I think this can cause some spammy behavior, creating too many stores to reduce competition like on marketplaces electronic, it's even easier.

As stated by the proposer, NFT artists generally would want a store place designed to suit their brand. Sometimes they are compelled to use existing market places because of the limitations to creating your personalized user store and user interface. If achieved, there is a high probability of having a number of artists onboard to explore the possibility it provides. This adds to the number of creative dApps operating on the Cardano Blockchain. I believe it meets the challenge setting.

What I don\u2019t understand, however, is what the cost of using this NFT store creator would be. I do not see this information anywhere in the proposal.\nAs risks, the proposers identified the fact that there might be competitors trying to provide the same service in the near future. As mitigation, the suggestion is only to focus on providing a good user experience and a good product overall.\nTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure if every person who wants to create an NFT would prefer to build their own store, as that still takes time and I\u2019m sure there are some costs involved which are not disclosed here. That being said, the proposal does fit the DApps, Products and Integrations challenge, I just don\u2019t know if it addresses it effectively.

It\u2019s not explicitly stated by the proposers, but it seems that the plan is to have the site operational at the end of the third month. The team is currently composed of 4 people: a product manager, a full stack developer, a DevOps engineer and a front-end developer. They all have LinkedIn addresses and their credentials seem fine. I have to point out, however, that based on my 8 years of experience in delivering software products, I do not think this team is large enough to create this type of site in just 3 months. Usually a product like this takes half a year to a year with a team of around 10 people. Not only do you need to make sure you have a robust website-building tool with a safe payment solution, but you also need to make it mobile and tablet responsive as well. All in 3 months with only 2 developers and no dedicated QA engineer (no automation will mean lots of bugs that will slow development down a lot and cause the developers grief down the line). Furthermore, no mention is made of what the marketing strategy for this tool will be. Without proper advertising, no product in today\u2019s environment stands a chance of succeeding. The budget of 50000 USD includes a breakdown of the salaries of each person, which are 4-5000 per month for each person. That\u2019s not an exorbitant amount, but my main concern here is that no mention was made of how this website would be monetized. I can almost guarantee that the site will take longer than 3 months to build and then it would also have to be maintained and improved, but we don\u2019t know how the project plans to obtain the funds to do that.

They have pledged to provide reports on their social media channels regarding this topic (Youtube, Medium, Linkedin and Twitter), but have not provided links for these (maybe they have not been created yet) and also have not mentioned clearly what information they would share and how often.\nSuccess for the project is defined as https://www.tangocrypto.com becoming one of the major revenue generators for artists on Cardano.

I think this is a very good idea. The issues raised by the team are very reasonable that the technology is advanced today but the websites can't help them and need another representative to be able to help them. By integrating the storefront generator into NFT Studio, artists can post and track their own collections. I find this group's solution to be very good.

Which is why selling their art as NFT through third-party NFT marketplaces may not be the ideal option for them today. Today, perhaps this is simply the most feasible option, as the alternative would be to build everything from scratch. The proposal team sees this as a business opportunity, and offers as a solution a way to make use of this untapped need by giving you the option of building your own personalized, turnkey NFT store without prior programming experience. This proposal is for the development of the storefront builder (a la Shopify), so that it can be integrated with your already developed NFT studio. As a joint solution that would include not only the NFT collection mint, but also the website page, I can see how it would be a solution that adds value to the Cardano ecosystem. The metrics presented are considered appropriate and aligned to the challenge. Lastly, considering that according to Tango's twitter account the \"NFT Studio\" solution was launched in July 2021, I would have liked to know what are the current adoption numbers of your solution, as well as understand on what basis you are claiming that this solution can get 60 stores to choose them as a turnkey solution, and 300,000 NFT are expected to be mined by 2023. The basic question I would ask is; in one year, how many NFTs have been mined with your solution?\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The budget presented was structured in 4 items dedicated exclusively to the values of professional fees by technical specialty. As the estimated number of hours for the completion of the project is not specified, it is impossible to know if the monthly cost per technical profile is full or part-time. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine if the amount requested is appropriate or not, since I would have to make many assumptions. This team consists of 4 individuals, with links shown that allow verification of the skills and experiences described in the proposal, which I believe are relevant for what will be built. Furthermore, the implementation plan presented is exclusively focused on the development of the storefront builder and the actions described make sense with what we are trying to accomplish and the timeline proposed (considering previous experience) seems reasonable. The only risk presented is the latent possibility of new competitors, with which I agree, since today the big player in terms of built-in solution to mine NFT in Cardano now is NMKR Studio, and at any time they could add this feature to their catalog of solutions as I do not consider it is a big barrier, as well as the possibility of big players from other ecosystems to join Cardano. However, the team fails to present countermeasures for the mitigation of that risk that would allow them to differentiate themselves from the rest. Perhaps there could be an argument that constant updates could be a good strategy, however considering that their solution \"NFT Studio\" is already more than a year old, and their twitter account has a little over 2000 followers, I would say that it speaks somehow of the low adoption of their solution until now (I could not find anything elsewhere about it).", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of auditability the team does a good job. The definition of success provided is simple, easy to measure, yet ambitious. On the other hand, a set of 2 success metrics are presented, number of stores created, transaction volume. Both will be communicated to the community on a quarterly basis. It is also informed that development progress and user growth will be communicated in the different social media channels, which also seems positive to me. As an additional note, I must add that considering that Tango has 2 proposals approved in the last fund, it would be interesting if they were already presenting the progress of the same in the different social media channels, thus strengthening the proposal in terms of transparency, trust and auditability.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15265, "q0": "This proposal raises the issue that NFT artists must rely on third-party NFT marketplaces to sell their NFTs.
