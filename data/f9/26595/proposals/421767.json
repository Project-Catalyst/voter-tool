There has been almost $2 billion stolen in 2022, and this has discouraged many from participating in crypto and Defi. Fortunately Cardano's security has not been compromised, however many people have fallen victim to various scams and lost their Ada. If the community can work to protect its users, spread awareness and education around security, we can reduce the amount of scams that are successful. By leveraging the security of the protocol and the wisdom of the community, we can further the brand image of Cardano as the most safe and secure crypto platform. However, cardano is not immune to scams, and educating users to be able to safely manage their own wallets is critical to the success of Crypto adoption. Recent close calls with the Minswap Dex, and Ardana ISPO that have been prevented by outsiders noticing the problem first,  have highlighted the need for Cardano project teams to understand and enforce high level security practices. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has provided sufficient background information, providing a linkedin, and overview of their 13 years working in cyber security. The proposal includes a detailed plan, with milestones and a timeline. The budget is clearly explained, and will provide a generous 100K salary for approximately 10 hours of work per week. This seems a little high, but we must consider the experience and potential value provided by the proposer. A single major hack could have a significant impact on the price of ada and negatively affect all ada holders. Additionally many users from a popular platform could all be affected if there was a hack. Therefore I think the cost is justified to help protect the Cardano community, and work for both individuals and teams, as well as providing a valuable web resource for the global community. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditable metrics and KPIs are included in the proposal, and they are clearly defined with timelines. The only point lacking from the proposal is how the proposer will communicate results to the Catalyst community, as there could be a more specific commitment to providing monthly reports, or clear communication with the Catalyst community for auditing. The metrics in the proposal are excellent for auditability, as long as the auditing community has access to them.

This can have a positive global impact by helping secure the Cardano blockchain and helping investors realize its potential.

In the proposal, it is stated that the proposer will help projects at no charge. This is a great idea. However, it may come across to other readers of this proposal that this proposal is to simply fund the individual. Even though that is the case, it will be rewarded by giving free service of security to other users. It almost may sound better if more of the funds went to development rather than the proposer income. There is a detailed roadmap that describes what will be accomplished if funded, and there are specific dates which is good. The main part of question is the detailed budget plan. There may need to be some reconsidering of this plan. I know that many people would view this and assume that these requested funds would be better used elsewhere.

The first factor is transparency. The proposer should be transparent with the community and allow for people to follow the current progress. The second principle is accountability. I find this principle to be lacking in this proposal. It may be difficult to audit the success of this proposal without a form of accountability. What will lead the community and other readers of this proposal to believe that the potential funds would be utilized properly and that the cyber security assistance would be worth that amount. There are some things that could still be considered. As I am unsure about this proposal. I have to give this section 3 out of 5 stars. There can be improvement in the proposal idea.

His work would continue until the end of 2023 and would be complemented by a website built over time. \n\nWith such a simple and straightforward value proposition, it\u2019s rather easy to frame it. Remembering that our goal here in this challenge is to foster the development of products and applications that can increase adoption, it\u2019s fair to say that there won\u2019t be a direct impact of this proposal onto this success metric, but rather an indirect one, through perhaps increasing the resiliency of some products following teams discussing security issues with Kyle. \n\nGiven this fact, I think four stars are appropriate since we have a fair, but not excellent, connection to the challenge.

And it\u2019s only fair that anyone does, since this is by definition a very personal sell - Kyle acknowledges that he will not be working with anyone else for this service, except for hiring a web developer for the website build. \n\nBudgetwise it\u2019s super simple! 100k would go towards Kyle\u2019s remuneration, and 20k for the website build. Considering his proposed schedule of 5 meetings per week, 10 hours in total, over 52 this translates to 520 hours/ year, so 720 hours over the lifespan of the project (Q3, Q4 this year and the entire 2023). It all translates to around 140 USD/hour as base pay. \n\nFor an excellent proposal I would humbly suggest: \n\n- starting with a smaller budget and testing first how the service looks and feels for the proposers, and see whether his supply matches the demand. Depending on this, things could be adjusted further down the road\n- build up a team around the concept. It\u2019s always better to have a few dedicated people servicing a product instead of a single one - this increases resilience, brings more comfort to the voters and users of the products alike, and might be less stress for the sole proposer\n\nConsidering these downsides, I offer four stars again since the project is definitely doable, but it could have been made excellent through these two points.

For example, the solution to the problem is summarized as follows: \u201cI want to do to things. 1) Help the individual, 2) Help new teams. At no cost to them.\u201d\nThe proposer claims to have 13 years of experience in Cyber Security and this is verified by the LinkedIn profile they added, but they also claim to work in the Cardano ecosystem (for Bloom) and have not provided any information to support this claim. Furthermore, I checked their Ideascale profile: they have been a member since June 2021, but have not made a single comment and this is their first proposal.\nNext, I\u2019m not really sure what the impact of building a new site with this information will be. There already are a tonne of resources on the subject, for free, on the internet. Even if a website was required, there are again a lot of already built solutions for hosting your information, which would be a lot, lot cheaper.\nThe proposer has not identified any risks (only pointed out some things he is aware of, such as the fact that he must keep up to date with new attacks and news in this field) and this is another point of concern for me. I could easily point out a risk to this project: what if people simply are not interested in going to a website and reading cybersecurity related articles?\nI do not feel like this proposal effectively addresses the challenge, as it\u2019s not offering something that cannot already be obtained. Score: 2.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer asks for a large sum of 120000 USD, to fund this project for one full year. However, the implementation plan only goes up to Q1 of 2024, instead of Q3.\nThe budget breakdown also has extremely few details: 100000 USD are to be the proposer\u2019s payment for the services he wishes to perform, while 20000 would be assigned to the development of the website and unforeseen costs. The plan is indeed quite detailed and mentions having 3 sessions per week of 1 hour each for one on one sessions with people who wish to learn about cybersecurity and 2 sessions per week for group sessions. Once per week, a twitter spaces would also be hosted. The site would start being built this quarter and the plan is to finish it by the end of 2022. If the proposer has the skills he claims to have, then this would all be doable of course (with the help of a developer who would build the site), but my concern is that this is not a good use of Catalyst funds. 120000 is a very large sum and it being basically allocated to a single, unverified person to just host some sessions in which they talk about cybersecurity is not the best use of this money in my opinion. For this reason, I can only give Feasibility a score of 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer has only added 2 ways to measure progress: \u201ctrack the total number of meetings (per individual / team) completed each week and tracking of the website usage\u201d. Tracking the number of meetings is not a good measure of progress in my opinion. The focus here should be on how many people participate. That is where the value of this proposal would come from. Tracking the website usage is an extremely vague thing as well, nowhere near a key progress indicator. We should have had here a commitment for how many articles are written there per week / month, a target for how many unique interactions these articles would have, a comment section where people can say whether they find the articles useful etc.\nThe success criteria suffers from the same focus on the number of completed meetings. That in itself is not a proof of success in my opinion. A decent measure of success would have been to commit to a certain number of individuals attending meetings per week and then to obtain feedback from them (through a form), on whether these meetings were useful or not.\nBased on these arguments, I do not think the information provided in auditability would help the community track actual progress in people being more educated on cybersecurity topics.

Also it is difficult to assess the impact to the Cardano ecosystem as the Cybersecurity is a broader field and is not clear what are the topics that are to be discussed and are related to Cardano/blockchain technology.\n\nI rate this section with 2 stars", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The requested budget of $120k is broken down in two identifiable items: one for the proposer income for one year, and one item (smaller) for the development of the website and other expenses.

There is a clear statement about 5 meetings per week (individual and with teams) of ONE hour each, but the next line states that it will be spent TEN hours per week for this kind of activities. The proposer should address this issue as is very tied with the requested budget.\nThe Timeline states that the project will start in Q3 2022, but it is recommended to have a clear date when this project starts, after the date when the funds are provided to the chosen projects.\n\nThe proposer will take care of the knowledge sharing part and a developer will be hired to build the website, but is unclear how much time this phase needs, as it is mentioned briefly in Q3-Q4 2022 (how many months are necessary from the total of 6 months?)\nThe proposer has provided some \"awareness\" related to this proposal but is difficult for an outsider to assimilate them with potential risks or challenges.\n\nI rate this section with 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are KPIs/metrics defined to measure the success of this proposal and they focus only to the types and number of held meetings and the website usage.
