Currently the cost is controlled by a few factions of third party logistic conglomerates that control the transportation cost of goods.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.6666666666666665, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 588, "q0": "Transportation costs are currently lacking transparency. In fact, freight costs are being controlled by several factions of third-party logistics corporations. In order to ensure transparency and desire to operate under a decentralized governance mechanism, the proposed team had an idea: build a Dapp that tracks direct costs for shipping from postcode to postcode other electricity. The idea that the team came up with is perfectly suited to the Challenge, dApp implementation, product and integration to provide an opportunity to effectively use the Cardano ecosystem thereby driving more people to adopt to create a competitive advantage. for user service. The problem proposed by the proposal also solved many of the Challenge's suggestions at the same time: creating a transparent trading market, providing the most reasonable transportation and logistics services, and moving towards decentralized governance. In addition, your proposals also work towards a number of sustainable development goals: ideas that have helped promote long-term, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full employment and productivity and decent work for all, building strong infrastructure, promoting open and sustainable industrialization, encouraging innovation, Develop solid, quality, reliable and sustainable infrastructure, including regional and transboundary infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on access fair and equitable for all, particularly the idea that it will help reduce inequality within and between countries, ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequities in outcomes, including eliminate discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promote appropriate laws, policies and actions in this regard. I evaluate: Your ideas are very practical and have a direct positive impact on the costs of businesses, which will also help the community to use consumer products at a lower cost. , true to the value of the product so it can be scaled up in the future. This proposal will help to add value to the Cardano ecosystem by attracting businesses to choose to use dApps on the Cardano Blockchain which reduces shipping costs and presents a better alternative to the merchants. offers the current focus of the business. The team came up with the solution to develop a Dapp MVP (minimum available product) with similar functionality to the current products. The team's solution solved the following specific problems: all transactions made would be transparent to all service seekers and service providers, and would allow stakeholders to view costs. transaction details (currently hidden). This will allow everyone to receive a fair exchange for the services provided. When the service is provided, the payees will also receive the funds immediately upon completion. Currently, it can take up to 90 days, and in some cases, payment may be received by the parties involved. Furthermore, other features such as tracking, expenses, landing invoices and other documents marked by all parties will also show up on the Cardano Blockchain. This will also bring a new user base to the Cardano Blockchain that may have never used Blockchain technology before. The proposed team wants to make an impact as one of the largest and most-used industries in the world. The team also gave real examples to compare current practices and practices when applying dApp MVP: To exploit the needy side, 3rd party logistics companies (3PLs) communicate specific costs based on problem market KPIs to a party that needs assistance in finding a logistics service provider. transfer. When the party receiving the costs from these intermediaries announces a price that is in many cases 10x and sometimes 100x + the actual cost to deliver the service from location A to location B. Then, the 3PL will place the load (items/s from the needy party) on the load table that only they and another 3PLs post. The load board is then tracked by logistics providers who pay a subscription fee to access the board and then call the number placed on the load board with general information like TO: location B, FROM: Location A, WEIGHT: and some other optional fields if needed. Then the transportation provider asks how much they have to pay for the payload. The 3PL then tells them a price that is almost always much lower than what the party that originally needed the service had to pay. This happens because the 3PL is responsible for the load while it is being shipped. However, if something happens to the load during transit, the shipping provider remains the one paying for the loss and/or damage to the product. Thus, the 3PL simply relies on the insurance the transportation provider has to cover potential losses in the event of a loss/damage. Essentially, giving the 3PL the ability to generate pure profits with virtually no risk. So through this evidence, we can see a great advantage when using dApp MVP: it will help reduce shipping costs, and fees are liquidated immediately after the job is completed without being held back as before. , everything is transparent and businesses have more choices in the process of using the service. That has a great impact on reducing the cost of products when reaching consumers. Great, excellent, wonderful! It is clear that with the theoretical basis to ensure the scientific and technical nature of the industry with objective evidence, the proposed group has a very convincing, sharp, logical argumentative method. During the ideation process, the proposal team also anticipated and presented two risks: insufficient funding to complete the MVP and criticism and brutal attack from existing 3PLs. And the team took the initiative to come up with a very viable solution to the risk (1) raising more capital in future funds and/or looking to other parties for seed capital; Solution for Risk (2) ensures compliance with all the rules and regulations necessary to complete and establish a truly decentralized logistics platform for even 3PLs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To ensure feasibility, the proposed team has given 3 timelines (6 months, 9 months, 12 months) to perform the works. I judge: it's the timeline to do the right job. That is specified in the proposal, you have also clearly defined the specific goals to be achieved for each stage. Within 6 months there will be an Active Load Table with smart contract payments enabled. Within 9 months there is an active base of active users on the platform. Within 12 months Start exploring the addition of new features like load tracking and market trends. And Continue to expand the platform to accommodate more users after reaching those 3 milestones. Your goals are very stage-appropriate and achievable. However, in the proposal, there is no specific address for the community to check your progress in the implementation process. I would like to see you attach the link so that the community can directly access and track the work you are doing such as Link Google sheet, Twitter... To complete their idea, the proposal team has asking for a budget of 150000$, I personally think this is a reasonable number. You have a specific budget to spend: $100,000 allocated to hire developers. 1 full time and 3 part time or 2 full time developers. (paid over a 12-month period). $20,000 paid to our business developer (paid over a 6 month period). $30,000 is for false expenses such as legal advice and other unknown potential costs at this stage. However, in order to ensure transparency and ease for you when doing work, I would like these expenses to be presented in more detail. I can for example: about $ 100,000 to hire developers, can you describe in detail how much it costs to build and program dApps? How much is smart contract programming? How much does a technician integrate the product on the Cardano Blockchain?... If you do so, I believe you will easily and successfully control the budget to work towards the common goal of perfecting the product to serve the community more and more. better. As shown in the proposal you currently have two developers along with a business developer ready to start developing this application however they need a competitive salary to commit to the job. I'm a bit confused, because you don't have a core member to represent and lead the project. The partners you offer themselves do not guarantee that they will join you in the implementation. The proposal does not have a specific assignment of tasks because the personnel to perform each job is very faint, it can be said that there is no. It is also not easy for the community to see the experience of its members. Here I hope you can give the specific identity of the partner you intend to cooperate with and carry out this project with you and have an address for the community to easily identify. for proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposed team defined their success metric: aim to develop an MVP that would function similarly to existing products offered and used by other logistics companies. . The number of people looking for logistics involved. The number of logistics service providers. I completely agree with these metrics. However, it is not easy for the community to check the MVP development metrics. In my opinion, to ensure transparency in the process of developing an MVP, you should attach a Github Link so that the community can update directly to check the progress of the project. The success of the project is clearly presented by you: Launching a Dapp with 1,000 logistics searchers engaged, 10,000 logistics providers referred, and at least 25% of users engaged. application per epoch. The success of the proposed team ensures the goals and criteria of the Challenge. This is a completely new proposal, so there is no test product yet.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2109", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "The assessor as provided great feedback on ways I can improve the proposal. Their primary concern seems to be the ability to track the progress of the project as it moves along and asks for as much transparency as possible when it comes to the allocation of funds. "}, {"id": 2029, "q0": "The main idea of the proposal is to create a platform that brings together large companies that supply products to carriers, those that transport effectively. This proximity would also be transparent and would use smart contracts for payments. This idea would reduce the costs of large supplier companies and increase the profits of workers (carriers).\n\nThe problem observed by this idea, and which it tries to solve, is the high costs that companies that supply products pay to large transport and logistics companies, claiming that the latter charges an absurd premium. In addition, it also states that the logistics company does not honor the carriers since their payments are far below what they should be. Therefore, this idea tries to mitigate this process.\n\nThis aligns with the challenge at hand by virtue of utilizing Cardano's blockchain to solve a real-world problem and furthermore bring in people who would not naturally be blockchain-curious.\nHowever, I must contextualize as follows with my life experience. I'm an engineer and my parents worked in a huge national rail logistics company here in Brazil, so I know a little about the sector.\nHere in Brazil there are 2 main forms of logistical transport, rail and road. The main source of income for railroad workers here in Brazil is the transport of ores \u2013 as it has a much higher transport capacity than trucks and, therefore, the speed of loading, transport and cargo removal (with the new technologies) are much larger than possible for road transport. And, given that railways are, in general, government-use concepts, which, for the most part, are billionaire concepts and last 30 years, I believe that it is impossible to withdraw this company from the sector (even because the mining company would not have condition to make the transport itself). In this case, the transport company really charges a surplus to carry out the transport, even because the CAPEX of anything is multi-million.\nAnother form of rail transport is that of general products which it competes with other forms of transport, greatly reducing its profit margin due to competition with road networks - but this is a strategic decision of the company, looking at the market it It's inserted.\nThe road network, in turn, is very competitive, causing large companies to greatly reduce their profit to carry out transport and, in addition, there is still a presence of the self-employed, who set their price against large supplier companies. Therefore, there is already a \u201ctransparency\u201d and the possibility of cost reduction on all sides.\nSo, I don't see where your proposal would go directly to make it worthwhile, financially, for all sides to use it.\n\nThe purpose of the proposal aligns with the challenge as it is to make all transport transparent. However, metrics were not provided for monitoring results and development.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: A detailed roadmap was not shown, with specific tasks, deadlines, allocated people, etc. This must have occurred because the team was not yet complete and, therefore, this project is still in the process of realizing the idea. As a suggestion, it would be important to meet with potential developers, talk about the project and jointly build the detail of the project, with metrics, tasks, subtasks, indication of personnel, parallels, etc. That way, it would guarantee a more fluid development with several checkpoints.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: Budget suffers from the same problem. There is an idea of the budget needed for development, but as the team is not yet complete, there is not the necessary detail yet. This budget may change upwards or downwards.\n\n3 \u2013 team: It was not shown who is part of the team, no proof of knowledge or experience, not even the proposer. It would be important to have these proofs, even because it is an ambitious project.\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: I think one of the main risks faced is the evaluation of the market. Which country/city would be the best to enter with this proposal and how companies behave there. Analyze what the real needs of stakeholders are in this specific location (there may be differences from country to country, for example). This level of specification is important to the project because of the structural change in internal logistics.\t\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: There is no possibility of scaling and sustaining itself if you don't finish the MVP. Therefore, there is a possibility to return for the next fund.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: It is not possible to audit this part due to the lack of basic information about the tasks to be performed for the development of the project. Deadlines, dates or which tasks would be developed were not informed.\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: As the project is about developing an MVP, there are no metrics or KPI allocated to project propagation.
