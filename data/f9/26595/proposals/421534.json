The main reason for this solution is the proposers believe the information should be displayed to the community and the impact will be just displaying this information. It would have been good to have heard of more examples of community members or organisations that have stated they would benefit from this information to provide more real world examples. Another thing that would have been useful is a statement of whether any of the existing pool stats websites have this information as then the voter could have confidence that this is indeed something novel and new that is currently unavailable. Another key thing would be how can this data be accessed? If the poolpeek site had an open API where this would be accessible then this would be more easily integrated into other applications. If this was the plan it would be easier to state with more confidence this could produce a growing impact for the ecosystem. Overall with the information provided it is hard to state with any confidence that this solution would produce high impact for the ecosystem. If this is a novel solution then that is fantastic and I would kindly ask the proposers to clarify that in a future proposal submitted in the future if that is needed.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "A simple breakdown is provided to track the progress of this proposal. First is to create the batch process that will gather the information, the second is to update the site to showcase this information. All the funding will go to the developers of the proposal for their labour effort. It would have been good to provide some professional links to know the background of the proposers and also some more depth in what is involved with doing the batcher just to provide a higher level of confidence the proposers understand the implications involved. However the site that already exists provides evidence that the proposers have already implemented a solution that handles stake pool data which provides sufficient evidence that this proposal would be feasible by the same team. Overall the budget is very modest in terms of budget considering what the team has already delivered and offers a way to showcase that the team can deliver further iterations for the community if the community decides to vote on this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers outline the website has been live for 2 years and freely available. In terms of tracking success the statement is that the website will be updated. It would have been good to have any Github links provided if anything will be made open source or that already is. Also it would have been good to have some information on who may use this and what kind of ways they may track the usage of this feature. There is already evidence people can audit their delivery of this proposal and the clarity is there in terms of it being simple to understand the intentions. Where the proposal is lacking in clarity is the depth on use cases and how to measure the impact of those use cases. For instance is the code going to be open source for others to use - if it was you a successful outcome is people using that tooling or if it came in the form of an API then you could track the usage of that API.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 800, "q0": "Pledge by the pool operators is an indication of their skin in the game and is a metric which is important for the delegators to make choice.

However, it is impossible for a normal delegator to extract the detail. There is a large number of online tools and one such tool is poolpeek. The proposal is to add the stake changes details feature to the peekpool and also to tweet the information.

As a recommendation to the proposer: when using special terms / acronyms / referring to companies, either explain what they are or add a reference so that the voters and assessors can understand what you are talking about. The timeline is short, the estimation being that in the first month the work to gather the data will be complete and by the end of the second month, it will also be displayed on the PoolPeek site. I have over 8 years of experience in software building and delivery and I can confirm that the requested amount of 4000 USD for 2 people (Paddy, the owner of the Shamrock pool and Brave, a member of the Poolpeek team) for 2 months to complete the work here is not only feasible, but at a very good price as well. Another comment here: try to add some social links to the team section of the proposal, so that people can put a face to the name and get in touch with the people there if needed.\nI agree that this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.

Please consider, in order to follow the proposal guidelines and not get a low score by strict assessors, to add at least some basic key progress indicators, like \u201cwe will have X commits per Y amount of time in Z github\u201d, or \u201cwe will share screenshots of the dashboard as it\u2019s in progress after 2-4 weeks of being funded\u201d etc. These are simple things which can give the community trust that the progress will be auditable.\nI would also recommend being very specific with the measure for success, as this again needs to be clear to the community so that it is easy to say whether the proposal was completed successfully or not. In this case, I think that simply stating that success looks like the PoolPeek website having a dashboard which displays data regarding the holdings of stakepool owners would have been perfect. That being said, I still think this proposal merits a score of 5 here, as in reality it will be extremely easy to audit it at the end.

Pledge is a widely discussed issue among SPOs as it shows the commitment of SPOs (their own ADAs as part of the stake pool). The higher amount of ADA pledged, the more reward the pool will receive. The team will provide graphs (updated every epochs) and twitter bot to tweet out the information regularly. They want to display this info on their poolpeek website. It fits the challenge in the sense that the feature will bring more transparency to the community. Pledge is one indicator of decentralization as it encourages decentralization and large operators control fewer pools with high pledge instead of many pools with low pledge. As Cardano promotes decentralization, having this info displayed will show that the ecosystem is transparent and fair in reward distribution which will drive more Cardano adoption that is a goal of this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project duration will take 2 months with month 1 gather database and month 2 on website updates. The budget will go towards poolpeek developers (although the name of pools are disclosed, it will be beneficial to voters if they could provide URL links or linkedin of pool operators). As they would come back for future funding round, I would suggest the team to look into the features that not only benefits the pool but to the wider community in Cardano. This will increase chance of getting funded also. The team could do budget breakdown in more detail as the community would have no idea what $4000 will be spent on. They need to supply more information on their profile and budget breakdown in order to improve this proposal. This will increase the community confidence that the project can be carried out successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The measure of success for this project is that the poolpeek website has been updated/populated with this pledge information regularly.

Poolpeek helps community members by providing information on all of the stake pools on Cardano. This includes lots of data. In this proposal, the proposal is suggesting implementing another feature that will help further education in the community. The more tools we can build on Cardano, the more involvement we will see. It is extremely important to build those tools right now because soon there are going to be so many dApps launching. It will be easier to have those tools built so that they can keep up with the traffic of the blockchain. I believe that this additional tool can help benefit the Cardano community by helping viewers to see the pledge of all pools and find the average pledge among all the pools to see how much Ada is coming from the SPOs.

One thing that can be extremely important is transparency. The team should be open with the community while building. This will involve more people so that we can ensure that these funds would be utilized properly and that the additional feature would function properly. The second principle is accountability. If the team can provide details to the community, it will increase the likelihood of being successful because the community will hold the team accountable. This is important because the Poolpeek pledge tracker will be a beneficial addition to their dApp. This utility is something that the community would want to see which makes it an easy case when sharing with the community.
