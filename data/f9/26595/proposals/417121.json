This proposal does not specifically mention ChainlinkOracle, but is this something that will be built upon that technology? \nOr, if it is to be developed as a new platform, why is this \"IoT/M2M Oracle Platform\" needed instead of Chainlink? \nThese are some of the questions we have.\n\nWe believe that the proposal would be more persuasive if it touched on the problems with existing technologies, as well as the differences and advantages of the technologies to be used in this project. \nI feel that the use cases listed in the proposal could be made more familiar and imaginable if the proposal also emphasizes the fact that this proposal will make it possible to realize these use cases.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As far as we can read from the description in the proposal, we must say that its track record is as opaque as that of other proposals by the same proposer. \nAlso, as for the development company, which is essential for product development, although there is an explanation that \"a partnership with a globally active electronics company will be entered into,\" no details are given, giving the impression that the project is essentially starting from scratch.\n\nThe schedule is expected to last until December 2023, but even at that stage, the goal is to create \"an environment where developers can easily try out the product,\" and there is no prospect for the final launch. \nThe budget for the project is relatively excessive, and yet the development team is not yet ready to start work.\n\nIf the proposal is based on a situation in which the prospects of the development team and product specifications have been established to some extent, it is necessary to explain the details of the proposal in as much detail as possible.\n\nIn any case, there are many uncertainties in the current situation, and I strongly feel concern about the risk of the proposal not progressing as envisioned in the proposal.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposal anticipates a long-term development period of more than one year until product launch, but the schedule is straightforward and does not include indicators for evaluating progress at each stage. \nBecause this is a proposal that is expected to be developed over a long period of time, we feel that it is necessary to set targets for progress at certain stages and to undergo self-evaluation and third-party audits.\n\nThe content of the current proposal is a plan in the form of a plan that delimits a certain span of time as a stage up to \"the creation of the foundation of the Oracle Platform and the creation of a mechanism to connect sensors that already exist in the market,\" which in itself seems reasonable. \nHowever, if this is the case, it would be clearer to show both the overall plan until completion and the subplan in the form of a period in the current proposal.\n\nAlso, although this overlaps with my impression of another proposal by the same proposer, I cannot help but feel that the specifications that can be clearly stated are currently insufficient because the development team is currently undecided, and the basis for estimating the required budget amount is also unclear. \n\nIf the current situation is that it is difficult to indicate the direction of the project because it is still in the blueprint stage and the development team has not yet been formed, it would be desirable to start the proposal as a study phase and limit the budget request to the areas of research and study and the search for collaboration with partner companies. \nWe feel that it would be desirable to start the proposal as a study phase.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2061", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1102, "q0": "I believe the proposal properly addresses the challenge simplifying Oracles integrations in Dapps.

For current and futures developers that join the ecosystem, this will help to speedup the process of implementing smart contracts with Oracles as an MVP and continue product development. \n\nBy combining multiple sectors in the output to obtain new intelligence, the customer experience will improve dramatically propelling the mass adoption by retail or corporate.

At the same time, detailed planning will show the ability to plan and fully visualize the steps to turn ideas into reality.\nRegarding the budget, the cost items are listed but not specific, not corresponding to each work item performed. The proposer should be more specific about the cost items and how they are composed. Personnel costs should be recorded by month or unit price per hour. The cost of buying hardware and software should clearly state what to buy. Catalyst and the community will easily check the source of funds and intended use if the budget is specified and clear.\nRegarding the development team, the implementation person is stated in general, it is not clear how many people are needed.

Overall, the impact of this project brings to the Cardano ecosystem is huge if it can be successfully implemented.

There is not a lot of information to show that the project will be successful. Because when it comes to the technology aspect of the project, the key factor to evaluate the ability to turn the idea into reality is not, I did not find any information about technology solutions at all. In my experience with technology solutions for blockchain, Oracle is the hardest thing to do. An Oracle must first be considered through aspects such as security, data retrieval mechanism, data encryption and decryption, degree of decentralization of nodes. Where Oracle's security must be at the forefront. What protection mechanisms will Oracle's protocol have in case the collected data is manipulated or the data is tampered with in the event of any node is attacked? It is dangerous in case the manipulated node slips through the protection mechanism and is passed to the input to deploy the smart contract. Where will the collected data be processed, on-chain or off-chain? Unfortunately, all of the above issues have not yet been provided to us by the proposed team. Therefore, I recommend that this information needs to be supplemented so that we have more bases to properly evaluate the project's technology solution.\nSecond, I think the proposal for a $70,000 budget is unreasonable. I am asking myself what does the cost of buying hardware and software include that costs $10,000? I think a more detailed explanation of this implementation cost is needed.\nThird, I think the implementation route is unreasonable. It took us up to 6 months for the \"confirm operation of oracle API with Plutus Application Framework\" work, but it is not clear during this time what the proposed team will do. And if simply confirming the operation of the Oracle API, in my experience when researching through similar projects on Oracle, it only takes 1 month to do it.
