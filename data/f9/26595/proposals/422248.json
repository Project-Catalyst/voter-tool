The proposer would like to create decentralized reward scheme treasury (DRST), to encourage academics, students, or anyone to write and publish papers related to Cardano blockchain topics to well-known and high-ranking journal and conference databases.  I appreciate the proposer's effort to clearly explain the reward process in a flowchart and answer questions related to this reward scheme in a detail manner so that community could visualize and understand how it works. As I know, this proposal will include the implementation of the web-based platform for Cardano-related published papers to upload or share information so that Cardano community members could access, view, and vote on per paper content. Moreover, with the consensus-focused design, Cardano community members and key stakeholders will fully decide on which paper will get voting and the amount to be rewarded. In my opinion, this project will bring many positive impacts and is consistent with the Challenge. Academic writer, students or anyone could earn rewards for publishing a Cardano-related paper in a high-ranking publishers, increase awareness about Cardano blockchain, reach wider community, as a result, increase the adoption and integration for the Cardano ecosystem in sustainable future. Besides, there are some possible risks in the process of implementing this proposal which have been addressed clearly by the proposer; and I found the proposer's solution for mitigating these risks is very suitable. In short, personally, this is an exciting idea from the proposer.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Well, the proposer tries to give the most details of each part to show the feasibility of implementing this proposal, but some parts still lacking. Regarding the roadmap, I think their plan is understanable by what the proposer explains and from the Flowchart 1. The proposer said that after the initial fund releases, they will build the web platform for writers to submit their paper, and then go through Stage 1 and 2 (see Flowchart 1). In Stage 1 and 2, the ongoing tasks entirely up to how fast the writers write and upload their papers on the website and how Cardano community decide and vote these paper, it means, this proposal has no estimated closing date. However, I would like the proposer to make clearer plan regarding the web building and the system design, what activities involved? who will be in charge of? As I know, there is only the proposer at present, it means there is no web developer to work on web building. To implement this proposal, the author need to find a qualified web developer. Besides, I appreciate that the proposer introduces clearly how he related to the blockchain and Catalyst with experience in cyber security, cloud computing, digital forensics with social account link provided. Next, speaking of the project budget, I think the required cost for Stage 1,2,3 is explained quite ok, but the cost for Pre-stage 1 is still superficial. I know that $110,000 total is required, in which $10,000 for web building (Pre-stage 1), and $100,000 for decentralized reward scheme treasury (DRST) (Stage 1,2,3). However, as I said above, the tasks for web building is not clear, so for the Pre-stage 1, I do not know the details of the use of $10,00 funding: how much money to cover for new domain, hosting? how much for web system? how much for marketing task? what marketing task included? how could you calculate it? Moreover, my question is How feasible to invite some key stakeholders such as Ray Network, SundaeSwap, Meld or Minswap to comment on the submited paper? I understand that this proposal is quite different from regular proposals. After all, I am looking forward to how this proposal turns out, and I appreciate the proposer's great effort for trying to analyzing every aspects or questions related to this proposal in details.

As we know, within 3 months, the web platform will be available for community. And following their roadmap, for Pre-stage 1, some activities are fully informed on their website including: Cardano ecosystem published reward registration function, a complete guide to invite Cardano key stakeholders, summary of degree, course, and research topic areas of up to 100 universities and higher education providers,..For Stage 1,2, and 3, all information reward requester and relevant papers will be available on the website for validation and audit too. My suggestion is that the proposer should have more direct communication channels between the team and community such as social media Telegram, Twitter, Discord,..Moreover, the proposer clearly defines their success outlook for this proposal: their solution will be a reliable source of papers from well-know publishers used by universities, higher education providers, government agencies or research firms; and further helps improve the content of current course and curriculum design about Cardano blockchain.

This would be achieved by providing a decentralized rewards tools that the community can use, and that depends on joint crowd decisions by the community. This may at first sound a bit out of left field for a Dapps & Products challenge. In my opinion, the long-term impact on our product pipeline and ability to grow the \"core\" of Cardano community members with a love for engineering rigor and peer-reviewed research could be enormous. Further, this project is not just a marketing campaign, it is actually a system or web app that would be an impressive piece of collaborative engineering in its own right, and has the potential for future blockchain integration.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides contact information and social media handles and proof of involvement in the community including challenge team and Eastern Townhall for Catalyst. It would have been nice to break down the budget more, ideally into timeline and cost items with hourly rates etc., and provide names and work/study/experience background for all team members working on this proposal. This often helps assessors and voters to gauge the likelihood of the project being \"done right\" and to learn more about the values and authenticity of the humans behind the project. Given the extremely good documentation for this proposal with lots of diagrams, flowcharts, inline pictures and tables, and a lot of info about risks, audits, implementation logic, this project is likely to be carried out successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer assures us that every step of the project will have an audit available on the website for anyone to access. The sheer amount of work flow diagrams, tables, milestones, risk factors and so on, demonstrates that the team are neither work-shy nor unwilling to share their work or plans with us, so this is good. The goals could have been bolder and more technical, for example how to measure and quantify success, avoid bias and ethically questionable outcomes of the reward structure and measure web traffic, ranking and searchability.

The academic research and material that has been provided for Cardano is very specific and shows the time that has gone into the project. The challenge for this proposal implies that there can always be more academic research conducted on the blockchain and implemented into upcoming projects building on the blockchain. With defi building on Cardano right now, there is always room for more content to be created. The proposed solution to this challenge is to reward academics, scholars, or even anyone who is willing to create this educational content and research for Cardano. This will be done through a decentralized reward schemed treasury (DRST). This is important because it allows for anyone to see that research that has been provided for the blockchain and that there are systems that continue to stay up to date with current research. This has potential to have a positive global impact on Cardano. It will allow for more people to read about these documents and even has the potential for speakers of all kinds of languages to create this review papers in their native language. Allowing for more users to be onboarded on Cardano. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a great deal of information included in this proposal. This comes with a lot of illustrative content that explains exactly how the team plans to accomplish their proposed project idea to create a decentralized treasury that pays users that want to submit academic papers or sufficient research. The proposal includes the name of the individual behind the proposal. I would suggest including a LinkedIn profile or another form of verification so that the readers of this proposal know will be held accountable for the completion of this project. There is a specific roadmap that includes models that display what will be accomplished throughout the process. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that illustrates where the requested funds will be allocated. It appears that the majority of the funds will be allocated towards the treasury reward system. Meaning that the funds requested for this project will go directly back into the hands of those community members striving to submit more academic documents which benefits the Cardano ecosystem. I think that apart from including more information of the individual/team behind this proposal, it is written very well and gives a great description on how they plan to create this treasury reward system that promotes further study and papers on Cardano. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 4 out of 5 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As stated above, there is a lot of information included in this proposal. It is easy to see that there has been a lot of time and thought put into this proposal and it has an approach that is intended to benefit productive community members. It appears to me that it is a win-win situation. More academic research and descriptive documents that support Cardano and its ecosystem, and rewards community members that are willing to put in the work. Something that needs to be considered is asking the question of how this proposal will be promoted. How does the proposer plan to allow for more community members to learn about this proposed idea? I would imagine that there are a lot of people that would love to participate in a program as such. But they need to find it first. I would suggest including this in the proposal as well.  I believe that this proposal can be a great benefit to a lot of people and promotes the idea of decentralization. When the proposal has a community behind it, they are more likely to be held accountable and it increases the likelihood of success for the proposal. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. After considering the few suggestions I have given, this proposal has the potential to be 5 stars all across. For now, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars.

The proposal raised a rather important problem, which was: \u201cNear nil results when searching for Cardano blockchain topic papers from established and endorsed publishing databases used by most universities or higher education providers' search engines\u201d. Currently, Blockchain technology and the Cardano ecosystem are being applied more and more in many areas of life. However, this concept is quite new to many people, and the number of people who know and go deep into it is still relatively small. Therefore, I completely agree with this proposal. Giving a decentralized reward to scholars, students, or anyone who wants to write and publish articles related to Blockchain Cardano topics to the database of conferences or famous journals and ratings high will help Blockchain Cardano appear more on the search and access applications, get closer and closer to the community. Here the proponent presented the fact and reason to encourage scholars, students, or anyone who wants to write and publish articles related to the Cardano Blockchain, through which they came up with specific tests to emphasize the impact of the problem. If this proposal is accepted, it will be great because it will expand the coverage and increase interaction between the Cardano ecosystem and new people who have not had the opportunity and time to access the Cardano Blockchain. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified the problem of the challenge. To successfully implement the project, the proponent has to foresee the risks they may face. The proponent has separated into 3 stages, then identified the risks of each of those stages very clearly and in detail. Moreover, for each risk they have proposed measures to minimize the risk of that part, avoiding affecting the later stage and the overall results. I find that identifying risks, and solving difficulties at each stage will help the team control progress and quality. With this thorough preparation and methodical planning, the proponent will always proactively resolve arising issues more quickly and flexibly.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "As for the implementation roadmap, the proponent raised the issue, that the difference between this proposal and other conventional proposals, is that it does not depend on the proponent to push and intervene with the writer but is entirely up to scholars, students, or anyone who writes and publishes papers. Hence there is no expected closing date. However, in my personal opinion, although this proposal deps on quite a lot on the writer, the proponent should also make a plan about the start and end dates, the allotted period for the students to learn scholars, and students to complete and submit their papers. I find that this specific time regulation, will help the writer to arrange, consider, and gradually they will come into a specific plan. Because this is a project that will develop long-term and sustainably in the future, planning and determining working principles from the beginning will help everyone easily control each stage. Regarding the budget of the project, the proponent presented how to allocate and use the budget for each part. Here, the proponent has divided into 2 phases, namely the previous stage 1: building the e-portal or the system budget including 10,000 USD. In this section, they outlined the specific work that needs to be done to utilize that total budget. In the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd stages they have divided into the period and the amount to use each quarter. They also go into depth explaining why that money is needed and not another amount. During this time, the budget is divided into two purposes, the first is for authors who have to spend months testing experiments, and predicting research methods for publication; the second is the usage cost for 5 stakeholders and 3 conference paper votes. There is also an incentive amount for DRST team members in project management. I find that the allocation and use of this budget are quite reasonable. Regarding the team involved in the project, this proposal mentioned that the proponent is both a security and computer network consultant and an East Hemisphere Townhall Co-Organizer. Fund7 Challenge Team Member - Disarming Cyber \u200b\u200bMisinformation Attacks, Team Leader for both Funds 8 and 9 for Grow East Asia, Cardano Development Challenges.

Similarly, in stages 1,2,3 the results will be reported on IOG for capital disbursement, all the information and documents related to the rewards will also be available on the web for everyone to confirm and check. Thereby, the auditability of this project is relatively high. The success of the project is also very clearly defined and easy to track.
