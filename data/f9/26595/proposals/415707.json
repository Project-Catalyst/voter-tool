The team behind the proposal is well versed in the field and has the necessary skills and capacity to execute the project. The budget is understandable and stated in hourly rates. However, with the budget amount, I would be even more interested to know what specific subtasks each stage includes. Only then is it possible to evaluate whether the budget is justified or not. It should be noted that the possibility of involving relevant partnerships and collaborations should be considered.

This proposal, if successful, will help to create a dramatic increase in API calls to the singularity net which is a part of the card on OWN Network. This AI algorithm would be a huge benefit to have hosted on cardano. It could help grow the network by providing a research-based AI tool  that would have wide-ranging effects in the future. Much of this cutting-edge AI research has limited immediate benefit, but as it becomes more publicly available, and more people grow more aware of it, this becomes a huge and impactful resource to have in our ecosystem.

So this proposal is suitable for the Dapps challenge. After watching the Youtube link (attached to the proposal), reading a bit about Dr. Nelson's research, and from my naive knowledge of dynamic systems and complexity, the simplest way I can think of to describe the proponent's technique is to place more weight on negative outliers. Although, I still can't say much about the technique in a scientifically rigorous way. But in my opinion, I like the idea of focusing on bad outcomes. Because it will hold you not falling into overconfidence (avoid bad but rare outcomes) which, to me, is why traditional predictions do not work. \nIn this section, the proposer is introduced and clearly explains their solution for the forecast problem. Every statement has a scientific citation. And It also has some links to give more insight into the idea of the proposal. All these make the proposal very professional and convincing.
