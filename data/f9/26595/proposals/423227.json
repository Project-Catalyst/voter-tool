Therefore, the low score.\nThe proposal describes the KPYs, but there are no estimates or values to evaluate the success. The goal is to bring notice and showcase a strong community in order to attract artists and celebrities.

However, in the \"about\" description, there's a section where it says proposal may include \"social media\" (although it's not well specified if it's talking about creating social media engagement or developing social media dapps/product), so in this case the proposal may partially apply, since it'll host some hashtags in twitter, although it's not sufficiently impactful for the amount of funding required IMO, since it's not a dApp or product, but a party to present Cardano'ecosystem as a \"cool community\" to the public.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There's only 2 numbers regarding proposer's team, which is good. However, they're planning to give 100K to an event production company, and they don't even mention which company it'll be, so it's hard to know how they can be successful or not, and we don't know if it makes sense to give them +50% of proposal.\nRegarding roadmap/milestones, they have a schedule date for 7 oct (to confirm, after 2 months upon proposal confirmation). They mention they're planning to pitch celebrities, although we don't know who they'll be and how this/those celebrity/celebrities will impact into community engagement. \nThey have a somewhat detailed plan, however, I don't like the idea of giving 100k to an event team from who we know abolustely nothing, that's why I give this proposal a 3, since it doesn't seem that assessable the team in my opinion.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Since the main objective of the funding will be about throwing a physical event in US, I'd like to see some KPIs and metric goals regarding physical number of assistants, rather than only measure the twitter activity through hashtags. \nWhen it comes to how the success looks like,  they've stated \"Success for us looks like when Ethereum and Solana Twitter users start to interact with the Cardano Twitter pictures during CNFT CON Kickoff Party to create cross chain talk attracting them to Cardano.\"\nIn my opinion, I don't agree that the main focus or success of the project should be to attract cross-chain interaction with Eth/Sol comm. members; but rather focus on generating a valuable experience for the Cardano community, with meaningful speakers and thoughtful talks, networking between projects, etc. I think something like \"Achieving X number of assistants to our physical event, with a thriving exchange of ideas and projects between participants, and knowledgeable presentations of Cardano's true potential\" or something similar.\nSince they've presented that the problem is Cardano's reputation or image from outsiders , they should try to present this in the \"Cross-chain collaboration\" challenge, with a twist of idea that can generate meaningful collaboration within communities, not only a Cardano NFT focused party, with no interaction with other crypto communities whatsoever, but expecting big results in terms of raising awareness or changing Cardano's image or status in the crypto industry.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2121", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2660, "q0": "This seems like a great idea to promote ecosystem adoption for Cardano, however it may be suited for a better category?

I've got a lot of event experience too and I find people enjoy this method just as much or more! Maybe take requests or something to get the crowd involved.

If this event will take place on October 7th then the timeline should be the most important part of the proposal. If funded this proposal would have only one month to accomplish all that is described. Time management would play a crucial part in the success which is not reflected here. Regarding the budget allocation, $100K will be used to rent and pay Event Production Company, is this the name of the company that has already been identified as been able to provide the equipment needed? It would be wise to request a budget to at least three different companies that could rent the equipment needed for the date and location of the event. More information regarding the allocation of these 100k would also be needed to properly evaluate the proposal. The total amount mentioned in this section sums up to $190k while the requested funds in General is $180k, this discrepancy gives further evidence that the amount requested was not analyzed in detail.\nThe proposal answered No to the question of \u201care you or any member of your team working on any other proposals in this Fund9?\u201d when in fact the user Timothy Vang, the author, has a second proposal called \u201cCreate YOUR RPG Character with NFTs\u201d in the same challenge.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While Twitter interactions and engagements are beneficial and a positive tool for adoption, a project with requesting six figures in funding should have additional and more robust metrics to measure the project\u2019s progress.

Regarding how success looks like for this project, the answer provided is too vague. How will you identify Ethereum and Solana Twitter users? What about users from other blockchains? How will you quantify these interactions? Against which other metric will you measure it?

Publicity and marketing are without doubt important to every community and business, and benefiting the entire cNFT space would be a big boost to Dapps and Products relying on demand for and value in Cardano NFTs. I just think that by purely focusing on buzz, celebrities and press, the long term vision and image of Cardano as the more secure, more robust, more scalable solution for NFT minting and integration is not served with too much impact. If we were to highlight a new product launch or hardfork crucial to cNFTs I could see the point how this might justify 4 stars for Impact given the clear directions, however broad, of this challenge category. But by focusing solely on hashtags and the period during cNFTcon, the funds requested might be better deployed elsewhere creating new user experiences, features and integrations.

I would have liked to see some goals and metrics not only for the post-event success evaluation, but also to safeguard the impact of the funding in the event the targets are not met. How could we maintain relationships with the celebrities enlisted, how could the long-term Twitter following of Cardano NFT related content providers benefit from this kind of investment and event? Project Catalyst gives us a unique opportunity to plug the community into the implementation and audit of this kind of proposal, so I would have loved to see more of the proposal deal with updating the community not only about the party/event itself, but the process of organizing it and the possible benefits that could be had from spending $180k in Vegas.

However my concerns is how effective the impact of a party will be. Agreed a party will create the buzz and be the talk on twitter and other social media outlets, but the impact will not be sustainable longterm. I will however suggest that the proposer put these same energy into creating a DAO with the musicians and artists and then through the DAO, they can discuss a more resilient way to impact and create a more structured method of creating awareness within their (Musicians) respective communities. Afterwards, they can plan a party. With these approach, the people coming for the party will make informed noise and buzz on social media which will have more weight and value. This is in my understanding, the Cardano way. Education first and then fun.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The major metric to track progress as mentioned by the proposer is the rate of twitter engagement regarding the event and the factor to evaluate success is the rate at which other blockchain users react to the event.

For a $180k proposal, there is not enough information here to assure voters of the quantifiable impact that makes this proposal worth that much. Since funding for round 9 would start being distributed just before CNFTcon on Oct 8th-9th, there is not a great possibility that this proposal would attempt another Catalyst proposal for the 2022 event. If I were to suggest improvements for future proposals, I would suggest putting a lot more work into providing market research into quantifying the impact based on modeling evidence from other events of a similar nature, impact of previous year\u2019s events, and a disclosure of how many people have purchased tickets for this event. I vote positively because there are very few Cardano based events in the status quo, so the project behind this proposal is unique in this space.

Copy & Pasting the roadmap to the budget breakdown is not necessary. I think this proposal warrants a further breakdown of the budget as well.
