A hardware wallet that fits in a wallet and can be used by the user via fingerprint authentication opens up apps.", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 2.8333333333333335, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 3986, "q0": "From my understanding of it, this proposals goal is to create a Cardano-compatible hardware wallet that has the shape of a normal credit card. It is also planned to include multiple fingerprint-authentication and extended use cases beyond blockchain technology. \nHardware wallets usually come in the USB-shape (and some other calculator-type shapes) but I have yet to come across a credit card-shaped one. Considering privacy and discretion is such a big thing in Cryptocurrency, I could imagine that a lot of people would be interested in this type of product. There is also a need for ease of use, which the fingerprint-authentication potentially could address. (More on the fingerprint authentication later)\n\nThere is a clear spot for these types of projects within the challenge. As described above, the team addresses a problem or potential need of the product (discrete but easy to use hardware wallet to fill gaps in the hardware wallet-market) with a pretty direct solution (Create a card shaped hardware wallet). \n\nMetrics to measure after getting the product to the market can easily be measured by sell numbers and users, and the project has the potential of developing further (and attracting more users, even those that are outside of the cryptocurrency-universe) by adding additional compatibility and use cases for the apps used through the card authenticator. The idea is there and seems great, despite the current global shortage of electronic components (which the team mentions in the proposal). \n\nThe part where the proposer tells us what they want to do and why is super clearly described, but in order to make the proposal even more impactful I would suggest to add more information on how they intend to do it. Personally, I have very limited fundamental knowledge of technological complexities (which is why I might misunderstand some things in the proposal), but all information added that describes the process of development make me trust the proposers capabilities more. For example: Is the card intended to be using battery that needs to be switched, or something chargeable? Even if the fingerprint authenticator has a lifespan of 30 years, I would like to know what I would do when it doesn\u2019t work, and why potentially it doesn\u2019t work. I know that the project is in its infancy or idea-stage, but for people without knowledge of how fingerprint authenticators work it could be wise to include a very short paragraph on basic functions and risks in order to include them by educating them. Or, what kind of apps and services are planned to be able to use with the hardware wallet? (What is the potential integration?)\nOverall, I agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed plan included in the proposal is set on a time frame from September 2022-October 2023, a bit more than a year. The milestones included in the roadmap is quite broad (which is understandable at this stage) but seems realistic. First two months is investigations and examination of specifications, then software design and design of prototype hardware starts (good idea to have ample time for these two). The planned incorporation of the Daedalus-wallet is probably a good choice since it is the official wallet. \n\nThe proposing team is asking for a total of 80 000 USD, which is a substantial amount but is meant to cover the funding for the whole project during the year of development. (Which makes it quite reasonable in contrast to what I\u2019ve seen from other proposals, in my experience as a PA since fund 6). I would like to have seen some further specifications in the budget breakdown regarding the number of team members that will be working on the different areas of responsibility mentioned. Also including an estimation of work hours for each team member would allow the community to estimate the workload a bit more properly. For example, will the 15 000 for one years of work be full time, or will the time for that person be contested with other types of work for other projects? \u2028\u2028Additionally, there is no information on the team members included. In its current form, we don\u2019t know if the responsibility areas mentioned in the budget breakdown will be covered by current team members, or hired from the outside. I might be misinterpreting it, but I believe that there are four people in the core team. One project manager, Software engineer, Firmware engineer and one hardware engineer. It is stated in another place of the proposal that the people who will be working on the project have the responsibility areas:Project manager, Blockchain dev:Front-end, Blockchain Dev: Back-end and Embedded systems developer for hardware design. This becomes a bit confusing to me. \nI also believe it would be very useful if the team provided links that could verify the expertise needed to work on this project (by including LinkedIn-profiles for example), and proof of person (Social Media? The current website in the proposal only feature the proposal in Japanese, no further info). \n\nBy doing some detective work we can find that the proposer has one other active proposal in Fund 9 (in the same challenge setting) along with a few partially funded ones from previous funds (7 and 6). Except for the mentioned risks of global shortage of electrical supplies and construction-design issues, it would be nice to see a plan for the future workload if both proposals should be funded. Considering the lack of information within the proposal, I neither disagree nor agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "First off, it is an issue that none of the team members can have their identities or competencies verified by the community or potential customers, despite the project being at a very early stage. Especially since the official website only contains the proposal itself (As mentioned under \u2019feasibility\u2019). \nThis section is all about transparency, and the ability for anyone outside to follow the progress of development. I like that the roadmap is clear with milestones and timeframe, but where are we supposed to follow that progress? As I mentioned before, having a dedicated social media platform for this purpose where you could share updates is the first thing that comes to mind, and probably the most common option. Considering how great the idea for the product is, marketing it will be of importance (and who will manage that, and where will it be marketed?). \n\nAnother important aspect is: How will you (the developing team) measure the potential success of this project? Will it be by how many products you sell (and if so, how many do you expect to sell within for example the first 3 months after releasing it?) or will it be by how many people are using it after one year after its release? Will you share those progress reports with the community? The inclusion of these types of KPIs are important in order for me to be able to measure the level of auditability of this proposal. I disagree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information in order to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2504", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 211, "q0": "The proposal is to develop a credit card-sized hard wallet with a fingerprint sensor, which is appropriate for the purpose of the category, and its content is pioneering and clear.\n\nAlthough we recognize that hard wallets are originally intended as cold wallets and are primarily required to robustly protect assets from external targets or personal management risks, but this proposal cites daily portability and operability as its merits, and CARDANO can be used in a variety of situations,  and will help integrate it into society and promote its spread.\n\nHowever, there is concern that carrying assets that should be protected in a wallet significantly increases the risk of loss or theft, but there does not seem to be a concrete indication of benefits that would be sufficient to overcome this concern. Based on the specification that fingerprint authentication can be shared by multiple people, this product seems more like a payment card than a hard wallet.\n\nIn any case, if this is a proposal that appeals for portability, convenience, and various use cases in daily life, rather than a function as a robust wallet, then while the technical explanation to ensure safety as a hard wallet is a prerequisite, it is necessary to explain not only the development aspect as a product, but also the specifications for subsequent dissemination and promotion. It would be desirable to mention not only the development of the product, but also the future direction of the product, including examples, possible sales channels, and introduction in stores, etc.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As far as we can read from the description in the proposal, we have to say that the track record of the proposer is unclear, and as for the development company, which is indispensable for product development, although there is an explanation that \"a partnership with an electronics company has been formed,\" there are no details about the partnership. This gives the impression that the project is essentially starting from scratch.\n\nThe schedule is expected to last until October 2023, which is a long period of time and requires a relatively excessive budget, but with no prospect for the development team, we must honestly say that this is an idea-driven, shortsighted proposal.\n\nIf the proposal is based on a situation in which the prospects of the development team and product specifications have been established to some extent, it is necessary to explain the details of the proposal in as much detail as possible. In any case, the current situation is unclear.\n\nIn any case, there are many uncertainties in the current situation, and we are strongly concerned about the risk of the proposal not progressing as envisioned in the proposal.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Although the proposal anticipates a long period of time (more than one year) until the product launch, the schedule is straightforward and does not include indicators to evaluate progress at each stage of the project.\n\nThe budget for hardware purchases does not include actual purchase estimates or targets, such as how much equipment is expected to be purchased and how many units will be shipped, nor is there a website where progress can be checked. We believe that it is difficult to objectively measure the degree of progress and appropriateness of this proposal at this time.\n\nAlthough this overlaps with the evaluation mentioned in the other section, we believe that the indicator for such a project is not only the number of products created, but also the degree to which they are spreading and having a positive impact on the ecosystem, which is essentially important. \n\nHowever, if the current situation is that it is difficult to indicate such a direction because the development team is still being formed at the blueprint stage, it would be desirable to start the proposal as a study phase and limit the budget request to the areas of research and study and the search for partnerships with partner companies. We feel that it would be desirable to start the proposal as a study phase.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2061", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3117, "q0": "The proposal concept is interesting.

In the future, yes it's possible this card may be practical and secure at the same time. But  this proposal somehow feel its ahead of its time. The real world has not adopted cryptocurrency enough to make this proposal impactful. Also most of us who use a hardware wallet would be in front of a PC and not outside purchasing items. Thus, I respectfully disagree the proposal's effectiveness in this challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposal has given a clear roadmap with a timeline of approximately 1 year. Which is reasonable. The task are detailed out clearly and the budget breakdown is clearly shown.

Overall, with the given information I can't agree or respectfully disagree with the feasibility of this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As mentioned the proposal did layout the timeline with the details. Thus the proposal has given us metric to audit the progress of the project. Updates would be published on their official website which is good to have. However, it would be better if the team could provide more updates thru their social media channels as majority of the members would use that. Would appreciate more metric to quantify the success of the project (i.e number of sales, defect rate, etc), as currently there is a brief statement to quantify the success of this proposal.

Currently, there are no Cardano-compatible cards in the world, so if this proposal is successfully implemented, it will certainly contribute a lot to the increase in transactions using ADA, increasing users and making Cardano easy to integrate into real life. In particular, the small size like a regular credit card helps to increase the convenience of use. High security thanks to fingerprint authentication. This is a cool, high-impact idea for Cardano development that aligns with the goal of the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The implementation roadmap is clearly stated, with specific timelines. The detailed plan, for each timeline, have specific, clear, and easy-to-understand work items. The main job is to set up hardware and software, so the goal is mostly qualitative indicators. The goal of finalizing design and development is June 2023. I understand that this project can be divided into many stages: product development phase and marketing phase, community expansion. However, if the proposal writer can write more about the marketing plan to attract users of this wallet/card, there will be more quantitative goals for the number of users. From there, Catalyst and the community can better see development goals, scalability, and user attraction.\nRegarding the budget, the proposal lists product development cost items such as purchasing hardware, managing the development team, and necessary personnel costs. However, the budget needs to be built corresponding to the work items listed in the plan, it will be clear, and easier to check and manage costs. At the same time, it is necessary to have a more specific calculation formula, for example, the cost of personnel is calculated according to the unit price of 1 working hour, and the number of hours needed to perform each work item. If the proposer can be more articulate, the proposal will be more coherent and persuasive.\nRegarding the development team, the basic information of the team members such as name, and experience... has not been specified, and there is no affiliation or proof of experience.

The proposal is a solution to create a card-type hardware wallet that looks like a credit card but is integrated with fingerprint authentication. However I am a bit confused about the function of this card wallet, are they used for payment or to store assets?\nIf it's payment, I think the impact on sales and the number of users is small. Because today's trend is to pay not via card but only using a mobile device with an internet connection (a mobile device with chips like a credit card installed) Then the question is how to attract more users to use this hardware wallet while the trend is showing the opposite?\nIf it's storage, I think its impact is extremely low. Because the project will find it difficult to compete with hardware wallet manufacturers in the form of USB due to the lack of brand value as well as technical proof.\nTherefore, in general, I rate the impact of this project as medium", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I think the feasibility of the project is at a low level. There will be many issues we need to discuss here to find the right solution to implement this idea.\nFirst of all, in terms of technology, I still don't understand how they integrate the fingerprint sensor into a card that is only about 0.76mm thick. All I know from this proposal is a card with fingerprint authentication, OVER!. Also, I still don't understand how this wallet works, how they interact with the mobile or the major Cardano wallet applications? Perhaps we need to be on the team to suggest more detailed information for this section.\nSecond, the budget to implement this card hardware wallet is $80,000. But what the proposer then explained about how to use this funding was extremely unreasonable. We have a salary for firmware engineer $15,000/year equivalent to $1,250/month, ok fine! But with only this 1 credit card device, why do you need to pay for software engineer, hardware engineer? This is absurd because there is no hardware or software-intensive work here because the information I read does not mention the technology factor of zooming into a 0.76mm thick card. Not to mention the hardware cost is $20,000, what is the hardware here? I don't know that. I think the proposed team should rebalance the costs for this budget.\nThird, the implementation roadmap lasts for 1 year. After the parameter checking phase, the project will start designing from December 2022. However, I wonder why it took us 6 months to do the confirmation operation of prototype hardware? What work will be done during this period to pay the engineers for 6 months?\nI suggest to the proposer that it is necessary to add more details to the issues I listed above in order to clarify the questions as well as clearly state the plans that the proposed team wants to implement.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "I don't think the project's auditability is high because it's hard for me to check the authenticity of the information that the proposer provides.\nFirstly, I do not agree that the project progress will be posted on the website because there is no website provided here. There are no metrics to measure project success. The simplest example we can measure is through sales after the product is launched in the first 6 months (for example, 1000 wallets sold), or how many Dapps are integrated on the Cardano ecosystem ?\nSecond, am I missing something in the proposal but the proposal states that it has partnerships with many global electronics companies, but I don't know which companies are included. It would be persuasive if the proposer could provide more information and evidence to support this claim.\nThe third about the claim of the proposed team's experience is to specialize in blockchain and embedded system development, but unfortunately we do not have any information to support this statement.

A hardware wallet that fits in a wallet and can be used by the user via fingerprint authentication opens up apps\". Currently, the use of bank cards and credit cards are used in transactions more and more popular because it is compact, and easy to store in wallets. Therefore, the idea of \u200b\u200bdeveloping a card-type hardware wallet that is compatible with Cardano but has the same size as a credit card and can be stored in the wallet, making it easier to move instead of using supported hardware wallets another Cardano that looks like a USB is necessary and reasonable. Moreover, the proponent also mentioned that the card would be equipped with a fingerprint sensor, I think this will help reduce the risk of damaged, lost or stolen cards, other people not the owner card owners will not be able to use it, and also reduce the risk for people who often forget their PIN when logging in. Thereby, it can be seen that the problem raised by the proponent has had a significant impact on the community, it has contributed to simplifying storage and convenience in card movement. In addition, the hardware wallet is researched and developed to be suitable in both size and compatibility features, overcoming the inadequacies of previous Cardano-supported hardware wallets. I think this is a strong point of this proposal. The solution proposed by the proponent I found identified the problem of the challenge. By having them present the current situation and then come up with a solution, develop a card-type hardware wallet with the right size and outstanding features to emphasize the impact of the problem. To successfully implement the project, the proponent also anticipated the risks. The difficult problem they are facing is the thickness of the hardware wallet. However, they also offer a solution that is to cooperate with other electronics companies to find a solution. I think, with careful preparation and initiative in work, the proposer will be able to flexibly solve the problem, and come up with the most effective and optimal solution.

The costs mentioned by the proponent include the purchase of hardware, project manager, software engineer, firmware engineer, and hardware engineer. I see that the costs here are mainly concentrated into 2 categories: labor costs and machinery and equipment costs. In my opinion, if possible, the proponent should add other costs such as marketing communication costs, etc. by deducting a small part of the budget or applying for additional funding. Moreover, the implementation of a project, even with careful preparation, will not avoid unexpected risks, to be ready to deal with such difficulties, the proponent should set up an additional reserve fund. Regarding the project team, the proponent presented 4 positions including project manager, Blockchain developer: back-end and front-end, and embedded system developer: hardware design.
