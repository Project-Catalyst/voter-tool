It's also great to see the self-reflection evident here with JPG.STORE, which is already ahead of the curve with it's integrations with Eternl light wallet. While it's true that the integration is a huge step in the right direction, the proposal to make a mobile application sounds like the next big step. \n\nThe mobile interaction promised by this proposal will be required if Cardano is to take a step forward in the NFT game for certain. This will onboard new users, new artists, and make Cardano NFTs more accessible and influential as a whole. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Seeing the work that JPG.STORE has already done with their marketplace, and the plans they're laying out via Catalyst proposals gives me more confidence that their plans will come to fruition. The team has also been thorough in their breakdown of funding and what it will be used for; they are well aware of what is required to accomplish this task. \n\nI'm also glad to see the foresight presented here.

I would definitely suggest adding benchmarks like those to the proposal as deliverables along the way. \n\nUltimately, the only way to audit a proposal like this one really is with the end result... when the app is ready for major usage.

The proposed solution to this challenge is to create a mobile app for Jpg.store on IOS and Android. This will be a huge solution given that 50%-60% of their traffic is coming through mobile devices that currently can't do anything on them. This change will completely add value to the Cardano ecosystem given that Jpg.store is the biggest CNFT marketplace.

However, there is a detailed roadmap with a timeframe of 8 weeks. It is important to include a timeframe so the community can hold the team accountable for their proposed idea. If the team hasn't already, promoting this proposal through social media would be a good idea to start engagement in the community. If funded, it will lead to the likelihood of those loyal community members to hold the team accountable as we look forward to creating this Mobile app to support CNFTs.

This is very fast and shows that the team is ready to get the mobile apps out as soon as possible. It will promote all CNFT's and could lead to other ecosystems becoming interested in getting NFT's on the Cardano blockchain instead. By having these timelines, it allows for complete transparency while working on this proposed idea.

Based on the analysis that more people would/will enter the space if given the proper mobile access in order to buy cryptocurrency easy and securely while visiting the jpg.store all-in-one place right from their mobile device, this would increase volume within the Cardano ecosystem, bringing value from more investors and enthusiasts onto the blockchain. One huge step of the solution is partnering with MoonPay (a registered money service) instead of having multiple hurdles to acquire Cardano native tokens from an exchange, allowing users to purchase cryptocurrency and connecting them directly for purchasing or creation of assets via mobile onsite. The Impact of this development would be very beneficial, as stated in the proposal, to bring more mass adoption to Cardano and NFTs to users still learning and adapting to the changing era. Rationale for this proposal's Impact is a 5 for those reasons.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When looking at Feasibility of the proposed idea, the relevant experience from the jpg.store team and MoonPay's history as a money to crypto service, it is likely this proposal will be implemented successfully. The team members are not clearly specified to whom will be working on this proposal, yet there are 3 main resources that will be needed for successfully completing the solution; 2 engineers and one UX/UI designer. Given the budget and timeline of 8 weeks for completion, this may or may not be an underestimated amount of time as there are no indications of any delays though some funds are allocated to overhead cost that may take place. The only concerns being that there is no proposed transparency or discussion towards how easily this integration will be developed or what the coordination with MoonPay would look like. These aspects would help voters have a better understanding of said partnership and feel more confident in overall approval. The rationale for feasibility is a 4 based on the lack of more detailed information from the proposer, yet still very likely the solution will be delivered having two major companies involved during the process if funded.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer states, \"we are also driven to run the project in a user-centered manner, listening to our users and various stakeholders throughout the process to ensure the end product is what the community at large desires\". This is the foremost key metric of measuring the success for jpg.store and the Cardano ecosystem as a whole due to the passionately loud nature of the community's voice. The proposer does not ensure transparency throughout the timeline showing when the milestones within the 8 week roadmap will be met, because these goals are said to be completed internally as well through a third party resource, MoonPay. Having more publicly documented accessible information available based on the timeline's proposed achievements would improve the proposal's overall stature within the Project Catalyst community. There are no considerable challenges or risks shared by the proposer involving the solution being implemented other than potential overhead costs that may occur.

According to the author of this proposal, over the course of the past 6 months they have consistently seen 50-60% of their traffic coming from mobile devices who can't trade or mint on the store without the usage of a separate dApp. So as to address this, the proposer wants to build a native mobile applications (iOS and Android) for the JPG Store with deep linking technologies to allow a smoother trading and minting experience for people using mobile devices. Not only do I find the solution and problem statement to be connected, but I also believe the idea solved the problem properly and would have a significant influence on the Cardano ecosystems. If this idea is funded and implemented, there is an implied value added to the ecosystem. Because impact is typically connected to scaling a solution, the proposers did an excellent job of outlining the advantages for each aspect. They also foresee some potential dangers that might jeopardize the implementation, and they have sensible solutions in place. And, at this moment, I have no concerns about the team's ability to meet the outlined difficulties. My sole recommendation is that the proposer provide the relevant metrics to discuss that correspond to the outline challenge settings.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project's viability will be determined by whether or not the team can find a developer to execute the job. The good news is that there is a link which takes me to information on all of the team members and their areas of expertise. It doesn't take long for me to confirm who they are, as well as their knowledge and ability. The bad news is that they have yet to pick which team member will engage in this initiative. That is a quite disadvantage that might endanger the entire feasibility section. A clear understanding and outline for how many team members will be more beneficial for the implementation of the project. It would be much easy to establish whether the professionals involved in this project are capable of assisting it in its success if this were the case. Unfortunately, as much as I like the idea, the budget is not clearly broken down. The required funds total $80000 and are split into 2 key categories: employee costs and overheads for the duration of the implementation. Specifically, the employee cost for a weekly budget of $8000. The community deserves more than a total of $8000 each week with no indication of how they will get there. A well-explained explanation of which roles are required in this project, which experts will complete each role, and how much $/week for different roles will undoubtedly be beneficial in checking the budget's fairness. I also expected hourly development rates, as did every other plan, because it makes sense. It's odd to offer a price for development in any other way since it's difficult to ascertain that one feature is more or less expensive than another. Then there's the $5000 weekly overhead budget. As overheads include hosting, unexpected delays, marketing costs, tutorial development and more, I recommend the proposers try to estimate the expense for each element mentioned (% in a total $5000). The roadmap for this Dapp is brief yet comprehensible. Although I would recommend that the team provide more detailed descriptions of what will happen in each period and spend more time detailing the technical aspects of each step, I feel the goals are realistic and that, given the time horizon, the work should be completed as planned. Overall, it appears that this proposal has taken some attempts to explain how it would achieve its claimed objectives, but it lacks several critical components. I neither agree nor disagree that this plan is extremely likely to be executed successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to assess the development of this proposal. The author provides us with some measures that make sense and clearly describe what success means in this project, however I see them as milestones rather than main metrics.
