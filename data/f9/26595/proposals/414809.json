Although it is conceivable that your idea is good for environmental and atmospheric purposes and nutritious food for human health, it is difficult for many people to have extensive knowledge about it, So in my opinion the team should focus this presentation on 3 main goals that I read in your comments: An open source search engine, Tokenomics model working on infrastructure Cardano/ADA, A network of microbial facilities. there should be more in-depth explanations of this goal in mind, to help the community evaluate and understand this proposal more deeply, so your chances of getting funding will be higher,\n In addition, immediate risks have been identified and eliminated by the proposed group. Through the documents of the basic proposal, it is enough to see the impact on the ecosystem and the impact on the natural environment, but it could be more perfect if the team added a little bit about my opinion.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "this is what I determined from the budget table provided by the team through the team design model, however in my opinion this is the right diagram for the internals to use to accomplish the goal, so it will It is not appropriate to give it to a community without really understanding the group's plans to achieve the goals, so it will be a loss for you when the community evaluates it incorrectly. In my opinion, the group should use normal writing to be able to attach annotations for each work content, the group's activities will be phased, thus satisfying all those who review this proposal. .\nAlong with that, the budget statement is the same, so that the best group should make detailed notes, and at the same time can break down each expenditure and have a caption for each content to be spent, for example: search engines will use for any work content with spend $50k,\nrelevant information on the core team to develop this proposal, the team of scientists is well defined but still missing two positions as stack developer and user interface developer used, the team has further comment on the reason for the absence of these two positions, if possible, with a note and date to recruit them or are they hiring?.

The main purpose is to maintain the algae industry base, by applying the Cardano Blockchain platform. however, based on the pictures and documents proposed by the team. then, in my opinion, the proposed team should have more in-depth theories on how to apply it on the technology that has identified Cardano. Only then can we completely convince the evaluation community to receive the highest comment results. However, in the section on anticipating risks, the proposed team has predicted possible risks, such as natural disasters and budgets that can be a barrier to success, of course the proposed team has raised the risks.

What is a bit difficult to figure out and can only be drived from one bullet point and the link to the regarding shop is the fact that the expanded farms will not as a matter of fact be used for energy production but for the production of nutrient supplements.\nThis is just a bit misleading and while the supplements are surely healthy, I don't see why this business model needs catalyst funding and why it is not properly disclosed which funding from the company will be fed back into the network in return.\nStill overall a good idea that definetely sounds feasible and beneficial to the cardano ecosystem.

The goal would be to distribute the outcomes and effects of the model projects impact efforts, as well as incentivize others to support the growth of those impact efforts. Importantly, for this model those efforts are based around an algae producing facility, which provides food security, O2 production, and other SDGs, however the point of the proposal isn't to develop the algae side of the equation but to deliver Proof of Concept with the algae facility as the model...if successful, this project should be measured by whether other impact economies could be built off this template.\n\nThe ability to distribute such reciprocal impact economies, making their efforts both sustainable and scalable would be a huge resource for the Cardano ecosystem.  That this project also intends to develop a dedicated tokenomics as part of its post completion roadmap is also a source of impact, as the Proof of Concept could be rolled over into a dedicated product designed to drive growth and adoption on chain.\n\nTogether these factors give this proposal a lot of ways to bring positive impact to Cardano and the world.  5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The technical requirements of this phase of the project have been carefully described here, and it amounts to the development of a web service that can onboard users to a reciprocal economic engine where the users activity on that service (here a search engine, but could potentially be any service, such as hosted data, cloud computing, you name it...this might be my favorite aspect of the proposal, personally, as one could imagine a service that required distributed node operators to have those nodes parked in these little local economies in a sustainable fashion.  Now where have I seen a decentralized node network around here?  hmmm....) generates data that is used to establish user identity in the ecosystem (and this isn't a robust privacy oriented network...despite it being a search engine, the data being referred to here is support of impact goals, participation in economic challenges, etc) which can be parlayed into either support of the facility, or participation in challenges developed by the community (community is an open ended concept here....the team suggests a few options, from sponsors for the challenges to hardcoding certain types of challenges into the platform.  at root we are just talking about gamification).  All of this articulates via a token mechanism, with ADA being the fallback (along with a CATID partnership...later it will be a dedicated token with DID support), that rewards participation.\n\nThese details and more are clearly explained in the proposal and the supporting documentation for the budget cross reference to this architecture buildout well.  While a lot of the build has to do with the work of creating the front and back end web dApps, the need for the facility to be producing as part of the economic engine is an area that takes a certain amount of trust, however it is covered under auditability effectively.\n\nThe team has a unique blend of experience for a unique project, and that makes relevance and suitability difficult to parse.  However they are active Catalyst community members that were quite responsive during the proposal feedback phase, so if they continue to adjust and iterate, the project will be in good hands.\n\nDue to the deep description of the architecture required, as well as a reasonable timeline and milestones, and because the budget documentation for the large amount was extremely well broken down over multiple references, I feel this project deserves full marks for feasibility.  5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They have included a visual map for auditability, which might be a first for me.  I was able to go through this section to clear up exactly what the scope of the project was, as every deliverable is described in measurable ways and the project completion is expressed as a linked series of objective, actionable outcomes.  I particularly appreciated the distinction in the map between the testnet release and the alpha release...when project don't specify this it can lead to confusion at the completion stage, especially for projects that are running behind.\n\nThe team has been active in the community, and have participated in breakout rooms and community working groups, so they are accessible, and the information the have provided gives a healthy level of transparency.  Added to the FOSS github repos, there is plenty to keep track of and provide transparency to the community, while also keeping the project on track.
