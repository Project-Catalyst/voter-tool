This is a great idea, to provide display to those who are not really able to saturate their pools, because it will improve decentralization of the whole blockchain. The question that the proposer will have to tackle is \u2013 what will be the threshold? 1% saturation, o 2%? What will actually mean low? And if it will be visible, will it actually cause a shift in these pools? To be honest, even tough the idea is great, I am not really sure that the visibility is the issue, that is causing low saturation, rather than other pools are having a better marketing/provide interesting rewards, so even if this MobileApp will be accessible, will it make difference? Overall the idea is good, but this information is already available on another sites and it is still not making any difference, thus a thesis for this assumption (or some supporting information) would be nice to see.

It is not really clear. Also the budget, even as low as it appears, I am not really sure if it is enough to cover 6 months of work, thus 1. More information should have been provided OR 2.

So to measure the success, I think it would be nice to measure how was the saturation of pools that were display changed.
