Although not much value is created that can be greater than the confidence of getting staking returns on Cardano's PoS protocal.

And the same is true for the later phase, where the proposer then describes their intention to launch a protocol where their token owners can stake MiFi tokens they have purchased (in third-party custody) in order to earn a portion of the mining proceeds.\n\nIn a perfect world, it makes sense.

Where mining meets finance\" proposal addresses this Dapps, Products & Integration challenge with mining (BTC & Altcoins) and DeFi protocols (Health insurance). The team mentions the proposal democratizes these sectors and offers the revenue-generating activities done in  3 layers 1) cost-efficient mining 2) smart portfolio rebalancing 3) Defi layer. They aim to be the first mining protocol to launch on Cardano. There are a few points that needs clarification as it is questionable for the impact of this proposal to Cardano. For the mining layer, currently it is possible for public to purchase 'affordable' bitcoin mining machines and start mining right away as such there is no entry barrier for mining as they point out in the proposal. For the smart portfolio rebalancing, the MiFi protocol will mine BTC & Altcoins. They mention that \"Altcoin mining and conversion in BTC\" outperform simple BTC mining by 3%. The reward from protocol is in the form of BTC only (from their litepaper). How would they handle the sap in liquidity of Altcoins which could trigger their conversion algorithm? What if the BTC & Altcoin price drops at the same time? It is neither profitable to mine bitcoin nor the altcoins, how would their dynamic swap strategy from Altcoins to BTC work?  How could their reward be adjusted by the improvement in hash power and distribute to token holders in the timely manner? For the DeFi Layer, the MiFi token is backed by the mining machines running the MiFi protocol. It was mentioned in their Litepaper that the token issuer has a direct claim over the mining machines used for the MiFi protocol. The token actual value is directly linked to the mining machines and hence their facilities expansion means an infinite uptrend value for the MiFi token. The mining location is varied and dependent on energy cost (sometime location is even kept as a secret). It is true that token 'issuers' has a direct claim on the machine but there is no direct claim on the mining machine itself for 'token holders'. To publicly claim the infinite value of token from the mining facilities raises doubt on this proposal to benefit the token holders. Not to mention that Cardano is known to be the green blockchain and hence, there is a reason why Cardano doesn't have the mining protocol as they aim to be the first one. The team would need to elaborate the merit of this proposal to the ecosystem by addressing these concerns. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal doesn't specify the total timeline. They only mention that Dapp development will take 3-4 months including audit. The entire budget will be invested in the graphic cards for altcoin mining. The proposer will need to show the market price of graphic cards and also the other relevant costs to clarify on the budget. The team has missed to include the linkedin profile of one team member. The funding for this round is only for mining rigs and not for dapp development which they aim for future funding round. They have considered risk & challenges in fulfilling this project. Since the timeline and the budget are not fully provided, it is quite a challenge to draw the conclusion how likely the team is able to successfully implement the proposal. I would suggest the team to be very transparent when it comes to budget breakdown even that this proposal is for early phase (mining activities). Definitely there are energy cost (operating cost) of the mining machines and manpower cost, the team should add these costs to the proposal's budget. Also the total timeline is important else the possibility of project completion can't be determined.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They aim to publish their mining performance on the website and blog. In the first stage, their KPIs are amount of machines and hashrate deployed. I appreciate that the team will also publish the location site, container and amount/type of energy used for the mining machine. In the second stage of Dapp development, the technical progress can be monitored on GitHub. The third stage, they will use total value locked (TVL) and rewards distributed. There is sufficient information for the public to monitor the project progress. The MiFi proposal still needs to address a few important points as I mentioned in their impact section. The problem statement mentioned in this proposal might not be a very urgent issue as retail investors have access to the crypto mining nowadays. The team's definition of safe and profitable protocol could have been explained better in this proposal. With all these points raised in this proposal, the team intention to disrupt the health insurance sector might also be quite novel. There are a lot of interesting concepts in this proposal: mining, defi (dynamic swap strategy, health insurance & asset management), it would be helpful for the team to focus on the area where their strength is and where it is truly beneficial to the ecosystem.

Allow me to integrate more information for responding to your concerns.\n\nAbout smart rebalancing:\nWe\u2019ve developed a proprietary algorithm for smart rebalancing swap. This strategy is made and tested by our team of hedge fund traders and financial modellers in trading. We\u2019ve used indicators, signals, and rules from our thorough analysis of the Crypto market since 2016, assessing the natural cycles, the impact of macro-economic factors, and trend analysis on new developments in Web3.\n \nMi-Fi applies a data-proofed methodology for Altcoin selection and swap. the mined coins are included in pools composed of a predefined number of cryptocurrencies; once the the pool is filled - the swapping happens based on a certain index which determines the the conversion rate of the cryptocurrencies in BTC or stablecoin.\n\nDuring extreme market dump:\nIn the event of an extreme market crash or a black swan event that causes a price/difficulty ratio to go below the minimum healthy value on the daily chart, we will continue mining until we have used up 20% of the generated mining profits or deployed cash to meet electricity costs. This is because the revenues generated by our method have consistently outperformed their daily values on the 1D chart. However, if unprofitability persists beyond our tolerance margin, we will halt mining operations until the problem is resolved.\n\nHow could reward be adjusted by the improvement in hash power and distribute to token holders in the timely manner?\nBTC reward is distributed to each staked token according to the following formula:\n(BTC mined + BTC converted from Altcoins) \u00f7 total tokens in staking\nStakers receive rewards based on their number of tokens in staking. Suppose the total distributed reward increases, but the number of tokens in staking does not increase proportionally. In that case, each token staked receives more rewards.\nWhen we expand the hash power, we will release more tokens into circulation. The circulating supply increases when our hash power grows.\n\n Direct claim on the mining machine itself for 'token holders\nWhile a direct claim from token holders over mining machines would be not technically feasible and impossible to be actually exercised, our solution offers a powerful and effective contractual remedy for mitigating the performance risk of the mining farm(s). Once the project is fully deployed, we plan to assign this claim to a trust, whose token holders will be the beneficiaries. In this case, token holders, in case of non performance of the mining farm(s), can instruct the trust to sell the mining machines and return the proceeds to token holders.\n\n\nFeasibility\nWe need funding for both mining rigs and dapp development, for which we will work with a reputable Haskell development firm well-known in the Cardano ecosystem. With small capital at hand, we choose to kick off mining first because it is revenue-generating and the revenue can be used to finance other activities.

I therefore have my doubts whether this proposal\u2019s philosophy matches Cardano\u2019s ethos, but this is something the voters definitely get to decide.

That would probably be a more feasible approach and would allow for a better scalability, where the mining equipment volume would be commensurate with the demand for the token.

Allow me to integrate more information for responding to your concerns.\n\nThough we are a mining protocol of PoW coins, we will create the dapp on Cardano. The benefits for the Cardano community are twofold:\n \nFirst, providing the Cardano community with a fair opportunity to participate in BTC and altcoin mining and earn passive income from our revenue-generating activities, which are mining and altcoin-to-BTC smart rebalancing. The dapp is on Cardano and the reward distribution occurs on BTC network.\n \nSecond, the unique value proposition of MiFi has brought the attention of institutions and the general public. Among them are entities and people who are not familiar with Cardano yet. We expect to bring a new audience and liquidity into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nFeasibility\nFor the dapp development, we will work with a reputable Haskell development firm well-known in the Cardano ecosystem. We\u2019ve consulted with them for the feasibility study and got positive feedback. The dapp can be created and delivered within a limited time, estimated 3 \u2013 4 months. We will also onboard Haskell developers as in-house developers in the near future once we have sufficient funding.\n\nThe dapp will be created on Cardano and connects to a reward distribution system on the BTC network. It should have these functions:\n\u2022\tStaking contract - which also keeps record of user\u2019s BTC address\n\u2022\tBTC reward calculation and accounting\n\u2022\tReward distribution/Claim system on Bitcoin - for sending bitcoin to staker\u2019s BTC addresses.\n\nAbout the additional costs of mining, We use our mining partner\u2019s colocation service. The partner will give us a bill which is an all-in price, including electricity, service, maintenance etc every month.\n\nAuditability\nOnce we activate the mining rigs, we will publish all the information and performance of our mining rigs. Our mining experts are creating a dynamic mining tracking tool to showcase the metrics of the mining rigs and profitability. This tool will update the numbers weekly. \nWe will also disclose the area of use of the mined coins. The initial mining revenue will have dual use:\n\u2022\tReserve for reward distribution for early adopters of MiFi protocol;\n\u2022\tFinance the project development (i.g marketing, dapp)\n\nWork done:\nWe are in early stage and the things done so far are identifying the project idea and solution, forming a team, creating the website and social channels, creating organic contents to attract community members. \nWith the progress of the project, we will add more contents and disclose the fund use. \n\n\n"}], "solution": "Our project is backed by mining machines and consists of 3 layers:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCost-efficient mining\nSmart portfolio rebalancing\nDefi layer\n\nWith a long term goal to bring mining to the insurance sector.", "experience": "Our team has multiple years' experience across crypto and traditional finance.
