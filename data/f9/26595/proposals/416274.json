We already have several solutions on web2 regarding the subject, but there are few solutions from web3 that work with this universe. Therefore, the proponents intend to create a platform specifically geared towards music, so that they can mint music NFTs, play their tracks through a cross-chain media player (it would be interesting if the proponents explained this concept better); finally, that they could share their content and create NFTs from it, generating profit for both themselves and greater movement on the Cardano blockchain. The proponents claim that the platform will be simple and that they already have a Marketplace in which some independent artists from selected countries can release content, from what I understand. In my view, it would be interesting if more details had been attached about the platform itself. It is not said what functionality they would have besides music playback, minting and selling NFTs; could there be other possibilities there, some innovations? I would also like to know more precisely how the construction of the design of this platform would be, I entered the website that they attached, but there is no way to see any content without a registration, so I could not have a preview of what the interface. However, even though not so much detail was given in relation to the interface itself, the proposal is well aligned with the challenge of Dapps, productions and integrations, as it offers a solution that (as far as I know) is quite new at Cardano, we don't have many funded projects that relate to the musical universe. So, it is quite possible that a new wave of people will be attracted to our blockchain from this project: both musicians and consumers. I believe that the proposal will meet the requirements of the challenge well, increasing the number of active users in the community, creating a value application that will benefit Cardano as it will popularize our blockchain; the more NFTs will be minted on the network, the more digital wallets will be created (both the artists, to receive the revenue for the active tokens, and customers who want to buy the NFTs, for example). A suggestion that I would like to make, in addition to a better detail about the platform, would be the following: maybe it would be positive to include a short explanatory video on the platform that would detail the main concepts for artists who do not know about blockchain, so that they can coin NFTs , finally, they can carry out actions with Cardano's technologies and insert themselves in the cryptographic context, even if they do not have a previous familiarity with this universe. The proposal is quite valid, it just needs some improvements to make it perfect.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Speaking of script issues, the information is given in a very superficial way. It is not possible to understand with much specificity what would happen during the process of carrying out the project. First, it would be interesting for the proponents to have divided the whole into phases, for these phases to be made up of months, and for us to know in detail what would happen in each month. What we are told are the results of each phase, but not what processes, what works would result in that. For example, we know that on July 30th the NFT music marketplace and NFT music coinage site would be launched, but it is not said who would need to do what in order for this to be achieved. It would be important to detail the work of the professionals involved here. Most likely, developers and designers would be building the platform. How would your work routines be? The same can be said for the other deliveries. From the end of July to the end of September, the date of the next delivery, we have 2 months, but it is not said what would happen here. How the professionals involved in the project would be taking care of themselves so that continuity could be given. That said, the script, in my view, could be reworked, so that the information was conveyed in a more complete and detailed way. The budget part is also inadequate, the total amount requested is quite high (about 200 thousand dollars), and it is divided in a very basic way. We know which parts would make up the whole, such as: Media player, Marketplace Backend, Team growth, etc. But each of them could be better explained. For example in team growth, how many new developers would be hired? What kind of employees would be added, from which areas of expertise? What is \u201cAWS\u201d? And what would elastic and blockfrost search be? These are particular concepts that should have been explained, so that all readers would have a better understanding of how that money would be spent. The marketing part is essential for the success of any project, in my view; this one being even more so, since we want to attract an audience that is not necessarily familiar with the cryptographic universe. Finally speaking of the team, this is the best part of the topic as we know a lot of information from almost everyone involved. Their names, roles on the project, an extensively detailed resume, etc. My only suggestion would be that they all had the same level of detail, because some have a well-explained curriculum and others (like Nhan Nguyen) attach little information about themselves. That said, I think the topic is average, especially the script part needed to be better deepened.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the proposal is, unfortunately, low. In the part of delivering partials, we have the same schedule that is attached in the script. Again, it is possible to monitor whether the results that were expected for a certain time were being achieved (for example, it is possible to check whether the music player would be launched on July 30th; but apart from deliveries, we have no way of auditing the development process itself. For this to be possible, it would be necessary that a better detailed roadmap had been attached, where we would know exactly what would happen, when and how. the work of everyone on the team: both developers, designers, advertisers, in short, as each professional progressed in their work in a certain time interval (for example, in 1 month). and not just the latter. Success is defined very briefly as \u201cthe launch of our Music NFT Marketplace: SoundRig.io.\u201d But one would have to understand We saw two things: how this release affected the music industry, from artists to users; and also what were the impacts of all this for Cardano. Had the objectives of the challenge been achieved? Did the number of NFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain actually increase considerably from this project? Did artists realize the advantages of releasing music on web3 instead of web2? Has the number of active community members grown after the platform was launched? More Ada would be in circulation (it's unclear whether sales would actually be made on Ada). In other words, a broader and more in-depth study should be established, with quantitative and qualitative perspectives on the consequences of the project. With that, I think that auditability is quite inadequate and needs to be reformulated, both in terms of monitoring progress and final results; being that for progress we need to understand more about the work routine of the professionals involved, and in the final results it is necessary to understand in more detail what this project would generate for our blockchain and if what is being sought in the challenge would in fact be achieved. How can we ensure that the challenge KPIs (\u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d) will be achieved?", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 5, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 5984, "q0": "The proposal fits the challenge and can have a significant impact considering the sizeable potential customer base of music streaming platforms. However, some prominent players are already in the market (like Spotify). They have a plan to enter the market starting by enabling record labels from South Africa and local musicians from Nigeria to sign up for their platform. \n\nThe creation of this marketplace meets the needs of the challenge criteria, but I'm not convinced about the information stated in the proposal: \"Potentially offering paid promotional services (ex: Boosted artist will appear higher up in the category list or search result queue)\n.\" This is, in my opinion, not a good feature on a decentralized application. The previous statement can also deter upcoming small musicians from signing up for the platform because they will be at a disadvantage. \n\nThe proposal lacks technical details on how the user experience would work. There is also a lack of information on how the service will provide a better experience for the artist. For example, in the proposal, you could list the advantages of the proposed marketplace against other existing rivals in the marketspace (for example, Spotify).", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In the project team, I see professionals with good qualifications, and the information in the proposal is sufficient.

In this regard, I'm missing a financial roadmap to independent operations. I'm also missing who will work on the different tasks on the project. \n\nThere are other blockchain music marketplaces that they will need to compete with, but I can not find any features why this project will stand out among the competitors. Therefore, I would advise including arguments explaining the advantages against other music marketplaces. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal will be measured with three goals in mind. There are no smaller deadlines or a breakdown of sub-deadlines. I would advise adding goals like the number of sales, artists on the platform, number of users etc. to name a few KPIs. The goals are also not well described. \n\nIn the proposal, there is also no commitment written to report the progress publicly. Instead, you could use Github or the website to write reports on the progress every so often. Such reports would be an excellent way for the community to audit the progress.

This idea we may have come across somewhere, but it has certain values. The idea is basically to build a music platform in conjunction with NFT. The platform will allow musicians to mint their audio files on the Cardano blockchain into an NFT. These NFTs cannot be modified or tampered with, so they serve as a certificate of the musician's intellectual property rights. And musicians can sell them to fans. Having such a music platform combined with NFT is extremely necessary because for a long time intellectual property rights in real life have been a thorny issue for creators in certifying the ownership of music.  Therefore, this platform is absolutely essential in the blockchain space. This can attract more musicians to participate as well as increase the number of daily active users on the Cardano blockchain.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roadmap to implement this music platform associated with NFT is extremely detailed and clear. The proposal team provided us with information about the tasks that need to be done, the order in which the work will be done. However, I am a bit curious as to what time in the roadmap will we reach the audience of musicians as well as the plan to introduce the platform to the community?\nRegarding the budget breakdown: I expect the proposal team can further explain to me and the community why we spend up to 300 hours on the backend marketplace work making them $50,000? And besides, what does marketing work include that costs $22,000? I think these are the key points to see if we've really covered the costs.\nExperience of each team member: in this respect, I consider the proposed group to have enough experience and expertise to implement this musical foundational idea.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I think the auditability of the project is only at a relatively safe level. The details of each group member have not been publicly disclosed yet. We do not have any links to individual information pages. It's not enough, in my opinion, to measure project progress by hitting launch dates. Because when the product is launched, but whether it has attracted users or not, is it popular for each audience, and if there are no customers, the project will not be considered a success. I would suggest adding details to measure success such as:\n+ reach 10,000 users after 3 months of launch (for example)\n+ has a close cooperation relationship with more than 50 musicians inside and outside the region\n+ the number of downloads on the platform is 10,000 times.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2771", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6886, "q0": "-\tAwesome proposal submission the arts and entertainment space focussing on music and challenging business models in the music industry as we know them\n-\tThis proposal brings together Digital Rights Management, Gamification, Incentivization, Ecommerce, ticketing, and social networking features all in one platform aiming to decentralize and disrupt the music industy by bringing labels, fans artists, event venues together \n-\tIn doing so, it challenges the Cardano Ecosystem to provide tools needed for such innovations to materialize and also positions Cardano to compete with some recent products like Audius (https://audius.co/)  & the UtopiaMusic ecosystem (https://utopiamusic.com/) and even develop cross chain compatible audio/video/media player\n-\tThe team is qualified, diverse and experienced.

This project will attract more artists to join the application, attracting many new users.

The process for musicians to monetize their work will be simplified with the sales of NFTs embedded with their music. Through that, they want to solve a part of the problem of a huge demand for an NFT Marketplace catering to music and audio while onboarding independent musicians from Web 2.0. This idea, for me, can really help enrich Cardano's ecosystem since it\u2019s going to bring a new platform for new music talents, attracts new artists to Cardano, and also aim to bring Cardano to its new markets, especially in Africa and Asia. Moreover, it\u2019ll connect experience between two existed products/platforms (CNFT Audio & Listening Room Collective.

Currently, there are many ideas about building a music exchange platform between artists and fans, minting NFTs from music products, So what is the biggest competitive advantage of this project that can attract the user base and artists who choose to use the proponent's platform. Although the proponent has addressed this issue and offered brand awareness solutions to find customers, the proponent has yet to make an effort to demonstrate the optimal features and utility of the platform. What makes their platform different is to be able to increase brand awareness with other platforms.

From the websites (such as Daband.io/Soundrig.io), much work needed to be done towards its branding and user experience. We need to always compare with other successful music platforms' (Spotify/Apple Music/Waves) functionality and accessibility for user experience for mass adoption.

I believe that users would want to know more about the features/accessibility/functionality of the marketplace. For example, SoundRig will have a feature that users could create an album as an NFT. Or SoundRig provides a a security where users' music have their copyrights and will ban if there is a copy of sound signatures. Despite onboarding users into the marketplace, the team need to measure the traffic of users, hours spent on its dApps, and to expand it to a mobile dApp to reach more normies. These are my take for its roadmap, and plan.\n\nGiven the relevant experience of the team members with such great background, this proposal can be implemented successfully. But more detailed/careful planning must be met. Based on the budget breakdown, the team can further breakdown what are the key points needed for each of the budget costs. Such as, media player.

Further down the line, I would suggest that actively gathering feedback on the platform via Twitter/Discord/Telegram can make much impact to succesfully move towards what the Cardano users want, and eventually what the masses want.

Thank you for providing very detailed information of project members and related experiences, and I find that the team is very experienced in relation to the development of this project, the number of members is also appropriate with such a big project, this will reduce the work pressure on the members.

An NFT marketplace for music with a Cross chain media player. \nIn conclusion the proposal creates an new marketplace for Cardano with a new usability which can bring new users.

The rational on the high salary is unclear. \nThe timeplan is a good overview. They have shown when they want to release the different parts of the application.

Many artists today use electronic and social media channels to distribute their works. The main issue, though, is that artists could need to provide the platform's owner a considerable amount of money. I do agree with the idea of SoungRig that develop the platform so that musicians may keep the majority of their sales thanks to the blockchain technology. \nSoungRig may pique the attention of artists thus increase the utility and adoption of Cardano by inviting current independent musicians. From this viewpoint, the Cardano ecosystem may be enriched by new users, and the solution proposed here is aligned with the challenge.\nThe proposers should have explained more clearly and in-detail about how this platform works (maybe some more technical points). The proposers have listed out and addressed quite well the risks. I would like to add some more risks and challenges.

The goal of this proposal is to assist artists in using NFT music and sharing it with their fans more widely via Cardano Blockchain with video and art. Furthermore, it generates revenue for musicians by allowing them to monetize their work through the sale of NFTs embedded in their music. However, I have yet to see instructions on how musicians will sell their products, or how fans will be able to listen to the music of their idols. Users and investors will struggle to imagine how the product will work in the absence of specific instructions. In addition, the author's solutions are not really in line with The Challenge's Key Metrics. The phrase \"increase the utility and adoption of Cardano\" is mentioned, but this is insufficient to meet The Challenge's requirements.\nThe only part of this section that the author does well is the methods for dealing with future problems. It is clear that the proposer anticipates the challenges and offers solutions, which I believe is very appropriate. I especially agree on how to solve the problem of attracting users from other blockchains. The author has decided to attend other blockchain conventions as well as take advantage of strategic partnerships with Cardano and other blockchain projects. It not only ensures a certain number of participants, but it also increases brand awareness.

As can be seen, the list of people involved in the proposal is quite long, and the majority of them are completely appropriate for the proposal's purpose.

Furthermore, the budget is completely transparent and clear. Amounts will be charged by the hour rather than days or weeks as in other proposals, but for $2,200 for marketing, the author must indicate how the proposal will proceed. The proposer must be clear about whether the proposal will be promoted in the press or on social media. The roadmap for the proposal also is still a bit hazy and unclear.
