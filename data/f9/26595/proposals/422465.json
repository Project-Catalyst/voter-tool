A need to standardize pricing and digitize pet records.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 3.6666666666666665, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 13896, "q0": "This proposal has some connection to the dapps challenge in that the team plans to develop a platform to allow stakeholders in the pet industry in the Philippines to interact. \nBasically, they are looking at combining an \u2018amazon\u2019 type ordering site, with \u2018google maps\u2019 type reviewing capability, and vet industry specific connections. This marketplace of sorts will support pet owners in the Philippines to care for their animal companions. My concern is that most of this information is easily and readily available to pet owners worldwide already, including great apps and communities for pet sitters, online vet consultations and ordering supplies direct from vendors. As a pet owner who has lived and traveled with my cats through 4 continents I am highly aware of how easy it already is to get verified quality information with a few simple searches. How will the company bring onboard all of these aspects to fill their marketplace with enough data to make it a better place to go than the existing solid, tried and true solutions? One interesting detail that could be a great separate proposal is their idea to digitize pet records. Currently, my cats travel on a paper printed passport with handwritten information and a photo I stuck on myself! Future thinking, worldwide adoption of international digital pet records would be a challenging yet worthwhile proposal for the millions of pets and their owners. However, within the scope of this project it is not explained or defined how they will accomplish this. \nBeyond this initial explanation the proposers struggle to show any key impacts and state \u2018we will give more details in the coming days\u2019. Upon checking the comments today, there are no follow up details or information.\nDue to the already existing market solutions, limited sphere of potential users (only pet owners in the Philippines), I rate this proposal 3 stars for impact.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposer lists a roadmap with some milestones, however, is not nearly detailed enough to confidently fund this proposal. For example, the first four weeks are listed as user research, strategic partnership and planning, for which $10,000 has been allocated. The rest of the timeline contains only single phrases, or, at most a small list of ideas for whole chunks of time. As noted in the impact section, the proposer has promised \u2018a more detailed plan will be provided in the coming days\u2019 however, this is not clearly evident in this proposal and the website they have set up is empty.\nAnother worry is the financial feasibility of the plan. A total of $90,00 has been described within categories such as research, development, marketing and management. Within this they list $20,000 for team fees, is this the salaries of the current 3 employees? Or the money they will spend on hiring outside talent?\nOf some comfort is the transparency in the three main team members, all current employees of \u2018Euodoo Technologies\u2019 in the Philippines. They have tech experience and a solid list of companies they have previously worked with, although no specific dapps development is mentioned. However, it does feel like the company specifically wants funding for themselves to create a product, rather than a community development.\nIn addition to the current staff members they list 5-7 positions they would need as additional manpower to complete the project within the 8 month timeline. Not having identified specific needs, staff needed, or the direct funding correlation shows a lack of detail from possibly a rushed proposal.\nGiven the aforementioned concerns I can not confidently see how this project in its current wording is feasible, hence, a 2 star rating for feasibility. \n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As with the impact and feasibility sections, the auditability information written in the proposal lacks significant detail. Each section has a few sentences then they write \u2018A more detailed description will be provided in the coming days\u2019 without that information to be found anywhere in the proposal.\nThey have a few brief solid ideas how they could prove the marketplace effectiveness by collecting analytics of logins, purchases and other interactions, but do not detail how, where and when this information will be collated and published. \nThere is no mention of the company reporting on their development proposal, no mention of a blog, or Github, which is worrying to not be able to see the progress along the way if they achieve Cardano funding success.\nIn particular, there is no mention of an expenditure report or proof of financial records along the way. Who knows what they are spending the money on?\nThese concerns, along with the lack of detail provided lead me to rate this proposal 2 stars for auditability.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2125, "q0": "This proposal provides a fresh but equally interesting idea. The increase in COVID cases has led to more travel restrictions in most countries, according to the proponent, prompting people to register and shop more online than to buy pet supplies in other countries' real stores. Using a blockchain-based pet app with digital payment integration brings pet communities together, builds relationships, and provides pet owners with immediate, comfortable care support at their homes. Using technology and artificial intelligence on mobile phones, allows owners to build a new social network among other pet owners. The solution is to provide a platform called Petlove which is an advanced ecosystem that demonstrates transparency, traceability, and value creation for pets and pet owners by using Cardano Blockchain Technology and NFT to securely deliver resources, to improve the quality of care pets receive and increase the value of the global pet community. With the help of Cardano, Petlove will use a combination of blockchain and NFT smart contracts to organize and store collected information and facilitate personalized data monetization. The problem raised and the intended solution presented in the proposal by the meeting summarize the challenge clearly and logically. The minus point of this section is that the proponent has foreseen some challenges and risks that may be encountered, but has not yet offered appropriate solutions to deal with them.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposed team estimates that this project will be implemented within 8 months, the progress of the project is divided into 7 phases, and each phase is divided into specific periods and activities to be carried out, so in my opinion, the route part looks fine. Next is about the budget, the proposal asks for $90,000 we know the budget will be allocated to expenses such as Research & Development, Application Development, Marketing, Product Management, and Advertising ....in each section there is a certain amount required, however, these sections can be explained in more detail, such as the marketing cost why $20,000? It's a pretty high value, we need to understand exactly what marketing strategy will be used, how to reach the target audience, how long the process will take, and who will be in charge of the publicity? Since the required budget is high value, the more details the better\nFinally, the project team consists of 3 main members: Julius Evan P. Zapata, Alejandro P. Zapata, Giselle P. Bantug, and I was provided with a lot of information about their experience and field of activity, however, information about their role in this project is not provided, nor is it necessary to have a link to the members' profiles, where we can verify the details stated above theirs", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proponent says that it will track the progress of its Petlove platform using its built-in software to collect data whenever a user takes actions such as logging in, making a purchase, visiting, and summarizing everything on the dashboard. However, this method has no value to the community in assessing progress. Because there aren't any KPIs mentioned we don't know exactly what to expect from the development process for this project. I suggest that the proponent include KPIs and measurable outcomes that can be expected at the end and during the project. in addition, proponents should also prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, and share them directly with the community. This will make it easier for the community to track the project's progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 2, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5928, "q0": "This is a project with potential.

Their profile and experience also need to be listed, it will help your project more convincing to people.\nA long-term roadmap within 8 months has been provided. The budget portion is also determined. However it's not really specific, I think you should make it more clear by defining the tasks in each time period, thereby breaking down the budget further. For example: specify the number of working hours for application development, hourly wages; List the things that need to be done to market and advertise the product, how much it will be paid for, etc. This will help the budget become transparent. Indicators to measure progress and evaluate success are not really clear, because this is a project with a long-term roadmap (8 months), so the specific listing of progress measurement indicators is necessity.

The proposal will aim to directly build an app on top of Cardano, and will utilize different aspects of the blockchain to meet its goals. The pet industry is a very large one, and a project that can find a way to encompass all the different areas that make up the pet industry as a whole will be a great addition to the community. This is a project that has the potential to bring in people who have never even herd of blockchain tech, like grandma and grandpa.

There are challenges to implementing the proposal successfully, but the proposal has a very good understanding of these challenges.
