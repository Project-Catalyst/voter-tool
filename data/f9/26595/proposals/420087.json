They believe that these items can protect them from evil spirits. A mascot is created as an object, symbol, or word with a purpose. The most important idea of \u200b\u200bmascots is people's belief that they work. Their belief in their strength is what gives people strength. The goal of this proposal is to create an opportunity for each MASCOT token holder to purchase their own unique NFT amulet for the most unexpected, wonderful, cosmic, mystical, or whatever needs any other to create different collections of NTF tokens to visualize different unique amulets for everyone. MASCOT TOKEN is a native asset on the Cardano blockchain. You can buy it and keep it in your wallet to attract good luck. The proposal also provides a link to the MASCOT GALLERY page where we can envision some NFT models to be produced in the future.

The first is the road map, the proposal provides a road map of 3 milestones. At each milestone we were given what each sub-task would include, forming a very clear order. What is missing is the concept of time, unfortunately, the proponent does not say how long each of these activities will take on average, in which month such partial results are expected to be obtained, who will perform those tasks, etc. We need to have a 100% understanding of the process because we need to understand what will happen and how, if this is combined with a month or even a weekly idea, it would be perfect.\nNext is the budget, the total required budget is $15,000 which is divided into costs such as Software Development, Design, and Infrastructure...the details of budget allocation are fine if obvious making it easy for the community to audit, so the budget here is appropriate. And finally the project team, we were introduced to have 3 members working on this project, the information about their name, experience, and the LinkedIn link is provided so that we can verify their experience. However, it would be better to suggest providing more roles for each of these members in the project, and their connection to Cardano so that we have a better overview of this group.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "And finally the transparency of the project, in this part is a bit disappointing. To be frank, this section is very superficially presented. What we do know about the project's ability to measure progress is that \"The distribution and publication of our software will indicate the development progress of our solution\" But how does the community it possible to track the progress of the project? Because there aren't any KPIs mentioned! I suggest that the proponent include KPIs and measurable outcomes that can be expected at the end and during the project. Besides, the success of the project is also vaguely mentioned: \"People of the Cardano community use our products\". I would like the proponent to be more specific about this end goal, for example how many people will use this product? How the community can be audited bit by bit, gives us smaller indications of overall success.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2699, "q0": "This is a proposal by several developers, designers and marketers to, from what I understand it, create an NFT series that will act as digital talismans. This is aimed at people who use real world talismans and want that online as well.\nThe proposers have not identified any risks, but knowing how many NFT projects are out there and knowing the fact that we are in a bear market I must ask: is it not a risk if this does not take off and noone is interested in investing in these new NFT\u2019s? \nThe proposers also mention in the solution that they have several missions to fulfill: support Cardano network as the future of DeFi, Spread Cardano NFTs as a wallet talisman, develop games based on the properties of talismans, create real world talismans based on the NFTs. There is no mention anywhere else in the proposal how some of these missions will be fulfilled (for example, supporting Cardano as the future of DeFi). Saying that sounds good and makes a proposal sound more interesting, but with nothing concrete to back such statements up, what meaning does it really have?\nConsidering what I said above and the fact that there is a plethora of NFT projects already, I\u2019m not really sure if this particular proposal would effectively address the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge.

Another point of concern is that the proposers were not careful when breaking down the budget, so they ended up with sums there that when added up exceed what\u2019s asked in the requested funds section (22500 versus 15000). The team consists of 3 people and they all have LinkedIn profiles, but like I said above, the lack of information and  the contradiction between requested funds and budget breakdown does not give me confidence that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

We need to see key progress indicators, with estimations of what results will be available for the community to see after what amount of time etc. Expectations need to be set so that they can later be verified.\nThe measure of success is also extremely vague: \u201cPeople of Cardano community uses our products\u201d. What do you mean by this? That success is achieved if people buy this NFT collection?

What about your technology makes it a charm or talisman or whathaveyou moreso than any other NFT? Without answering this fundamental question, there is an enormous gap on the question of impact. It's simply not enough to pitch a new NFT brand and say it will be good or fun or lucky. We need to know how it will stand out, how it is special, how it is innovative, and why it's better than any other proposal with a similar idea.
