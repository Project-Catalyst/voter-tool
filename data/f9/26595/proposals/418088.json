The usage of their blueprints results in fees generated for the maker. The proposal and video also outline how the usage of AI can be used to automatically create new products based on a set of requirements and how ownership of the blueprints can be represented by NFTs where owners of that NFT would be the one that benefits from usage of the blueprints. An outline is given on the different smart contracts that are involved with some small explanations give. Something that has not been made clear is if the service became popular how it would protect the blueprint information about products from people who have already used the blueprint and could share the same information online. This is less of an issue for low value items where the effort may not be worth it but for more valuable blueprints this could be an issue. The proposal mentions rapid prototyping solutions so the intention could likely be more focussed on working prototype blueprints. If well executed and adopted this proposal could lead to a positive outcome for makers looking to sell accrued knowledge in the form of blueprints and also could become a source for recycling focussed initiatives.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal outlines a timeline for different milestones and separates what is already done and being tested and what is under ongoing development. The proposal suggests the ongoing development should take six weeks and is part of the proposal scope. The budget is used for a developer salary that will be focussed on this implementation. Some names are provided and their role in the project, no professional links are provided. No Github repository is provided to showcase any existing work in Plutus from the developer who will be helping create the smart contracts. The website implementation gives some evidence that a functional product can be created, what is less clear is whether the team has sufficient Plutus experience to execute on the complexity of the proposal being presented. More background information and evidence of Plutus development would be needed to provide a score showcasing a higher confidence in the feasibility of this proposal due to the amount and complexity of the smart contracts needed to execute the proposals plan. Further information would have been good to see in the budget breakdown about the team members who are working on the project yet are not receiving any of the funds from this proposal to understand their exact current involvement. Another area for improvement is a better sequential plan of exactly who they intend to target for initial users so we can have increased confidence in the feasibility of potentially creating impact in this specific area for blueprints.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team mention Git commits and Jira issues as ways to track the progress of the project. They have not provided a Github repository link for the community to track this progress. The proposers also mention recording traffic and usage data once the solution is launched. In terms of success the proposers break it down into the system and youblob focus areas. For system they mention the implementation of a light wallet, smart contracts and NFT conversions. For traffic they mention achieving a first user making $50k through the platform, the number of blueprints made and makers/distributors registered. Measuring success objectives appear reasonable. It would have been good to a Github link to audit progress. The proposal also could be improved with more clarity on how the smart contract list matched up with the six week sprint. It currently takes some interpretation from the reader where it would be good to be very explicit of all the smart contracts they intend to develop for the six week sprint being budgeted for. It would have been useful for the proposer to focus on some specific areas that they want to see success with within the space of users that make blueprints. This would have made it easier to make specific objectives that have more measurable and auditable outcomes based on fair estimations of potential adoption and usage. The results from these more specific focus areas could then be compared with other efforts over time to determine whether the platform can scale to the other multitude blueprint use cases.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1683, "q0": "The proposal is very interesting, it is about creating a DIY (do it yourself) platform, which, as the name implies, is centered on making creators sell their ideas so they can profit from it. The part where Cardano would be related here would be that blueprints could become NFTs to be sold. In turn, a blueprint, from what I researched, is \u201ca design thinking tool that maps service delivery interactions in general and helps you standardize them, or find your competitors' gaps and create value propositions more attractive to the market\u201d; it would be interesting for the proponent to define this in the proposal, so that it would be very clear to all readers what was actually being developed here. The main question I had when reading the scope of the proposal is: what would be the advantage for the buyer if the blueprint were an NFT? And for the seller? In the latter case, we know that by becoming NFT, the blueprint would remain unalterable, and perhaps a greater value would also be added to it because it is demonstrably original and unique; but for example, even to build the ideas, it might be interesting for the buyer that this blueprint could undergo minor modifications (for example, simplification of some parts, which the end user himself would add, or even the addition of extra explanations). Overall, the idea fits with the goals of the challenge, as it will generate an \u201conline rapid prototyping platform that will encourage Makers and provide a red thread back to the industry, and users will be able to turn their ideas into an NFT\u201d. As more projects are posted on Youblob, the number of NFTs minted on Cardano would increase, users who went there for the projects would learn more about blockchain, and perhaps become interested in the subject, becoming active members of the community. All users wishing to acquire a blueprint turned NFT would have to create a digital wallet, which is also an advantage for Cardano. In other words, the creation of this platform certainly meets what is sought in the Dapps challenge, because the way the idea is presented, the interface will be able to attract new members to our community and will increase the amount of active tokens being minted. in our network. However, I would like to make some observations: in relation to creators who are not familiar with the blockchain universe, how would the creation of the NFT be done? It is said that it would be easy, with one click, but it would be interesting if this topic was better broken down. Those customers who want to buy NFTs and don't know anything about the technology will have tutorials that teach them how to create digital wallets, how would this first contact with Cardano's technologies be made? Despite the proposal being well thought out on the whole (including the percentage of revenue that would return to Youblob, for the project to remain viable), the problems raised (\"marketplace not used by distributors + manufacturers are only left with the explanation of the video and are content with commercial revenue alone\u201d) are not resolved. How could we prevent manufacturers from using only the pre-explanations and not purchasing the blueprints? For these reasons, I believe that the impact of the proposal is good, but some points can still improve.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script is not provided properly, unfortunately. We know what has already been developed (\u201dCardano endpoints (APIs), native wallet creation endpoint, NFT minting endpoint, initial set of blueprint metadata\u201d and etc); and we are also told a series of steps that would still need to be accomplished (\u201dNACE and GRI alignment for company and organization records, Tinker Token incentive models for Blueprint Author, Blueprint Owner, Referral, Interactions, Improved team collaboration around of Blueprints\u201d and so on). But the ideal would be for each of these activities to be better situated in terms of time (that is, for some phases to be established, for us to know in which month which activity was being developed) and also for there to be more detail in relation to each of the activities . All the activities mentioned are technical, so a simplified and accessible explanation would fit here so that all audiences could understand each of these actions. Something that I consider important for this part of the project would be the work of a designer together with the developer. How would the site be constructed in an aesthetically pleasing way, and more importantly, in an ergonomic, end-user-centric and simple way so that those who do not understand blockchain can navigate and use it without any major problems? Turning now to the budget analysis, this part is very much to be desired because the amount is not divided into parts, we just know that all the money would go to the developer's work. However, for how long would this professional be dedicating himself to the project? What would his hourly work be worth, how many hours per week would he dedicate to working on it? We know that this part of the project (the part that would be covered by this financing) would last 6 weeks, however, without these specifications, it is not possible to determine whether the asking amount is fair, as we do not know the monthly salary and the hourly rate of work of the developer. As I commented just now, it would also be interesting in my opinion that a designe dedicate himself to this part of the project, so that part of the budget should also be directed towards his salary. Finally, talking about the team, unfortunately the information given is very insufficient. All we know are names, professional performances and which country each team member is from. We would need a brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 about each one to be included here, so that we have an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat they have done so far, in terms of how they relate to Cardano (that is, if they have some kind of connection with our blockchain, etc.). Due to the lack of information, not so much trust is passed on this team. So, in my view, this part of the proposal needs improvement in all the main topics (script, budget and staff).", "q1r": 2, "q2": "It is not very clear how progress monitoring would be done. It is said that Git (probably github) and Jira would be used during the development of activities. It would be interesting for the proponent to better conceptualize what the Jira tool would be and how it works. So that progress could be better monitored, it is necessary that the activities mentioned in the roadmap are divided according to the passage of time. We know that the total for this part of the project would be 6 weeks: but what would have to happen in week 1 for the partial results to be achieved as planned? What about week 2, and so on? It would be necessary for the proponent to make an overview at the end of each week, informing the Cardano community about what has been done so far and if the activities were developed as planned, if there were any work difficulties or any problems that affected the development of the platform that week and how these were resolved. Finally, talking about the success scenario, the proponent focuses on some KPIs regarding the system to be developed, such as \u201clight wallet implementation\u201d and \u201cimplementation of our long list of smart contracts and removal of our adaptive payment solution\u201d. current\"; and also some achievements on Youblob traffic, i.e. platform engagement level, such as \u201cfirst manufacturer to earn an annual income of 50K dollars through Youblob, 1K projects done and 1K Makers registered\u201d. These metrics are great for understanding the success of the project itself, but not so valid in terms of understanding what the effects of all of this were for Cardano and whether the proposal would have, in the end, achieved the objectives of the challenge in a solid way. It would take a survey of Youblob users (both the creators of the blueprints/NFTs and the buyers) to understand if they have understood and adopted NFT technologies in their lives; how they would have become interested in blockchain (if they were); if they somehow started to get involved with other initiatives in our ecosystem, such as other projects that involve NFTs\u2026 Anyway, we need to understand how the platform would have generated active members for our community, in addition to an increase in the number of digital wallets and NFTs minted on our network. Would NFTs be sold in Ada? Qualitative and quantitative data (and duly verifiable) would need to be collected, gathered and presented to the rest of our community. This could be done by participating in a room after Town Hall, for example. So I think the auditability is average, the metrics provided are really useful, but not enough for us to carry out a proper auditability of progress and success.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4105, "q0": "Not so impressed with the design or content on youblob.com.

When a blueprint NFT is sold, so as the all ownership of the blueprint to the new owner. Youblob will charge 5% of sale from blueprint that is enhanced by their AI engine. The Youblob platform will charge 5% for every sell transactions. This proposal effectively addresses the challenge very well as the dApp if implemented will bring impactful use cases to Cardano. It combines the power of online makerspace with the web3 technology to promote idea sharing along with incentive model. Although the risk of this solution is that the makers content with only commercial income and not see the importance to monetize their idea and make NFTs out of their idea (unlikely risk). The maker will surely want to share their product idea which is comprised of 3 main parts (instruction + tool + component) and gain incentive either by trading out completely as NFT or receive as % of contribution.

It loosely connects to the challenge framework in that they plan to support and allow users to turn their ideas into NFTs. Pending the smart contract implementation with the online marketplace, more users will be connected to blockchain, and more likely to become involved in the Cardano community. I don\u2019t fully realize the connections implied and feel that this proposal has a minor impact on the Cardano ecosystem.\nThe proposers have an active website with makerspace video tutorials and resources in place - from 5 years ago. They note a lack of funding to further develop it and are hoping Cardano will support their endeavor. The idea is solid, however, when YouTube has such a commanding share of the video DIY market, how are they going to attract people to their specific marketplace. There are details provided about users being able to sell their plans, and an integration with an AI engine - which is honestly beyond my current scope of experience.\nThe proposal is a nice idea, however, the direct impact for the Cardano community is negligible.
