Each company could become an issuer of Verifiable Credentials for their workers who will then hold those credentials. Those VC could then be used to easily verify the certifications and past experiences of someone (a kind of provable Curriculum Vitae). This would give people the ownership of their abilities credentials and allow them to publish them and be found by other companies looking for those certified abilities and experiences.\n\nIf successful this would have a huge impact, giving Cardano a new real world use case leveraging Atala Prism and empowering people directly (giving back power to the edges). So it does align well with this challenge and Cardano's mission in general.\n\nThe business plan is unclear for now as they plan to be self sustainable but don't really know how yet (from the proposal: \"The utilization of the tool should be giving enough cash flow to keep covering our expenses. How are we going to do that? It's not defined yet.\").\nSustainability is necessary to gauge the impact because if they can only operate for 1 month their total impact would be low in the end, even if their idea is very promising.\n\n\"The tool\" is not really well defined either, they clearly state their intents but not the form it will take, probably a SaS (Software as a Service) but this is only a guess from the current and future team members denominations (Atala pioneer, front UI web dev, backend dev, social media manager, web and app tester, etc...)\n\nFrom their GitHub link it's implied that the project will be open source but it is never mentioned clearly in the proposal.\n\nGiven all the above I can only give a generous 4 in Impact. The proposer needs to clearly define their project, provide a technical plan with all the necessary pieces needed for their product to work and a clear estimation of the effort required for each of those pieces.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I have many concerns:\n- Anonymous and incomplete team (they claim to have devs and an Atala Prism + Plutus Pioneer but no actual name or link is given - this is the irony of the project though: they could use their own product)\n- Only a very broad plan, no technical plan or work breakdown structure, was provided.\n- The $18k budget seems low from my own developer perspective, such a project requires many parts to be successful and they do not seem to have a clear vision of all the required parts yet so I wonder how they arrived at this budget.\n- In the same way we have no idea how their product will be implemented, will it depend on a centralized website or would it only rely on the Cardano Blockchain to work?\nThere is no link to past achievements of the proposer or team so it's really difficult to evaluate the feasibility of this project with so few information. I can only give them 2 in feasibility.\nThis project appears to be still in its infancy. They need to work more on the project and define each moving part and their requirements (front-end, back-end, what they do, what they look like, what language will be used to develop each part and why, what should be the user experience, what feature of the Blockchain will they use, etc...), assess the risks associated to each part and list ways to mitigate them if they come up during their implementation. Technically this seems feasible at a first glance but it's the proposer's job to show that they made sure of that with a detailed technical plan, estimates, etc\u2026\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Only an empty GitHub repository is given (at the time of writing), while it's a good way for other developers to see if a project is alive it's not very community friendly.

It is an interesting case that this proposal has very well defined as the problem to resolve.\nThe solution suggests the use of Atala PRISM to leverage the DID technology. It will store Verifiable Credentials (VC) in the blockchain that will track the skills and experience of employees. The proposal will target initially IT and Office resources to mitigate the risk of the variations and complexity that exist in other professions and countries. \nI strongly believe that this proposal will add more value to the Cardano ecosystem and enforce it adoption. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project team includes several roles to cover most aspects of this complex project. Three roles are already covered but there are still five roles pending for recruiting. I would recommend to add a role related to Labor laws and employment if this proposal gets funded to mitigate any risks of rejecting the solution for specific countries or professions. Moreover, it would be nice to add a reference with the skills and experience of the exiting people involved in the project.\nThe proposal provides a good implementation plan with a specific timeline in periods of months, however it misses some milestones to determine its current state and track its progress. For example, the requirements specification is an important milestone that all stakeholders have to review and agree upon them before the implementation kicks off.\nThe budget is split for each role and it estimates the costs based on the annual and hourly rates in Australia and Mexico. It is not clear with the provided information how the total amount of $108k is derived. It would be better if the proposer made some estimations of the time required to complete each task and then correlate the hourly rates to calculate the total cost per task.\nThe provided link in the GitHub does not contain any content.

However, this does not describe how to audit the project and how its progress will be measured. As stated in the feasibility assessment the proposer should include some key milestones to facilitate its auditability. \nAt least there are two metrics suggested to quantify its success based on actual DID references in companies' websites but these are not enough.

I agreed (vs strongly agreed) because I have an increasing distaste for proposals that don't include details about the working team.  Why do they want to be anonymous?  What's the benefit of hiding your identity?\n\nIn any case, the resource allocation is clearly presented, and the proposer also presents an opportunity to look for competitive rates as an arbitrage between Australia and Mexico.  And in either case, I could agree the rates are very reasonable (if not overly reasonably or even low).\n\nThe project embraces an open source development methodology, a great way to build transparency, trust, and a following that can support you or champion you in future rounds (potentially even a great recruitment tool if it really takes off).\n\nFrom the supply side (companies that need to issue credentials) I would just encourage you to spend a lot of time understanding the barriers to entry, so you can make sure to design a practical solution that aligns with those companies' ability to implement.  Their complexity doesn't always make sense from an entrepreneur's perspective, but we need to try hard if they will be compatible in any way.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is an early stage concept that requires significant development over the 12 month lifespan of developing the scope and delivering an early stage solution that can begin collaborating with external organizations.\n\nThe timeline is realistic, and includes the necessary resources to begin work, with a healthy budget built in to adapt on that timeline as the scope may emerge or integrations may become clear.\n\nThe proposer has considered risks, and I believe even in limited detail, one of the strongest parts of this proposal is how the proposer demonstrates their no BS approach to understanding the requirements and delivering a useful solution, to solve an enormous problem.

Mitigation is proposed with the solution to start first with the professions that are free from regulation as IT and office resources. This solution is thoughtful and shows deep considerations of the future of this project.\nThe proposer presents a plan with middle to low level of detail, however the plan is goal oriented and sets priorities which makes a good impression.\nThe project\u2019s MVP will be ready in 12 months and the first adopters will be sought after the native Cardano companies.\nThe proposer specifies where he will be looking to recruit and the hourly and yearly salaries in these countries. This again shows consideration of the future of the project.\nThe budget shows that a part of the budget is separated for Contingency and that the budget is composed according to the lower pay workforce. However given the international applicability of these skills, there is a risk for acquiring lower level professionals for the lower pay.\nThe proposer has in mind a team of 3 specialist working on this project and seeks additional 5 positions with different expertise. However the proposer fails to present the already gathered team or himself, which bring a really bad impression. \nThe proposer envisions this project to self fund after the initial launch. Therefore the project will not return for funding to Catalyst.

On the one hand, it is a job board that allows to exchange credentials in the form of VCs, and on the other hand, to get credentials from companies you have worked for. The project is to start in the blockchain/IT sector, as they are more receptive to such technology, and later expand to other areas. \nThe basic idea of such a platform could indeed be very growth-enhancing for the Cardano ecosystem. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a clear business strategy and details on implementation. The statement \"Start engaging with Cardano Projects\" is somewhat unclear. Which projects should be approached? Projects that have received funding from Catalyst but don't have a team yet? Or successful projects with ongoing business models that want to award their people. I think having a clear strategy here could be very helpful. Not only to be successful in running the platform, but also in development.\nOnce you get deeper into SSI, more questions arise that are not answered here: Under which governance framework should this take place? Which schemas should be used? Who has access to the VC? Is it all public on the platform?\nI think the team has a very interesting basic idea here, but hasn't gotten to the core of the idea yet and can't flesh it out accordingly.
