I have a few comments to point out, but I believe the impact can be maximum. To face a scenario of prejudice and aversion to cryptography and blockchain (we know that many people see technologies that involve cryptocurrencies only as a risky and quick way to get rich, not knowing the projects that really seek to make a difference and for society, etc.); the proponent suggests that a platform be created that will contain online comics, centered on the blockchain universe and aimed at attracting the gaming public to our community. It is said that mainstream gamers dislike on-chain games, and that many major and major platforms, such as Steam, do not include NFT games in their catalogues. This proposal aligns in many ways with our dApps challenge, more specifically addressing the topics \u201ccreation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d. Furthermore, the proponent makes clear its objective of, by attracting new players, to increase the number of \u201cMined CNFT, Market Traded CNFT, Chain Transaction, Infrastructure, dApp for Gaming in the Ecosystem, New Active Wallet\u201d and etc. The issues raised are unclear, such as: Cardano does not offer tools to reach players outside the crypto bubble; with that the Miverse platform will focus on that stable audience, and not just on those who are after quick and easy profit, excluding those games that don't make them profit immediately. I believe that the theory of the proposal is perfect, but I have some comments to make about some specific parts, which still left me in doubt. Would these comics be sold online only, or also in physical form? I believe it would be important to invest in physical models (for example, they could be sent by mail, it is not clear in which country the game developers reside - but from the information on the links it is in Asia. Maybe for when the project is more advanced, it will be a interesting solution to make this type of investment - not for now while development is in the early stages, but later). It is said that the comics would be CNFTs, perhaps it would be more appropriate if they were not native Cardano active tokens, since the objective is to dialogue more directly with people who have prejudice and aversion to blockchain? Would it be just 1 main story that would have multiple issues, or would each 15 page story be with different characters and plots of its own? This question arises because of the topics: \u201cHelp content creators monetize their idea, dream and assets by creating CNFTs for them + Help content creators more easily define the payment model for their fans and audiences\u201d. Regarding the players, it is said that they would be able to have a \u201cBetter understanding of the characters in the game and make players reflect on their own characteristics that tie into their favorite character. This will motivate them to participate and then the viral games to their communities in a positive way\u201d: how would they identify with the characters, what would be the characteristics of these characters, what kind of plot would they be involved in? In the excerpt \u201cBetter understanding of the game: structure, plot within the game, components, environments, the development phase of Miverse... based on comic book plots\u201d. It would be necessary for the proponent to better explain these characteristics of the game, such as: structure, plot, environment, etc. Our visualization of the final product could be more solid if we knew these points. I would also like to know more about content creators and how to attract readers.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "First, I would like to comment on how the links provided are great for us to better understand the whole project development process, because of the way they are organized by viewing. Photos of some team members are also attached, which is great to help us humanize the project, giving an idea of \u200b\u200bwho is behind the writing of the proposal. However, I believe that it would be even more appropriate if the proponent had attached a more detailed timeline here in the proposal itself, he states that it would be a very extensive content to be included, but I think it would be no problem, we would have a direct and safe way to understand what would be done each month. For example, the proposal informs what was done in the second quarter of 2022 and what would happen in the third quarter of that year: it would be more appropriate if the proposer had explained what would happen in each month, exactly, as neither in the attached links we have this more exact temporal division (this would also help us in the part of auditing the proposal). We have information about the script both here in the drafting of the proposal and in the links provided, there are many activities mentioned to be done, both in one place and in another, but the issues of temporality (which could be more exact) and the degree of detail of each activity itself could have been worked out better. For example in \u201cQIV, 2022: Developing the on-chain comics platform + Publishing comics on the on-chain comics platform\u201d; What small actions together would form the development process of this platform, how would the publication of the comics be publicized? How would readers be attracted? I think this disclosure process could have been a little better explained, we know of some activities that would compose this, such as: \u201corganize regular communication events weekly + artist streaming + artist show + publication of marketing materials in comics weekly + cartoon character clip\u201d; but what would these events and shows look like? Which artists would participate in the streams? How would this whole process take place? Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which is the use of financing, we know that the money requested would cover 3 months of the project, that is, the month here would cost 18,270 dollars, a very high amount. Expenses are broken down into a few topics: \u201cWriter and Editor Salaries: $5,000 * 3 = $15,000 + Publishing and Communication: $2,000 * 3 = $6,000 + B&W Production (Sketch, Ink and Lettering): $150 x 15 x 12 = $27,000 + Color Production (drawing and ink and lettering): $200 x 15 x 1 = $3,000\u201d. But the topics themselves deserved a little more detail, what would be the work routine of the writer and editor (would it be the same person?) to receive a salary of 5000 dollars? It is a very high value, if compared to the salaries requested in the other proposals. We should know how many hours per week they would dedicate to the project, in order to understand the value of the work hour. What would the tampons be and why would that cost 5% of the whole? Why would publishing and communication cost $2000 a month? We understand what the expenses would be, but they are so well argued. Finally, analyzing the team, it is not very clear who the content creators would be, how they would promote posts and conversations about the comic (this is mentioned in the impact), where this content would be released\u2026 In the excerpt: \u201cInstead of to focus on one author, we form a team of authors who love science fiction and are passionate about comics. In addition, we will closely follow readers' reactions to better plot stories that either surprise them or follow their insight. It will not only satisfy their experiences, but also make them viral this comic\u201d: how would they form a good team, how would they closely monitor the reactions of the readers and take this into account to continue developing the process? We are introduced to 2 people, directly: Ms. Trang and Juan Mart\u00ednez here in the drafting of the proposal, I think the ideal would be for the writers and artists to have also been presented here, because in the links provided we have an understanding of who would do what, but not about their resumes.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The topic is good, the first part is better than the second, as I will detail below. The auditability of the process is excellent, as we have a lot of information about what to monitor (the numbers of \u201cviews of comic series on Miverse, registration of users on Miverse through comics, comments, likes, interaction with the Miverse comic platform, users subscribers to comic series on Miverse, users watching comics and also from gamers\u201d), for example; and we also know by which platforms these KPIs would be reported, as they were achieved (proponents make some sites available). In addition to the partial results, they also report that what is behind this could be monitored: \u201cFor key metrics for the entire project, check our master proposal here + you can check the actual detailed executive roadmap here + if you want to know which ones group tasks are planned - in progress - completed, you can check out our page here + you can even suggest some of your ideas there in the future to improve Miverse Multiverse & Platform). In other words, everything is perfect regarding this part of the proposal, I believe that there are no suggestions to be made, as the proposers already inform us of everything we would need to know about monitoring both the processes and the partial results. Regarding the automatability of success, we know some KPIs that represent the more specific goals of the project \u201cproduce 12 episodes + attract 10,000 views for the comic on various comic platforms + adding 300 more members to the community created from the previous proposal\u201d. I believe that this information will also be made available on the attached links, but it would be interesting to have this information confirmed. The proponent and his team have a dream that their comics will be as impactful as One Piece, that after 3 months of the project, \u201creaders will mention a new sci-fi story with crazy and funny characters in their communities. And then they will compare this comic to others in the same way with the same vibe.\u201d But in this regard, I think the proponent lacked a little focus on how we will perceive the benefits of the project for Cardano, such as the increase in the number of active members in the community, number of CNFTs minted and in circulation by Cardano, more transactions being made in our networks and etc. I think it would be necessary for this data to be studied, collected and presented to the community, this could even be done through the attached links, such information being posted there to then be disseminated in our media, such as discord and telegram, for example.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1865, "q0": "There is currently no way to attract and convince gamers in the mainstream gaming industry to join Miverse's great games.

Miverse will provide a comic book and comic production platform so that in the long run, authors can monetize their dreams here. The proposal outlines progress and milestones along with specific tasks to be completed, stating what is in progress and what has been completed. It really impressed me because the work plan was written very detailed, specific and professional. The project's team has many participants, each person takes on a job. There are 3 core groups of people: Ms. Trang takes the position of Production Director / Editor, she is the real estate inspector. any spelling/grammar errors, responsible for tracking continuity, checking pencils, ink, colors, and letters. Writing Team - This team is led by Ms. Trang, who is responsible for writing the story. They are skilled and responsible for the overall story structure. Teams of artists will turn these sentences into comics, they take on the work of designing images for the characters in the story and the setting of the story.\nThus, looking at the experience and assignment of the core team of the proposal, we see that the team is fully capable of ensuring a successful project launch. The group also pointed out two possible risks that are the problem of attracting readers of manga who are struggling and not receiving funding. However, the group also had a plan to deal with these risks.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposed total required budget is $54810 , which is an adequate budget to launch an NFT game design project .

However, in my opinion, the group with statistics will have how many traditional games will like this experience, because most of the time I find this model will be popular among young people in countries like Japan and Korea, and As for other gamers, they will like the feeling of being immersed in the character, then having the control action on the devices, which will account for the majority of gamers. so what i would like to say to the proposed team is that there should be statistics in this game industry, so it will be more effective for zoning marketing implementation for this proposal,\nIn addition, the group mentioned 3 possible big risks but they were all prepared to avoid losses to this proposal.\nand based on the arguments in the solution of the proposal as well as examples like this this proposal may be suitable for the challenge, but since this is a different game platform, the team needs to add additional information.
