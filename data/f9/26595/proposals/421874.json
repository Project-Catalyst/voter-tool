The point being everyone is very anonymous about who they are and what they do.  As the team says, there is no real way to identify if the other side is genuine or not and this can be exploited if one intends to. We can restrict out transfers to those who we know are 100% genuine but how much can one go with that?

One is the development of the wallet itself which is almost done and hence might have no issues in execution. The other in the development of the social media platform with the wallet accounts.

The proposer stated that Medusa Social Hub is a communication layer of the Medusa Wallet that allows you to use your wallet as a part of your account. In addition, here there are two things: Medusa social hub and Medusa Wallet. Here, it means the users of Medusa social hub are also Medusa Wallet's users (As the propser also mentioned it). Since they have and plan for these two things, I would like the author make it clear how these two things fit with Cardano blockchain, beside that the Cardano has also its own wallet i.e., Yoroi wallet, this also need to be cleared. Despite that, I felt a lack of assurance about how this project would bring feedback to the Cardano community. I know this feedback will exist, but it would be great to have details of that. It would be interesting if we know better how these two things i.e., Medusa social hub and Medusa Wallet would work to connect with Cardano blockchain and Yoroi Wallet.

In relation to the budget, I see that the level of detail is alright. Perhaps one thing they could breakdown the budget for developer. How many developers that they hired which cost of $32K. about the team has shown to have enough skills and experience in the field to bring this project live.

This idea will be of great use for the average day Cardano user looking for ways to verify who they are talking to using their own wallet. Cardano has a lot of different wallets, all with different features and directions. This proposal clearly chooses a direction (i.e. Social Hub) which makes it easy to understand the problem & solution statements. The idea of a communication layer on top of an already existing wallet is greatly impacting the Cardano ecosystem for the user and voter. There are plenty of other benefits listed in the proposal to scale within this idea to fulfil all the wishes.

The timeline for the Social Hub is well written and understandable, with more features being added every 1-3 months. The budget seems to be reasonable as the team consists of 1 lead developer and 2 testers. Although, no further information is given about the professional security audit. But since this aspect is only in the last stage of the project I will be looking forward to this information in a later stage, but before the last stage. The only risk I see within the feasibility of the proposal is a limited amount of risks listed. There might be a lot of unknown obstacles while developing the different steps included in the timeline and the community should get insight in these risks and obstacles during the process. Important to mention is that the team is experienced and most likely very capable of tackling these problems. My tip: helping the community understand the risks and problems the project will face, will raise the transparency of the project and help the community understand better what you are working on. Also gaining better feedback in the future, due to a better understanding and ongoing process of evaluating the obstacles. One thing that really stands out to me and helps the community understand the problems & solutions is the fact that the writer of the proposal uses a lot examples to clarify the problems they are tackling and the solution for your average day life.

Also the writer using average day examples helps the community getting a better understanding of the process and the things to look out for when auditing the project. However, I am missing some KPI\u2019s to evaluate to success of the project in the long term. Examples would be: - New users using Medusa, amount of contacts added (after the function has been implemented), amount of users using the verification method, collaborations with existing projects for verification of NFTs or ticket payments, etc. The audibility section being very limited has a strength and a weakness with it. The strength being: the community has to use the already-existing Medusa wallet in order to audit the new implementation, which will results in more adoption and a better understanding. The weakness being: A lack of KPI\u2019s for further development in later stages and being able to audit while seeing the \u201cbigger picture\u201d.

The team displays a clear understanding of the existing issue and provide a solution that is novel and looks to enrich the current ecosystem. This is further enhanced by the section \u2018other benefits\u2019 in which proposers list other potential benefits beyond the scope of dealing with the primary issue. Not only does the proposal refer to the differences between their platform but identify the issue with the current system. In the case of exposure to a third-party bot/operator proposers could benefit from detailing how their platform avoids this and how avoiding this could lead to potential new use cases for those who have concerns about privacy and want a more secure alternative. This serves more effective than saying \u2018we want to change it\u2019. Consideration on how building on Cardano in particular especially benefits platform growth due to the unique features could also be better elaborated. Proposers have done well to address the problem and the benefits users will face but could look to explain how the enrichment of individual experience on the platform could serve beneficial l to the greater Cardano community. Integrations with sites asking for medusa specific wallets due to the higher level of security would be an example of this. Platforms could be incentivised to build on Cardano due to the benefits the unique platform provides. Proposers could consider existing services to integrate with and describe the impact their platform could have on new upcoming products within the Cardano ecosystem (social network dapps/nft minting projects being some examples).The proposers could have done more to list possible risks. Although the platform is already running this new feature may not receive enough awareness from the public to bring in new users. Proposers do claim there is high demand for the service (which as a Nami/Yoroi user I do agree with) they should look to evidence this. Low awareness could be easily mitigated by adequate marketing but remains a risk, nevertheless. In future proposers should consider all risks even if they appear trivial at first glance.

Proposers could benefit from attaching who is responsible for each task to assure their expertise aligns with the task making this is visible to proposal assessors. This could be linked to the budget creating an hourly breakdown of working hours for developers. There appears to be no red flags within the budget but consideration for a social media/marketing expert possible serving beneficial in spreading the word of the service. The team all appear to have qualifications in the relevant areas (computer science) as well as digital security(key for an online wallet).Verification of these credentials could serve beneficial, and addition of a possible LinkedIn profile would act as adequate proof of self.

Public channels do look to be used by proposers, with specific channels like twitter and telegram chosen. The proposers mention every update but fail to explain what this entails, whether these updates will be time specific (every month ) or event specific (finalisation of a key feature) should be specified. Also consideration of the reach the group have on these channels should be considered, a twitter post to around 300 followers (of time of writing) does not allow for the wider Cardano community to effectively audit project progress and outcomes. The team refer to general day to day use of the system as a metric for success. In essence the team look to achieve widespread use of the social hub.
