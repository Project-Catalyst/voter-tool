It seems quite clear they can scale based off this and the value-add to the Cardano community is very evident, given the importance of democratizing and decentralizing parts of human society's core infrastructure. Even beyond the Challenge, Simcrypted's proposal aligns to the more holistic Catalyst fund goals, notably adhering and promoting open source principles. They already have a functioning MVP.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer has clearly articulated all budget items, which are sufficiently broken down and detailed. Both the total budget and timeline look reasonable, fair and realistic, and it has considered some risks well. The proposer has provided good anecdotal evidence to their ability, skills and experience to make this proposal successful, however they did not share any references or links which overall brings them down to 4 stars. That being said, they have already launched an MVP and is in current operation so this is a strong indicator of success.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal address this excellently, given that all research and deliverables will be made open source. Additionally, marketing metrics will also be easy to review and analyse. The roadmap is again reasonable and clear which will make every monthly progress report easier to judge against. I also particularly like how the metrics and audibility roll-up to the broader proposal objectives. There are some unknowns given the nature of their proposal looking to explore and delve into deep telecom infrastructure and technical possibilities (a route which can lead to surprises!) however to their credit has been highlighted and considered with potential opportunities opened up for future proposals (not just by Simcrypted either).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2614", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12781, "q0": "This proposal aims to make our phone number more private and research to bring their current solution on Cardano. They currently provide a service where the user can buy a dummy number which is displayed on social media like whatsapp and can receive SMS. This creates more security because you own number isn\u00b4t displayed. Which the proposal they want to look into on- chain solutions that open up telecommunication and the results of the research. The outcome will be shared open source so everyone can profit from their research. \nThe product clearly has demand from many people who want to have a private phone number. Currently there are 1000 users on their product. Connection their usecase with Cardano could make a great product and impact on our privacy. \nTherefore the proposal matches the challenge strongly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is anonymous. They have added some information but more interesting is their MVP. They have built a fully functional MVP in the telecommunications space and they want to be recruiting people with other competencies like Plutus developing, researchers, Project managers. So their skill is credible through their MVP and they hire the additional competencies needed. Therefore it\u00b4s not good that the team isn\u00b4t already established, but their skill and approach is reasonable. \nThe roadmap is clear and well thought through. There are three different phases. 1. Research 2. Testing tech stacks 3. Socialising and marketing budget. All the phases are relevant and timing makes sense. In addition all the tasks are important. \nThe budget is fully transparent. It uses the criteria from the timeplan and allocates money to them. The money allocation looks justified and fair. \nThe team will come back to catalyst for additional funding if the research shows that there is a good option to put their application/ parts of the application on Cardano.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has made several relevant metrics on several different areas. It is easy to audit all of them because everybody has access to the information except for the test cases who are published.\nThe roadmap is clear and they have communicated their plan after they finished the research. \nOverall the solution solves the stated problem and could create more privacy for us all.

It has built an MVP with a small but growing user base and is now seeking Project Catalyst support to expand into Cardano and blockchain in general. It has demonstrated a clear proposal that aligns strongly to the Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge. The scalability is evident and there appears to be significant value-add to the Cardano chain and Catalyst ecosystem. Given the importance of democratizing and decentralizing parts of human society's core infrastructure, Simcrypted has identified key areas of exploration from both a research/academic view point and practical options that we have available today.

As they will be asking academics and others to get deep into the technology and telecom infrastructure, the content of the findings will be interesting to read (which will be open source).

No need for Sim, download and no personal data disclosure. Their MVP sees around 1,000 users signed up.

The proposal fits the challenge very well in that it promotes \u201cdecentralizing\u201d and \u201copen source\u201d which are core goals of Cardano.

It would be great if the team could provide the alternative communication channels other than the official website and medium article that the community can keep up with project progress.
