The user can rent, list, and run an auction. The Loqul real estate marketplace could eliminate bottlenecks due to middlemen in property transactions. This will bring value to property owners, tenants and increase Cardano adoption. The proposal aims to deliver an MVP but also encounter some obstacles ie. lack of fiat-crypto on and off ramp, finding good API, background checks. The team has partnered with TangoCrypto ( an APIs and developer tools service to Cardano ) and has considered alternative payment options to provide a seamless experience for users to pay in dollars and be able to use smart contract functionality. The proposer has rightly pointed out that homeowner association or condo do not allow subletting the property and Loqul will have to adapt their solution according to the market they operate. Their Loqul dapp would be a good candidate solution that is bringing the value to the Cardano community  and hence, the proposal fits rightly with this challenge setting. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The Loqul team has provided the clear road map and milestones between Q3 2022- Q4 2022. The project can do beta for Miami properties quite fast as they have undertaken their project a few months now.  Just a quarter later, they plan to roll out full listing and onboarding feature in a decentralized style. Within the same quarter, they plan to implement the rating system (for landlords, tenants and roommates) and generate sponsoring section for landlords and ad revenue. They have requested $20k as runway for founders and $15k for developer costs but haven't mentioned the number of working hours on the project. They also listed team members with their respective profiles. The team has a good mix of skill and experience. With the reasonable timeline, budget and good team, I am confident that the project can be carried out successfully. The project budget could have been broken down with more provided detail. The ranking of this proposal will improve if the team can give info about their pay rate and considered risk and mitigating approach to bring this project to a success.

The team holds the user experience ( onboarding landlords, agents and tenants) as the project KPIs (MVP stage).  Other metrics are Daily active users, weekly active users and monthly active users, % of listed properties VS those getting rented out. These metrics can be used once the MVP is functioning. The Real Estate rental marketplace solution addresses the problem of building dapp that boost Cardano adoption.

Their approach is to group up all the crucial information that one would need during the renting process into their identity tokens so that the involved parties would have more certainty before reaching the final decision. \nFor the most part, the Loqul marketplace will resemble other rental marketplaces, both on- and off-chain, in terms of functionality. Rental contracts and crypto transactions will be made and monitored in-app with secure proofs of payment, delivered through smart contracts. Local brokerages will be invited to cooperate with the team and they will lend the help of real estate agents to aid the landlords and tenants operating on the app. \nThe way that tenants find their future accommodation on Loqul is quite similar to shopping on e-Commerce platforms, as there will be multiple listings of properties, either whole areas or just separate rooms, available for renting along with their respective descriptions. And when they come into one that they think would suit them the most, they can place an offer of interest for the property in the case of an ordinary listing, or if there is an auction for a particular property, they will have to participate.\nIn the events of an auction, users will have to have their wallets connected to their account and show their NFT identity for guaranteed transparency. Auctions will share similar features and functions to eBay listings, therefore, users who frequently surf eBay should feel familiar and have a more convenient time using Loqul. \nThere will be a rating system for all participants to rate their reputation. The higher the reputation is, the more credible one person is. A property owner with a high reputation is more likely to offer quick and satisfactory service, and a tenant with a good reputation is more likely to be responsible and have a good sense of community. \nThe target audiences will of course be landlords who have properties or units for rental and the Gen Z generation (those born in the latter half of the 90s till now) who are looking for a temporary place to live and open to having roommates or housemates. Additionally, landlords should be eager to hop on board a platform that safely secures their agreements and brings in tenants with goodwill, and Gen Z are the younger audiences who are more likely to be interested or invested in the crypto world, thus a high chance of them adopting this application. \nThe proposer has demonstrated their objectives and ambition to attain with this project, which is to deliver a fully functional app that benefits all parties involved and Cardano itself and further evolve it through collaborations with other projects to hopefully develop an ecosystem in the future. And to back up their claims, the team has also devised the key metrics they would use to measure the future success of the project.\nAs for the current risks and hurdles that the team are facing with the project, which are the acquiring of a good fiat-crypto on and off ramp, finding good APIs that integrate with the Cardano blockchain, getting an effective method to conduct quick and reliable background checks and gaining the cooperative consent from associations and condos. All of them have been carefully considered and packed with viable solutions.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As the work to create a functional MVP is already underway, the timeline and milestones provided in this section focus more on the gradually evolving outcome of the MVP and the dedicated website. More noticeably, the MVP is expected to be rolled out to the public via a beta test in Q3 of 2022 and the following full version with aforementioned features and functions is planned to be released in the next quarter, which should indicate that the MVP is nearing completion.\nIn the requested budget part, It\u2019s a pleasant surprise to see that the team has been putting their love and maximum effort to finalize the MVP even though they haven\u2019t been receiving any salary. Therefore, the requested funding will be used by the proposers to pay the developers and interns who have been working tirelessly as a way of paying respect and appreciation, which I believe is very commendable. \nThe listed members of the project are all enclosed with their respective positions that they\u2019re in charge of, along with their LinkedIn profiles should anyone wish to have a closer look.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In terms of auditability, I believe that the team has achieved a certainly positive degree of it. Not only does the team use the dedicated landing page and marketplace as places to post updates and news about the project during its execution phases, boasting clarity and availability, but they will also continue that flow even after the project has reached its final day of finishing touches. Furthermore, there are and will be standards and criteria deducted by the team, which also act as key metrics, to measure progression during the execution phase and measure success when the project has been fully implemented. \nThe envisioned success for this project is also what the team has set out to achieve, which is a fully functional MVP, hopefully followed by the final product in a close and foreseeable future, that delivers seamless renting experiences and a safe and trusting environment where people can expect near-professional service and behaviors. The SDGs that the team aims to achieve are Goal 10 and 11, boasting equality and sustainability, and their subgoals are basically to enhance living standards, growth and development of countries and nature preservation.

The proposer aims to introduce the blockchain to the property owner and tenant that this platform provides transparency, speed and secure payment for real estate industry In addition, lead to MVP credibility. The user will be able to see different rental property listings posted by landlords and their descriptions, once the find the properties that they interested in, they put in the auction to bargain the price of the properties. Furthermore, all transactions are handled by smart contracts. The market that proposer target to is Landlords that have 1-4 Units that they manage on their own (B2B), and Gen-Z/Young Professionals/College Students. it is good target audience since they are participant in the rental of real estate. Furthermore, the proposer is working to find payment method for the transaction as they said that we are running into on the technical side is finding a good fiat-crypto on and off ramp. We believe it is vital to provide a seamless experience for users to be able to pay in dollars, and have us convert to ADA on the backend to be able to use smart-contract functionality. However, they need to have a stablecoin or a very reliable fiat to crypto on and off ramp that handle the conversions on the backend for our users since Djed will not be available for use in the US. I believe they able to solve this case.

About the script, they present which phases would need to be completed to reach their goals and it is sufficient information that project can be implemented well thus, it makes the community easy to understand. In relation to the budget, I see that the level of detail is alright. Perhaps they could breakdown the budget and provide specific cost for example, how many founder should be paid with the budget $ 20.000 and how many part-time developers should pay with the budget $15.000. however, the plan is doable and I believe, the proposal will be implemented successfully", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I find how the team concern with auditability.

They would give update any functionality that they achieve e.g., progress on the smart contracts, progress on API integrations with TangoCrypto, progress on background check integration, and finally getting the fully functional MVP ready. Furthermore, they will collect metrics on our Daily Active Users, Weekly Active Users, and Monthly Active Users; allowing us to calculate a retention rate and track how effective our product is. In addition, they will collect the number of tenants bidding per property, allowing them to leverage their tenant supply to their landlords.

The need for an integration of various dApps into the cardano ecosystem, to drive impact and increase adoption, is what this project seeks to answer. Marketplace rental and house listing has mostly been transacted through traditional means, however, the need to digitize real estate onto the blockchain marketplace is transformative. The system of enlisting, auctioning, minting assets by stakeholders in the real estate rental marketplaces will revolutionize how housing transactions are carried out if this project is funded. The team\u2019s desire to use cardano based technologies like the Atala Prism, smart contract system etc. demonstrates how this market is willing to integrate more into the cardano ecosystem. With the detailed experiences of the team, I am certain about the impact value a successful project implementation can create.

As this project has undergone extensive research independently, It is likely that the provision of funds will only propel the project into success. The budget provided is relatively small considering the scope of the project. However, as mentioned in the proposal, the budget will go towards remuneration for the volunteering developers and the team. The project has included a couple of risks involved when operating, however, they have detailed various systems that can mitigate these risks should they arise. I commend the team for including statistics about housing and landlords in the proposal, as well as their identified target audience, however, I would have preferred if the team detailed how exactly they plan to onboard the stakeholders on the marketplace, especially the landlords, and what system would they use to accept or refute house listings.

These measures I consider as high performance indicators for the team to track its growth overtime.

While more steps need to be taken to complete a lease, Having a third party manage contracts and receipts can build tenant confidence and increase credibility with landlords thanks to a credit rating. The author also clearly outlines the customer they are targeting and analyzes why their potential customers will love this type of rental. The integration of crypto payments on the platform will increase the liquidity of Cardano wallets and this unique idea can further promote interaction on the blockchain.

This project perfectly fits the goal of the challenge.\nAfter completing a background check, tenants are onboarded and granted an Identity NFT that enables them to interact with the market. Landlords may be confident that they are working with legitimate, screened potential renters in this way. NFTs enhance asset transfers between individuals and fundamentally alter how ownership is kept. You may list your house for rent on this website and get safe payments. NFTs serve as receipts and are used to register monthly payments. With the help of the Cardano multi-asset ledger, Loqul makes advantage of this expertise.\nThe proposer presented the features of Loqul very clearly, including the main components and main activities of the project. The target market is landlords that manage 1-4 units on their own, as well as Gen-Z, Young Professionals, and College Students because they are already receptive to having roommates.
