This proof of accomplishment is not specified in detail so I can't tell you what exactly it is, but funded  proposers will have to provide it and it will need to be auditable, although what that means is not specified as well. This seems like a good idea, but the proposal needs some more polishing, because after reading it I was left with a lot of practical questions which I'll touch more on in the feasibility part.\nOverall I like the impact this proposal would have if the practical side of things turns out well thought out. This is a topic I have thought about as well and it is a very difficult problem to solve for a couple of reasons. Most of the proposals are very difficult to measure and to compare with others. I mentioned comparison, because you need to have a standard of what it means for the proposal milestones to be met, which isn't clear right now. The second problem is scalability, which I'll expand on later as well.\nI'm not sure I agree with the mentioned challenges and risks, there are a lot bigger problems this proposal could face like: enforcing all proposals to follow the standard, defining the standard itself between different funs, having the experience to be able to judge if a job is done or not (examples: how to find out if a software feature that doesn't have a facing UI is implemented or not, how to find out if marketing KPIs are reached?). These are all very difficult questions, but ones that need an answer in order for this idea to be realized.\nThe KPIs seem vague, because there are no concrete numbers to strive for, just \"number of onboarded projects\" which is a great metric but it's not a valid KPI which is an important distinction. Overall I see a lot of details missing from this proposal so I'm uncertain of the impact this proposal would have.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I managed to verify the listed team members credentials and to compare the skills listed to the ones I found and the linked ones and it all checks out. The team do have very specific skills which I'm sure are extensive, butt they do not cover all the skillset to distinguish between successfull implementation and not for all the challgnes sunce fund 3.\nAs I previously mentioned scalability is one of the biggest issues this proposal faces IMHO. \"We will talk to at least ten projects a week. \"  thats noble, but that's not something you can currently do for all proposals with the current team members, I'm talking both understanding and establishing if the features delivered are the ones mentioned in the milestone or at least acceptible and second just the time in a day to manage all proposals. Let's say you don't enforce the standards, than what happens with the proposals that you just didn't have the time for, should they be ignored or not flagged even if they're worse than a team for example that is just late. So this is the kind of solution that whould be a bit pointles if not applied for everyone.\nThere's a mention of a number previously funded projects, but there was no mention or links to those projects and considering the proposers push for accountability and proof of accomplishment, I fund it inappropriate they don't hold themselves to the same standards.\nThe budget breakdown could use a lot more work. I struggle to aggree with the numbers: 4 hours per project to find out if it's delivering milestones seems a bit unreasonable. Let's say a project is funded for 6 months and you give reports once every two weeks. That means a total of 12 meetings. That means 20 minutes to understand and verify the work that been done in 2 weeks. As a software engineer and an assessor since fund 7 I find those numbers really hard to believe possible. It would take 20 minutes only to read and understand 1 / 10th of the development made for that time and because the proof of accomplishments data structure wasn't specified I can't speak if it would make this timeline possible.\n\"Proof of Accomplishment Sytem 25000 USD\" - I didn't find aby more information on this: what will this system be?, will it be mandatory for everyone?, will there be a benefit to use it if it's not? what does a proof of accomplishment look like?.\nAll and all I'd have to disagree with the notion this proposal is feasible for the aforementioned reasons. Even so I do believe this is a really important idea that needs to be implemented, so I urge the team to keep at it and come next funding round with an even better proposal.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As I mentioned there are decent metrics but not measurable KPIs. I find the lack of information considering the auditability of this proposal strange considering it's content. I didn't see any mention of accountability of the progress of this proposal if it's funded. Reports in telegram channels or even twitter notifications would have been nice to have.\nI didn't find a definite roadmap of iterative tasks or items to follow along with for any future supporter of this proposal. More details are necessary.\nThere's a clear problem to be solved, but IMHO the solution eludes the community still. In summary I think the auditability of this proposal would be questionable.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2463", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Please filter this out.

A lot of this is word salad and does not make any logical sense.  while he has strung words together into sentences they have no context in terms of relevance to the proposal. Please filter this out"}, {"id": 5513, "q0": "The proposal understands the need for a tool to assess the already funded proposal's completion and impact. It is true that a majority of the projects funded haven't seen an eventful closure and there is no substantial evidence available for the community to audit and scrutinize them. The proposal addresses the need for a bridge that fills the gap between the community and funded projects. Proof of accomplishment would give the community the overall idea about the return of investment and how impactful all their time and efforts have been reciprocated by the proposers. However, a manual process the author suggests might not be the most preferred approach but at least the best that we can do at this stage. Maybe an automated process, later on, could help speed up the process and also reduce human errors assuming that going forward more and more proposals will be funded by catalyst. This could have an enormous impact on the entire Funding cycle as the number of fraudulent and plagiarized proposals are being submitted incrementally with every funding rounds.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There exist no plausible evidence to make conclusive assumptions regarding the probability of the proposal being a success. The proposer however provides his experience in the field and also the experience of his teammates. The process is manual and the members trying to contact the individual proposal owners might not end up being prolific due to a lot of reasons, some might not respond, some might produce false reports, and so on. And eventually, it will be the team members who would be producing the proof of accomplishments collected from them all, and the conscience developed might vary from one team member to another and there might be some discrepancy in the end. The fund also looks a little overboard considering that most of it are manual work and the quality of work depends highly on the probability of successful intervention with the authors of various proposals. Taking into consideration that the idea is great and exciting I can support the claims of the author but the suggested approach might not be the best way to go about it.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I felt the proposal lacks a lot of required information for one to picture its probability of success. However, the author makes the doubt go away by providing the readers with a set of well-constructed KPIs. The number of proposals reached out to, the number of projects who submit their proofs, and also a report on the number of hours worked on the project might be plausible metrics the auditors depend upon. The important fact would be auditing a proposal who is trying to audit the other proposals, hence I feel the author would provide extended assistance to make sure that the auditing process turns out to be hassle-free and worthwhile. The success of this proposal will surely ignite a lot of other proposals that might wanna work on automating this process and provide a user-friendly interface for the community to check the feedback and flags against each funded proposal. The open-source nature helps the auditing and hosting conferences of the community to provide the report of the entire process shall show the success of the project.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This is a good and fair assessment.

On the budget part, I'd like to commend you for determining the total number of funded projects (up to F7) and calculating the cost per project ($140).

In line with the concerns of the Cardano community, the sustainable development goal is based on all completed projects and used as committed. The proposed solution creates a system whereby any project , social service can establish transparency, tracking capabilities, and auditing capabilities using blockchain. The right solution to solve the stated problem and have a good impact on the project proponent. The benefits of project owners are achieved when the details of their project are known to the community, if the project is not completed they get contributions from the community to restart the project. Bringing PoC to implement the solution is appropriate, the identity and reputation of the projects are made public. The impact of this project on the community is huge, the choice of projects that have been successfully completed is prioritized. The reputation of the project has been audited transparently making the community safe to participate in projects with good PoC. The elements of transparency and tracking of projects that have been funded from F1 to F7 will have a big impact on Cardano. Completed projects will develop better, unfinished projects will be restarted after solving difficulties, funded projects are not implemented, the project owner is not funded the following funds and carries a bad identity in the community. Doing this helps the Cardano ecosystem develop better, eliminating projects that are wasting resources, good projects are growing. The author cited the challenge and risk of \"failing to achieve clarity on the project track record,\" the author optimized the data collection mechanism to minimize risk as appropriate. I have an opinion for the project: The implementation of providing detailed information of funded Project owners may be dishonest, uncooperative this makes it difficult for the author and the implementation team. Authors need proof for gathering information to create PoC (reputation) for them, their project will develop better than expected. Language risk is also a major barrier, language between countries, languages each locality affects the collection of data, In addition to direct communication, the author can exchange in writing to minimize this risk. While there have been translation project considerations for inclusion in this project, the risk of misleading local languages is still possible.\nI rated: 4\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The project implementation plan is full of details and data on projects that have been funded from F1 to F7, with a total of 642 projects that have been funded needing to collect information. The plan has reasonable implementation timelines, the 2nd month of application completion, and the proof-of-completion meter. Application building techniques and structures are not detailed, information about the application and the meter Proof of completion is not specific. The inspection is carried out in the 3rd month and there are specific KPIs due to the project measurement such as the PA assessment. The plan incorporates translation projects to find the optimal solution for different languages for the entire project to be tracked. The project team consists of 6 members, they are active members of the Catalyst community, have information about the ability and capacity to complete the project (as evidence shown on LinkedIn). The recommended amount of $120880, which represents 1.5% of the cost of the F9 challenge, is appropriate. The amount spent on the information collection of the tracked project is $140 with 4 hours of work is reasonable, $25000 to create the application and evidence system. The project has hedged against the risks with $6000 room for incurred during implementation. We can see that the money granted is being used for the right purposes as planned.\nI rated: 4\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The implementation roadmap has a timeline for achieving results, the contents of the work performed are reported monthly. The measurement of the author given during the implementation process is the number of projects implemented, sending information and the time of implementation of information collection, the number of projects provided with positive proof of completion.

However, the construction of the application has not been mentioned, the plan to build the application and the process of implementing the application creation have not been given. We hope that the author will complement the application building process through a detailed report sent to Catalyst. KPI defines successful projects: the index of completed F1 to F4 projects is put on the system, the application is completed. The rest from F5 to F7 (about 547 projects) we have not seen results, we look forward to the collection of information of these projects to be completed and put on the system.

This will be difficult at first because the amount of funded proposal is quite large, the workload will be larger but will get the most accurate information.
