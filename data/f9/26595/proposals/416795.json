The solution will use non transferable tokens and dynamic content NFTs to create these reputation models. The execution of this solution allows users to start providing a type of social collateral when interacting with projects where their actions and behaviours in the project could influence their reputation by changes to the dynamic content in the NFT that is always attached to their wallet. This solution has a massive potential to create high impact as there is a need for solutions where the end user can create reliable and ongoing reputation in ecosystems without having to reveal their full identity. It also covers the need for people to have more ownership of their own data and which projects will have access to and can interact with that information. The solution intends to utilize what is being built with Iagaon as a decentralized storage solution to make this proposal possible. The proposal is currently at the idea stage and the proposers outline that a risk for this proposal is that it is indeed an ambitious project to deliver. The two main risks they cover regard the business model of this proposal and issues surrounding how data can be deleted from the NFT that has changing content. As an idea, and as some feedback, I imagine one approach could be for people to have to pay to remove bad reputation points from their NFT or need to perform some form of public good or good deed that is verifiable. As someones reputation grows this cost could increase or the number of good deeds could increase to a certain threshold to create the right incentives for people to have some control over their reputation but for changes to have a cost to that user. Allowing a user to pay to remove certain things could be part of the business model that makes this work! Overall this is a very exciting project that has enormous potential in other applications across the ecosystem whether that's finance, climate change initiatives, gaming and the rest! This is because the same model is repeatable and transferrable across many markets and domain areas. As one piece of critical feedback I believe this proposal should have mentioned self sovereign identity and to what capacity it should be integrated into a solution like this as SSI helps users to be the sovereign owners of their data. In future proposals I would kindly ask the Iagon team to provide thorough reasoning and justification for the inclusion or exclusion of utilizing SSI technology with this suggested solution.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of creating a detailed plan the team outline that this proposal is in idea stage. They outline three phases after this which cover the business model, token type implementation, integration token into Iagon, support adoption of new token standards, deploy the reputation model and finally collaborate with end users and projects. The roadmap could have added more depth to what will be happening in these steps to add more clarity to increase confidence that this proposal will be feasible. A budget breakdown separates the distribution of funds into market research, architecture, consultancy fees, development and audit/security costs. A spreadsheet image is provided that shows how this will be spent amongst different roles in the team or with consultants. The costings look reasonable for the deliverables of the proposal. The team details are provided with some professional LinkedIn links provided and the website also provides a background and more information about the team. Iagon already have partnerships with GeniusYield and are in talks with DC Spark. The team does not yet have a fully launched product however they are open to beta testes. Overall it appears the team have the right background to execute a task as described, have a number of growing partnerships that would be able to support this work. In terms of improvement, more details could have been added in regards to the plan and there is also a risk of execution for proposal as it relies on unfinished releases from Iagon that this proposal will rely on. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For tracking the progress of this proposal the team outline that they follow an agile sprint based process and that a third party organisation would be who deals with the auditing of the code. It would have been good to have more information on how the progress of this proposal will be communicated with the community over different social channels. It also would have been beneficial to have a Github repository link for any open source work. It is also not explicitly clear what would be open source from this proposal, in future proposals making this clear would be beneficial as the impact of proposals like this in an open source format could be highly effective for supporting the development community. In terms of success the list provided covers the execution of the different stages for this proposal. It would have been good to suggest some example initial use cases that they believe would attain initial adoption so that both assessors and voters could have higher confidence that the execution of this proposal can lead to adoption in the short term. Overall the clarity of this proposal is to a good standard with the main improvements being some more information around open sourcing parts of the proposal, approaches to communicate progress to the community and being more specific on objectives for how this solution could realistically be used in the short term.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 7, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6671, "q0": "This is a highly technical proposal, but links extremely well with the challenge. Let\u2019s try to make sense of it. To summarize the problem statement, we have to understand that it is difficult to trust crypto users based solely on their wallet address, and we need a way to establish trust in this pseudonymous environment. The solution proposed here is the development self-sovereign pseudonymous reputational model, which needs two additional pieces of technology to be implemented: non-transferable (aka soul-bound) NFTs and dynamic content NFTs, which have the ability to change the off-chain data at a later point in time. I would be lying if I said here that I truly understand  \n\nThe proposal seems to be backed up by a research paper of Rohit Gupta, a co-founder of Iagon, the company behind this proposal. I did open the research paper (from 2004) and skimmed the abstract, and we are in fact told that the paper proposes a reputation management framework for large networks \u201cachieved by developing trusted communities of nodes whose members trust each other and cooperate to deal with the problem of nodes\u2019 selfishness\u201d\n\nIf it is indeed possible to develop these two new types of NFTs based solely on that research, in this case the proposal has an extremely high potential impact for Cardano, especially if the development will take into account the EUTXO model and develop the features in such a way to make use of all the Cardano features brought by the Vasil hardfork (metadata, inline datum, etc.). But since this is a highly technical proposal, it\u2019s rather difficult for the average assessor (me) to vouch that the technology and prior research are enough for the technology to be built. In conclusion, a very unique value proposition for which I can only offer four stars. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Iagon is a Norway based technology company focused on the decentralized cloud services industry and the company behind this proposal. They have a very informative website, with many external links and descriptions of their product, and the team is very diverse in terms of skills and competencies. \n\nTimewise, the team is currently finalizing the idea and discussing potential use cases. The project should take around six months to complete, and would be split in three phases: phase 1 would bring the development of the business model and the new token type. Phase 2 would integrate Iagon\u2019s solution with the toke and work with wallet developers to increase adoption. Phase 3 would see the deployment of the reputational product. There is a rather worrying phrase within the proposal stating that \u201cThe initial idea came from Navjit Dhaliwal, and the algorithm developer Trym M\u00e5ke Bruset. More details concerning the project design will be provided by them\u201d. Provided when and how, and why not not, within the proposal? This is definitely an unfortunate error that they have not finalized including all the technical details within the proposal.\n\nThe budget is presented in a very detailed manner in two table screen shots, but it would have been a good idea to include a text version within the proposal itself. Overall there is an extensive level of detail for each budget caption, with the highest part of the budget funding the technical design and consultancy fees, mainly through monthly fees attributable to each developer working for the project. A strong point is that the team also accounts for an external audit of the code, but we do not have additional details as to how exactly the selection of the third party will take place and how they intend to mitigate potential conflicts of interest stemming from this part of the project. In addition, we are being informed that there are two ways of spending the budget, but it is not very clear what the distinction is between these two solutions, and perhaps more thought should have been placed in a few simple explanations. \n\nIn conclusion the proposal seems feasible from an operational point of view, although not perfect given that they don\u2019t make it easy to understand the budgetary implications of their two proposed solutions and that there are still technical details lacking, so four stars are appropriate.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has adopted an agile working methodology and conducts sprint planning to track the project\u2019s progress. The team also has a QA function but they will be using a third party audit as well, so this is a very good sign. Sadly, we are not informed whether the code developed will be open sourced or not, and this is definitely a critical piece of information that should have been included here. Another worrying point is the fact that the company does not present us any github repository for their work, and we can only assume that the earlier question regarding open source coding, and there is no evident effort to engage in discussion with the wider Cardano community. \n\nLastly, the team makes a good effort of defining what success means for the project: if in the future, projects will be incentivized to use this technology and to share their collected data with other projects while maintaining user sovereignty. I appreciate the effort but I would have expected more in terms of: \n\n- setting clear goals in terms of how many projects to use the technology in the future\n- include a detailed set of performance indicators relevant for a technology that wishes to position itself as a standard within the ecosystem\n- finally, make it very clear whether the developed solution will be completely open sourced. \n\nGiven the many (but not critical) worrying points above, I think four stars are appropriate for this project\u2019s feasibility.

The required parties or platforms can update the reputation data based on the user's behavior on the files stored on Iagon's storage. Therefore, this proposal is aligned with the challenge as it involves the creation of a reputation model product.\n\nThere is a demand for a reputation model in the crypto space. For example, there has been a conversation going on in the Cardano space to use the reputation model in Catalyst, and if I am not wrong, several proposals are already working on this problem, and they are utilizing the 'Atala Prism DIDs' for developing the solution. Therefore, if the proposer can successfully build this product, it will positively impact and add value to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nI think the proposer should also utilize Atala Prism DID instead of creating a new 'soul bond token' protocol. This will reduce overall cost and saves a lot of time which can be spent to complete the other parts of the proposal and launch the final product soon.

The Challenge is looking for novel and viable applications so this proposal addresses the challenge beautifully. \n\nThe proposal\u2019s approach to build on their existing decentralized cloud platform enables the system which has never been tried before. By relying on the EUTxO accounting model, this solution on Cardano is very unique in nature.
