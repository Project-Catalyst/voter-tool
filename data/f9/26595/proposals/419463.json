Phase one is now in beta testing and this proposal is for their phase two which is a dungeon crawler. They focus on playability without pay-to-win, and there is a play-to-earn aspect, something which is very popular and might help bring new users to Cardano. I enjoy playing blockchain games and think this is a huge growth industry.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has been very visible to the community. It's encouraging that they are not outsourcing any development and they only work with people they know. We have been told that demos from the closed beta test will be available by the end of the month, however, it would be helpful to see some concrete development from phase one now, before funding phase two. They have previously stated that the three phases require $500,000. If they aren't able to secure enough funding, then all three phases might not be developed, but they do have other funding sources: NFT sales, ISPO and IDO. The proposal has a clear budget breakdown.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Details of how phase two can be audited during development are lacking. It's important that progress of development can be measured.

The proposed solution is aligned with the gaming aspect of this challenge. Moreover, the proposer has a high ambition to create the first AAA game on Cardano that brings mass adoption to Cardano. Having an AAA game will very likely drive adoption for Cardano from multiple target user groups (e.g., turn-based gamers, fans of competitive games, core gamers, casual gamers NFT enthusiasts) because AAA games on the blockchain are still rare breed. The proposer addresses how they plan to be sustainable afterward; this proposal serves as the last phase of a series of related proposals since Fund 5, and the team targets financial independence after feature release. The goals and metrics of the proposal are highly aligned with the challenge settings (e.g., new user accounts, impression, view, NFT sale volume) and Fund9's strategic goal (i.e., prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem). Overall, I assess the propsal covers all criteria of its impact effectively. If there is one more thing to add, I would suggest the team provide a bit more contextual information on the size of the AAA gaming industry, thus they can help the community better visualize AdaQuest's potential impact.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am strongly convinced that the implementation of this proposal is highly feasible. First, the team has demonstrated their track record of implementation in the previously funded proposals, which serve the same project (ADAQuest), in Fund5 and Fund8. The team has laid out a good foundation regarding the technology, gameplay, style, graphics, and most importantly, community. They have more than 850 members on their Discord and they develop the game with real-time feedback from this community (Discord server, support/claps on proposal). The proposer discusses in detail the unique features and gameplay of this phase and attaches the graphics/UI which demonstrate that the work has already been underway. As this is the last phase of their game development project before being financially sustained, the team should have a strong motivation to meet the finish line. They show their thoughtful planning in the risks section as well by considering challenges and risks that may intervene with the implementation and proposing approaches and tools to help mitigate those risks. The proposer adopts modern software development tools (e.g., JIRA, Confluence, Slack). The proposer provides a monthly timeline and corresponding key deliverables across the 5-month duration of the project. The budget is allocated by functions with details regarding the number of team members and cost per month for each role. The budget cost is very reasonable to my understanding, and the proposer highlights that they would use a relatively low marketing budget as they are confident in their bottom-up marketing and organic growth strategy. Overall, I assess the team has put great effort into their implementation plan.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I strongly agree that this project is verifiable. The success is clear and straightforward to track: the Vertical Slice Dungeon Crawle feature release to AdaQuest, increase adoption from the gamer community, and contribution to mass adoption of Cardano, The proposer sets out the KPIs to measure the progress and impact (e.g., # of new user accounts, website visits, NFT sales). The proposal could also be audited along the way, using the roadmap and milestones provided. As this is the last development phase for AdaQuest after a series of funded proposals were in Fund5 and Fund8), the community has already had good data points of how the team performed in their previous proposal. I understand from the proposal that AdaQuest already has active social media channels to engage with and update the gamer and investor community, but I would suggest the team add one more communication channel to update the broader Cardano ecosystem of their key milestone (for example sending monthly reports or presenting at the Townhalls).\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9142, "q0": "\"This proposal is about building phase 2 of AdaQuest, a game project that combines three different game stages into one Total Virtual World Game Experience.\n\tPhase 2 is called Dungeon Crawler, when we hear this name, we can guess the game will give dungeons for players to explore.

If you have been waiting for a AAA fantasy roleplaying game on Cardano with deep Web3 principles, Fun as a first principle and very cool Cardano integration (FTs and NFTs), these are the final steps of that journey.\n\nDescribed here is the final implementation of all the gameplay elements, development milestones, business requirements and blockchain integrations from past funding rounds, culminating in PC and mobile release.  Specifically they are funding the final 4 month development sprint to tie all these modules together into a comprehensive game experience, including programming the interactions between the game mechanics and procedurally generated maps, finalizing and locking art design, integrating the sound and narration assets to the engine, and all the little details and bughunting that mark a release version.\n\nThis is a project that has received tremendous support from the community, in a reciprocal arrangement that has been beneficial to Catalyst (the team here are creators and co-supporters of the original Gamer's On-chained challenge setting), and has seen 100s of unique wallets voting and hundreds of millions of ada in voting power, even in funding rounds where they were not ultimately funded.  With a growing community of extremely active users, who have played a pivotal feedback role in iterating the quality and engagement of the game, this team is at the precipice of delivering on the promise to onboard gamers and casual fans to Cardano in a fun, secure, and accessible way.  5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline is clear and they do a great job of showing both the broad timeline and the delivery of all the current milestones required by this project.  They do note the early funding period issue with difficult to track milestones as the work is gearing up (and this is the first project I have seen actually account for the holiday season in estimating their december deliverables), but I found no real issues with the early milestones.  Even if not listed as KPIs these are reportable progress indicators that will make effective monthly reports.\n\nThe team itself is still the same team that started out in this space to have fun and deliver the kind of game that they would love to play, and that hasn't changed.  Despite managing a huge community and balancing rough markets and economic conditions, they still seem to be rooted in their original enthusiasm for the project and the process, and they have continued to form partnerships throughout the gaming landscape on Cardano, as well as continuing to add to their team.\n\nThe budget is on point, and as always, I am amazed at the quality they have been able to squeeze out of limited funding.  For $160k I believe we are getting about $300k of effort, even taking into account the work and assets delivered as part of earlier proposals.  They also indicate a very small marketing budget compared to what is typical in the space, which would be triple for a standard mobile game.  I sympathize with their reasoning, and I agree that the work should speak for itself, and that good marketing is organic and spreads best via word of mouth.  But it remains to be seen if that will work here.  Not marking this down, but I could see it affecting the adoption at roll out.\n\nBecause the well established team has presented a reasonable budget and a clear, detailed timeline with achievable milestones, I believe they deserve a full 5 stars for Feasibilty.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They are close enough to the end-game here (sorry) that they are including metrics now for user adoption for the game, including NFT sales and game play metrics like resources collected.  While these are great success metrics, I would have liked to have seen the progress metrics that mark this 4 month development sprint.  We can pull several from the milestones list (level design, %complete for locking of final code, etc), but presenting these coherently really solidifies the monthly reporting outlook, and helps with confidence that the project won't get derailed by funding inconsistencies (it is bad enough to hit a stretch of low funding due to not getting funded in a round, definitely don't want to compound that by delaying funding that has already be rewarded).\n\nHowever, this is a team with funding experience in Catalyst that also actively pursues other funding mechanisms to bridge gaps, so I expect that they will manage the process well.\n\nBecause the team is hyper-accessible and phenomenally transparent, and because they have provided a clear vision of success and the metrics to qualify it I believe this proposal has a strong auditability component.  However, due to a lack of progress metrics for what looks like a grueling 4 month sprint to the finish, I have to mark down auditability by one star.  4 stars.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "After creating the Concept & Prototype for Phase 2 we have to develop the Release Candidate.
