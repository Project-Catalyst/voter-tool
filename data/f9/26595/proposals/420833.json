Based on the data provided, the legal cultivation and commercialization of Cannabis are growing rapidly as taboos are removed from the population and more countries are allowing its medical use. Been The United Kingdom accounts for 75% of global production. Tamerlane is a small company that has grown over the years, having grown to serve more than 300 clients in the areas of brokerage, marketplace, and supply chain. An excellent explanation of the current situation is presented, emphasizing the fact that product quality degrades as a result of time, transportation specifications, and storage conditions, as well as the potential of using Cardanon's characteristics to enhance its supply chain. Also, the author provides a good explanation of how this proposal fits within this Catalyst fund, which is led by its partners. This helps the reader understand the holistic solution planned, and how the requests within this proposal fit into that vision. Upon successful implementation of this proposal, I can see how it adds value to the ecosystem and could become a flagship use case for Catalyst. So I strongly agree with this proposal from an impact point of view.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Team members have experience in the key areas needed for this proposal; skills and experience are all described, as well as the necessary links. One of the most positive elements, from my perspective, is the agreement with Jann Muller, who has extensive knowledge of the smart contract structure in Cardano and has been part of the team who build one of the most successful DEXs within the Cardano ecosystem, MuesliSwap. A great deal of attention is also paid to identifying all the professional profiles needed to ensure the success of this proposal. In terms of feasibility, one of the sections of great value is the time and effort put into explaining not only the actions, milestones, and timeline of this proposal. But on a higher level, how the work is distributed and the hours of work are estimated in combination with the rest of the complementary proposals that compete to be selected in this fund. In reading the proposal, one of my biggest concerns in terms of feasibility was the dependency of one proposal on another, and I am glad that the author has addressed this in one of the sections, explaining that each proposal is interdependent. In terms of the requested budget, it seems to me that enough detail is provided to make a full analysis of the rationale for it and I must conclude that it seems appropriate. In fact, this proposal should be taken as an example for all teams that as part of an ambitious or multi-step proposal present several proposals in the same fund, the planning and resource distribution of the proposal should be thought of as a whole and all this information should be presented to the community.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A total of 5 milestones are presented, which are explained in detail, and a clear alignment between them and the actions of the work plan is evident. Each milestone has an estimated completion date. In the explanation of how the success of the project would be, a summary of the milestones is made arguing that success would be the construction of each of these. I wish to add that while this is correct, it is what the community would reasonably expect. The team should, however, also present metrics that provide an indication of the impact they intend to achieve through successful execution of all deliverables. For illustration purposes only, I have provided some examples of expected metrics. \"XX NFTs minted in XX months after launch\", \"XX products sold through the supply chain in XX months after launch\" or \"XX in revenue from this business model after X years\" or something similar. Even though this is a high-level estimate with considerable margin for error, it is important for the community to understand what the strategic objectives of this project are. To conclude, it is worth commenting that although it is explained how the reporting and communication with IOG/ Challenge Teams would be, it would also be interesting if the team could make available to the community the progress made during the implementation of the project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1702, "q0": "The proposal fits well with what seeks the challenge, however the integration between the company's activities and Cardano's blockchain is not so clear. Talking about the problem situation, it is about the cannabis market, which is really a high growth market and that has been gaining good prominence, especially after the pandemic. The proponent argues that legal cannabis is heavily regulated and can be easily counterfeited, so it's an industry that works with consumers' distrust, particularly as cannabis is more vegetable/fruit-like in terms of talk about the quality/integrity of the product, due to the logistical problems currently encountered, the product is often not sold at a fair price, as its quality has deteriorated. While all these issues are being tackled, the cannabis industry continues to grow. The proponent brings several data that argue this, such as being the 5th most valuable crop in America, being a product that has already been legalized for recreational purposes in 18 states of the United States, and 26 states for medicinal purposes - for this, it is also quite used in several countries such as: Argentina, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, etc. It is a plant that is under research, and can be used to help treat serious diseases such as epilepsy and the effects of cancer treatment - so there is no lack of facts to make it interesting for Cardano to invest in this industry, despite the prejudice, the field of use is getting wider and the product is being legalized in more states as time goes on. The bidder also presents his company, Tamerlane, as an \u201cexperienced and well-established leader in a small market. Working in the Aperon group of companies. We have steadily increased our market position in Washington State for the past 7 years. As the regulatory environment slowly accepted cannabis as a legal but controlled substance. More than 300 clients use our brokerage, market and supply chain services. We hired Big Tree to rate 90% of the product we sell.\u201d So now they are looking to invest in a cannibis supply chain service built on Cardano's blockchain, according to the proponent, the data minted in our network would serve for the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of the product's provenance (from seed to sale), with commercialized shipments marked with QR codes, which are linked to On-Chain data. The proponent cites exactly what integrations would be built on, in the excerpt: \u201cThe Cannabis Listing Service is the big tent that unites growers and buyers, meeting in a market environment that provides up-to-date information on different products of ever-changing quality and availability. . BigTree classification system provides confidence, a common language, immutable records and efficiency\nThe Supply Chain service allows product provenance using the International Cannabis and Hemp Standards (ICHS) Certificate of Degree (CoG). Proof of CNFT's Smoke (\u2026)\u201d. Despite this, none of these integrations are so well explained; despite the bidder saying that his business faces challenges similar to those of Cardano, such as \u201cEfficient sizing, Building trust in an environment without trust, Traceability, Transparency\u201d and so on, these points are also not so well explained. We know well what the advantages of working with blockchain would be (\u201cInverts the roadmap about producers being underpaid, undervalued and underrepresented at the retail counter + Provides a transparent and immutable record of product provenance and traceability from seed to sale\u201d + Educates and informs the wholesale bulk buyer in each transaction what is being sold and bought with 100% confidence, etc.\u201d). But it is not explained so well how this would be done, in practice, here in the impact of the proposal. The risks are also not adequately addressed, how could we solve the problems related to Cost overruns / Technological Complications / Key Persons Unavailability / Market Acceptance / Inadequate business experience? In terms of alignment with the challenge, the proposal certainly fits very well, meeting the topics \u201cCardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps, products and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the best alternatives to to current centralized providers. + The more interesting and useful the products and integrations that can be built into the ecosystem, the more reasons people will have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help drive further adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovation.\u201d I just want the doubts mentioned here to be clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The script is explained in a very original way here, however I think that our general view of the levels is not well defined. The first thing we are told are the tasks that must be done, they are well punctuated and we know the approximate duration of each one, as we can see in the excerpt \u201c1. Specification: Describe exactly what the service is supposed to do, how it will be used, and how it interacts with other services -Developer Estimate Time Required Min. 2 days / Max. 7 days; With Coordination (Review and Approve and Rework) Min 5 days / Max 10 days. 2. Writing on-chain code: Building the Plutus smart contracts that govern the creation of tokens, writing of on-chain data, etc. Developer Estimate Time Required Minimum 1 days / Max. 3 days; With Coordination (Review and Approve and Rework) Min 2 days / Max 4 days\u201d. Then the proponent attaches a table in which we can better understand the relationship between the parts, which tasks would last for which days at least and at most. In terms of detailing what will be done, I think the information we have is quite adequate, but we are not informed about how these tasks would be located in time, that is, they would start in which month, and end in which ? What is the estimate in relation to the quarters of the year for this project to be started, developed and completed? I found the way in which the development process was presented to us here very interesting, leaving only this issue of temporality in relation to the periods of the year pending. But in general I believe that this part of the proposal is good, we have a lot of information about what will be done. Speaking of financing, 115 dollars are requested, which is a very high amount, but it is well explained. We know that the amount will be divided into some parts (administrative support, developer, project management, technical management, etc.). We know how much money will be allocated to each of these parts and also the value of the professionals' working day; I found that the amount requested is very high, for example the daily rate for the plutus developer is 1100 dollars, when generally in the other proposals the salary that I see being asked for this position is around 5 thousand dollars a month, so here the value it's really high. The other workers also have their daily rates well explained (\"UI Developer - $500/working day (8 hours), Project Manager - $260/working day (2 hours), Technical Manager - $260/working day (2 hours), Administrative Support - $400/business day (8 hours)\u201d). I think this part of the proposal is very well explained, it is only up to readers and voters to decide whether the requested amounts are adequate compared to the market average. Finally spoken in the team, this part is great. We know in great detail who the members involved in the project are, what their names, resumes, linkedins are, we see that we have people with business and global trade experience, an own developer for Cardano will be hired, people experienced in the Cannabis trade, etc. As we can see from the excerpt: \u201cJhavid Mohseni, over 24 years of business and business experience in global distribution and trade, commodities, supply chain management, cannabis, operations and strategy. As a recurring founder with multiple successful exits, Jhavid is focused on vision, strategy and team, while supporting mission-critical priorities, revenue opportunities and ensuring fiscal accountability (\u2026)\u201d; there is a lot of detail about each involved. In general the feasibility is very good, despite my scores on the script and budget.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Progress will be measured through monthly reports, developed by the project developers, in which they will report on whether the work was done as planned; team members will communicate internally through various suggested communication channels such as discord, telegram and whatssap, where they will share weekly task sprints along with reports. They claim that they will report the progress also by the standard reports to the IOG coordinators, in the Catalyst process itself, at least from what I understand. And so that the community can be aware of the updates, from what I understand the information will be posted on websites, it would be interesting for the proponent to cite which websites would be these and what would be the momentary success, exactly, as it could be considered - the partial results, the project development activities (as in the script we know the minimum and maximum amount of each task, it is simpler to monitor this). In other words, this part of the proposal is good, although we are not so clear about what content would be reported to the community, in what media and with what frequency. The proponent defines success with various pieces of information, for example a \u201cTransparent, reliable and traceable product provenance system for cannabis and hemp material from seed to sale. (Backend feature) + System that empowers consumers/buyers with access to accurate product information and enhances the social enjoyment of the cannabis experience. (QR Code Interface - Buyer Front) + Immutable or Non-Fungible Token that promotes trust at the time of purchase + Search tool to access product provenance data stored on Cardano Blockchain (user resource)\u201d and etc. It would be necessary to have, in addition to these more technical terms and precise data, a more general analysis of the cannabis market, to know how it was benefited through this project, and it would also be interesting to have a notion of how these customers would be becoming members of our community, if they are, etc. The proponent cites much-needed data, which may well safeguard that the KPIs specific to this challenge (\u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d). I think that part is also good, although we could have a better understanding of how this success scenario would be analyzed, how a presentation would be created and how this content would be passed on to our community (via Townhall would be very suitable).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 552, "q0": "This proposal is aligned well with the challenge, as it will create a unique product that will help drive adoption and potentially a large increase in on-chain transactions.

Supporting and building this type of real world applications will further help Cardano stand apart from other crypto projects, and potentially help the Ada price decouple from the cyclical price of BTC.
