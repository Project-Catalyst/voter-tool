The problem statement clearly identifies a widespread problem of theft and counterfeiting of Name-Image-Likeness (NIL) assets in sports and the proposer goes on to provide a dApp linking NFTs with DIDs to establish ownership of NIL assets. It addresses this challenge's goal by bringing an impactful user case and large potential new users and market to Cardano (as the market size for NFT sports is huge in terms of dollars and number of users/fans and the athletes and their fans are poorly served by current Ethereum-based NFT solutions). This proposal also meets two of Fund9's strategic goals: to prepare a group of people (i.e., the athletes and their fans) able to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem, and build real-world solutions based on the Cardano blockchain. The proposal's goals are well aligned with the challenge settings, e.g, driving a high volume of transactions on Cardano. The proposer provides clarity on how they will continue to develop the product beyond this phase. My one suggestion for the team is to include some data or proxy that demonstrates the impactful size of the sports industry they address to help with community buy-in, in particular, those do not keep track of the sports sector.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that this proposal is very feasible.

The proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the implementation steps to take, including scoping, framework, methodologies, and key deliverables. They also provide system architecture and a GANTT chart for the timeline, supporting their commitment and focus on implementing the project. I would have given a rating of 5 with one improvement: a more detailed budget breakdown. The budget is currently allocated by phase (each phase is budgeted in a lump sum).

I find the idea bold (though not entirely new) and with a lot of potential given that they are trying to penetrate a huge market: college sports. That might not mean much for many people outside the US, but trust me when I say this, we are talking about millions of fans willing to support future professional athletes and millions of dollars. The NCAA (US National College Basketball Association \u2013 this is where most future NBA players start) decided to let athletes directly cash in on NILs starting 2021. This is still untapped territory so this is the moment for Cardano community to try to start cashing in. There are specialist voices who see the college sports sponsorship market growing to $1 billion in the next 5 years.\nAnd the way proposers want to enable this is by developing a DApp to establish ownership of NIL assets by linking NFTs with DIDs and they want to do that in the sports world (an obvious choice, since we all know the money that goes into worldwide). So, if successful this will have a benefic impact for the Cardano blockchain, increasing transactions of NFTs and potential users. \nThere are not many other similar solutions out there. There is, of course, OpenDorse, launched in 2012, and look at how successful it has become. And they only work with NILs, not NFTs.\nDepending on how you look at it, this can be a risk (will they really be able to attract athletes and fans?), but also a huge opportunity. I believe that by offering a mechanism to establish digital identity and enable monetization through tracking architecture this presents more of an opportunity worth the risks. \nTo break things down, what the proposers aim to do is to i) have a NIL asset associated with an athlete, ii) create a DID as well as an NFT for that NIL and iii) create a DID method to link the NFT to the DID. And all of this would be integrated with Cardano-compatible crypto wallets.\nSome might wonder why bother to have both NFTs and NILs together, when you can have them separately, as they are now. But why not? Why not take things to the next step? I think the proposers are right in saying that by doing this they can tackle the challenges of identity ownership (linking DIDs to NILs) and enhancing monetization opportunities (via the NFTs as part of the DID document). \nI like the fact that the proposal includes links to other work, it shows the team have done their homework and they have looked into that is already out there. \nIdentity related issues, online privacy, brand abuse, fraudulent domains are well known to all of us, whether we are specialists or not, so this proposal definitely responds to a current issue and I trust that it will bring Cardano benefits if we bring NILs and DID onto the blockchain. It will surely increase users and raise awareness given the market the project is aimed at. Only Ethereum based NFT solutions exist at the moment. \nNo numbers are given in the proposal, but I admit at this stage, that seems an impossible task. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Their project plan is solid and very well thought through. The 4 phases build on each other and the detailed list of actions makes sense, in my opinion. The stages and actions flow logically from one another and the core team definitely has the experience and the tech skills to do it. The fact that they have so much experience in cybersecurity, in addition to blockchain and DIDs is of course a benefit. \nMy only concern regarding the team and their experience, and my bit of constructive feedback, is related to the whether a core team of 4 people really is enough for this project, as I am not sure it is. Unless I failed to see this, there is no mentioning of extra people being brough on at later stages. It is also not very clear if they have existing Dapp development experience and skills and Plutus experience, which represent important aspects of the project implementation and, again, there is no mention of new people. For eg, Phase 3 is all about proof of concept development and involves smart contract design on Plutus, Development of UI/UX Interface and designing the Sports-ISAO website. It is not clear from the bios of the team that they actually have this experience. They do mention seeking to involve more experienced Cardano developers if they get funding, but I would have liked to see more detail on that from the start. It\u2019s risky to start without a full team (or a plan on how to have a full team).  \nI also wished I could see links to people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles or other professional profiles, but the descriptions are detailed enough for anyone to understand the background of the team and that they are no newbies, but quite the opposite!\nThe plan also contains a Gantt chart and very detailed outline of the tasks and their start/end dates. What is not clear (actually, I could not figure out the math, and I don\u2019t think it was me!) is the total duration of the project. There are some bits that don\u2019t add up, for example, they give the duration of Phase one, Scoping and Problem Definition as 78 (they don\u2019t mention it, but logically, it\u2019s hours), but once you start adding up the numbers for each activity you end up with lots more than that \u2013 142. Confusion here is far from ideal, especially since duration and budget are strictly related. Which leads me to a second observation on budget. There is detailed budget for each phase, divided into direct labour and other direct costs, but have they calculated the budget based on the action plan? If so, which is the actual working hours they\u2019ve taken into account? What hourly fee are they working on? How many people will be involved at each stage for each action? I also think it would have been useful to see at least some examples of what falls under \u2018administrative costs\u2019. \nWithout clarity on this, it is harder to evaluate if the budget seems realistic for the task or not. And this is the reason I have not given them a full score. It might seem nit picking, but funding is what this is all about! \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposers have surely done a good job here (minus the issue with the duration I\u2019ve mentioned earlier) in setting out the road map and including the Gantt chart is surely a plus! It makes it easy to track progress and figure out what needs to be done, when. Again, I might seem picking on the small details, but they mention regular progress reviews and regular quality assurance reviews\u2013 what does regular mean? Specifics would have been welcome. It is reassuring to see they will define exit criteria for each phase \u2013 a lot of teams forget to do this, or at least to mention them.
