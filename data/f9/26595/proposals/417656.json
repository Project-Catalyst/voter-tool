If all of it is provided, the voters can easily determine if the requested budget is reasonable or not. The proposal provides some background on Wolfram Blockchain Labs, and the researchers involved in the projects. The proposal also attached an external link on additional info on Wolfram EPC. The link is directed toward a page that explains concise about Wolfram EPC, and there is more info on other members in the projects.

The proposal's goals are to develop a proof-of-concept for starting and managing Cardano nodes inside the Wolfram Cardano EPC, as well as to compile an overview of current Cardano node release engineering procedures and requirements for standardized updates to the Wolfram Cardano EPC in the future. Additionally seeks to investigate smooth failover between private and public Cardano node infrastructure. This will be extremely beneficial to enterprises that want to build Cardano applications but lack the necessary infrastructure. This would be very helpful in onboarding new businesses to Cardano as well as increasing the efficiency of the Cardano ecosystem, all of which would contribute to Cardano's growth. The proposal's success does match the problem statement. Future sustainability will benefit from the creation of a concise report on current Cardano node release engineering practices and specifications on requirements for regular future updates of the Wolfram Cardano EPC. Taking into consideration all of the preceding observations, it can be stated that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Wolfram Blockchain Labs, the proposer, has developed middleware to run numerous nodes in their public cloud infrastructure, and they will collaborate with Wolfram Research (creator of EPC) to develop an appropriate EPC system server. With these details, it is possible to conclude that the proposer with Wolfram Research possesses the necessary skills and experience to successfully implement this proposal. The proposer is knowledgeable enough to determine the kind and number of team members needed to carry out the proposal. It would be difficult to determine whether the budget demanded is justified or not because only a rough budget breakdown has been provided. If a detailed budget breakdown had been offered, that would have also made it easier to assess the proposal's development. Since this is only a proof-of-concept, the proposer will come back for more funding, which makes sense because once it is implemented, more funding will be required for further development. The proposal gives a detailed plan with tasks broken down into manageable phases, each with a deadline for completion. which seems to have a reasonable timeline for the work that needs to be done. All potential resources needed to carry out the proposal have been considered by the proposer. Because there are only a few new technical things to execute on this project, the proposer has considered all possible risks, which are minimal. Based on the observations made above, it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal does include a step-by-step plan divided into phases, each of which includes work that must be completed within a specific time frame.

The number of Companies interested in projects and the number of Cardano projects are two indicators the proposer has provided for assessing the proposal's progress. Catalyst will receive monthly project updates as well as updates following the conclusion of each phase. All of these will be useful for monitoring the proposal's development. The solution offered by the proposer is simple to understand and does an excellent job of resolving the issue. The proposer has specified that the project's completion can be measured using Wolfram Cardano EPC's documentation and marketing materials. Additionally, discussions with EPC use-case candidates and ongoing conversations with EPC consulting clients can be used to assess how well the proposal is working. This proposal is a proof of concept, so no key performance indicators or sustainable development goals are given.

Especially Blockchain technology. This technology is increasingly proving its capabilities through Blockchain applications in enterprises. Therefore, attracting businesses to use the Cardano blockchain needs to be pushed harder. For this proposal, I see that the proponent raised a very important issue and the scale of impact is large. The problem is that \"Business wants to build Cardano apps but doesn't have the infrastructure to start with\".\nThe solution of this proposal solved that problem. By rebuilding a middleware to support running Cardano nodes from within the Enterprise Private Cloud (EPC)- EPC is a middleware created by Wolfram Blockchain Labs (WBL) that allows enterprises to create applications Its application is based on Wolfram technology. However, Wolfram currently does not have a solution that will allow EPC to integrate and manage its own Cardano nodes so this proposal applies for funding to rebuild this middleware. This is a proof of concept. This proposal meets the challenge as it integrates the application which increases the utility and increases the adoption of Cardano.\nThe author stated that there was a risk in doing this project that was a technical problem, but they also outlined solutions to reduce that risk.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author has provided an important roadmap and timeline. The roadmap is divided into 3 specific phases, but I see that this plan is not detailed yet. For better, the author should present specific work at each stage so that readers can easily visualize and easily track progress when the project is done. Especially phase 2 (working phase). If possible, the author should detail the work by week or month to increase feasibility. In addition, if funding is not granted, the project will be deferred until funding is available in the future.\nThe proposed budget represents 2.55% of the total Challenge budget. This amount is divided into 3 parts (team costs, supplies & hardware and marketing costs). However, I find that it has not been analyzed in detail and clearly. At the same time, it does not yet have an explanation and a calculation basis. It is my opinion that the author should allocate the budget of each section in proportion to the expenses outlined in that section. For example, the budget allotted for the group cost is $170,000 including the 4 document costs, programming, system administration and design. How much is each of these expenses and how is it calculated? Calculate the average cost of 1 hour (or 1 month; or package) and the total number of hours (or months) performed.\nInformation about the team has been described fully and in detail (the author has provided a link to the team's information for readers to learn more). They are all members of Wolfram Research's WBL, Open Cloud and Enterprise Private Cloud. The household's capacity and experience are completely consistent with the proposed objective.

However, I have some additions to the project. For the measurement index part, there are 3 indicators which are the number of successful application companies, the number of EPC consulted companies and the number of responses from consulted companies. As for the progress tracking part, the author should have a plan to update new information and the development progress of the project on communication channels such as the Website, Github, Twitter, youtube..v.v. the community will be easier to follow. This increases interaction with the community (the community has feedback to make the project more successful) and increases transparency.\nProject success is determined using Wolfram Cardano EPC products; continue discussions with EPC consulting clients and candidates in the use case of EPC. In my opinion, the author should add a specific KPI about the number of companies successfully applying this project in the short and long term (after 3 months, after 6 months, after 1 year.. etc) is easier to test and more obvious.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2956", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9934, "q0": "Wolfram Enterprise Private Cloud (EPC) is a solution for companies to run operations on their own infrastructure. However, it is not currently possible to run a private Cardano node through this EPC. This proposal is about making it possible. In addition, when there are blockchain based applications running on public cloud infrastructure it is essential being able to seamlessly move these applications to the private infrastructure and other way round as well. So the number of potential applications to use the blockchain integration increases.\n\nMajority of people will get introduced to cryptocurrencies and decentralized infrastructure through applications from the brands they already know and trust. Creating tools for the companies to manage required decentralizing components of their products sets the entry threshold lower and speeds up the construction of blockchain based services. Not every company needs to build all this tooling by themselves and also the connection to other Wolfram technologies is a great advantage. If this infrastructure helps those companies to use blockchain in their service, the number of end-users on Cardano has a potential to grow significantly. This is well aligned with the challenge as well.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has been divided into two phases. The first eight month phase of researching node operations and practical enterprise use cases determines what kinds of solutions are effective to be built and how the final outcome could look like. The second short phase is integration of the nodes and the existing EPC infrastructure. \n\nThe budget breakdown is clear but not very detailed. The research/discovery phase is long so in that sense the high funding request is justified. Maybe some more detailed information about the process could shed light on what type of work this first phase includes. As this is a proof of concept, follow-up funding is required to finish the scalable working product. \n\nAs such I would see this a highly risky research endeavor. However, Wolfram Blockchain Lab is a well recognized player in Cardano ecosystem as well as in the blockchain space in general. They have experience in the technologies required here and are definitely the company to do this. The bios of individual members are available on their websites. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team is going to provide a monthly update to Catalyst of the project state. This makes about ten updates and the final presentation which I find reasonable. In addition, they prepare a report after each of the two phases.

At the same time, the proposal also shows the impact of the project on this targeted audience.\nProposal also raised the content that the project is suitable for the key metrics / KPIs of the challenge, but it is still not really clear. The content should be divided into sections, each phase and state how the project will be in sync with the challenge's set metrics. Proposal should also state what results will be achieved once the project is completed and communicated. There should be more clarity on where the above ideas will directly affect the Cardano ecosystem and whether it can be expanded in the future.\nThe difficulties that the team will encounter when implementing the project is related to the problem of new technology techniques.

That is what needs to be stated so that viewers can assess whether the plan the team has put forward has the potential to achieve the purpose stated in the proposal.\nBudget intends to invest in four categories. However, the spending plan is still unclear, there is no specific estimate. Budgets should be broken down and clearly bulleted for each activity.

They seem to know what should be done for each phase of the project, but explain it pretty uninformatively. In the Discovery Phase, they evaluate the tools to monitor and maintain Cardano nodes, but what exactly will be done is unknown. \"The tools\" is a general term, and they need to be described carefully by the proposers. Monitoring the node is important since they can see how everything is running by monitoring the node\u2019s behavior regularly. Because of its importance, it is necessary to identify the tools that they are planning to use. In addition, they mentioned private cloud blockchain use cases that are being experimented with by Fortune 1000 companies, the name of those use cases are required due to the knowledge getting from the plan is too vague. In Phase III, they tend to have a presentation of proof of concept. They should provide the location/link or a social media page where the presentation will take place. For budget breakdown, since they haven\u2019t had a particular number of requested funds, it is hard to estimate the efficiency of their work. By far, the one missing piece that was required was the staff salaries. They said they will need Maintenance support staff, but whether they have the team needed or they are still recruiting is unexplained.
