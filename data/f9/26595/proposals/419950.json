They have included significant flexibility for the time of each task with a total between 15 and 36 weeks.

Links to Test sites can be made available to Challenge team members, as they are ready. We expect to be active in after town hall breakout meetings (main and Pacific) and swarm sessions where we can discuss progress, solicit ideas and answer community questions. I have given 4/5 stars for auditability because this is slightly vague about exactly what will be reported, where and when.

The problem statement is straightforward, and the proposer points out that the cannabis market is sizable ($80 billion globally) and growing. This use case meets one of Fund9's goals to build a real-world solution on Cardano.  However, I am unsure to what degree this product is a Decentralized App (DApp). The business model looks to me as a centralized solution belonging to the proposer's cannabis group of companies. It was not mentioned in the proposal if the users of this CLP will need to have a Cardano wallet to use the marketplace. It sounds like the Cardano blockchain will function as the backend and the frontend users do not need to onboard to the Cardano system to use it.  It may not be that the information provided is not sufficient to assess its impact on the Cardano ecosystem, and I would recommend the proposer to further elaborate on this front. The risks and mitigation section should be tailored for this specific product (i.e., the risks to implementing a marketplace should not be completely the same as the risks to building a supply chain tracking or grading app).\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other two proposals in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals share a large portion of content]  I agree that this proposal is feasible. The proposer presents in great detail the customer personas, their needs, the user stories, and the acceptance criteria for the system design. Similarly, the proposer plans a detailed timeline and milestones (I like that the minimum and maximum time estimations were given for each workstream. It makes it easier for the project team to keep track during implementation and for the community to verify it along the way). Given that the implementation plan is for all three proposals in Fund9, I would suggest the proposer provide one more level of implementation concerning each individual proposal of the three ones in Fund9. For example, the implementation plan and technical requirements to build this grading app must be different from those to build the marketplace. The budget breakdown is well thought through as well, as it is broken down by components and functions for all three proposals in Fund9 that the proposer has. It gives the community an overall view of the time budget for all three projects, and the specific budget for this proposal. The only concern I have for the budget is the high daily rate across the board. The budget specifies $1100/ 8-hour workday for the Plutus developer, this is on the high end in comparison to other proposals I have assessed. Or Project manager cost $260 per 2-hour workday, equivalent to $130/hour or $22,900 per month; this is a very high salary for a project manager when I compare it to the same role in the traditional tech industry in the US or in the blockchain. I would recommend the proposer revise this part of the budget. The team has experience in the cannabis industry and system architecture, though the Plutus developer is a contractor that may present some uncertainty.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "[My comment here has overlapped content with my comments for the other two proposals in Fund9 from the same proposer since those proposals have similar shortfalls] The project is auditable from the perspective of product completion, but it is not so clear from the perspective of impact to the Cardano ecosystem. The KPIs proposed in the \"How success looks like\" section are all relevant to the product functions. As it has not been made clear how this product would bring a quantifiable positive impact to the Cardano community, I would recommend the proposal to add quantitative KPIs and metrics that are relevant to adoption or transactions on the Cardano blockchain. The roadmap with milestones for each individual proposal of the three ones could also be more elaborated for the community to track alongside the progress, and I suggest using a GANNT chart to do so.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2558", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8621, "q0": "This proposal explicitly identifies the problem and challenges within the Cannabis industry.
