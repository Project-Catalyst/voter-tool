Even many existing holders and traders lack confidence for self-custody.", "f6_no_assessments": 7, "f6_rating": 4.095238095238096, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 12724, "q0": "The Proposal correctly addresses the Challenge Topic of \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" as it aims to attract more users to the Cardano Community and Ecosystem.\nThe stated problem and proposed solutions are clearly presented to the audience.\nI find the proposed solution simple, yet useful in solving the stated problem of high barriers to entry for potential blockchain users. The guide will be posted online, which means that the number of people accessible can be unlimited. The solutions, if carried out successfully, will encourage a lot of new bees to learn about the Cardano Eco-system, join the Cardano Community, and subsequently, become Cardano Users. The project, if effectively implemented, will increase the value of the Cardano Eco-system.\nThe proposed problem can be scaled easily to other languages, as the Proposer has also pointed out. The possibility for the Project to be scaled outside of the Proposer's physical boundary is endless, as it reaches as far as the internet.\nHowever, the Proposer should explain the Proposal in more detail relevant to the project, such as: How many users will the Project be exposed to? How to promote the guide to the right audience? Does the Proposer need help from Cardano Community in populating his guide? It would be helpful for PAs to judge the possible impact of the Project if we are given sufficient information on the Proposal.\nFor all of the above-mentioned reasons, I give this Proposal an average of 4/5 score for Impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The Proposer has specified that there are only a few people needed for this Project, amongst which he will be the most important personnel as the writer of the Guide.\nI find the personnel allocation sufficient, given the Proposer's experience in customer service in Yoroi and his published materials on Cardano Guides.\nThe Timeline and Actions are presented, but not well elaborated. Additional details on how the product can be built, how the chapters are broken into small parts, etc. are needed for the audience to have a better grasp of the Project.\nThe Proposer has both customer service experience and writing experience, which gives him a good background to produce a realistic estimation of the Budget. Being both the Proposer and the Executor of this Project, Leo King will have to be responsible for this proposed budget and successful implementation.\nThe proposed fund should be sufficient for this Project.\nThe Proposer has revealed that this Project will last 3 months. However, he/she failed to disclose whether he/she will be working full-time or part-time on this Project. If he/she works full-time for this project, he/she will very likely be able to finish the Project within the proposed 3 months.\nThe Budget was not at all well-explained with only 1 cost item at USD 3,200 per month. I find the Proposer lacks effort in putting together a well-defined budget with smaller items detailing needed costs for the Project.\nThe Team includes the Proposer as the main Executor and a few freelancers in charge of presenting the product. While the Executor seems to be capable of carrying out the Project, there is no information provided on the potential freelancers that will join the Project. This kind of information would be extremely useful for analysts to judge the feasibility of this Project.\nAll in all, execution risk is high because the action plan and budget items are not specified.\nAs a result, I give the Proposal a 3/5 score for Feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While there is a general timeline, no milestones are provided to track the progress of this Project.\nIn addition, KPI items are not provided. The Proposer has provided some qualitative indicators on how the Project can be considered \"successful\". However, there are no quantitative indicators for Analysts to assess the Feasibility, and subsequently, the Auditability of the Project. KPI items should be provided to convince the Community to trust in the possibility of success of this Project.\nThe Proposer has a good understanding of the Project, and his solutions are well-specified. While his background and experience are relevant to the Project, it would be more convenient for Analysts to assess his capability with proof of his credentials such as his personal LinkedIn Account and links to his published materials.\nGiven the relatively large fund requested, the Proposer lacks a reporting system and possible auditors for the Project. A website is provided as proof of his commitment. However, a more convenient and straightforward means of reporting should be provided to the audience to easily track his progress. \nFor all of the above-mentioned reasons, I give this Proposal a 2/5 score for Auditability.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3470", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3475, "q0": "Proposal starts with a valid problem statement (barries for new comers to start in Cardano) and proposes to solve it in a straightfoward and simplified manner, by creating start guide that be referenced to, in any other project. It fits the challenge as it creates a product (the guide), possibly promoting a more seamless and connected experience between different products, as stated in one challenge kpi. \nProposal also explains well the value proposition and how it be done. The potential content of this guide is available in the feasibility so its possible to check already how it van be leveraged by others.\nAs a suggestion, I'd bring here already how proposer wants to communicate the existence of this guide to the community, once ellaborated. Mention for examples which channels will be used and so on.\n\nIn a summary, I totally agree that this proposal has a good impact on Cardano ecosystem and addresses well the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Starting with the timeline, it is bascially divided into the sequence of content that will be generated every 2 weeks. For this project, it doesnt need something much more complex than that, sepcially if proposer already has this knowledge and wont spend much time on reasearching. However, a final step of commucation could be added, to share the guide in the community and amplify its use.\nBudget breakdown makes sense for the scope of the project. It considers basically the payment for the hours of work from proposer and the host of the site.\nProject team counts with the proposer himself  and possibly a freelancer. By the description provided, he seems to have enough experience on Blockchain, Cardano and writing, which are indeed the necessary background to execute it succesfully. However, a linkedin link or other link that could serve as reference could be provided.\n\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The main proposal for auditability is updates that will be provided whenever a new chapter is finalized so community can track project advance this way. It's a good start but other elements could be included.\nFor instance, it could be measued the number of accesses the guide has, the feedback from the readers, once its ready, number of references made (if possible to be measured). it would be nice also if these metrics could have targets. Proposer could mention as well where this mentioned updates will be communicated.\n\nIn conclusion, its possible to audit the project but extra metrics could be included.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 1, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5495, "q0": "A simple yet intriguing proposal especially in a challenge so broad and intense. The author understands the very basic concern of many newcomers who wouldn't know the basics of Cardano and its projects and tries to address these concerns with a start guide that gives all the necessary information to get started with. This literary work could be used by several applications which are technically emphasized so that all the new users could get a hang of what exactly Cardano is and how they could leverage its capabilities to get various jobs done and what are the available projects that can be used directly. With such a start guide, the community can build a sense of comfort and ease in the new users and developers wanting to build on Cardano. The author intends to cover most of the topics up to governance in the first version and also give a brief about various reputed L2 and Defi apps available. Also give information about stake pools and NFTs, thus giving a rough tour of the entire ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan laid out by the proposer in front of us has covered all areas required to create trust and confidence for the community. The author states his plan of covering the 6 chapters in a span of 2 weeks for each and completing the entire proposal within 3 months' time. And the fund of USD $3200 per month over 3 months will cover all of this as well as guaranteed web hosting for at least 5 years in the future and hope to continue to post that too. The budget request is very small, especially for a challenge with such enormous funding. The breakdown also looks feasible as the author proposes to work on it alone and would roughly end up taking $800 per weak, making it very minimal and practical. The author also introduces himself in an effective way and seems to have worked with many known organizations across the chain and also mentions the need for freelance help to assist with editing and layout work. So that makes the feasibility metrics covered from all aspects. Moreover, the author does not want to stop here and wants to translate this guide to other languages in the future.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For a proposal of such stature, there is not much to track. Despite this, the author provides the community with some trackable metrics. The author assures providing updates as each new chapter is completed every 2 weeks and updating if the proposal is still on track. Qualitative aspects are covered by the sample text that will be released throughout the task to give an idea of the quality of the work. These makeup most of the measurable KPIs. The success metrics of the proposal are mentioned to be the final document that will be available to all, which the applications can integrate into their portals thus making it easier for the users to read it, and understand it in turn driving the Cardano adoption and usability. For a new proposal, this is impressive work and for such small funding, if the community is receiving a universal integrative guide, then it sure is an optimistic venture from the community point of view, and with such a simple tracking mechanism provided by the author, auditing shouldn't be much of a hassle too.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6068, "q0": "In the face of the increasingly strong expansion of the Cardano ecosystem, many new users do not understand all the necessary tools and applications when participating in Dapp and DeFi on the Cardano platform.

This guide is a helpful resource for any project deployed on the Cardano platform.

This Cardano starter guide has a total of 6 chapters, each of which will be completed every two weeks. The author has listed the main content of these six chapters through a work plan. I am generally satisfied with what the project author has presented regarding scope and corresponding budget. $9,600 will cover all the work and guaranteed web hosting for at least five years in the future.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The transparency of this proposal is straightforward. The author said the most significant difficulty when implementing the project is dealing with a large number of documents, structuring and sequencing the content, and providing reasonable explanations for everyone in the community can understand.

Especially for newcomers. This proposal is focused on creating a Cardano start guide for those new members becoming active on the Cardano blockchain. Most people still don't know what crypto terms mean. Such as blockchain or Cardano. This start guide will help address the challenge of lack of education for new users by creating this start guide that will have several sections of educational content. I love reading through proposals that are focused on education of the community. We should expect to see a lot of newer users coming into the space in the next couple of years. By creating this educational content, it will help them get familiar with certain terms and using dApps. I think this can be very valuable to the Cardano community in the future and can have a large impact. For these reasons, I give this section 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It is important that this proposal includes the information of the team. This highlights skills and experience in the Cardano ecosystem. There has been experience with Yoroi customer support and even creating a guide on using Milkomeda. The detailed roadmap is very specific and gives details on all of the things the team plans to accomplish. There are specific dates that promote auditability and feasibility. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that helps illustrate exactly where the requested funds would be allocated if funded. There is a timeframe of completion set for 3 months. This is great because it will allow the community to hold the proposer accountable to these dates. There is a lot of information supporting the idea that this proposal will be implemented successfully. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "When measuring the potential success of a proposal, there are a couple indicators that should be watched. The first being transparency from the team or individual of a proposal. When there is honestly and transparency in this setting, it allows for trust to be built within the community. This will lead to a larger group of people that are looking forward to this proposal being implemented. As for newcomers to the Cardano ecosystem, they would look forward to this Cardano start guide because it would help them get educated quickly and become a strong member of the community. The second important principle is accountability. Once you have these community members that are looking forward to utilizing this proposals product. There will be a direct form of accountability that will help support the proposal to be implemented successfully. Since there is a set timeframe of completion. In this case around 3 months. Those community members would most likely motivate the team to complete the project in a timely manner. I believe that there is always more room for improvement and there is always more people that can learn about this proposal.

The reference links that were included do not refer to the proposer. Adding a LinkedIn profile and other projects would have added more credibility to the proposal.\n\nThe budget is not itemized and all items are lumped together for a combined monthly USD rate. The proposer should take time to list individual items and their costs separately so that project assessors can make judgments on the amounts requested.\n\nThe proposer outlined that he has worked with reputable blockchain projects before. This would be a plus, but the lack of proof provided via reference links and the substandard budgeting makes it less likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

A better roadmap would have had actual dates to make it easier for the community to reconcile with what is posted on the website.\n\nInstead of a website, the proposer could make use of a github repository which could allow for better auditability and at the same time allow members to provide valuable comments and insights.
