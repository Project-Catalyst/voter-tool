It increases the number of products available for the community, which enriches the ecosystem and at the same time tackles a real-world problem of vulnerable stray dogs. The idea is to use the Cardano blockchain to create personalized CNFTs for each dog and allow people to donate to a specific dog or a shelter using ADA or Fiat money. This way not only people will be able to assist these dogs in an easy way but also more people will be introduced to the Cardano environment. As the main goal of the proposal is the development of the platform it aligns with the objectives of the challenge settings as these focus on the ecosystem expansion and creation of new use cases. However, there is not much discussion on scalability on the proposal. As a suggestion they could create a treasury for the organization that would collect a small percentage of the donations and use this at first to invest in marketing to attract more donations and in a later moment use the treasury to pay for operational costs to enable a sustainable position.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team of four is composed of Sabrina, Tian, James and Emerson, and they have relevant skills in marketing, software development, computer science and language support. Also, they are featured in the group website, but sadly, there is not much information there and there are no links to LinkedIn pages or any equivalents in the proposal. The budget is clear and broken down into pertinent and identifiable items. The total amount, however, is a bit overpriced. For an initiative that will survive based on donations and that has not provided potential to scale I don't believe the cost is in line with the value they will create to Cardano. On the other hand, the plan outlined is conductible and the timetable provided realistic. It is divided in three stages, the first one being the frontend development and lasting two months, the second is the backend development and should last three month and the last one is the audit phase and is estimated to last one month. Finally, they also raised three main risks to the project, which are relevant, and discussed mitigating solutions for them. The main one is not obtaining enough donations and if that happens, they will intensify their marketing.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has provided a roadmap with clear milestones and a time horizon for the execution of each step of the plan, which should last six months in total. They also added milestones for after completing the project but these would be more appropriate as KPIs. The metrics they defined are precise and well-thought. Even though they don't say it explicitly they have defined KPIs as amount of donation received, CNFTs created and dogs donated per month, which are good metrics to define success of the plan. Another KPI they could add and that would lean more towards the goals of the campaign would be number of new users onboarded onto Cardano. Finally, the proposer has not provided a public channel to update the interested parties on the plan's progress which hinder its auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8295, "q0": "The proposers address an interesting issue : the welfare and adoption of stray dogs in dog shelters. They highlight the current world economic condition that puts strain on shelters to keep the dogs in their care alive and healthy. The proposers intend ease help these shelters by creating a dApp that allows people to donate directly. By using this dApp, donators can feed, buy supplies and healthcare for a specific dog at a partner shelter. At a certain level of donation, the donator will receive a CNFT as a reward.  Payment can be done via ADA or FIAT. However, the assessor suggests that the dApp should focus on ADA payments as allowing FIAT based payments would limit the fulfilment of the challenge.  \nThe proposers have mentioned several risks : lack of donors, donation imbalance to a certain dog, and capability of a given shelter to provide to the dog as the donator wishes. The proposers seem well aware of these issues and have established suitable measures to mitigate them. \nWhat attracts the assessor to this project is the direct interaction that donators will have with the dogs via the dApp and see how the dog develops and grows. Whatis even more interesting is that the framework for the dApp has a large potential to be adopted for other uses such as preservation of historical landmarks, support of orphans or disadvantaged groups, etc. This will definitely raise awareness and adoption of the Cardano ecosystem and help make the world a better place.  \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposers have set a timeline of six months which seems realistic enough to setup an application and establish collaborations with several dog shelters.  While the milestones for the development of the dApp are defined, the milestones in interacting and supporting the shelters are not mentioned. \nThe proposers should have established milestones in regards to shelters. However, from the link mentioned it would seem that the proposers already some degree of collaboration. Six months should be sufficient to establish new collaborations with shelters, therefore the assessor does not find the lack of description regarding shelter collaboration milestones to be a significant deficiency in the proposal. Even so, this should be addressed by the proposers with urgency. \nA budget breakdown along with a list of team members has been submitted.  While, the tasks are defined, linkage between the personnel involved with the tasks in the budget breakdown are not clarified. It would be much better if the tasks in the budget breakdown mentioned the team member in charge for the given task. \nIt should be noted that the proposers did not provide a detailed profile (e.g. Linkedin profile) for the staff involved thus the data available to the assessor to judge competence and experience of the personnel was limited. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers have defined completion of the project based on the completion of the dApp according to the milestone objections and by measurement of defined quantities, specifically the number of feeds and personalized CNFTs within a given timeframe. Meanwhile, measurement of the completion of the dApp was done qualitatively based on the features and framework/structure of the platform completed. In regards to the function and purpose of the dApp, this is sufficient. \nHowever, in regards to the interaction with shelters, progress metrics are somewhat lacking. The proposers mention the contacting of shelters, collection of dog photos and CNFT design. However, these specific activities were not mentioned in the feasibility section of the proposal. While these activities can be done in the time specified, the proposers should have made a detailed plan along with metrics to measure progress (number of shelters on board, number of dogs on the roster, types of snacks/toys, number and types of healthcare items available, etc).  \n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2973", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8701, "q0": "Exploiting the emotional factor to attract potential users will be the main focus of the development of this project, I believe that if the project has the right marketing strategy about the meanings that the project brings, influence the emotions of the audience, it will be able to attract a large number of users to actively participate.

I believe that everyone who loves animals will be excited and welcome this project. The author has given clear descriptions of how the platform works including how to donate and tracking how donations will be disbursed by using the platform's interactive mode.

If there is a mistake here, you can check and adjust it accordingly to increase the auditability of the project.

It is easy to understand the idea, but I have a recommendation that the proposal should include the technical information or the proposal has an example with a case study, which helps the proposal be clearer. The explanation on how the solution will address the challenge is apparent that the platform allows donors to buy food, medicine, and sponsor medical expenses, and the total number of users and transactions made will be used to determine the success metric of the platform.

I highly recommend the proposal should combine that information in a data system, so that the readers can easily understand and get the idea of the proposal.

This will help many shelters that are having a hard time maintaining and not having to make heartbreaking decisions like putting them to sleep to make room for other dogs. I also like how the proposer handles anticipated risks. For example, in order to ensure that all dogs are supported rather than just one adorable one, the platform will notify users and suggest they feed or help another dog. This not only gives more dogs a better chance at life but also creates a loving Cardano community.
