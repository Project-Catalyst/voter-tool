It would make dApps development a lot easier because now developers have HTTP endpoints for Cardano transactions provided in Golang without having to understand the underlying Haskell protocol implementation. As a Golang developer, I believe that supporting Golang would add value to the Cardano ecosystem as the language is becoming increasingly popular in the industry. Overall I strongly agree with the idea the proposer brought. Anyone interested in learning more about the proposal could listen to the podcast in the links section. It helps to understand what the proposer is trying to solve.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I firmly believe the proposer could develop the proposed Golang implementation smoothly. Based on their profiles, they have worked with open source projects for more than ten years and have written many of them in various programming languages. Therefore I am assured of the code quality they would produce, which isn\u2019t a problem, too, since the proposer has already put dedicated resources for code review. The budget requested is 5000USD, 40% of which would be used for upcoming development tasks and the other 60% to cover the existing work they have provided. The timeline is realistic; the proposer speculated another 20 engineering hours. However, there isn\u2019t any specific deadline or time divisions for those hours; would those 20 hours be spread over two weeks? Three weeks? It is not clear. That being said, their implementation plan is already laid out thoroughly in the Kanban board. Furthermore, I applaud the proposer initiatives to tackle the risks by planning to do code testing and battle testing of the service on testnet & mainnet. Therefore I strongly agree with the feasibility of this proposal primarily based on the proposer's experience, the plan provided, and the amount of work they have put up already.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success of the proposer\u2019s proposal is evident; in the release of stable v1.0 of their service. To keep track of the service development, the proposer used a Kanban board to see tasks being planned, in progress and done. It seems like they are indeed progressing at a decent rate already. The proposer has listed what they want to achieve with their two milestones. However, the time horizon for those milestones isn\u2019t divided yet; the proposer only used the required engineering hours. I suggest the proposer set a deadline date or week for those milestones. If the deadline date or week is hard to estimate, the proposer could also add a time buffer. Whichever it is, by setting up the deadline, we could at least estimate when the service will be available. That being said, I agree with the auditability of this proposal, the saving point being the existence of that Kanban board, which we could use to track their progress.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2878", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 3, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "It's a fair point on the milestone dates.

At the beginning of the proposal, you stated the problem and explained your solution. Then you show us how this project addresses the challenge. The information provided is easy to understand. Through that, I realized the impact this solution has on users and on our ecosystem. This is a project that will bring a lot of value to the developers and Cardano. Besides, the risks of the project have also been calculated. It's great that you've also provided measures to mitigate these risks. Overall, this part is very well done so I feel completely satisfied.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the plan you provided, I can see the project going through 2 major milestones. In each milestone, specific tasks were also mentioned. I am delighted that the first milestone has been completed. However, I have a few suggestions for your proposal. Firstly, your roadmap has not mentioned project timing. At the top of the detailed budget section, you only mention the engineering hours to complete the milestones. So, I think you need to add a timeline to the whole project. For example, what date does the project start? With such engineering hours, how many days/months/years will it correspond to? The second is about your detailed budget, you just provide the hours worked and the amount to fund. You should specify in detail what the money is used for. For example, if it is to pay an employee, it should also state that it is paying an employee. Thirdly, about your team, I saw you give a brief introduction and mention the names of 3 core members with the link. However, it will be better if you introduce their biography, experience,... right on the proposal. Indeed, your suggestion is not bad, but it is missing a few pieces of information. I will rate this presentation 3* because I still see the project as viable anyway.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Through your presentation, the project can be tracked through GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects Kanban board. Weekly meetings will also take place for status updates. I also saw the link you attached. However, you have not stated what metrics the project will be measured by on the proposal. Metrics and KPIs both makes the project auditable and increases the persuasiveness of the project. The success of the project is also described. It would be better if you introduce more about the benefits that the developers as well as the community get if this project is successful.

The proposer is able to identify the reason behind preference for Haskell (requiring a lower level of implementation) and the motivation for higher level applications in other languages (diversity for Cardano ecosystem, decentralized security). The target language that the proposer wants to attract is Golang. This is done by writing project structure and layout in a way that is familiar to Golang users (with the aid of other Golang-friendly implementations: Bitrue, Ourboros, CloudStruct). The reason behind this choice of target market is well demonstrated by the proposer with specific figures to support the popularity of the Goland community (via Github repository). With this scenario in mind, the Golang community promises to be a great resource for the Cardano community. The implementation will be created upon existing services and create more scope for complex transactions such as DeFi. Alternative entities used to support the implementation are FreeBSD and ARM. If possible, the proposer could brief about the advantages of using FreeBSD and ARM and their impact on this proposal for better assessment. The main risks include robustness in error handling and incompatibility, which is sufficiently mitigated by in-service additional validation before submission to Cardano node and battle testing, partnerships and replacement of service). Overall, the proposal is well-presented and aligns with the problem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is already an initial project released as a foundation of the roadmap. The steps are explained in a clear way and divided into milestones. The emphasis is placed on milestone 2 where the main functions (error handling, validation and testing) take place. However, for more feasibility and management, the proposer should provide a specific timeline/span of time which each milestone lasts for (ex: milestone 1: 3 months or Q3/2022,..). This will help keep track of the productivity of the plan. The budget breakdown includes funds for both milestone 1 (30 engineering hours - which has already completed) and milestone 2 (estimated 20 engineering hours). However, there should be a detailed explanation for the cost of 100usd/hour (what resources it takes: programs/hardwares/brainwork/\u2026) and the compensation fee for the prior work in milestone 1. This is very crucial in determining the feasibility of the proposal. The generalization of the expense for two milestones and compensation fee is hindering transparency/feasibility and needs to be addressed. Milestone 1 has deliverables which ensures the validity of the proposal and the feasibility to fulfill the proposal. The team members are from Cloudstruct engineering team with each team member is presented with reference via Github. Their experience is relevant to the blockchain technology and Cardano community. Involvement with the Golang language and connection with the Golang community should be highlighted for more relevance. Each member is assigned with specific roles. Further funding will be required for other additional projects - the proposer could specify what aspects that these projects entail (development/marketing/validation/\u2026) for voters to assess the progress of this proposal in connection to those in the future.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer is able to provide tools for audit (Github issues and GitHub Projects Kanban board). There will be weekly meetings among the engineers for status updates. The proposer should clarify whether the results from these updates are open to external audit which is necessary for auditablilty. The current vision for success is releasing a stable version after completing milestone 2. This metric is relatively difficult to measure for audit, therefore requiring more elaboration on what is defined as \u201cstable version\u201d (beta testing and feedback/survey/\u2026)", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4055", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We will include time estimates for the milestones in our future proposals.

The information about the proposal is transparent and adequate. The project focuses on the Golang community. Its mission is to build a Golang Cardano transaction submit API service alternative implementation. This implementation will utilize common Golang project structure and layout and will be written in a way which is familiar to Golang developers while introducing the developer to Cardano. The proposal has written about the rationale, which shows how important it is to conduct this project. The Golang developer community is large, approximately 4x the size of the Haskell developer community, based on the number of Github repos with code for each. The project bridges the gap between Golang developers and the Cardano blockchain and attracts more developers to Cardano, which increases the adoption of more users and developers to the cardano ecosystem. The challenges that the project can deal with are listed with 2 items: robustness in the error handling around the various conditions outside the happy path and changes in the underlying transaction format introducing incompatibility with the payload decoding, coming in Vasil or future hard fork combinator events. The solutions to mitigate these problems are given suitably and fully.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has a plan with 2 milestones. The first one is the creation of a minimally viable product, which works under test conditions. In this step, the proposal has an illustration with different activities. In the second stage, the project comes to the main period of finishing the product with many particular activities. However, the timeline should be added for each milestone, so that the assessor of the community can understand how long the project will last, in which time the activities are completed. This will hook the voters' vote for the team. About the budget breakdown, the spending is calculated in engineering hours with the total budget of $5000. About the human resource to build the project, the CloudStruct engineering team is a bright point of the proposal. The team includes Principal / Staff Engineers, with more than 60 years combined experience. The team has had time working together before and they have long-time experience. From this, I believe that the team would make the proposal successful.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has GitHub Issues and a GitHub Projects Kanban board for the community to follow and assess the effectiveness of the project. From the Kanban board, I can see the team;s updates of the status of each activity, which one was done, which one is in process or which one is going to be conducted. It is quite clear but it will be better for the team to add information about KPIs or measurements, which makes the process results more specific and easy for the community to evaluate. The proposal shows that success for the project for the funding period would include release of a stable 1.0 version after completion of Milestone 2, support for Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOS, and at least ARM64 and AMD64 architectures. Here are the results of the completion of the project. And I find this aligned to the plan which has been mentioned in the previous section. Finally, the team should give information to answer whether this proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project in Catalyst or an entirely new one.
