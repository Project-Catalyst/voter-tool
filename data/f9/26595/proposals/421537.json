A question that might arise is that crypto is very volatile in its nature and has a potential for +/-90% swings in a short span of time. Why would crypto be a preferred solution over a slowly deprecating currency (Aeros miles points)? The miles points are at least predictable in their nature.\nIt would be suggested to address this in the proposal - how would you on-board customers from a deprecating scheme to a very volatile scheme instead? (This is not an argument against crypto, but it is important to know how you would sell the proposed idea to the users).\nFurthermore, it is mentioned that there will be extensive data collection (or already exists). Is this also true for European users? Are you compliant with GDPR today? No points are deducted as a result of GDPR aspects, but it would be interesting to hear about compliance and/or potential issues.\n\n\nThe proposal is well aligned with the \u201cDapp\u2026\u201d challenge setting and all things considered, it is impactful to an extent. The project could absolutely gain traction if it is implemented, marketed and adopted. The main question is how the proposers will market and on-board users so that it has a significant impact.

The plan is divided into sprints which lists major milestones within that also acts like a great alternative to track progress.\nThe listed hourly wages are reasonable for the positions, and it matches with their claimed budget.

However, for an easier auditing process for the community to evaluate the project after its live, it would be great to have real and measurable metrics to compare.

This section of the proposal gives voters a very strong start with demonstrable proof that this team is committed to producing something to address the given problem statement. As much as I love the quantified nature of the problem statement, I do think there\u2019s room for this proposal to further define that quantifiability by translating data to USD to give a clearer sense of how big the problem is AND how much money could come into the Cardano ecosystem because of this proposal. I also wince a little bit at the first sentence that states \u201cAeros is the first universal \u2018currency\u2019 issued and owned by airports.\u201d This statement might appear a little antithetical to decentralization but it is a rather fair model because airlines are the ones that are supplying the goods and services, so it makes sense that they own the controlling rights to the medium of exchange. On this point about decentralization and the use of blockchain, I would also like to be given more assurance about protection of privacy to contrast a lot of the rhetoric about collecting information about passengers. Furthermore, I think there\u2019s an opportunity here to lean into the potential impacts of this platform by theorizing connections to credit card companies that offer travel rewards, international utility on a global scale, and MASSIVE Cardano adoption potential. These are kinks that I expect to be worked out and addressed along the way but they are seem to be at a rather impressive place for a project that is rather newer in their development. I think the proposers have a very creative solution for a very real problem within a trillion-dollar industry, which is why I rank so positively. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Between the impressively comprehensive skill set of the core development team and the surprisingly efficient spending, I rank this section a 5. The project director has direct experience (and established relationships) working with some of the biggest airlines on the planet to create loyalty programs, which scores major points for the positioning of this proposal. Beyond that, this team has large-scale experience working with multiple fortune 500 companies to create top of the line digital products. If voters are evaluating the feasibility of this proposal through the lens of the capabilities of the core team members, I think the outcome is overwhelmingly obvious to the positive side. On the roadmap, the only thing I love more than the outrageously fast process of producing a demoable product is the detail in the roadmap that shows different aspects of the proposal beyond just development tasks. In this roadmap we get company culture actions, advertising campaigns, partnership acquisition and tokenomics panning, which is a nice level of detail that we don\u2019t get a lot from many Catalyst proposals. Though what\u2019s most impressive about this proposal is the insane level of efficiency in the budget, especially for the high-level experience that we get out of it. The $3000/mo compensation for full-time hours comes out to $17.30, which is criminally low (I mean that positively). I\u2019m inclined to assume that a project of this scope is likely getting some funding from investors/partners in other areas outside of Catalyst funding (which would be a VERY good sign of success), so I am under the impression that this proposal is more supplemental. I vote yes. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For a very organized and well compartmentalized KPI outline, I rank this section a 5. I appreciate the breakdown of KPIs into different aspects of the project because it gives me a sense of all of the different modules being measured for performance AND it tells voters that this proposal has 4 separate categories for success that must all perform at a minimum standard. This is a unique auditibility format that I might like to see implemented in other Catalyst proposals, I\u2019m a fan. I also appreciate the quantification throughout this section, specifically the aim to integrate at least 5 loyalty programs in the first draft of this project. For where this project is in its development, I don\u2019t expect to see further quantifiability in different areas of usage. Still, I don\u2019t think it could hurt to stretch existing KPIs across multiple timeframes to show the anticipated progressive performance AND point out additional metrics like usage data, traded volume, and other stats that might point to solvency on the problem statement. I would expect to see these stats on future proposals but for this one I am very enthusiastic. This proposal is very well aligned with Catalysts mission to pursue the highest levels of community innovation, so my reaction is positive.

Even though we did get mostly fives from other PAs, this assessor really understood what we are trying to do and how we could increase the value of Cardano and ADA through a real case. This PA paid a lot of attention to the description of the proposal and how all the different pieces interact.\nThere are many interesting comments like the one related to credit cards that we did not explain but are on the roadmap.

Or there are also lateral rewards which can be exchanged with other services or products. These are non-core activities for airlines and there is a trend to outsource them leading to a dilution in loyalty due to convergence in reward structure among airlines. In other words, there is no major benefit in being loyal to a septic airline since all airlines give the same or similar rewards. There are ways to overcome them by reward inflation with repeated travel etcetera in this aspect the Aeros token has a great business appeal, providing great flexibility for users and the airlines. With smart contracts and crypto tokens, there is a chance to unlock great business values. In this respect, the proposal is in alignment with the challenge. The success of the proposal can bring huge value to Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is from a team of at least eight people with excellent professional backgrounds. The idea for using Cardano native assets as Airmiles may not be unique and there is sufficient literature and knowledge in the ecosystem to use the native assets for a loyalty program. The technical similarity is likely to help the project implementation. The current status of the company is shown as the pre-seed funding stage and any information regarding the same in the proposal would have added value. However given the scale of work involved in onboarding airlines to the crypto-backed loyalty programmes, there are risks. The team\u2019s contact with airlines or the state of talks with them or any information on the interest shown by Airlines in the proposal would have added great confidence to the proposal.

The cost also includes hosting charges in AWS. The total comes to about 70K USD. The project is expected to be completed in five months and the proposal includes a fairly detailed road map. There is a need to estimate the scope of the project in terms of shops/services that will come on board and more importantly airlines that will use the aeros coin.

It's about converting air miles into Ada via a token called Eros, it's argued as miles are the world's largest digital currencies, with around 500 billion units being issued each year.
