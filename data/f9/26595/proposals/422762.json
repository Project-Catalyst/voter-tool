The fundamentals that are most directly addressed are the creation of projects such as \u201cGames - Open world games, card games, RPG, etc\u201d, and also \u201cWhat dapps, products and integrations can be implemented to bring impactful use cases to the Cardano ecosystem that help drive more adoption?\u201d. The problem that is raised concerns how most blockchain games require players to be already experienced in relation to this technology, and also the games are usually fighting, cards and so on. The proponent agrees that this type of game is very interesting but that we should expand the performance of Cardano's games a little, and with that the idea is to create a game of the virtual animals style, being more advanced. It is intended, in the words of the proponent, \u201cto create a highly relatable AR pet entertainment experience geared towards mass market adoption. Build the experience on top of Cardano, powered by NFTs and a backend dapp, based on smart contracts.\u201d It is necessary to make it clear to the general public that everyone can understand and have fun with blockchain technologies. The concept of this game reminded me of another project that is also submitted for funding in this fund, Flooftopia, which also deals with characters (pets, NPCs) that are NFTs. The concepts are similar since, when starting the game, the NFTs would be basic and from the moment a digital wallet is attached to the player's account, he can start to buy props and customize his NFTs. It is very positive how the proponent explains what the gameplay would be like (\u201cthe free version will have a virtual pet with some basic features to choose from. All the basic features will also be available for free\u201d); the idea is for it to be a game well focused on virtual reality, and the entire world creation process would be done through four well-defined steps: \u201ccompleting and adapting world construction and character development - writing and conceptual art, prototyping of game mechanics, first phase of development (both blockchain and game development) and tokenomics and NFT distribution models\u201d. Another positive aspect of the impact of this proposal is that the game already has a certain popularity, so the chances of the project succeeding in attracting new active members to our blockchain are quite high. I believe so, everything we are looking for in the challenge will be covered: greater community engagement, with new people becoming active Cardano members out of interest in the game and not necessarily in blockchain, more active tokens will be minted on our network and the number of contracts smarts and transactions in Ada will grow. My only comment is: I wish it had been clearer how the team will go about attracting the attention of the public outside the crypto bubble, those who don't know what blockchain technology is, how they will learn the basic concepts (such as creating a wallet digital, etc.). Apart from that doubt, I think that the dApp can bring a very considerable positive impact to our ecosystem, deserving top marks in this topic.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is very viable. Regarding the whole topic, I believe that I also only have one observation to make, as I will comment throughout my analysis. Starting with the explanation of the script development, the proponents give us a lot of detail about what will be done. In addition to the activities that are yet to come, they give us a good idea of \u200b\u200bwhat has been done so far, for example in the excerpt \u201cSeptember 2009 - December 2010: Initial concepts, world construction, character development, concept art and a script for what would be a full-fledged adventure game (project is shelved due to financial constraints). In addition to knowing what activities have already been developed, we are also informed of various deliveries that have already been made (\u201da clear user-oriented tokennomics model is developed, character concept art is produced, 3D character models are created\u201d and etc). We know that the game has been thought and conceptualized for a long time, and we have a very rich and extensive collection of information about what will be done, how, when, by whom, why and so on. In addition to describing what they are doing and what resources are already available, they provide us with a series of links where we can see in practice what has been developed, as in the case of the\u201d coinage of half of the Trybbles Special Reveal Edition (SRE) community. that was/is/and will be distributed to the Trybbles community through giveaways, contests and other special events. A record of its distribution, including links to Cardano transactions, is maintained here [link attached].\u201d So, about the proposal development process itself, I don't have many comments to make because I think that part is already very adequate. Regarding the division of funding, I found the amount requested quite high for a project time of 3 months (which from what I understood would be this time, also adding the other proposals that were launched regarding the game). The explanations regarding the budget are good but not at the level of detail of the script, because the proponent does is to divide the whole into some parts, for example the payment of the art director, the animator, the game director, writer and so on. The amount charged for each hour of work is quite compatible with the market, but due to the fact that the script is very rich and extensive, it would be interesting if a small bridge was drawn between the work that each professional would do with the development parts ( for example, professional \u201cX\u201d would be doing activities \u201cY\u201d and \u201cZ\u201d). About the team's presentation, the comment I mentioned I would like to make goes here: even though we know that the project would be fully developed by the New Mindflow team, we have not defined all the professionals involved. The proponent proponent states what would be the skills needed to implement the project successfully, giving us an idea of \u200b\u200bthe professionals that would have to be hired. However, in relation to those that are already defined, it is positive how they inform us in detail how they are involved with Cardano, conveying confidence that they are prepared to successfully execute this project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As with the previous topics, the auditability is very good. Once again we have a lot of information about what will be done in this part of the proposal. Starting with the KPIs, we have many, such as the number of approved concept art pieces produced, approved 3D models produced, final game assets generated, Github commits\u2026 that they would be having after the launch of the prototype; we know when the AR experience MVP has to be released (Q4 2023); we also know that the current project is divided into parts, what each part would be (what is not lacking in this proposal is details on the development of the project itself). And all this information will be gathered and sent in the Catalyst monthly report, in the case of the Cardano community a website is attached where the game team intends to post monthly updates to keep the Cardano community informed, which includes visual materials about the development of the project. I believe that the only observation about the auditability of the process would be: will they inform us both about the professionals' work routine and the partial results obtained? I believe so, but it would be important to be sure. Thinking about final results, we have defined the success scenarios for 3 months (\"the first part of the team is assembled. In this first hiring phase, we will seek to recruit highly qualified individuals for the development of the art and the community), 6 months (\"the world construction and a prototype game mechanics are finalized, a vertical slice of the experience is almost complete\u201c etc) and 12 months (\u201can MVP is created for the AR app and displayed to the community, producing the MVP allows us to test properly the product, both from a technical and mechanical point of view\u201d and so on). So the only question about this part would be how the scenario would be perceived and presented to our community, even if we don't have a completely finished game yet, it would be very important for the team to do some research and a general gathering of information to understand how the scenario really works. presented after some time of releasing parts of the game, how this was accepted by the public and what the visible results would already be for Cardano. All this could be summarized in a final presentation with visual content (I find this approach interesting, as it is lighter and more educational), which could be posted, for example, on the website they attach and also in the communication channels with our community (or just on the website, there would be no problem as long as this was properly publicized). For these reasons, one more topic in the proposal is very suitable and deserves top marks, even if some small adjustments can be made to further improve the level of our follow-up.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8216, "q0": "The team has described the proposed solution in a clear manner, allowing the community to understand the project. The project is broken down into 4 pillars (prototyping, tokennomics, world building - art and assets, development) and this proposal focuses on world building. They plan to build a free and available AR app, however, the users who connect their Trybbles NFT will experience new functionalities and more skin options. By implementing AR experience into the game, they can offer more than breeding and fighting pets in some current blockchain games. The scope of the project is once again explained, ensuring transparency during the operation process. Trybbles also proves its huge potential to develop through the current community engagement on Twitter& Discord and the number of NFTs minted. The team has plans to approach their target audience and the future team effectively and I believe these approaches will help them get the expected results. Ultimately, the proposed solution is well aligned with the challenge through efforts to drive more adoption and bring new use cases of Cardano Blockchain technology. The main risk regarding hiring the right members is tackled. Although there is a delay possibility, this risk doesn\u2019t have a serious impact on the project\u2019s success. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The timeline and key deliverables are well provided in the proposal. The stage in this proposal will be implemented from Q4 2022 to Q3 2023 with specific desired outcomes.

The deliverables for Fund 9 and the previous funds proposal are also presented. This detailed plan will significantly support the community in following and tracking the progress of the project. \nAccording to the delivery plan, the costs have been allocated. I believe these are reasonable numbers, given the compensation of the project\u2019s personnel and other expenses. However the \u201cother expenses\u201d seems a bit vague to me. For example, how can the team define \u201clegal: $750/month\u201d? (what tasks are involved? Why the cost is $750/month? Does the team hire a lawyer or someone else?). The same breakdown can be done for the recruitment costs to ensure transparency and reasonability of spending. \nThe information on the team is good and adequate. The team is reliable and experienced, given all the events and projects done in the past. Additionally, this is a continuation of the previous proposals, I think they are fully capable of running the project efficiently. \n\"", "q1r": 5, "q2": " The reporting methods are very clear and well-updated, making the auditing process easier. The team will keep the community updated about each deliverable through a monthly reporting form.

Additionally, there will be an auditing portal for the community provided in the form of a website so the tracking process will be consistent. The KPIs are specific and good to indicate the development of the project, they are also well in sync with the delivery plan and objectives of the project. The goals for success are well set in 3 phases (3 months, 6 months and 12 months), which allows the team to focus on the right path and detect any derivatives that might happen.

Gaming is a growing industry right now. especially the game with a plot like in the project will be extremely attractive to gamers of all ages. The team gave an extremely detailed solution and added an in-depth explanation of the technical side. The team has done a lot of preparation and research, has completed most of the storyline, and writing the extended script to make it a quality adventure game. that has partly shown the determination of the team in the project. I believe the project will bring many achievements to the team and the whole Cardano ecosystem", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Proposal has a specific roadmap for each quarter of the future years, besides there is also a roadmap of group activities done in the past. It can be seen that the project has been carefully prepared since September 2009, so far it has been 13 years. The members must have put a lot of effort into the project. The expenses are also very specific, detailed and transparent. The members are evenly distributed across sectors and they are the ones who have been exposed to all aspects of the NFT ecosystem on Cardano.

Here they are called Trybbles, and they represent a classic \"Tamagotchi\" game mechanic, upgraded with and for DLT.\n\nThis proposal focuses on the ideation, generation, and integration of the in-game assets required to eventually build an MVP of the game, things like concept art, environments, maps and levels, 3d renders and textures.  In addition, it also includes the formalizing of the game mechanics themselves, character and plot writing and designing animation for the end results of all these asset chains.\n\nOnce completed, this proposal will deliver a collection of artifacts for customizing a gameworld.  Unlike the team's development proposal, which described a self contained Cardano based game build with NFT functionality via smartcontracts and ready sockets for integration of custom assets and tokenomics, this proposal unfortunately describes a set of deliverables that won't have any direct impact on Cardano.  This will be covered more under Feasibility, but the issue is that if other proposals aren't funded, there is risk that what is created here may not be able to be implemented.  Would it greatly improve the other proposals if they are funded?  Absolutely.  But it is hard to ignore that \"if\".\n\nBecause the concepts of the underlying game are capable of onboarding possibly millions of users, and the team has presented a coherent vision of how to achieve it, I believe this proposal has the potential for impact.  However, because its deliverables are not directly impactful, and instead are dependent on the success of other proposals, I find that I can neither agree nor disagree with the idea that this specific proposal will have an impactful outcome. 3 Stars for Impact.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Despite the second-hand connection to the challenge setting, this proposal does an excellent job of mapping out both the broad vision of the game, including over a decade of history behind its ideation, and the specifics of this proposal's role in realizing that vision.  This is really the nitty gritty work of creating the user experience in the game, and it is unfortunate, if understandable, that it has been separated from the user-interface (the development proposal) to be submitted to Catalyst.\n\nThey describe the relevant deliverables on the timeline, including all the standard game development artifacts.  They also do a good job of describing the skills they will be recruiting for.  One thing that needs to be understood is that this is not a game-development company, but rather a bootstrapped MVP trying to bring a unique evolution of the gamespace forward to grab marketshare, and then iterate and develop in a more community oriented way.  \n\nTo that end, we have here a core team of project managers and ideators who are ready to start the collaborative process of building out a dream project and making it real.  The included team descriptions and experience reads well, especially when it comes to the organizational capacity of the members, and their familiarity with the technology and standards behind NFT, and particularly CNFT.  However it does look like there is a shortcoming in their description of the architecture and workflow of the creation of these game assets, especially if you compare it to their descriptions of the tokenomics and game development proposals.  It should be noted that they have included a well-compensated role, \"Art Designer\" which typically would be the lead for all the different asset creators, from scripts to 3d models.  I expect that this role here will be the one making the architecture decisions about what programs and repos they use, and things like the Unreal and FxPak-type integrations they will need to design for. (This also points towards the issue of interdependence of proposals, as the development proposal has the game engine developers, but their input would be useful here.  Very challenging proposition, project-wise.)\n\nBecause the budget, timeline and milestones have been presented in an understandable, reasonable light, and because the team has an excellent history with this and other products, I believe their is a solid foundation for Feasibility.  However, due to the need to lean hard into the knowledge of an early hire to supplement the needs of the existing project management framework, and due to dependencies between this proposal and others in this project, I am reducing the score by one star.  4 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The list of KPIs presented includes KPIs that are related to all three proposals (another indicator about the difficulty of separating this project into modules like this...contextual understanding is always at risk), but they have helpfully highlighted the relevant KPIs for this proposal, and they are straightforward measures of the development of the deliverables, very similar to software development.  (Note for the proposer, you could express the assets as a subset of an expected total, giving you a %complete metric to report similar to a sprint burndown.)\n\nThey also highlight their website, and their intention to dedicate a section of it purely to these Fund 9 proposals (they are already tracking earlier successful proposals there), which is a fantastic way to provide transparency.  I'll also mention their community presence in Catalyst, where I have found them to be thoughtful, engaged contributors across the NFT space, Catalyst governance and gaming.\n\nBecause the team is transparent and accessible, and because they have provided an excellent framework for auditing their efforts, I believe they have satisfied the basic criteria of auditability.
