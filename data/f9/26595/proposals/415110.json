Similarly, the sector lacks transparency over the impact it has.", "f6_no_assessments": 8, "f6_rating": 3.208333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 587, "q0": "This day, the existence of NGOs is proving to be a necessary condition in the development of a state, country, or community in a worldwide assembly. However, most NGOs struggle with data collection (budget, time, and power) and transparency about its impacts. Stemming from the state of implementation that the topic group was given the idea to build Havuta tool, Havuta provides a Blockchain-based mobile application to help NGOs reduce the value of data impact costs decimal for the program they run; provides data for NGOs and transparent calculations for donors. The proposal matches the requirements and criteria of the Challenge: provide the product and integration for use by the community, it will become a better choice than the current vendor scheme. So, the idea that the team came up with was to solve some of the problems of the Challenge: promote Defi applications and trading markets, while providing real products and creating new system administrators. Furthermore, your proposal also aligns with the sustainable development goals: Promoting sustainable, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, creating full, productive jobs and decent work for all. people, Building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation, Strengthening means of implementation and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Development Lasting; In addition, there is also a great impact on many other social aspects that have been detailed and detailed in the proposal. With a positive meaning and a profound impact on the operation of such NGOs, this proposal is likely to expand in the future. This proposal will bring potentially millions of new users to the Cardano network. Large NGOs work with hundreds of thousands to millions of people. For example, Action Against Hunger works exclusively with 8 million people in Nigeria at any given time. At the same time, the proposal would also place Cardano at the forefront of the Blockchain-for-impact narrative and SDG, potentially attracting more dApps to its platform in the future as entities/applications link together on the same network. In particular, the Incentive Mechanism that the proposal has also allowed Defi applications to be added to the Havuta App in the future. Proposed solution: Havuta's data collection app allows NGOs to quickly collect data from their program beneficiaries through technically delivered survey numbers and verify their impact through blockchain transactions. Beneficiaries are rewarded with a digitally distributed incentive to complete surveys, also using Havuta's native blockchain and HIE token. That solution has an impact on the health and education sector of the development sector, which is about $29.3 billion a year. For conservatives, this excludes non-DAC aid ($60 billion annually) and informal charitable, corporate and household donations based in the United States ($390 billion). dollars/yearly). The impact on NGOs will be huge. with Havuta the proposed team aims to cut M&E budgets (monitoring and evaluation) so that smaller NGOs can access impact data, larger NGOs can do more impact studies and longer-term studies, and effective impact-oriented organizations will be able to raise more funds because the impact is verified by Blockchain technology and transparent. This is even more meaningful when the proposed group gives evidence to explain specifically: The United Nations estimates that there were about 35,000 large NGOs established in 2000. According to the OECD, in 2017, the total public aid provided by the member countries of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the EU Organizations to developing countries is $160 billion. Of the total development funding granted to developing countries, 18.3% went to health and education. Development organizations now spend between 5 and 8% of their budgets measuring their results to deliver impact assessments: ranging in size from $1.465 to $2.344 billion per year. As we can see, NGOs currently spend 5 - 8% of their budget on audits which is too large, the application of Havuta will save a lot of budgets. I feel Havuta's positive impact on future NGOs. The proposal has great persuasiveness because of the scientific and technical theoretical bases and practical evidence to prove the positive impact of the product. In the process of implementing your idea, you also envisioned the risks that may be encountered in the implementation process: (1) lack of capital and (2) slow adaptation and acceptance of NGOs. government. You've come up with a solution to the risk: working with large, reputable organizations on testing deployments of Havuta apps to collect data on a professional basis, to develop a profile for the proposal. in the field and validate the group's product offering. So your solution is very feasible and easy to implement. However, for at-risk (1), I want you to have a more specific and feasible solution, such as putting in a backup budget or maybe looking for a partner to complete the product.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "To ensure feasibility, the proposed team has determined the timeline to complete and deliver the product to the community is 15 months (divided into 3 phases: the first 6 months, the next 3 months and the last 6 months). . Given the nature of each work associated with the stages, I think that the timelines you have presented are completely reasonable and highly feasible. In your proposal, you have also detailed the goals to be achieved for each stage: In the first 6 months, you will develop the Application further to be ready for the market (including the expansion of the distribution package). capacity and capabilities); The next 3 months are product integration with the Cardano network; the Last 6 months start Business Development/Marketing for this field. In your proposal, you have presented the Application that is in Beta and written to the EOSIO (Telos) network. However, I have not seen a reliable site for the community to check the progress of your project. Therefore, I would like you to add tools and online addresses so that the community can easily check them, which will increase the persuasion and prove the feasibility. To implement their idea, the team proposed a budget of $453600, which I think is the right budget to implement. Planned budget for 3 phases: 2 backend developers: $151,200; 1 user interface developer: $75,600; Marketing/business development: $226,800.

All three are to be completed in 15 months (6+3+6).\n\nAs stated above, the requested budget of $453,600 is enormous and not reasonable. Furthermore, it is not divided into identifiable tasks; it is merely broken up based on the team's salaries.

Instead, he described only three milestone steps in the plan section, which are expected to be completed in fifteen months. This approach is vague and inappropriate and will make auditability difficult.\n\nAs mentioned above, the proposer requested an enormous budget without sufficient details. He just segregated the budget based on salaries, and it is not divided into identifiable tasks.

The scale of impact is relatively large because the target audience of the proposal is NGOs worldwide, with the target market being the healthcare and education sectors.\nThe proposed solution identifies the most challenging problems and makes a sound argument. This solution will potentially bring millions of new users to the Cardano network, helping Cardano stay at the forefront of the blockchain narrative for impact and SDG and potentially attracting more dApps to its platform in the future as more entities/applications are linked together on the same network.\nThe author has outlined the main risks encountered when implementing the project and has solutions to minimize those risks.

For this proposal, the author has outlined a plan consisting of 3 main work parts and a specific implementation time. But for the better, I have an opinion that the plan should be presented in more detail. I am very interested in this project and would like to find out more about the project's HIE token. In addition, the team can provide a website link or a whitepaper of the project so that the community and I can learn more about tokenomics, the token distribution table, and its listing time.\nThe budget of this proposal represents 5.78% of the total budget for Challenge. The budget is divided into three specific sections. But for a better assessment, the author should give more details and add an explanation for those expenses. In my opinion, the cost of marketing/business development (this part accounts for 50% of the total budget) is relatively high, so the author should analyze it in more detail, including what costs and how much and calculate how to increase transparency. In the salary cost for developers, the author can add an explanation and basis to give that salary for a more straightforward assessment by the community.\nThe implementation team consists of 2 founders, and the proposer has described 1 CTO. They have six years of experience in the NGO field, including M&E consulting, two years of experience in software implementation for agencies and sponsors such as USAid, and two years of experience working at the donor level, specifically AusAID. I find that their qualifications and experience are consistent with the proposal's goals.

However, I think the community will expect more details on the risk management plan. As I see, some NGOs are not familiar with blockchain technology applications, so how can the team get them on board? (maybe some educational approaches, workshops,...).

Furthermore, will the use of Havuta tokens rather than ADA currencies make the app and Cardano ecosystem at odds with each other? This problem detracts from the integration of Cardano. The target market is education and healthcare which are large and receive a huge influx of investment with lots of NGOs in the related fields. This is demonstrated in figures provided by the proposer, which provides good background information about how these two sectors are receiving enormous investment regarding their equally impressive output. This validates the application's choice of the potential market. The transparency of blockchain verification helps NGOs allocate more funds for other purposes such as studies. The utilization of blockchain technology by Cardano will bring to this ecosystem a large population as NGOs are increasing in size and scale. The proposer places emphasis on Cardano blockchain and dApps as well as DeFi, which highly utilizes integration of the Cardano ecosystem. The main risk is identified as lack of funding and adoption.

(Facebook, Instagram,...) and how much will go into hiring marketing executives/content creators/\u2026 How much will go into advertisement posts?
