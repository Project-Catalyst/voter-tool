It is less clear in the proposal on how this may be priced to these users such as the paying for the usage of the API and how sustainable this might business model may be. Better access to high quality data on NFTs could have a number of knock on effects that improve the ecosystem to improve applications that could use this data or investors who want to get more familiar with the Cardano ecosystem. It would have been good to see some comparisons with existing NFT tools (e.g. https://cnft.tools/ or others) that bring together data about NFTs so that a comparison can be made on the exact differences.

A software licensing NFT collection is also mentioned - this sounds like a release of an NFT collection instead of a tool for the end user. The team provide their LinkedIn profiles that showcase the background of those involved. Most notably the CTO has a number of years of experience in the blockchain space. The team appear to have the right background and skill sets to execute on this proposal. One area of main concern is the amount of tools they intend to build when no evidence has been given of existing efforts to create some of this tooling. Due to the large amount of work that needs to be executed and the lack of evidence that this will be achievable in the short term it is difficult to give a very high feasibility rating. A slightly smaller budget but just focussing on one of these ideas to showcase the teams ability to execute would have been a great first proposal. This could have been for example the project tracker, was the only thing being focussed on and had a more extensive breakdown of the tasks and potentially wireframes to showcase the intentions. In contrast to this it must be noted there are some benefits to trying multiple things at once to see what sticks with the community to determine what is working most effectively.

Building on a brand-as-a-service model, the team views their solution \"Imperium\" as a analytical tool/tracker of NFT projects on Catalyst and a curated platform for mainstream users to realize the potential of NFTs and to allow them for a fractional ownership. The project will onboard traditional retail investors, improve the liquidity of digital assets as a new asset class and boost activity within Cardano ecosystem. The proposal fits the challenge very well because of the above mentioned reasons.

The \"Software Licensing NFT collection\" timeline looks more plausible and will take 10 weeks. If understanding correctly, this project will take 20 weeks ie. around 5 months to complete.  However, the team should confirm this and put in the comment to clarify. The team members are comprised of LatAm team members and Wolfram Blockchain Research Labs. their CTO is involved with the data processing phase of the CNFT awards 2022 and hence, is very knowledgeable on the NFT projects. They plan to come back for F10 for future features ie. Pricing tool, statistics screener, calendar, and refined version of Imperium Wallet tracker.

This also indicates that they will be better positioned for any uncertainty inherent in cost and time estimates, as well as an unpredictable financial risk.
