The proposed project aims to create an eco-friendly alternative to plastic straws with ADA payment integration in order to reduce plastic waste. The problem statement is well defined, and it is further supported by illustrative emotion-evoking videos and provided dedescriptopn of the end product. Furhermore I like the idea of using Cardano to solve real-world problems, proving the ecosystem's utility, which is well aligned with Cardano's main goal. Furthermore, the project appears to be well aligned with the current challenge, as it proposes the development of a tokenized product that will use ADA payments and integrate Cardano's payment ecosystems. Furthermore, the project aims to address an imported environmental issue that Cardano regards as a top priority. This is also an excellent opportunity for the community to expand, as increased adoption of the ADA and cryptocurrencies in general will result in the realization of other blockchain-related ideas, such as the use of the blockchain for supply chain monitoring, identity storage, and so on. The proposed solution, if implemented, is likely to have a global impact because it addresses a global problem; however, it is fair to say that the effect will be marginal because plastic straw litter accounts for only 0.03 percent of the plastic waste in the oceans (sources on Guardian, National Geographic etc.). On the other hand, proving the validity and utility of this project could lead to blockchain solutions in other areas of closely related to plastic waste, such as fishing (more than 50% of plastic waste is fishing nets and so on.) by storing information about the plastic impact of fishing companies tied to their identity on the blockchain and so on.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For a number of reasons, the project is likely to materialize. To begin, the project's team has extensive experience with IT and e-commerce-related projects, as well as experience with eco-friendly product design and trading. Everyone is internally motivated since they see the project as a mission. The proposal is also rich in details about team members' contacts, proving the validity of their previous experience. The team was previously funded by the Catalyst project for integration solutions for shops and e-commerce platforms, which is an important step in this project as well. The team's final point is that each member's responsibilities are pre-determined, filling all of the important responsibilities for project execution. The timeline is well written, with a clear short and long-term plan. The goals, on the other hand, are only written for each quarterly ommintg specifics on a monthly basis. Furhtermore I dind the long-term goal to be slightly ambitions (or perhaps I don't have a good overview) i.e. \"Top #1 grass straw provider in the world payment by crypto\". The budget breakdown is, in my opinion, reasonable for a given type of project over a 6-month period and includes all necessary costs for labor, technology, and logistics. What I would recommend is also stating what other funding will support the project so that you can get a better idea of how feasible the idea is, as it will undoubtedly include other costs related to IT development and so on.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The timeline and milestones are clearly defined. KPIs mentioned in the project\u00a0are relevant\u00a0for tracking the project's exposure, both in terms of the working process and ADA utilization. While delivery dates are only provided on a monthly basis, I understand how difficult it is to predict all of the circumstances that may affect the entire process. The authors also provided a plethora of risks associated with delivery in great detail and solutions. Furthermore, the community could expect a high level of transparency in the ongoing activities, as the team provided numerous channels to monitor project execution on the designated website and social media platforms.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3256", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4617, "q0": "The proposal addresses a real environmental issue: plastic straws, which cause harm to marine life and animals while also harming the ecosystem. This is an excellent choice for the challenge. The proposal addresses two Challenge questions: creating a product that influences the sense of environmental protection and this product being instantly usable to solve the problem of plastic waste. At the same time, the product may be connected with ADA coin payment. This is a proposal that can be expanded in the future. The proposal addresses a real environmental issue: plastic straws, which cause harm to marine life and animals while also harming the ecosystem. This proposal contributes to Cardano's aim of addressing environmental challenges, waste, carbon emissions, renewable energy, and food. This proposal results in the release of plastic straws into the ocean, which helps to reduce waste to the ecosystem and the ocean.\nIn reality, plastic straws harm wildlife and marine life by polluting the ecosystem. As a result, it is proposed to provide a solution to this problem by producing natural grass straws to replace plastic straws. Propose presenting relevant evidence and arguments. The proposal also discusses the potential risks to the project, such as climate change causing drought, salinity, and water shortages, which impact the development of raw material locations. The second risk is that natural grass straws are more expensive than plastic straws. The third risk is that cryptocurrency price fluctuations may lead the project to be underfunded. The third risk identified is that the covid-19 epidemic interrupts the export and transport networks, which might result in long and sluggish shipment and delivery times to international clients. The proposal has solutions for the first risk of excavating natural water reservoirs and storing water for farming to reduce the above threats. The proposed team's answer for the second risk is to preserve and safeguard the new raw material location in response to natural environmental changes. Exploiting and discovering new raw material locations unaffected by climate change. Plant cultivars that can adapt to new weather and soil conditions will be tested. There is a plenty of natural grass with knives, as well as self-control over the source of self-cultivated grass. Due to the risks of cryptocurrency price changes, the proposing team selected a cash payment method and by ADA; Covid prevention measures are now being improved, so the supply chain will be restored shortly. The proposed team has implemented a solution to establish raw material sources and automation in the production line in order to cut expenses and lower the price of grass straws. In this regard, I see a possibility that restaurants and consumers are increasingly using plastic straws, which has a negative impact on the environment. The solution to this problem is to distribute the harmful effects of plastic straws and plastic garbage in commercial centers, restaurants, and schools. \nThe product provided in the proposal is highly valuable; it is chemical-free, biodegradable, and decreases CO2 waste as well as the problem of plastic waste and marine pollution. This is a problem for the world in general, and for Cardano in particular, in terms of sustainable development. The risks and solutions offered by the proposal are both realistic. The product will have an impact on the user's awareness. As a result, I scored myself 5 points.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is divided into two phases that will be implemented over four quarters. This is an acceptable timetable. The proposed group provides a phase 1 implementation plan: Started construction. The projected group's activity in the second quarter of 2022 focuses on the construction of factories, working groups, and the development of natural grass raw resources. Build factories and recruit local workers and farmers. Establish production procedures and train employees. Purchase and begin exploiting the raw material area. A well-established production crew and a grass straw production line are in place. Develop retail channels, SNS community channels, and e-commerce channels. Build an online store that takes ADA as well as cash payments. Design of product packaging Bring the first product to market; The group proposed doing the following in the third quarter of 2022: Investing in automation and equipment to replace manual labor. Increase the amount of straws produced. Product categorisation should be checked and shaped. Products that are printed and packed. Product marketing and promotion Exports to other countries are looking to support sales growth. Create an e-commerce web store and sell online. The Global Campaign \"Cardano 4 Sea - C4S\" and \"Cardano SAYS NO TO PLASTIC STRAWS\" are launched. Phase 2: Q4 of 2022 Carry on the \"Cardano 4 Sea - C4S\" and \"Cardano SAYS NO TO PLASTIC STRAWS\" campaigns. Plant materials are harvested from the start of the project (harvest time is about 7-8 months). Increase the number of local employees. Factory and manufacturing line expansion Increase the export of grass straws to other countries. Establish new raw material locations. Launch a grass straw marketing and communication campaign. The planned alliance would campaign and persuade other governments to ban plastic straws entirely in the first quarter of 2023. Support for transfer of knowledge and skills in the manufacture of grass straw. Provide partners with communication and export assistance. ADAPay payment connection is complete. Continue on with the global campaigns \"Cardano 4 Ocean - C4O\" and \"Cardano SAYS NO TO PLASTIC STRAWS.\" The project's progress is posted on Telegram and Facebook. The financing budget for the proposal is $86,708, which is less than 5% of the total Challenge budget and offers a reasonable redundancy cost. The proposal has a redundancy cost of $7,882.5.\nThe proposed group consists of three main members and two teams of engineering and technology professionals. Members are allocated tasks that are commensurate with their responsibilities. LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, and the website all provide information about the proposed group's members. The proposed team is led by Trong, who has proposals and active activities in the Cardano community in Vietnam, and there are 17 more proposals to support the Catalyst community. This is an excellent idea, and I give it 5 point rating for project feasibility.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides a table that will be used to measure the project's success as community activities. Number of retail orders, exports, and e-commerce activities completed online. Project management tool index The proposal indicates the use of a manual manufacturing process that incorporates light industry into operation. As soon as ISO standards and occupational safety indicators are created, they should be applied. Using and applying fire prevention and fighting standards in production management and operation. This is a proposal submitted to fund 8, however due to funding exhaustion, it cannot be implemented, thus the proposed group continues to implement at this fund. The proposed team has completed various tasks such as creating a sales website and stockpiling raw materials so that information regarding the project's progress can be easily verified. Individual assessor have no more suggestions for the project's success metric. The proposing team has built concrete successes for the project that include ideas about creating a mindset in the Cardano community that says no to plastic straws. Based on Cardano funding, the proposed group might create grass straws to replace plastic straws. The project would incorporate the product to develop an economic model for bringing natural items linked to ADA copper, as well as the creation of a commercial website for the product. According to the proposal, the initiative will rely on funds in the first year. The proposal is planned to operate the firm independently after the second year, without the need for another round of funding. The project will provide local job opportunities, contribute to local economic growth, and forecast land and water resources from climate change. This is a proposal to inspire anyone interested in applying for Cardano funding to produce ecologically friendly products. In the future, the proposal will continue to invest in other similar business models based on the experience and information obtained from this project and used the profits from the current business. These milestones are all attainable and linked to challenges. The proposal already has a test product and is brand new. \nThe proposed team's products are realistic solutions for reducing CO2 emissions, plastic waste problems, and marine pollution, while also raising user knowledge about environmental protection, at least in the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, the product can be linked with an ADA for payment. I completely agree with this fantastic proposal, and I hope it is funded by this fund.

You give arguments explaining why we should use co-bang (lepironia actiulata) straws. Your team also exposes the obvious risks to come up with a reasonable remedial solution. About labor: Your group has the idea of \u200b\u200bHiring local people to participate in the project in planting materials, harvesting and production. This I think is very reasonable because it will help many local people have jobs to do during the Covid epidemic, many people are unemployed.

This section is a clear winner for positive change but loses a few points from me in a few different areas that I would like to see explained, if another attempt is needed. First, as the section is currently framed, the proposal seems hardly relevant to Cardano as it\u2019s only connection/contribution is the option to pay for services in ADA. In theory, the 20% discount for paying in ADA is an incentive to adopt assets from the ecosystem but that depends on the business seeing substantial success AND that clients find the discount appealing enough to participate in what is generally recognized as a risky asset class. So, essentially, this proposal is mainly just funding a startup company that will utilize existing Cardano infrastructure as an option, which is ultimately up to the community to decide if that is aligned with Catalyst values. Voters may also raise some concern with the acknowledged fact that grass straws are more expensive than plastic straws, which might cause this product to be found in the same sort of purgatory as paper straws. I think this section of the proposal could benefit from some market research on grass straws and how this team stands out from the competition. Aside from concerns about the legitimate possibility of having any impact on the Cardano ecosystem & adoption, this seems like a very clearly positive proposal to me that earns my confidence with the honest effort put into considering risks. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For comprehensive transparency, impressively specific detail in roadmapping, and strategically efficient use of funds, this section earns a 5 from me. If voters are evaluating the feasibility of this proposal through the lens of the capability of the core team, then this plan is in demonstrably good hands. The team appears to have a comprehensive set of skills relevant to this endeavor, including ecommerce and global markets. The spending appears to be impressively efficient and spent entirely on the investment of the operation (not to any self-determined salaries to the core team members). The only concerning part of this section I see is the reference to Amazon webstores, which doesn\u2019t have impact on feasibility but does further impact the capability of this proposal to contribute to the Cardano ecosystem.

I rank this section based on the auditibility of what the proposal aims to accomplish, not based on its contribution to the Cardano ecosystem directly. If there are voters that are specifically looking for this assurance, it may benefit this section to include direct metrics on how much ADA revenue will be aimed for and what actions the team might take to reinforce this impact. Aside from that, this section provides everything voters could possibly need to prove that they have very thorough and ambitious definitions of success. Unlike most Catalyst proposals, this section enables effective guages that will help the team monitor progress in a way that keeps productivity up and allows the team to know if adjustments need to be made along the way (if KPIs are not on target).

Those risks are climate change causing drought, salinity, water shortage, affecting the development of raw material areas. The price of natural grass straws is higher than that of plastic straws. Crypto price fluctuations can cause the project to be underfunded. The covid-19 epidemic disrupts the export and shipping chain, which can lead to long and slow shipping times and delivery of final products to overseas customers.

With an environmentalist foundation, the project manages to specify their positive impact on the Cardano community. The grass straw is envisioned to replace plastic straws completely in some countries. Therefore, Cardano will receive more publicity if it involves itself in this environmental project and expands its brand awareness through these relevant projects.

The project mentioned a youtube video but still no link, need to add a few links to a short clip about 2-3 minutes long to give an example. The team is also worried about the problem that plastic straws may be discontinued in Europe, the US, and Japan in 2023, so creating a straw made of natural grass will help increase income and develop public health. .

In addition, they also provide information about natural grass with full functions and 100% guarantee of no harm to health. The values they bring will help inspire other people to work on new eco-friendly products. In particular, they also mentioned ADA, a useful means of transaction during the epidemic. They are even more careful than showing themselves a picture that clearly summarizes their purpose. Each section is clearly numbered so it is easy to observe and follow each stage. First of all, it is reasonable to use 7-8 months-old sedge plants to start planting because at this time the plants are in the growing age, but not yet stated what type of soil is used and not How much is the area, for example, the type of soil in a wet or dry environment, how many square meters.
