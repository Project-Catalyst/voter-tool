To protect the wildlife biome and create awareness on earth.", "f6_no_assessments": 12, "f6_rating": 3.388888888888889, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1597, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe game is good, but I found the proposal written in a somewhat abstract way. We know that the intention here is to create a survival game, in which we would have a piece of land, through an active token, from what I could understand it would be a simulation of real wild life in which animals and plants would be NFTs. The goals of the game seem to be to explore the environment and evolve, however the matches themselves are not so clear. What would the gameplay look like in practice? It is said that some activities would be \"find hidden treasures in the wild, collect families and earn mystery boxes with rankings\", but that's a pretty short description of the whole. What would we do in this wild environment? It is said that we would learn about biomes, species, etc., but the scenario is a bit abstract. How would face-to-face camp, in the Nordic environment, enrich this experience and relate to the game? Why would the adopted currency be Omimimo, and not Ada? It is said that players would form a DAO that would later make their own decisions, but what kind of decisions are we talking about? Are they related to the real world or the game experience? How could we be sure that nature would be preserved through the game, in addition to, for example, live measurement of water purity? It is said that \u201cthrough the Omimimo game you will gain knowledge and connect point by point how the ecosystem works and why exactly all species are needed\u201d. How would this knowledge be gained? They mention having an NGO, but which NGO is this and how does it operate? In general, I think that several aspects are said in which the game would form, but without us being able to visualize the whole in a solid way. I think that for this to be clearer, it would be interesting if the team had, for example, attached a video with a simulation of the game, even if short, so that we could know what it would be like. Regarding the impact of the project on Cardano, unfortunately the authors focus much more on how the game would be beneficial in the sustainable bias than how it would contribute to popularizing and wide adoption of our blockchain. I would like to be more assertive about how the game would appeal, for example, to an audience that was not necessarily active in the cryptographic community. How to make players who participate in projects on other blockchains, for example, become interested in Cardano, realize its differentials. What kind of transactions would be minted on our blockchain, for example? You can understand that information aimed at animals and plant species, but some purchases would be made, NFTs would be acquired, would there be what kind of financial transactions involving Ada and smart contracts, for example? So, even if the idea itself is interesting, unfortunately the proposal is not so clearly aligned with the objectives of the challenge and its whole scenario is a little abstract in the face of such diverse information, but that is not well-detailed.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script presented is satisfactory, although not ideal. The timeline is divided into quarters, each of which is detailed in activities. I would like to suggest specifying what would happen each month within the quarters, and also that each activity be better detailed, as they are only mentioned, not broken down. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022 the \u201cdesign improvement for in-game customization\u201d would be made, but what would this improvement constitute? How would designers work with the pre-existing material, making it more attractive to the public? Regarding the game mechanics, it is also said that it would be improved at this stage of development. But how, what kind of changes would be made and who would work here? Therefore, I think the script deserved a better depth of parts, so that we had a more complete view of the whole. Similarly, the budget explanation exists, but it is superficial. For example, we know that the development of the game itself would cost 12k. But why? Who would work, developing what tasks, to get this part of the project done? How would the money destined for marketing be used, with what strategies would the game be publicized, how would the target audience be reached? I believe that the gaming universe is one of the richest for the cryptographic community, in the sense that they have many projects and many interested users. So it is of paramount importance that advertising is done in an attractive and assertive way. With that, I think that this and also the other parts of the game's development should be better explained, more detailed in relation to funding. Finally, speaking of the team, this is the part that leaves something to be desired, unfortunately. We don't know much information about the team members, including their full names, which is very necessary information. For example in the case of Maria, we know that she is the creator of the game. But what professional training does she have, how does she relate to the Cardano ecosystem? It would be important to understand a little of her professional trajectory, which projects she has developed until today and so on. It would be important for this information to be proven by some link, a linkedin profile, for example. Likewise for the other team members. Unfortunately, this topic leaves a lot to be desired, requiring more detail in all 3 main parts, especially in the team presentation. That said, it is necessary that a general deepening be done, so that the script allows us to have a more specific understanding of what would be done, how, when and by whom (and why); the division of funding is better broken down, arguing the need for the requested budget; and the presentation of the team is more complete, with CVs that allow us to understand their professional paths.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proponents provide good material that can serve as auditability of the final results. We know what are the expected results for each quarter and also what would be the success scenario of the game, which in short would be people playing, having Omimimo NFTs, learning about nature and environmental preservation as they evolve in the game, there is still the possibility to visit a physical camp. Regarding this last part, I believe that there was a lack of detail to understand how, in fact, this activity would be developed. Where would this camp be located, would it only be accessible to European players, as plane tickets are generally very expensive? In this sense, would players from other parts of the planet have any possibility of real immersion in relation to the game's experiences? One point that I think is important to comment on is: we know what should be monitored, but not how. In other words, how would the Cardano community have access to such information, in a direct and simple way? The ideal, in my opinion, would be for the members of this team themselves to have reports, posted or on social networks, or on telegram channels, discord, in short, a means of communication between community members. So that in such reports partial progress could be described, information about each area of \u200b\u200bdevelopment of the game, however diverse they may be. Whether those involved would be carrying out the activities established within the correct time frame and in the expected manner, etc. Another very important issue that was somewhat absent in the auditability of this project was how the impact for the Cardano community would be measured, that is, how the specific objectives of the challenge would be addressed. How can we be sure that the number of transactions on our blockchain has increased? Certainly these NFTs would be minted at Cardano (hence, CNFTs), but how can we ascertain the considerable growth in the number of smart contracts in circulation? Could Ada be involved in this game in some way, besides the cryptoasset itself created especially for the game? In order for all of this to be better understood, it is necessary to establish a solid communicative point with the community, so that all advances, even if sensitive, can be monitored. It is also necessary that the tangible consequences for our blockchain be stated some time after the project is carried out, a direct survey could be carried out with the players, for example, to understand in what ways they would be relating to Cardano after participating in the game (if would have become active members of the community and how). So, as a whole, I don't think that auditability is precarious, but very important issues were not so evident either, needing to be taken more into account.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 9, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8297, "q0": "Initially, I want to point out that I have seen this project popped up in Fund 8, specifically in the Gamers On-Chained challenge setting. This current proposal seems to be similar to the one in Fund 8, however, I believe that this is a continuation of the one in Fund 8 rather than a lazy copy-paste work. Therefore, I\u2019ll still give my unbiased verdict to this proposal.\nOverall, this section of the proposal is well-written, well-aligned, easy to comprehend and the intention is clear. The aim of this project is to raise awareness and provide knowledge for players to cherish the environment, protect the wildlife biome and preserve the resources wisely, all of which is a noble cause, without a doubt. I notice that the team also has plans for a field trip, apparently, to the Nordic regions for further appreciation of nature, which is very welcoming. The proposal also mentions the integration of Cardano into the game, which is the objective of all challenge settings, however, I feel like the proposer should give more details regarding how technology and real world assets are made for each other, since that part is still quite unclear to me. \nI\u2019m still intrigued that this is a free-to-play survival 3D game utilizing the Cardano blockchain for a noble cause, as stated multiple times in this section. The proposal also offers a glimpse into some elements of gameplay, such as the item rankings of Epic, Rare, Uncommon and Common species; ranking up mechanism through mystery box acquisitions and surviving from predators; and the Omimimo token being the main CNFT currency of the game.\nNevertheless, there are still some flaws to this proposal that I would like to deduct. Please note that I have brought up these issues in my past assessment of this project in Fund 8, however, those issues seem to remain in this current iteration. Therefore, I shall list them down once more.\nFirstly, in order to gain more credit and likelihood to be accepted, I believe the proposal should include some key metrics or KPIs to determine the success-to-come of this project, for example, an estimation of a player base or how much income players will be able to earn from the game.\nSecondly, while the proposal does address a potential challenge of the project for the foreseeable future, which is the ability to make contributions to the preservation of nature while still creating an enjoyable experience for players, there is yet to be a viable solution being offered. It\u2019s clear that the team does have enthusiasm and passion for the project, but I think that a more profoundly impactful action should be taken, for example, the team could extract a small amount of income to donate to charity or organizations with a similar cause.\nLast but not least, the proposal does ambitiously aim, to quote directly from the proposal, \u201cto reach even the most passively pro clean water gamers\u201d, meaning they should have a great target audience in mind, which is suitable for this project. Yet, despite my interest in the genre of this game and the heavily-featured noble cause of nature protection and preservation, the proposal doesn\u2019t offer many details for me to be desired and attracted, regarding the content of the game. There are still a few elements as listed above, but coming from a gamer myself, I still need more details relating to the gameplay mechanism, specifically, what tools players will have and what actions and interactions players can do in order to survive; the game lore which tells the story and background of the game, leading to the open world setting of the game (since I\u2019m pretty sure a survival won\u2019t be limited to a confined space). So I strongly recommend the proposer supplement those details quickly.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Having finished researching this section, I would like to send out my congratulations to the team for delivering a pretty well-conceived roadmap and milestones. I wish to point out that apparently the project is on the verge of completion, as in Q3 of 2022, the website, gameplay mechanism and the OMIMIMO community is still in development. Still, the team hopes to have delivered the final product in one year\u2019s time, as the final phase of the project is expected to arrive in Q2 of 2023. Even though I would love to have more details at each stage of the project to carefully inspect, I have high hopes that the project will be able to achieve the desired outcome. And I am absolutely loving the idea of bringing the game to the realm of Virtual Reality, as this technology has been on the rise and worth the money for its various applications in different fields and industries. To have players hop into the game and become the survivors stranded on strange land sounds very promising and interesting.\nAs for the budget breakdown section, to be honest I\u2019m quite baffled with the Fractional Ownership part. This part mentions the activities, ownership rights and benefits that players can expect to gain from the game, which, don\u2019t get me wrong, is a very welcoming feature considering that you\u2019re aiming to lure in people to play your game. I\u2019m just not sure whether this is the right section to put this part in. That being said, the requested budget is detailed, due to the fact that the proposal includes sufficient information regarding each phase of the project, from the work needed to be done and the enclosed time periods to the amount of funding for each phase. I notice that the real life visits to the Nordic wild camp doesn\u2019t come with a figure, but the total sum of Q3 of 2022 is $15,500. Subtracting the $12,000 of 12 weeks of game development, the cost of the Nordic trip should be $3,500.\n Nevertheless, the requested budget that the proposal lists, which is $19,000, is incorrect according to my calculation, since the total figure of all quarters is $13,000 + $4,500 + $15,500 + $10,000 = $43,000, more than doubling the the number that the proposal lists out. I strongly suggest that the proposer update this information for best clarity.\nAs for the members participating in this project, the proposal does list out the names along with the expertise and the positions in the project. I must admit that this sector is a little vague since I feel like myself and the community would want additional information regarding their expertise and appropriateness to the project, perhaps some visual evidence or affiliated profiles online, for further inspection.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From what is offered in this section, I would say that the proposal has gained a certain level of auditability, though there are some small tweaks here and there that I would like to make. The proposal does include its supposed versions of future success, which are the short-term, mid-term and long-term success. All three are relevant to the production of the game with the hopes of a perfectly delivered game in the long haul. However, the team has yet to provide a means of tracking progress of the project, so I suggest using tracking tools such as JIRA for this purpose. And I also notice that there are no details relating to the benefits and profits that the Cardano blockchain can expect to reap from this project, which I would advise the proposer to add since they are quite pivotal.\nOne more thing I would like to add is that in the Impact section, I thought that the Nordic trip was for players to enjoy the natural sceneries and relax. I wish to reaffirm that in actuality, the assets that players may own in the game translates to real world properties, by which I am genuinely surprised. How the team will be able to realize this feature, I believe, hasn\u2019t been specified yet.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2974", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 4, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2388, "q0": "According to the ideas present in the proposal, we realized that the project fits the objectives of the challenge in which it finds itself, as it aims to use Cardano technologies to develop a game with the potential to reach many users, promoting the preservation of nature. If the game manages to achieve the intended engagement, in fact this proposal would have a great impact on our ecosystem, and in this context, the budget being requested seems consistent with what is planned to be accomplished. Unlike other games that use blockchain technology, we see here a clear concern to create an immersive and captivating universe for the player to evolve. This is a clearly differentiating point, as other similar games are only aimed at selling NFT's. With that, if well executed, we would have here a good example of allocating funds to promote the Cardano ecosystem and the environment through a game.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As previously mentioned, a good execution of the project would be essential for this game to reach the desired visibility and awareness. In fact, when we look at the activities that will be carried out on the timeline, we can find ideas that have a good progression and that gradually become more complex, which makes a lot of sense. However, it seems that currently the project is not at a very advanced stage, when we take into account the milestones that aim to be reached later this year. This puts in doubt the feasibility of the project, as perhaps the steps provided here are not enough for the game to be released on the scheduled date (November 2022). In this context, perhaps the expenses foreseen in the budget breakdown are not enough for all the work that must be done until the game's launch. In particular, we are in doubt whether the amount allocated for programming is enough when considering the aforementioned caveats. Thus, we can say that the main point of doubt so far about feasibility is that we don't have so much information or demonstrations that the game is in a more advanced stage of development, analyzing the game's website I also didn't find such indications easily. But it is important to mention the positive factor that the team showed a constant concern to promote the game through marketing and community growth. Still in relation to this team, we noticed the presence of relevant technical knowledge for the development of the game, however, it seems important that other people related to non-technological areas were also present on the team. People who had specific knowledge in project management or administration, for example. It would also be nice if the CVs of the aforementioned team had been made available so that we could verify their experiences more easily.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Regarding the team's perception of success, we realized that it is consistent with the ideas developed during the proposal, to create a game always thinking about its environmental impact.

Some of these possible goals would be the expected number of players in the first few months after the game's release, an expected volume of NFT's marketed or even a survey seeking to understand whether players' environmental awareness has increased after the experience.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2306", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9288, "q0": "I agree with the proposal to create a game to strengthen and train the cognitive capacity in all people about protecting nature and pure water.

Making it a survival game is very engaging, and an extremely fun way to implement NFT assets, as one of the main disadvantages of current NFTs is that we cannot do much with them and only display them. Integrating real life assets into the game and attaching them to NFTs is also extremely interesting, and will bring more interested people, as a big critique of owning an NFT is how it feels like you don't own a tangible object. The goal of the game being to educate the gamers about the importance of the environment and protecting it is compelling, and especially relevant, as the world finds ways to fight climate change. It's a very engaging topic that many people are passionate about. This project completely meets the goal of impactful uses for cardano. I feel it is a very meaningful project.\nI do think the project needs more brainstorming. While the initial idea is very nice. We don't know what the actual content of the game is. What genre of game willit be? What are the characters? Is there any artwork or concept art? What are the features and gameplay mechanics being worked on?How exactly will \"\"real life elements\"\" be implemented to the game? What kind of real life elements? Who will be in charge of the conservation efforts for the environment? There are many elements that remain unanswered, or extremely vague. Perhaps it would be better to focus on a simpler aspect of gameplay, and really flesh out one idea first. It also seems like the game is an immense workload to both maintain online assets and offline assets.

From there, a well-aligned challenge settings solution combining two categories: environment and gaming was proposed to create positive values globally (protect the wildlife biome and create awareness on earth). I suppose it is a new strategy based on the \"knowledge is caring\" philosophy that targets those interested in protecting the environment (such as pure resources and wildlife) in the blockchain platform with a direct impact on the roots of the problem. Through cool gameplay and story, players will be able to \u201cprotect nature together in a flow on the blockchain\u201d by \u201chaving their piece of the wild on an NFT\u201d which allows them to grow and collectively create enlightenment on earth while making a profit for themselves. In addition, the proposal promises to create software real-timing to manage the water measuring sources data on the blockchain and organize a Nordic wild camp for individuals to have a more intuitive view of nature. However, to emphasize the importance of the proposal, it would be better if the team provided some more data and cases to describe the current state of the environment. Regarding the challenge settings, the proposal should analyze the suitability of the Cardano ecosystem (ex: available facilities) for their plan's prospects explaining the execution right now and offering suggestions to improve and enrich our community. Moreover, although the proposal has identified the potential target audiences, it had better have a clearer view of their natures (ex: mindset in protecting environment solutions, platforms usually approach) to have an effective marketing and propaganda strategy. Furthermore, the proposal might provide some KPIs/key metrics to express positive impacts on the Cardano ecosystem and its users (such as total number of users, amount of awareness being produced, and player income generated) to make it become more reliable for voters. In the challenges and risks section of the proposal, \u201cconnecting the real-world protection of nature with the gamification\u201d is considered the biggest one \u2013 the actual situation of most projects in this field.

By applying Blockchain technology, they may be able to keep track with realtime status of the nature being reserved. Moreover, a Nordic wild camp is also arranged for physical trips, which is a very creative point to help people observe the results of the game in real life. Nowadays, the play-to-earn mechanism based on NFT is gradually becoming more popular than ever in this era. That mechanism is also applied well into this project and makes it aligned with the challenge. The team pointed out a very detailed idea, which is building a NFT-based survival 3D game, combined with hidden mystery boxes as well as an interesting ranking system. This is a strength to take advantage of in order to attract new users to the Cardano ecosystem as well as compete with already existing NFT games. Moreover, the most featured point is that every token collected by players will be used to fuel the nature reserving system and develop the future growth of the game. They believe that this will train cognitive capabilities about nature in all humans.
