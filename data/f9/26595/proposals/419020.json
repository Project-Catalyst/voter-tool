These downsides of the collectables market are definitely real: collectables are by definition unique, and thus illiquid, and time consuming. The costly aspect probably depends a lot on the market: art collectibles that have to be stored properly in order not to degrade over time likely incur higher trading costs than trading cards which are easier to store, transport and sell. \n\nLet\u2019s look at the value proposition. The proposers\u2019 plan is to build a marketplace for NFTs backed by certified physical, real world collectables. Here is how things would work. Verified sellers would deposit the collectables at a location in London, and an NFT would be issued to represent that item. Owners of those NFTs can, at any time, redeem their physical item. In the meantime, the items would be fully insured and can be audited by \u201canyone wishing to do so, as long as this person has been approved by the community\u201d. \n\nWe don\u2019t have many other details, and I have to ask a significant number of questions, what-if scenarios and stress testing the business model. Please bear with me:\n\n- can we have more details on what that location in London would imply? What kind of security measures are in place and what volume of collectibles can it hold? What collectible items would it target at first? Does the team own it? How would its costs be passed on to the marketplace?\n - if the project is successful, that means a significant physical value would be stored in that London based vault. How would NFT owners gain comfort that the items are safe from theft if under the control of one central party, the NFT marketplace? Would a custodian be appointed to ensure a higher level of trust?\n- who would be the verified sellers, businesses or private persons? Would they act as custodians of the items in the London vault?\n- How would the physical items be ring-fenced from the marketplace\u2019s balance sheet? Are there any contingency measures in place in case the marketplace goes bust? Who would ensure that the items in store are sent to their rightful NFT owners and not end up being liquidated in case of default?\n- storing the items over a period of time would incur costs? Would there be annual storage fees and retrieval fees? If yes, what is the pricing model of such fees? \n- how would the marketplace address the global market, or would it only be limited in the UK? What about performing KYC controls before a user redeems an item?\n\nI shall limit my questions to the ones above - but for me they are a clear demonstration that the business model definitely needs, if not perfecting, at least being better explained to the Cardano community before the benefits of such a model become evident. Until then, despite the excellent connection between the proposal and the challenge, I have to limit my assessment to three stars. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "There is a somewhat good, but definitely not perfect, description of the team. The proposal mentions four names: James and Arnas, with backgrounds in the collectables and auctioning industries, Tashoma the UI/UX designer and co-founder of liqwid.finance, and Jemini, responsible for video production, marketing and branding. An excellent proposal would have definitely included some social media profiles for an easy way to verify the team\u2019s profile and previous experiences. The team also lacks, for the moment, internal development competencies and are in talks with Haskell teams. \n\nThe timeline is the following: designing and creating the marketplace would take 18 weeks. The proposal mentions that users would have a chance to experiment with the testnet, but it does not tell if the target for testnet or mainnet is after 18 weeks - so things are rather fuzzy. There are sadly no intermediary milestones, just a storyline: initially, trading would start in \u201cthe most established certified collectable markets\u201d: banknotes, coins, comics, trading cards and video games. Marketing efforts would then be undertaken, and the target would be to onboard the first 1.000 participants. After, user base expansion would follow. \n\nBudgetwise, the platform build would require 150k USD. Additionally two employees would require 25k USD each per year, and they would handle marketing, promotion, engagement, admin duties, storage, and issuance / redemption of NFTs. Initial set-up costs are also included for 50k USD: insurance, deposit boxes, maintenance, marketing.  \n\nI have again a set of questions:\n- The proposers claim that \u201ca significant amount of Coin collectables are already secured from our first registered seller\u201d who is that registered seller and what is the total value of coins secured?\n- if they are still in talks with developer teams, how do the proposers know that the build would require 150k USD? How many quotes have they obtained, and from whom? Do they have a more detailed budget with necessary tasks, hours needed and hourly rates charged by the outside developers? \n- how would the marketplace make money, what is the overall revenue model? \n- how would possible cost overruns be handled, and does the team plan on deploying their own capital to fund the marketplace? \n\nIn conclusion, there are still many unknowns regarding this project\u2019s feasibility: more details are needed about the team, the budget needs a more thorough look and the development stages are not very clear either. Similarly as in the previous section, three stars are sufficient. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers mention that they would issue monthly reports with information on users, trading activity, user feedback and demographic indicators. Performance indicators would include number of active users (retail, institutional) and questionnaires to trace the user acquisition process, mainly from which market have they joined the marketplace. Sadly, the proposal does not offer clear success metrics in terms of number of users after a certain time, or a target volume of trades / collectible items stored. \n\nI would have also expected that the team would have set-up by now, or at least promised to have in the future, a website with more details on the marketplace, roadmap and team, as well as digital communications channels with the target community / enthusiasts. \n\nLacking these ingredients but still delivering a fair auditability case, four stars are appropriate in this case.

Once the transaction is completed, this NFT will be transferred to the buyer, and they use this NFT to exchange for the item in real life.

Please provide additional infos or some developed products to show you capability. \nThe budget is described shortly. The budget for the employees and initial set-up seems reasonable but the \u201cPlatform build quoted at 150K$\u201d is unclear. Please define this in more detail. \nThe timeplan is more like a longterm roadmap. It would be nice to how you want to develop the application. You said that you need 18 weeks. What exactly do you want to do in this time. How much time is allocated to design the dApp, to develop the frontend, develop ten backend etc\u2026 \nThe risks are analyzed. The problem have been addressed and they have proposed solutions. \nOverall the proposal lacks details in every major field of the feasibility. There is not proof for the skills, the budget allocation for the development is unclear and the timeplan misses the shortterm development. Therefore I give 2 stars. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team wants to make monthly reports which include many relevant KPIs and overall many important KPIs and metrics are listed. \nThe problem was clearly stated and it get solved by the success goal. The goal isn\u00b4t clearly stated but is observable in the context of the whole proposal. Therefore I agree strongly that the proposal is easily auditable.
