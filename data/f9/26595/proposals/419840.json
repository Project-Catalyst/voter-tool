According to the proposer, Cardano is not widely supported by analytics firms (due to it being \u2018under radar\u2019), so the proposed solution is to increase collaboration with a variety of other projects (Cryptoslam, Bubble maps, etc). In my experience as a recurring PA (since Fund 6), I believe that the problem statement and the solution could be made a little bit clearer. For example asking ourselves questions similar to this: What does the proposer mean when addressing that Cardano is \u2018under the radar\u2019? Do they mean upcoming regulation? What is meant by \u2018utilities\u2019 (what tools will be part of the solution? Brief explanations on why these tools are needed and what potential effect they will have)?

It would benefit the proposal if it would have included some foundation to these statements. It would also be preferable to list some thoughts regarding the future sustainability, or if the proposer will need to return to Catalyst consecutively in order to manage an expand on the project. \n\nDue to the reasons listed above in the rationale, I disagree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

Let\u2019s say that this proposal is focused on a timeframe of 6 months, divided in 3 different phases of 2 months each. First two months will focus on outreach to different projects, working on utilities on the official website. Also doing analysis of incoming data. Phase 2 will keep working on outreach and have previously mentioned utilities released on the platform, and plan for an upcoming event Phase 3 will host an event to bring more collaborators together in a hackathon-like way. (Just an example for a super simple roadmap). \u2028\u2028Budget breakdown: The money estimated to be needed for this proposal is 25 000 USD, but we need to know how these will be allocated. How many estimated working hours (hourly wage?) for each responsibility area and team member? Will a developer have the same wage as the project manager, and will their workload be the same? Will phase 3 require more resources than phase 2, why? \u2028\u2028Team: There is an official website listed but no information given on any team member. I would suggest to include linkedIn-profiles, social media channels etc so that the community could access some way to validate proof of person, education and the expertise needed to implement this proposal. I couldn\u2019t find information of the team members on the official website, but maybe that is just me being bad at navigating the website. \n\u2028It would also beneficial the proposal greatly if it would include some information on the other 4 projects submitted for Fund 9, and how it would affect this proposal if all 5 proposals were to be funded.
