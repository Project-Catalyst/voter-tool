To do this, almost all dApps rely on companies that sell API access to a node that they run as a service. Cryptographic wallets like Metamask have a problem though; when they have to interact with the blockchain to do basic things (view your balance, transitions, NFT) and / or more complex operations (build transactions, interact with smart contracts, etc.) they are not really able to do it as is built the blockchain itself.\nSo to carry out the operations mentioned above (view balance, transitions etc) Metamask makes API calls to centralized servers (etherscan to view the transitions, Infura to view the balance, Opensea to view the NFTs).\nAll this has led to a situation in which the vision of our cryptographic wallet is the version of the company that provides the API service.\nThis underlines the need for a device designed in such a way as to be one of the peers in the blockchain network diagram (a node), without having to rely on a centralized server that gives API access to a node running as a service.\nFor this reason peakchain car wallet device aims to develop a hardware device capable of running a complete Cardano node and a wallet.\nTo understand the other aspects that this proposal aims to solve, it is necessary to introduce the concept of CAN bus. When we think of a vehicle we can think of it as a human body: The Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is the nervous system, which allows communication between the \"electronic control units ECU\" (for example the engine control unit, the airbags, audio system, etc.).\nCAN bus data logging is critical for several use cases: OEM prototype field testing, vehicle telematics, rare problem diagnostics, and more.\nUsually the CAN data of a vehicle / car is recorded on an SD card and in some cases uploaded via WiFi / 3G / 4G to a server.\nBringing the CAN bus network \"online\" exposes 4 critical system vulnerabilities:\n1) Most CAN bus data loggers record CAN data not encrypted but in raw form of \"bus recording\" which must be scaled to \"physical values.\" For these protocols, a large part of the data can be decoded directly using files J1939 standard DBC or OBD2 DBC.\nlogging unencrypted CAN data to an SD card should be seen can make the data content accessible to anyone with physical access to the SD card. (this means a risk both for the confidentiality of the data and for the authenticity)\n\n2) Recorded CAN data is often uploaded via WiFi / 3G / 4G / 5G to a server as part of a telematics system. If the data transfer is not encrypted, the data is exposed to remote attacks. (Examples of insecure transfer protocols include FTP or HTTP as opposed to SFTP and HTTPS)\n3) Saving data on centralized servers exposes the data to possible privacy issues (sensitive user data such as travel trajectory and personal data could be tracked or abused by the service provider) and security (server hakeraggio)\n4) CAN bus telematics also exposes the asset itself to attacks due to two features supported by many CAN loggers:\n-The ability to transmit data in the CAN bus (e.g. to request OBD2 data or control the asset via CAN commands)\n-The ability to receive firmware updates\nIf an attacker is able to deploy modified firmware on a CAN-based device, it opens up a wide range of possible attacks, incl. those critical to safety such as disabling the vehicle's brakes while driving.\nRegarding the vulnerabilities listed above, the Peakchain car wallet device effectively solves them.\nThe data is obtained in a raw output in a CAN Bus format, they are decoded in a human readable format using embedded software. The hardware is connected exclusively to Cardano thanks to the built-in sim card without the presence of centralized servers or SD memory cards (vulnerabilities 1.2 and .3). Finally, in a Blockchain-based structure, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), suppliers of software updates, and intelligent vehicles together generate an overlay network in which they can share data in a distributed way.\nThere can be different types of cloud storage in the overlay.\nThe first category is managed by the OEM and / or SW update provider and can be used to store the latest SW updates.\nThe second group includes storage that vehicle owners use to store vehicle data to receive specific services, e.g. cloud storage provided by vehicle insurance companies. To store the data, the vehicle owner provides his authentication metrics to authenticate anonymously to the cloud.\nAn attacker might attempt to attack the cloud storage and, consequently, manipulate the stored data to inject malware into a large number of vehicles, but the signed hash of the data stored in the cloud storage, as well as in the multisig transaction generated by the SW provider and the OEM protects vehicles from this attack.\nEven if an attacker tries to distribute a fake update claiming to be the supplier of the OEM or SW update this would not be possible.\nThe overlay nodes know the OEM's PK and the SW vendor. Therefore, the attacker cannot claim to be one of them as it requires the private key associated with the PK of the relevant entities (vulnerability 4).\nSources: https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-simple-intro-tutorial\nThe application domains are various; remote software update, insurance, electric vehicles, car sharing services, fleet management and ridesharing.\nUltimately the solution proposed by Peakchain will help unlock countless mobility solutions for exclusive use on the Cardano Blockchain: increasing retail users and improving the adoption of Cardano by car manufacturers and mobility service providers. It is therefore configured as a use case of great impact for the Cardano ecosystem.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer clearly knows the number of team members necessary for the implementation of the proposal\nhowever, for some roles (such as hardware design Engineering, UI / UX designer, card hardware integration, quality assurance and digital marketing) external profiles are indicated without providing the documentation relating to these profiles.\nThe team members, who have proven experience in software development, testing and quality, are part of a company duly registered in Germany as GmbH and certified by STQB which is the worldwide standard for the certification of skills in software and testing.\nThe proposer defines the technical aspects and technologies necessary to implement the proposal. Scrum will be used as an agile framework for managing the software development cycle, which will allow us to focus on the goal of delivering a finished product with a low time-to-market without sacrificing quality requirements.\nThe budget for this proposal is clearly delineated and in identifiable items, including hours of work and timing of the various stages of development. The salaries required for team members are slightly above average but still in line with the salaries received in Germany. \nHowever, one important thing should be emphasized, Peakchain has proposed 3 other proposals in fund 9. In many cases the weeks of work of the team members overlap. According to the proposer, if all the projects were funded, as a software consultancy company, Peakchain' team says they should have no problems in recruiting other external profiles with the same skills.\nThe costs indicated for some external profiles are high. In particular:\n$ 14,400 for Hardware Design Engineering ($ 90 hourly / rate). The average annual salary for hardware design engineering is 72808 euros per year in Germany for a senior figure. Which means 6067 euros per month as reported on https://www.payscale.com/research/DE/Job=Hardware_Design_Engineer/Salary\nthe cost indicated for a UX / UI designer is justified if he/she is a senior figure, but since the reference is not present it is not possible to verify it(https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Skill=User_Experience_(UX)_Design/Hourly_Rate)\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer provides an ordered list of what will be done for product development and the timing of implementation is well defined and measurable by the community (A Scrum board will be created in Atlassian JIRA Tool to track progress). At the end of the sprint phase, there will be a sprint review and a sprint report with relevant KPIs will be created.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2531", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 14332, "q0": "In this proposal, the existing company PeakSoft would like to equip vehicles with a Cardano node via an OBD2 port. This should allow the vehicle to send the data collected during a trip (speed, RPM, etc.) to the Cardano blockchain after the trip is completed. What would this be good for? The proposers see several reasons, all of which are interesting approaches but not completely convincing at their very core:\nFirst, they propose using the Blockchain as a protocol to push updates to the vehicle \"connecting cars to the Blockchain using a dedicated device and performing the updates in a decentralized way.\" In principle, I can imagine the device to be updated pulling a hash of the update from the Blockchain and only allowing an update when the update matches that hash. But these are just my thoughts on this - the proposal doesn't explain what this looks like. But again, there are a ton of issues (this doesn't protect from hardware access and just flashing a new firmware, also and update is only possible with fully synchronized node, etc.). \nThe second example is about insurance: The vehicle is supposed to write data on driving style directly to the blockchain in encrypted form. Sounds interesting, but this is only one entity reading the data (the insurance company). Having this information on the blockchain is only relevant in the event of a change of the insurance company, so that the new insurance company can ensure that the historical data has not been manipulated. This is a fundamentally legitimate application purpose, but it is also fraught with many questions: can't this be done more efficiently? Why does this have to be a blockchain for this?\nThus, 4 more examples follow, all of which are somewhat fuzzy. Basically, all the ideas have something going for them, but they are not fleshed out and are satisfied with terms like \"Decentralized\", \"Secure\" and \"Private\". The team here is trying to apply Cardano's existing technology to a problem domain without looking at the details:\nThe team wants to run a Cardano full node on an OBD2 device. I don't know if this is possible, but it could theoretically be. The problem with this, however, is that the full-node will also need to be updated and will grow in size. The requirement is around 100 GB at the current time, with huge growth rates over the next few years. Furthermore, a broadband Internet connection that is as permanent as possible is also required. Unfortunately, the issues are not even touched upon in the proposal.\nAlternatively, one could, of course, use a light wallet. This is a more realistic idea, which I could rather agree with. However, this idea is rejected for reasons of possible centralization.\nThe team thinks it makes sense to store every trip with all parameters on the blockchain. Under the optimistic assumption that one trip generates 100kB of data and one trip takes place per day. A vehicle consequently generates about 35 MB of data in a year. A small city with 10,000 vehicles about 350 GB of data. Does all this really need to be on the blockchain? One could now argue that there are layer-2 solutions, that one tries to keep the data extremely small or only writes hashes on the blockchain to then send the rest of the data to central servers in other ways. However, the proposal does not address this issue at all. Everything points to it as not even having been thought about.\nThe problem with this proposal is not the big idea, which may well be valid, but the specific details. These are completely concealed or ignored. For example, under \"Risks\" you only read about 3 challenges: Unsuitable team, too long development time and insufficient QA. This may be true, but wouldn't it be appropriate to mention that it could be problematic to operate a full node in a car and to keep it synchronized? Or that the amount of data could become too large, and one should perhaps rather look at a hybrid solution of blockchain and centralized server? \n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Based on the resumes, at first glance, the team has enough experience in different disciplines that one can be optimistic about the qualifications.\nA plan exists over 6 months with a finished product at the end. The total cost is $358,300 of which $50,000 is manufacturing prototypes and $40,000 is marketing. The rest of it is HR costs. Because of the technical challenges, I don't think it is realistic to develop a product in this time that could subsequently be produced for 50K or that would require a marketing budget of 40k. I assume rather that such a development needs 1 year or longer, and then you end up with something that you can demonstrate as POC.\nMy recommendation to the team: first develop a prototype with a lower budget, and then focus on a concrete application and present it - with all the technical details and difficulties. I don't think it's credible to claim a budget including marketing, production and staff for administrative work and accounting. I don't think the project can realistically be implemented in the form presented.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Several team members are Scrum Masters and have experience in QA field. Accordingly, an agile approach is proposed. Everything is very textbook: with sprints, boards, backlogs, reviews and reports. Sounds great - Unfortunately there is not anything to indicate if this information is also public. No other project progress is publicly viewable either.

We notice such innovation mainly because a wide range of possible problems to be solved arises with the adoption of this device, and all these problems (which were even mentioned in the proposal) concern situations that can be potentially optimized with safe and decentralized solutions. Thus, with the success of this project, several paths are possible and the potential positive impact for Cardano's ecosystem is real. In fact, the budget being requested is quite considerable, but we found factors that justify the amount, as we will describe further in the feasibility section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned above, one of the points that most brings confidence in the feasibility of the project is the real-world and wide-ranging problems that can be solved with the device. These problems were not only mentioned, but there are also proposals created by the same team that aim to solve some of them. In addition, the issues cited by the use cases are widely known and relevant. Clearly, the main scope of this project is technological development, with the need for highly qualified professionals to carry it out. And in this regard, we were able to find an exemplary team, composed of people belonging to a structured company and with excellent capabilities both in terms of development and monitoring of the product being created. Given the scope of the proposal, monitoring is especially important here, and in this aspect one of the team's strongest points seems to be precisely certifying the quality of the product being developed. In addition, the curricula of professionals were made available so that their experiences could be proven. As for the action plan for the construction of the device, we see that the activities are well planned and follow a good logical chain, starting from the product conception until reaching the validation and implementation stages, the document available with these stages is also quite organized. Regarding the details of the budget, we can say that the amount being requested is really considerable, but taking into account the applicability of the product we have that it is justified. In addition, we also need to take into account that the professionals are located in Germany, where professional costs are generally high. Still in this context, we have that for a project with this scope it is important to be concerned not only with labor expenses, but also with ways for the product to be publicized and in this regard we found a considerable amount of capital of $30,000 being allocated to marketing.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In line with all the organization presented so far by the project, we see that great metrics were chosen so that the evolution of the proposal was well monitored. We have mentioned the use of the Agile methodology and the use of the JIRA tool, which are some of the most used practices today for software development. It is also very interesting to see the use of user stories so that the product is well adapted to reality. Regarding the team's perception of success, the most important point seems to be the well-established deadline for the first product increment to be delivered, as well as the idea of always evolving the product backlog.
