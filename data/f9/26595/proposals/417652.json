The purpose of this proposal is to create and implement the Cardano ERP, as they referred an intelligent, robust, open-source, multi-national, enterprise and government-appropriate Tier 3 system that will seamlessly integrate all business and government-related transactions and reporting between modular dApps. With such an advance in the development in this Tier 3 system, there is no doubt that mass adoption by businesses and government would be inescapable. However, other ecosystems have also implemented or commenced similar technologies such as NEO 3.0 (you can look up NEO\u2019s ecosystem and develop teams for more information). In my opinion, a product needs more than just rationally function as an antidote for the market\u2019s need urgent to accomplish the state as the team mentioned \u201cMass adoption\u201d. In the question of what are the team\u2019s hindrances, poaching of core team members is a status-quo in this domain and I can see that the scheme on which the team will base to take action is considerably efficient. But I have to remind the team, that those have talented sometimes solely see wages as just a nagging, working environment, and attitude towards them will play a vital part in keeping them in place. Last but not least, we all know for a system to be treated as renowned and well-function needs lots of time and money, these are the obstacles every team has to encounter in this field but you guys can\u2019t last until then without an organized and clear scheme of time and money it will consume. Therefore, the team might want to provide investors with a glimpse of a profound plan about what the team will do with the money being funded. The impact of this supposition as my concern is tremendous but there remains some lack of clarifications to get 5 points in impact, as that being said, my score given to the team is 4.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the proposal fails to present not only the description of the team's skills and experience but also the reference to verify them. As part of the budget, they propose to hire people with relevant skills, but I would recommend to the team that at least one core team member should have a technical background. Budget-wise, practically the entire amount requested is intended for payment of professional hours, and in comparison, with other proposals within this challenge, the costs per hour are considered reasonable. Except for the expenses for legal and accounting, the team should be spending more expenses on that if they want the best services for the foundation. Therefore, I would also recommend that the proposer present the criteria used for cost allocation. the author of this proposal states that they would utilize an innovation stake-to-subscribe revenue model, and the team has to requestion for allowance to implement so to avoid further troubles. For future catalyst cycles, I recommend the team to take into consideration to provide a clear statement that these concerns were considered.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "With the metrics and outcomes proposed by the writer, we can see a considerable increase in the newcomers into the network. But, there are no KPIs that the proposal provides to understand how effective this project, in particular, has played a part in it. Also, they have a misconception about the audibility of the Impact category, this term state how success can be measured in the monetary system, not anything else assuming it will be a remarkable idea. There are no well-laid-out milestones for the auditors to track the progress and also unrealistic thresholds to measure the timely utilization of funds and their return on investment. A moderate amount of effort into laying down some plausible figures the auditors could use will make the proposal more practical and understandable. The team also makes no mention of its constituent members for the community to predict the outcomes of this project based on prior contributions to the ecosystem. And I may make some personal statements about the SDG, but those goals should be considered regularities, not something to be layout as pellicular or KPIs.

I believe there is a poor fit between the proposal and the existing challenge, and I shall bring forth two main arguments. Here they are. \n\nFirst, for me it is not clear what advantages such a system would bring, compared to classical accounting systems. My background includes accounting / financial matters, and I can\u2019t really be accused of not being knowledgeable with the subject. I am however at a loss when trying to imagine the features and benefits of a Cardano - native, or rather any blockchain - native accounting system. What would such an accounting system have on top of a regular one, will it be on-chain, will it provide cryptographic proofs of entries performed, or generally how will it differentiate itself from any other accounting system? The proposal does not shed any light on these topics, it only states that \u201cwe will scope the needs of stakeholders, then architect and deliver an MVP which meets scoped needs\u201d. This is a clear case when the proposers\u2019 level of understanding of stakeholders\u2019s needs is still incipient, and a much better understanding of the needs has to be gained before proposing such an undertaking.\n\nSecond, accounting systems are by definition country / regime specific. Each institution has to obey a certain framework when doing its books, be it US GAAP / IFRS standards for large institutions, or simply the country-specific accounting / tax rules from the place it resides, in case of small and medium enterprises. How would a Cardano native system account for all of this, will it have country-specific modules, will it be fully customisable? Will you be able to change accounting practices, tax brackets, VAT systems, amortization schedules? Again, the proposal stays silent and there is no meaningful information regarding these aspects. \n\nConsidering all of the above, and taking into account the many questions unanswered with regards to the value proposition, I have to maintain a slightly negative stance towards this proposa\u2019s impact. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I see a rather poor feasibility for this project. First, there are major red flags with regards to the team\u2019s description. The proposer states that the team members are experienced, and we are being asked to go through the resumes posted on their website in order to have more details. When doing this, I was very surprised, and not in a good way, to see that although there are quite a few resumes posted there (five), their quality is simply very very poor. All the names are anonymised with black markers (so you can\u2019t really know the names of team members!) and the information within all of them is again unclear, ineligible, the formats are all different, they look like they have been scanned with very old equipment, and the information within is likewise. Very bizarre names of companies, awkward backgrounds and universities and little information that you can actually verify. Of course we are not being provided with any linkedin links or other references. I hate to be judgemental, but this is a major red flag for me, that in an open, decentralized system, a team chooses this anonymization path. \n\nIn a similar fashion, we are not offered any kind of information with regards to the timeline or the budget. For the budget we are only informed that the project would require 1.000 hours to complete, at an hourly rate of 50 USD/hour, with a very vague split between tasks. There are other captions in the budget, but somehow it all seems very artificially built and i don\u2019t consider it as a trusted source to assess the project\u2019s viability, since you can hardly make any connections between the budget and the timeline. \n\nTimewise, the project would take five months to be complete, but given the poor level of detail the deadlines should be taken with a heavy grain of salt. For an excellent proposal I would have expected to see: \n\n- full names for the team and appropriate resumes\n- a better level of detail with regards to the product. How can the product be planned, designed and built in only one month? What will be the split of hours between the phases of the project, and how will quality be measured?\n- a pre-existing github library with past projects would be very useful.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "A fairly decent, but not perfect, level of detail is present within all the auditability sections, with a few sets of performance indicators to follow: number of developers using the tool, complexity of the transactions processed. For an excellent proposal I would have expected to see: \n\n- full transparency of the team behind the proposal\n- already opened communication channels: Discord, Telegram, Twitter\n- a commitment to open-source development\n- a commitment to have at least monthly development reports and regular AMA sessions \n- a pledge to participate in weekly town halls and organize break-out rooms\n\nLacking any of these items, I can only be neutral towards the auditability prospects of this proposal.

ERP is considered the most successful business and government solution in the world today. The integration of blockchain technology with the ERP system will be very promising. The author raises an important issue: \"There is no smart, open-source Cardano native ERP system to provide for seamless integration and optimized user experience as standard for centralized dApps. focus on business and government\". I find that the proposal meets the challenge requirement because it creates a Dapp on top of the Cardano ecosystem that solves all of those problems. In addition, the project will attract more open source ERP developer communities to Cardano to build, integrate and develop their products. That will attract more users and accelerate the growth of Cardano.\nAt the same time, I think the project's impact scale is relatively large. Enterprise systems software is a multi-billion dollar industry that produces components supporting various business functions. Occupying a crucial role for large, medium, and small enterprises. While in the world today, the number of large, medium and small enterprises is vast.

Furthermore, it is said that the software \u201eprovides seamless integration of businesses\u201c  and \u201eoptimal user experience\u201c.\nAlso, the steep thesis is put forward: \u201eMass adoption of Cardano by enterprises will likely not happen without there being an ERP system in place\u201d. These are very ambitious claims, but they are not supported by facts.\nIt is assumed that just because ledger technology is used in accounting, it logically belongs on the blockchain. I think this is a fallacy.\nThe reason that there is no ERP system based on blockchain yet is attributed to the fact that there have been scaling problems, transaction costs are too high and performance has been too low. This is all correctly analyzed! The only thing is that it is claimed that Cardano has now solved all these problems. This is not correct. From a practical perspective, it does not make sense to store all database transactions of an ERP application on the blockchain, neither today nor in 5 years. Among the reasons mentioned before, there are also privacy issues.\nFrom a technical perspective, there are misunderstandings on the part of the proposers as to what a blockchain can and cannot do. I would be less critical of the topic if the proposers mentioned this themselves - but they do not.

Accordingly, the team wants to attend Emurgo Academy courses. Only to then demonstrate an MVP of the product within 1-2 more months. This is highly unrealistic without specific prior experience. Furthermore, there are dozens of questions that are not answered: Where is the application hosted? What FE/BE technology will be used?\nThe budget breakdown of the estimated costs, on the other hand, is fair, but only cover the costs for 5 months.
