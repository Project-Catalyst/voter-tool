Through digital, the proposed team will propagate and reach the target audience using technology platforms such as: website, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and possibly TickTock. In addition, the group will also release books on related knowledge and books, two books are expected to be released, and there are also plans to release content in parallel with video, to serve those who have not. Conditionally, the team also announced its intention to raise capital by issuing native tokens, and revenue from book sales for the sustainable development of this idea. There are two risks that have been identified and all of them are. there are solutions to optimize them,\n* Through specific documents and plans and certainly announced by the team, this proposal is perfectly suited to the challenge. However, I would like to contribute some constructive comments to make the plan more perfect.\n- Firstly, on the issue of selling books, in my opinion, the group should not put all the content in the books that you want to sell on video, because that will be difficult to sell with the books and print. It can be a calculation to create scarcity for the product for the purpose of selling books.\n- second in the section of the group plan it is necessary to specify which areas the proposal will apply to the solution, i.e. the group needs to delineate the target area, or if the proposal is to be developed internationally, Therefore, the team needs to have a plan for removing the language barrier between the two subjects, the midwife and the pregnant mother. For example, if the mother tongue of these two subjects is not the same, it will be difficult to give advice or impart knowledge related to childbirth. that's an example if the proposal is intended to develop internationally, but otherwise the team needs to have statistics on the number of mothers of childbearing age and evidence for those statistics, i.e. target zone.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal team provided a detailed and detailed plan for the implementation of the idea. by having the symbols: O,H,W,C, based on these markers the group notes the work that is difficult, and the work that has been completed before and the work that has not been done, the tasks work in progress, in addition to examples of completed work with pictures. Overall a very solid and complete plan.\nIn parallel, the expenditures for the budget are also based on each work content mentioned in the roadmap, to attach the amount of money to be spent on that content, thus ensuring transparency and clarity for the project. every smallest expenditure,\n along with that information about the team is fully published, and related experiences such as medical doctor, midwifery. every member has been assigned the job to do according to the available member's own experience.\n So based on the documentation provided and the team's diverse medical experience I believe this proposal will be successful.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although there are community interactions with caregivers on social media platforms, the majority of work will also require the publication and support of the proposed team for the community to be able to monitor and control it. evidence, eg Number of critical cases recorded, Number of important cases resolved. so the team needs to have notes or statements that will support the community by making those metrics widely available on social platforms, or such periodic reports will ensure monitoring of the workload. resolved work of the proposal for community verification.\nsuccess goals are defined by the team in two as there are long-term goals for self-employment and revenue, while short-term goals are likely to impact the care and protection of the midwives. target.\nThus, based on the documents published by the group, the success of the proposal will be easily determined.

Specifically, it would be better if the proposal could touch on one use case and illustrate how such a solution would be much better than existing alternatives. The team themselves noted that the main beneficiaries are from lower income countries which has a higher corelation to lack of internet access, if web2 websites and solutions aren\u2019t serving this target demographic well, trying to get them to use web3 platforms would be even harder and less successful. It is an ambitious project which must be applauded but the benefits of using blockchain for many use cases aren\u2019t well articulated or convincing eg increasing the reach of midwives and rebalancing their workload will probably be better done on web2 rails given that many more people use it and is much cheaper and efficient to compute. Some aspects make more sense like utilizing NFTs to build a community. Some aspects are promising but need more development such as using the blockchain for health records. A health record is only useful if other medical professionals acknowledge its legitimacy and use the data for medical decision making, if it is deemed as untrustworthy (Who recorded the data? What are their credentials? Are they legally certified?), then the medical community will probably disregard the data for fear of inaccuracy or lawsuits. Such projects can always be improved and while not perfect, still worth funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This is probably one of the most detailed plans for timelines and budgets and it can be seen that the team is passionate and committed to bringing their plans to reality.

Besides advanced medicine, midwives around the world are still actively bringing babies, young generations, and future generations into the world (preventing 80% of pregnancy-related deaths). However, midwives have not received attention due to obstacles in their work. Here, it is proposed to move towards the development of a digital platform, to increase the accessibility of mothers and midwives for knowledge sharing and governance, with the goal of reducing mortality, in reproductive health.

At the same time, detailed budgets are analyzed over 3 timelines (in 3 months) to support easy and transparent audits.

Specifically: Number of books opened on the website; The number of NFTs requested; Number of midwives referred; Number of followers on social networks; users download Lace wallet; Animation is pushed to Arweave, then KYC, DID, SSI are generated etc. Which means we have multiple ways to test this project.
