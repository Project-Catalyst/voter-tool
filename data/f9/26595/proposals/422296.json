I\u2019m rather surprised to see a Catalyst proposal coming from jpg.store because the most dominant service provider within the largest volume industry in the Cardano ecosystem is most likely the most profitable organization in the community. That been said, the impact section is an opportunity to provide voters with a clear sense of cost-impact ratio to determine if this proposal is more valuable to the ecosystem than other Catalyst proposals. In this case, the proposal only provides what the proposers intend to create but it doesn\u2019t explain what value this would provide. I would suggest providing information about the number of existing users on the platform, the growth rates of platform/industry adoption, and some form of research that demonstrates how these kinds of features could grow the greater ecosystem (perhaps with displays of modeling evidence from other ecosystems). For a rather expensive proposal that could otherwise fund 5 more average priced Catalyst proposals (that might not have the cashflow to fund their proposals), I think voters will want to see more substance here as to what value this provides and why the funds are best spent here. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "For lack of thoroughly displayed information on development team capability and spending efficiency, I rank this section a 2. While it\u2019s likely obvious to most that there is a capability of this team to produce a product that is usable by the masses, this proposal does not thoroughly prove it by providing core team qualifications, names, and resumes. The proposal only provides a link to the website that displays team pseudonyms, Twitter links, and no LinkedIn profiles (which is standard practice in Catalyst fund proposals). The roadmap is a functional display of how long the proposal would take to reach completion but it doesn\u2019t leave voters with a sense of efficiency that can tie well into the budget section. The best proposal roadmaps breakdown each task according to macro timeframe AND hours of labor needed. This budget isn\u2019t thorough enough to give voters a sense of confidence in the proposal spending funds efficiently and responsibly. This proposal could greatly benefit from a further breakdown of the budget as allocated according to hourly rates and hours of labor needed as well as more definition of what is included in the \u201coverheads\u201d category. If voters are left with the information given in this proposal, they would likely determine inefficiency in spending as $3500/week comes out to $70/hr evenly split between 5 developers (if you assume full time hours). At this rate, this translates to a yearly $136k that well exceeds industry standard in many areas (unless working at major corporate tech companies). I think these concerns can easily be aided with further breakdown and definition. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "For omitting the specific KPIs that will be measured from data collected from beta testers, I rank this section a 2. I give this section a little credit, as I assume the proposer has particular KPIs/metrics/data in mind when they indicate beta testing feedback and feature testing. However, without explicitly identifying these metrics, voters are not left with a clear understanding of what the team is evaluating pre-launch. I would suggest also including metrics measure post-launch, as this is where the actual impact of the proposals approval manifests itself. The best proposals take that extra step to quantify these metrics to display to voters that there is a specific level of impact that is being aimed at for this proposals approval (bonus points for setting progressive metrics at different milestones in the future of the project), which enables greater confidence in voter perception of cost-impact. Overall, I think this proposal displays an innovative idea that lacks the presentation that voters will expect for an expensive request from a top-tier Cardano project.

The challenge brief includes \"Novel and viable applications and products get built on top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.\" Considering the recent growth in NFT projects on Cardano, which by some reports make up about 40% of the projects building on Cardano, and the success of jpg.store to become the most used NFT marketplace on Cardano this proposal can help to onboard a new wave of NFT artists and NFT enthusiasts. By making it easier and cheaper to launch an NFT project on Cardano than on other competing chains, this proposal may also help to bring existing NFT artists onto Cardano from other competing chains. However, I think the largest impact will be in bringing new users to learn how to launch their first NFT project. This proposal can easily scale with increasing adoption and users. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is known by the Cardano community and while most of them are sudo-anonymous with only twitter profiles and aliases listed on their team page, they are accessible to the community, and are well known to be able to deliver a high quality NFT marketplace, so it is also very likely they have the skills and experience to deliver on this proposal. The budget is clear, and broken down into employee costs and overhead categories. It could be refined with some more details but I think this is acceptable for the company to generalize the labour cost and time required to build out the proposal. There is a detailed plan included with specific features that will be delivered. The jpg.store website includes individual NFT minting service, and they have already announced that large NFT collection minting services will be available soon, so this shows me they are capable and confident they can deliver this proposal and that they are probably already working on this solution. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal includes a specific timeline of 8 weeks, with key deliverables included. There is limited reporting to the community during the development process, but this will be straightforward to audit after completion and launch of the service, as the final product and deliverables are clearly defined in the proposal. It would be nice to see the team commit to specific reports or development updates produced weekly and provided to the community, but considering the scope of this project I'm not sure that would be necessary for this 8 week project. I believe the community can audit the success of this easily after the 8 week period. The KPI's would be to audit the process and insure the process includes all the stated features in the proposal such as the metadata standard and a low tech simple solution to turn layer files into an NFT collection minted on Cardano and stored on IPFS services.

Indeed, the NFT space is very technical and costly for most CNFT projects, who particularly do not possess the necessary infrastructure to launch their own NFT collection. To date, minting services, metadata generation sites and art generation platforms are highly scattered and less integrated in the Cardano ecosystem. This raises the barrier of entry for NFT creation significantly as project founders/artists may find themselves overwhelmed by various other tasks, instead of doing what they do best. \n\nThe proposed solution has communicated clearly that it intends to lower barriers of entry of launching NFT collections on Cardano for all aspiring non-technical people by providing a one-stop, integrated service for all aspects of NFT creation. Should this be a success, I foresee this service to be a great addition to the Cardano ecosystem as it introduces more use-cases that can be used by virtually anybody of any background. \n\nAfter understanding the proposed solution, I am certain this is an impactful proposal with metrics and goals aligned to the challenge. The CNFT space is a thriving space with growing recognition from the crypto community worldwide. Having an integrated service which covers all aspects of NFT creation and minting will significantly drive mass adoption further. However, I think the proposal lacks clarity in this regard as there should be quantifiable metrics for the Catalyst community to objectively gauge the impact of this proposal. This will be explained more in the latter section (refer section 2 & 3 of assessment). \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I am certain this proposal is feasible as the team is the backbone of  the leading CNFT marketplace platform. The success of the marketplace showcases the team\u2019s resources and technical capabilities. Plus, the team has demonstrated confidence in the aspect of artwork generation. This conveys a reliable and productive team. \n\nHowever, one reason I deem this proposal to be less feasible than it is supposed to be is down to the reason that the proposal does not address the background, experience of the 5 core members. The only information given on the team is \u201c4 engineers and 1 UX/UI designer\u201d. There is a significant lack of explanation as readers are left wondering what will the 5 core members be doing to materialise this proposal. By doing so, the team has missed out on one of the most crucial aspects determining the feasibility of all Catalyst proposals. Without clear explanation on the 5 core members, it is hard for readers of various backgrounds to gauge if the team has enough talents to work on the project, hence negatively impacting feasibility. I also have the same issue with the budget breakdown of this proposal. Although the requested amount is reasonable, the amount provided is very superficial. For example,employee costs of $14,000 / week, how will the $14,000 be distributed, what will it be used for, has it accounted for the possibilities of requiring extra staff? Ideally, we would have a breakdown of pay rates of the 4 engineers and 1 UX/UI designer so that readers can compare their pay rates and measurable benchmarks such as industry rate and task difficulty. \n\nRegarding timeline, I think it is reasonable, given there are several one-stop integrated services the likes of what the team proposed in other chains as references. What\u2019s left is mostly on integrating services provided with the respective vendors, whilst ensuring its workability in the Cardano ecosystem. Again, I would suggest the team to provide more clarity in their timeline. For example, under the umbrella of core functionality development, what would be done, when it would be completed, who would be in charge, and how it would be done? Such information is essential for readers to gauge the scale of this proposal with more objectivity. \n\nI think the team has identified the appropriate risk, that being product usability as the proposal targets non-technical individuals. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "As a whole, I find this project to be less auditable. The roadmap has no clear deliverables and milestones. Sure, all aspects of the project are said to be tested in a modular manner and having beta testers for feedback. Question is, what would be tested, and would updates be provided by the team as the project progresses? \n\t\nThe identified metrics/KPIs focus on usability being the success of this proposal. This is a relevant KPI. But, the measures given in this proposal are highly subjective. What does it mean by \u201cempowered enough\u201d? To me, this is not the most useful indicator as everyone has varying technical capacity, tolerance levels, workflows and experiences. For one person to feel \u201cempowered\u201d does not mean the same for the others. There are so many variables determining usability, such as product\u2019s user friendliness, users\u2019 satisfaction score, time needed from art generation to NFT minting etc. Should this proposal be funded, I strongly suggest the team define \u201cempowered enough\u201d in a more quantifiable, objective manner for auditability. \n\nThat aside, I believe there\u2019s a clear description of problem and the solution in conjunction with the proposal. \n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2729", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6483, "q0": "There are not a lot of tools for easy onboarding into the CNFT community.
