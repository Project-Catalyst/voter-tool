I like they provide an example on it, making the visualization of the platform easy, specially for those  not familiar with prediction market. Proposal also fits in well the challenge as it creates a new product that uses cardano blockchain, helping to address challenge kpis such as \"Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\"\nIn regard to its value proposition, indeed, being in Cardano ecossytem since 2020, I've never seen a predicion market solely based on Cardano so far. Having one like this can help boost Cardano adoption and amplify its use cases, specially as prediction or betting market are growing fast. it is also stated what will be the advantages of this market when compared to other descentralized/blockchain prediction markets, as it leveres Cardano structure and its embeded technical features. My main advice here is for when communicating/marketing the platform and showing the advgantages of this Cardano-based market, to not to be so technical in the approach/communication, to reach people outside de-fi/Cardano world- but this is not after project launch.\nLast, regarding the risk, the technical and managerial ones are really well identified and mitigated properly. One thing I'd add here is regarding the reputational risks inherently present on this type of markets that receives critcism (and here I'm not talking about any type of prediction market, not particular for this proposal or blockchain). the point here it is that it can generate controversial incentives, such as estimulating assassinasion market (so people can earn money with this predicion). A mechanism to avoid this kind of market generation would be much welcomed to avoid this kind of critics.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a timeline with the sequence main activities, in a good level of details and the duration in days.

And a lot of people are losing interest in holding assets when they do one wrong decision of buying/selling, especially in times of recession or panicking times. Therefore, a prediction market could assist these users who do not have substantial expertise to assess the demand/supply themselves. This might help users develop a sense of confidence in holding assets FT or NFT, it will also help a lot of newcomers get used to trading rather than blindly transacting and losing most of their capital right in the beginning. The CONVEX project has been designed with sustainability and transparency as primary goals The author also mentions of the various challenges that might impede the development process and have done a commendable amount of spade work already in that direction to mitigate them effectively.

Other aspects of the proposal, however, are information-deficient. The plan falls short in outlining the composition of the team that would work on it and the expertise they would provide. Although the deliverables are clearly defined, the breakdown of workload and associated budget looks a little too vague with no room for any contingency, and the per day charge for the developer is way above the standard pay. It can be understood that the developer is Jann Muller himself, but the entire development process dependent on one person would have a lot of bottleneck issues if he is unable to work for a few days. But if the third party is involved to assist the development process in such a case, the pay seems overestimated. Hence a dainty more information regarding how the work shall be divided and which the third party will be assisting the project would help readers establish the overall production image. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "This proposal offers readers and assessors useful indicators for each of the deliverables in addition to being significant and practicable. Every part of the plan has distinct deadlines and milestones, which makes auditing considerably simpler. The viable metrics such as tracking through Git commits during development, customer engagements on the release of the first beta, and financial reports at the end are all sensible and easy to assess. However, community members who are unaware of technical knowledge would appreciate monthly reports or regular development announcements over some media channels. The CONVEX token's popularity and trading volume would be the eventful indicator to estimate the customer satisfaction and acceptance of the prediction market. The successful deployment of the CONVEX on the Cardano mainnet would be the eventual goal and evidence of the successful completion of the proposal.

The main risk for successful delivery arises from delays due to underestimation of the complexity of the work performed. The specific delay came from the need to find a developer for UI and UX work.

There is also technical documentation available with everything about this project. CONVEX adds a new type of DeFI app to the cardano ecosystem. Such a market does not yet exist for Cardano. The advantage is that CONVEX would be completely open source. This would lower the barrier for new people in the Cardano ecosystem. A large list of risks for the future has been made.

According to the proposers, there is a lack of prediction markets on Cardano which will let people buy/sell shares in the outcomes of future events, with the share price indicating the odds & acting as an important signal. I agree with the problem raised and think the noble idea of building CONVEX - the first operational prediction market on Cardano which is truly decentralized for everyone to participate as no central authority is required is a vision that we all at Cardano community are envisioning for. This solution effectively addressed the problems and is clear to understand. Furthermore, the thorough plan also elaborates on why the team believes their solution is essential. This fits into the challenge setting and, if executed, would have a significant influence on the community and the future of Cardano.

Furthermore, the fact that he is standing behind his idea with his name gives it greater weight and legitimacy. It's clear that he has an idea of the team he'll need to bring together to make the proposal a success, but I'm left wondering if he's found them yet. The role of a Community manager does not have a name on it, although there is a brief presentation of her expertise and competency, I can\u2019t find any references related to verify her. However it is a good point that the proposer clarify the role of UI developer which is open, what quality this position will require and its responsibilities. A clear roadmap for the proposal's implementation is indicated, as well as the steps that would comprise the full project. The authors describe exactly what would happen in a certain time frame. It is usually crucial to design a timeline of activities to be accomplished and establish milestones which are achievable. The budget of $150,000 could be described better.There is some breakdown per task, but no justification is provided for the specific sums. To explain the enormous sum of money requested, I expected hourly rates and the number of working hours for development to be included. Since there will be challenges and the proposers have mentioned them in the proposal and have thought them through already, it\u2019s good that they prepare for the unexpected happening but more detail on how the money destined to the Contingency will be used will surely build extra confidence in voters.

Furthermore, the proposal includes a link to a GitHub repository, allowing the community to track the project's progress along the way. They establish success metrics which I consider to be relevant such as users, community members, revenue generated for $CONVEX holders, TVL, etc. Unfortunately, information is too brief to enable a thorough comprehension of what is intended for results. If possible, the team might try to quantify them. Some costs are not broken down into components. For example, the infrastructure and operational costs of $15,000 are considerable and not appropriately justified. Additionally, I would advise the proposers to be concerned with drawing definitions of success based on the passage of time, in order to directly exercise auditability.

The proposal is in line with the problem that you don't have any prediction markets on Cardano. I agree because I recognize the importance of decentralized market prediction. Because it allows anyone, anywhere, anytime to trade and create markets based on any outcome. It not only allows themselves to participate in prediction markets, but also speculation in general. For example, if you're in the developing world, it's hard to get exposure to US stocks. But with the decentralized market, anyone, anywhere can gain exposure to any asset by trading in the prediction market for its future value. They also let the participants create their own marketplace. An example of the benefit of market prediction is that market prediction not only extracts existing knowledge, but also promotes the production of new knowledge. For example, weather prediction markets can spur meteorologists to develop improved forecasting models. Prediction markets make knowledge creation and disclosure competitive and valuable. Therefore, I really believe that your CONVEX project idea is good. Besides, I find your suggestions very detailed.
