Cardano in a multilingual environment and became more serious with the rise of different PAB platforms, each written in different languages.\n So potential users are developers who are building Cardano DApps, tools, and extensible infrastructure. They are missing a common configuration language for different languages. Thus the proposed output is a configuration language that can provide a reliable code generator targeting a number of different language / PAB environments.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The solution was to build a configuration language for use in Cardano DApps. This language maintains correctness and compatibility between different language/PAB environments.\nThe core team consists of 3 people:\nSean Hunter has expertise in the philosophy of language and logic. He is a Haskell developer who has experience working on Cardano DApps and infrastructure projects at MLabs.\nVlad Posmangiu Luchian is a software engineer working with Haskell. At Mlabs, Vlad is responsible for designing and delivering various types of DApps including DEXs, Oracles and NFT Marketplaces.\nDrazen Popovic is an information security software engineer. Drazen is a Cardano developer, with experience working on several Cardano DApps across the Haskell, Purescript, and Nix language environments.\nSo looking at the experience and education of the core team of the proposal, we see that the team is fully capable of ensuring a successful project launch.\"\n The main source of the project's revenue is revenue from providing a configuration language that can generate a reliable code generation tool for different language/PAB environments, helping Cardano DApps developers, Extensible tools and infrastructure make work easier.\n There is a risk the proposal may run into that API crashes will be common when projects are currently in active development. However, the team has also shown how to fix it.\n The proposal outlines progress and milestones by month with specific tasks to be completed. However, the team should further break down the timelines along with the tasks that need to be completed, this will make it easier for the team to check the progress of their work.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The total required budget of the proposal is $115200, which is a suitable budget to kick off a project on building a config language that increases compatibility between different language/PAB environments for development.

In addition, the budget is explained in detail, specifically for each item of the project, calculated for each number of hours, showing that the proposed group is very close to reality. However, the budget analysis should explain more clearly about the amount per hour, the number of hours for the work should be divided into smaller and more detailed to increase financial transparency for the project. .", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2280", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5300, "q0": "This really important interoperability tooling proposed by MLabs is a classic \"Developer Ecosystem\" proposal, and would have fit perfectly in such a challenge setting. It aims to make the lives of virtually all dApp developing teams easier by reducing the need for cross-language type definitions, for example when integrating web- or mobile-facing applications with the PAB. The reason this proposal is a good fit for Dapps, Produvts & Integrations in my opinion is two-fold. First, by requesting around 1.5% instead of 12% of the total budget available, they voluntarily compete in a \"harder weight class\" (boxing analogy). Without the protection of going into the dev exclusive challenge, they help other developers get funded in the \"easier\" specialist challenge. Second, as this proposal mainly benefits the ease of dApp development, it has potential to become a great boost to the total universe of available dApps on Cardano, which is exactly what is set as the goal of this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal budgets 1440 work hours, including 60 for change requests and 60 hours for preliminary research, at a rate of $80/hour for a core team of three MLab devs who are experts in the field of Haskell, Plutus, PureScript and Plutarch. Their experience also covers important dApp directions for interoperability requirements such as oracles, dexes, frontend, backend, bridges and cross-platform package management.\nThe hourly rate seems to be a market or below-market rate for the experience of the developers, and the time should be sufficient to finish the project as described, although the scope is probably not yet fully understood and has to be defined during the 60 hour research that have been budgeted for.\nThis proposal uses embedded references very well, and it is possible to read about all the technical aspects in external links or by the company's own Github repositories and pages provided.\nThe budget and timeline, skills required and provided, and the extensive portfolio of previous projects that MLabs have successfully completed make the delivery of the proposed solution highly likely.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Six distinct KPIs are defined that cover the implementation, delivery and community feedback. By providing the Github links and proposing a common social circle to address risks for example API breakages during the project implementation, I assess the proposer's as highly transparent and proactive. This is a positive sign for the auditability and willingness to communicate and update on the progress of the proposal. The close work relationship that MLabs have with IOG will also be useful in the transparency and smooth implementation of this proposal, as a lot of the infrastructure that will be affected is still being maintained by Input Output.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2687", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6720, "q0": "The value proposition here is to develop a language agnostic tool to help with specifying data types and producing common use libraries for popular languages and development environments. So while this proposal does not set out to create an application itself, it aims to create a tool that makes it easier in the future for such applications to be built.  This proposal therefore fits very well within the challenge, since our goal here is to build products that will increase the possible real use cases within the Cardano ecosystem and increase adoption amongst the general population.\n\nLike other Mlabs proposals, this is a niche project, without an obvious end product in mind that the general Cardano user can relate to, but it can definitely turn into a backbone piece of enabling infrastructure that can boost future dapps being built faster, quicker and perhaps in a more secure way thanks to existing and curated libraries. \n\nThere is definitely a strong case to be made for funding such a fundamental project with excellent scalability fundamentals.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project\u2019s timeline is very simple, three months in total. The first month would focus on studying relevant technologies, schema definition systems, data models and generally the way they are built. Further, a schema validation tool would be developed and the connection with Plutus would be made through an API. The second month would focus on generating the code, starting with Haskell and Purescript environments. The last month would see refinements being done, running tests to ensure compatibility and integration with existing tools (Nix, Cabal). Finally, a demo dapp would be built just as a final proof of concept.    \n\nThe MLabs team is very extensively presented into the proposal, and let me offer just a flavor of their competencies and background: with a team of over 80 devs and as a company that are an IOG Plutus partner, they have already been involved in plenty of Cardano projects, with the most known ones perhaps being  Sundae swap and Liqwid. An excellent point of the proposal is that the core team for this specific proposal is extensively presented within the proposal itself, including links to their github pages, thus making it easy to verify certain things and generally obtain a better view of the team\u2019s skills and background. But to be more specific, the core team here would be composed of Sean, Vlad and Drazen, all of them software engineers with excellent bios presented within the proposal. \n\nThe budget is reasonable in my opinion, since they are asking for a modest amount considering the highly skilled competencies required. The entire project is estimated to take around 1440 engineering hours (thus full time work for the three team members, at 80 USD/hour rate). There is also a very small \u201cchange budget\u201d of 60 hours included which we don\u2019t really know what it accounts for, being most likely a buffer for admin work. \n\nOverall a very solid proposal with excellent feasibility prospects.

Of course, the most relevant one being the final prototype built with the use of their tools. \n\n\nBeing a rather technical team, it is perhaps understandable that opening up communication channels is not their greatest strength - neither the proposal nor their website offer any indication that dedicated Twitter / Telegram / Discord channels exist for the enthusiasts to get in touch with them more easily than to send an email, but perhaps this aspect will be improved in the future if enough demand emerges from the Community. This is just a noteworthy point, but definitely not one that can by itself detract us from the clear message that the proposal has a five star auditability potential.

Interoperability is critical because it reduces the time, effort, and expense of data collection. It also reduces the risks associated with handling incomplete or inconsistent data, among other benefits, with development teams being the target audience. As the development ecosystem continues to grow, and different teams around the world begin to build different solutions on top of Cardano, solutions like the one proposed by MLabs will become more and more essential. In a few words, they want to solve this problem in a single configuration language that can be taken as a reference to feed the different languages and PAB environments used today, with this, they want this solution to become in the medium term the default choice for Cardano DApp developers. When contrasting the purpose and metrics of the proposal with the Challenge setting, I find a clear alignment with it since it seeks to solve a problem that every development ecosystem that seeks to grow exponentially must solve.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed implementation plan clearly outlines all the actions that will be implemented during the 3 months for which this proposal is projected to last; the description of these actions is understandable and relevant to achieving the proposed goal. The budget was clearly divided into 5 clearly identifiable items, these are divided according to the type of work to be performed and are complemented by the estimated hours for each work package. As a comment of improvement for future proposals, I would have liked to understand in more detail the amount and estimated hours per type of specialty needed to carry out the project. However, considering that MLabs is behind this proposal, and they are easily the most relevant conglomeration of developers we have in Cardano today, I have no doubts about the feasibility of this project.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team anticipates that the outcome of the successful implementation of this solution will result in initial adoption by small to medium sized Dapps development teams. There is a clear description of the expected success, and this addresses the problem stated previously. Of course, as a consequence of that first state of adoption, the team expects the rest of the ecosystem to take this solution as the Go-to for building on Cardano. The metrics presented are equally well defined, they address all edges of the problem to be addressed, as well as I find them easy to measure. The only point that is not clear to me is which channels the community can use to consult the progress of the project. However, I would assume that it will be available in the set of repositories that they currently have on GitHub.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15280, "q0": "According to the proponent, the lack of a language agnostic mechanism to specify the types used in Cardano Dapps reduces interoperability in multiple languages. So they propose a configuration language to specify DApp schemas. The language uses a code generator, which uses a schema that generates 'type libraries' (aka. Typelibs) for different language/PAB environments. Each typelib is created with support libraries to handle encoding, serialization, and other essential operations. All mentioned processes are automated, maintaining correctness and compatibility between different language/PAB environments. This proposal is not intended to create an application, but it is intended to create a tool that will make it easier to build such applications in the future. If this project is successful it will radically increase developer productivity, while reducing the amount of unnecessary, error-prone, and boilerplate code that needs to be written and managed manually. This proposal is therefore well-suited to the challenge, as our goal is to build products that increase the real-world use cases possible within the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I like the feasibility of this project. Regarding the implementation plan, the proponent divides the time into 3 months, stating what activities will be developed in each month. This is very active, so we have a very clear view of the process\nNext is the budget, the proposal asks for $115,200. The proponent broke the budget by providing the working hours of each task, the total execution time of the tasks included in the project is 1440 hours (including 60 standby hours) which equates to $80 /H. I think this is a reasonable number.\nAnd finally, the project team, Mlabs, proposed to provide some background information about the MLabs teams and their various projects.
