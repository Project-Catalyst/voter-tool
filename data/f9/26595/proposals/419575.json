The proposal is likely to have a positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem, as it is the continuation of RootsID, the first Open Source Identity Wallet on Cardano. \n\nGiven the importance for Cardano's success to have the best Identity Wallet, I think Catalyst should keep supporting RootsID in its development. The produced code will be open-sourced. Documentation will be provided with build and run guidelines and tutorials. I think this proposal addresses the challenge effectively. 5/5.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers provided a short description of who will work on the project,Esteban Garc\u00eda and Rogelio Blanco, including their roles, experiences (Developer, Solution Architect, Data engineer and QA Engineer.), and past work. They have successfully completed past Catalyst proposals in FUND 6 to 8. There is therefore confidence that the team can bring this proposal to term.\n\nThe budget is outlined clearly and broken down into identifiable items (Research, Design, Implementation, Testing and Documentation) with a list of actionable tasks and time to completion.\nThe budget ($9900) and the timetable (12 weeks) seem to be reasonable to achieve the set goals. Given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a clear and detailed roadmap and a time horizon for achievement. The KPI that defines the success of the proposal is pretty straightforward (delivering a complete, tested, and documented open-source solution that covers the functionality presented in this proposal.).

Identity wallet infrastructure is critical to an effective SSI ecosystem and the WAL-CLI and Rootswallet projects are the leading ID wallet projects in the Cardano ecosystem. So this project to build the infrastructure to connect the two is clearly within the scope of the summary challenge to position Cardano as a leader in the SSI space. This project very effectively tackles the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team developed Wal-Cli after being funded by fund7&8. Therefore, the team is qualified and experienced in carrying out the project with success. Links have been provided showing past work as well as their videos. Regarding the implementation plan, the project will be implemented in 12 weeks. A detailed weekly timetable with detailed tasks provided seems reasonable and feasible. The $9,900 required budget is broken down by hours worked/task, so we understand very well what the costs are going to be spent on. The team clearly states that the nature of the project is technical and that implementing the project is risk-free as they feel very comfortable as far as their technical abilities are concerned. Therefore, I think the feasibility of the project is not up for debate.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "This is the shortest part of the proposal, but I think it has enough data to track the progress of the project. The proposal team provides a GitHub repository in which all code will be hosted for the proposal. Previous implementations can be seen as creating confidence that this proposal will follow the same path to ease of audit for the community and also a good source of knowledge to learn from. The team mentions a progress update where the community can easily follow and discuss the project https://github.com/HERE-id/wal-cli/discussions/categories/general. The project's success in matching the infrastructure takes it to the next evolutionary step in the identity space.

This is a necessary requirement for broader adoption of DID technology, and it will take some time to build and develop all the necessary components. The community of PRISM developers would benefit significantly from the results of this and previously funded WAL-CLI projects. The proposer has effectively communicated the relationships between the previous proposals and the current one that focusses on the application for instutions and organizations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers clearly have the relevant background and skills to build the WAL-CLI extension, and have shown this with the already delivered projects from previous funds.

The proposal clearly details the risk that the Atala PRISM SDK is not yet fully public, and possibly subject to change, but that the risk is sufficiently mitigated because the Atala PRISM team has offered access to their pioneer program. It is noted that the success of this project will be determined by delivering a complete, tested, and documented open-source solution that covers the functionality presented in the proposal, but an additional KPI would be how much developers are using the tool, or maybe easier to measure the number of github forks.
