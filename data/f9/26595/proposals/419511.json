Here people can chat and discuss environmental issues and proposed solutions. The creation of educational videos and infographics about sustainable business models that provide answers to solutions, focusing on Health, Nutrition, Climate, Society and environmental issues ... for people to interact and be educated about solutions that impact society. Enabling the Cardano community to join and become a decentralized business providing solutions to global warming, securing food and ending malnutrition while promoting acceptance and awareness about Cardano.

In addition, the proposed team also cooperates with projects that have an impact on Cardano such as Cardano4Climate, Climate Neutral Cardano, and SustainableADA....this shows the desire and direction of the proposed group. There is a roadmap with timeframes provided for 3 months. We know how long the whole project will take and what to expect each month. The activities involved are accounted for and we know well what will happen in each subsequent month, i.e., our visualization of the process is pretty solid. As for the budget, the proposal asks for $14,820, and we have a good understanding of the details of how that money is divided. I think the value is not high, compared to other proposals, but it is still basic that we understand the need for this amount, as it is done. And finally, about the project team, which is 3 members, and based on what was provided I think this is a well-qualified team, and details are given on what they can help ensure about bringing the development outlined in this proposal to success.

I like a lot this idea sustainability is an each time more present topic in society, and governments and companies are engaging a lot in such agendas. If Cardano can develop the right tools and soolutions for this, its adoption will increase rapidly. But first, of course, it is necessary to educate people on these subjective, incentivize and its dissemination, so the good ideas can come. In this sense, proposal fits in the challenge as it  can increasie the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, one of the challenge kpis.

A further suggestion on content, I'd include dicussions around methodologies to quantify and track impact measurements such as CO2eq reductions, energy savings, LCAs, etc. one of the big challenges nowadays is to have these metholodios standaized ans accepted globally and blockchain can play a big role on that, specially as a trusting way to keep track  on them and possible trading (such as in Carbon credit markets).\n\nMy rate is 5 as I believe proposal may present a great impact on Cardano, enviroment as a whole and on addressing challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The  timeline for this project has good milestones and is divided by months.
