Furthermore, there are some extra documents in this proposal presenting the teams and their previous experiences in Funds.\n\nThe plan seems to be review in detail, with clear tasks to accomplish (integrations phases that are the key points are perfectly described). The crowdfunding platform will directly benefit from the plan and could be used in the future as a \u201ccase of use\u201d for further projects in the ecosystem.
