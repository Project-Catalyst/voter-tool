After execution of successful product design in the form of Tent, which boasts a trading history of 3 million Ada and 10,000 assets, an obstacle to wider adoption was identified. Namely that people looking for a trade had no place to find trading partners outside of Discord. The proposed solution is to design a platform where trades can be advertised and executed in a manner that provides much greater exposure to assets and individual would like to trade, or trade for. The impact on the cNFT community could be quite significant, and this proposal aligns nicely with strategic funding goals of adoption and integration. Challenge met.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the successful delivery of Tent, this project seems to be exceedingly feasible. The experience of the team only serves to bolster that observation. One possible minor concern would be that the budget indicated in the proposal is $3000 less than the sum total of the five line items it contains. It may be necessary to request a small level of funding next round, or not, but that does not significantly change the assessment which identifies this project as on with a high likelihood for success.  A seven person team on a project this size instills great confidence.

Please take this a respectful, constructive criticism as one of the roles of project assessor is to advice proposers on ways to improve the quality of proposals and their chances of gaining funding. Another helpful suggestion would be to state where constant updates will be reported and what specific metrics will be used. These criteria are essential to Project Catalyst auditability and verification proceedures, and help facilitate the disbursements of monies following successful voter approval for funding. On the whole, the project has merit and reasonably good feasibility scores, and this assessment concludes that the determining factors in funding this project should not be unduly influenced by this one section alone.

So the solution is to provide A platform & community where collectors can post NFTs they are willing to trade, specifying ADA or other NFTs they are interested in, and allow them to connect and trade in a trustless system (Tent). The problem and solution statement presented by the proponent is clear and consistent with the spirit of the Challenge Summary", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is relative, some parts are suitable, and others can be improved. We know what will happen in great detail: in one part of the roadmap, the proponent divides the time into 6 phases, which are carried out for months and over several weeks, stating what activities will be developed in each of them. This is very active, so we have a very clear view of the process. Regarding the financial amount, we know how the total amount will be divided into large parts such as Research, Planning & Strategy, UX & UI Design, Front & Front Development Back End.... but each of them could be further explained. For example, how long will this process take, who will do it, and what are the salaries of the parties involved? And finally the project team, the strength of this proposal is the transparency provided behind the background and related skills of the proposal.

Too many market places for CNFTs may dilute liquidity, but the peer-to-peer character of the Tent and the innovations that the team want to develop to match buyers and sellers have the potential to meaningfully diversify the landscape and also possibly contribute to keeping fees of smart contract driven platforms in check.\nBy promising to increase the number of users, innovate the DApp portfolio and improve the quality of existing solutions, this proposal meets the setting very well and I strongly agree that the potential impact is high.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The existing Trading Tent MVP works well with my Eternl wallet but is not useful if you do not have an existing trading partner.

The skills present further support the likelihood of successful implementation. A 17 week timeline is given and the milestones and design principles of the team seem reasonable and realistic. The budget could have been broken down into more detail and explained over the timeline, but are detailed enough for the scope of the project.\nIt appears that the vision for the features of a P2P marketplace are still fairly vague, based mainly on the personal preferences of the team as NFT collectors themselves. No formal market research has been carried out and no clearly defined design direction has been set yet. In my opinion, this is alright, as the timeline allows 8-10 weeks for strategy and design prior to development, so this is by design and not oversight.

Why do we need chat to negotiate when we can bid on a certain NFT collection we want to buy?\nThe above questions are still unanswered for me, so I hope the proposal team can clarify these details.

Most members bought and sold NFTs but there were a few of us that traded. Trading was kind of like the bartering system.

This \u201ccoincidence of wants\u201d was hard to come by and while some Discord servers tried to accommodate the community by offering dedicated trading channels, it only improved the experience slightly as now members could only see what others were willing to trade. And alos you have to scroll an awful lot to find something. If you finally wanted to trade with someone you would either have to trust that person, or work via an escrow. \n\nThe proposers solution is an \u201cupgraded\u201d version of the https://www.tradingtent.io.

This opens up new options to community members. They would not have to forgo their ADA. For example they one could trade 4 Season 1 Knitties NFTs and 20,000 dripdropz tokens for a Cardano Warrior. \n\nThe proposer indicates that the \u201cmissing piece\u201d to the trading tent is the \u201cdiscoverability\u201d of trading offers.
