There is not enough Cardano representation at these conferences.", "f6_no_assessments": 9, "f6_rating": 4.185185185185185, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1724, "q0": "Yes, in theory the proposal aligns with the objectives of the challenge, as it intends to create an online event that will be promoted through an interface, that is, it would be a dApp. It is not so clear how Cardano's technologies would be used in the construction of the web application, which would be a virtual booth to hold an event for the dissemination of projects in our ecosystem. As much as it is not clear how blockchain would be used as a tool in itself, we know that it is directly related to the core of the proposal, since our ultimate goal is to promote the achievements of our community, so I believe that the project is aligned with the challenge of dApps. More specifically with the topic of creating \u201cintegrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d; because here solutions and integrations that already exist in our ecosystem would be worked on, which would be precisely the projects to be disclosed. The justification for carrying out the proposal is that there is not so much enthusiasm and representation of Cardano's projects due to the fact that we, from the community, are spread all over the world, which creates the need for a larger and virtual event that can reach the different audiences. In short, \u201cwe will build and host a week-long virtual conference highlighting projects in the Cardano ecosystem. Projects can customize their area to showcase their brand to conference attendees.\u201d One observation I would like to make, initially, is in relation to accessibility. It is said that the objective is to attract the largest possible audience, which leads me to think that if the event is entirely worked on in English, the language barrier will create a certain limitation of reach in relation to that audience that comes from other languages, So a suggestion I would like to make is: could be done subtitling work for other languages, more commonly spoken by the members of our ecosystem (eg Spanish and Japanese, which are key languages \u200b\u200bfor Cardano). In the excerpt \u201cThis solution is expected to drive Cardano adoption by showcasing the projects being built in its ecosystem. Being able to meet and interact with members of the community will hopefully increase bonds and relationships with the people in it.\u201d How would this virtual universe, to be built, attract more engagement than the current ways of promoting projects in the community, such as the existing Discord channels, the telegram group \u201cThe Project Catalyst\u201d, youtube channels like Catalyst Swarm, who are constantly posting videos of Townhall's breakout rooms, in which they talk more specifically about some funded projects? It is said that \u201cThe most time-consuming part of creating a digital world is creating the content. To create a scalable and inclusive convention, we would need to create tools that allow project creators to manage their own section\u201d what tools would those be? Another observation I would like to make is regarding the polls that would be created (\"To attract more attention to this event, we will do polls to assign tiers based on how active the project communities are. The more active a community, the larger the space\". that she will have at the convention\u201d). How would it be distributed, how would they reach as many people as possible within our community? It is also said that the lectures would contain a space for questions and answers, and that in case there was too much pending to be discussed, extra chat sessions would be organized. What would these sessions look like, how would they be organized and how can we ensure good community engagement (a considerable number of people per session?). Would it be 1 extra session per lecture? The risk part is ok, the main risk to be raised is in relation to the projects' interest in participating in the exhibition, and this would be solved by the fact that involvement is free, for example. The impact is good, but could have some more clarified issues.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The roadmap is explained through sprints - it would be positive for the proponents, the future fest group, to define what a sprint is. Although not a rare term, it is not a common language that all members of our community know. By the definition I researched \u201ca sprint is a gathering of people involved in a project to promote a more focused development of the project. The term is strongly related to the agile development framework Scrum. Sprints typically last one to four weeks.\u201d In general, each sprint is explained in a very superficial way, the activities mentioned are mentioned and then it is clarified who would be responsible for each part, as for example in sprint 1 (UI/UX projects [FF] + convention [FF] + Back-end architecture [FF].\u201d How would the construction of the UI/UX design be carried out? How would the aesthetic and ergonomic choices be made? In sprint 3, how would the \u201cInitial disclosure\u201d activities be carried out of the project [FF] + Interface of the convention site.\u201d How would the project reach everyone involved in our community? and the investment is very high, so it would only be worth it if a large number of people. Looking at the cost part, the total amount requested is very expensive, it should be explained as precisely as possible. It's approximately 122 thousand dollars, na pa In addition to the salaries of the professionals involved, the information is provided with a good level of detail (e.g. in \u201cUI/UX Designs: $7,200 = $40/hour fee x 180 hours + Front-end development: $15,000 = $50/hour rate x 300 hours + Backend development: $20,000 = $50/hour rate x 400 hours\u201d). But some parts should be better detailed, for example the art part, it would be spent 10 thousand dollars for that, including \u201c3D Models + Environment + Animation\u201d - how much would go to each part, and why? In terms of marketing, twice as much would be needed ($20,000) for the \u201cContent Creation + Project Integration + Project Outreach + Campaign\u201d parts. It would be necessary for us, again, to know how much each of these parts would cost in relation to the 20 thousand and how the project would be publicized, the campaign, it would be essential that the proponents had made this very important part of the project very clear. And finally, analyzing the part of the team, the members are presented in an ok way, but not ideal. I say this because their curriculum is not explored extensively and accurately (eg \u201cSteven Yang: Steven has experience in software development and has worked in Fortune 500 media companies. Led several technical teams in creating projects in emerging technologies [ Responsibility: Backend Development] + Kevin Mowers: Kevin has a background in virtual reality, specializing in interactive user immersion and systems design. His industry work ranges from media to e-commerce. [Responsibility: Unity Development]\u201d We only know superficially about their professional activities, even though the linkedin profiles have been made available, it would be necessary for them to be more precisely presented in which projects they have been involved in before and also if they have any experience at Cardano (from what is left exposed, do not have.) The topic is good, but also needs adjustments.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately, the way auditability is suggested is not adequate. Speaking first of the progress, it is said that \u201cDuring the convention, we will track the users served, the number of chat messages and the total time spent on voice chat (\u2026). Ultimately, we want to create a place where people can connect, so measuring the use of our communication tools is vital.\u201d Okay, this would be followed up when the event was happening. But how can we monitor the phases, the activities necessary to get there, that is, to make this all possible? Ideally, some team member would provide us with information, updating us at the end of each sprint on what has been done. This would be necessary for us to have a constant follow-up on the activities, as the work routines of the professionals have been, possible problems that had to be overcome... auditability, as we lack ways to oversee the development process itself. And about the ultimate success, it is defined in two points: \u201cMore people take advantage of this format for meetings. Virtual events certainly cannot replace in-person events, but we believe that elements such as social connections and shared experiences can be replicated\u201d and also \u201cif we find that a good number of people outside the Cardano community discover projects of interest to them at the convention. If we see many more communities participating in this event, it will provide more awareness of what is happening in the Cardano ecosystem.\u201d I believe that only the second point is really relevant for Cardano, it would be necessary for the proponents to explain to us how this success would be measured and this information would reach the members of our community. How can we be sure that the goals of the challenge were achieved, that people really got to know and engaged in more projects, that they started investing and using different dApps, that more Ada would be in circulation, as well as more smart contracts and CNFTs\u2026 How, in practice, can all this be perceived? One way that could be effective would be through the direct declaration of some project teams that were exposed from the event. How has this exhibition contributed to the development and popularization of your initiatives? Quantitative and qualitative data should be exposed here, some real examples should be brought up for debate with our community; a youtube channel could be created to post videos referring to the projects, nothing too elaborate, but where the teams could provide feedback on this positive gain they would have experienced. For these reasons, the auditability part still has a lot to improve.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3137, "q0": "This proposal meets the requirement for the challenge, as it intends to connect every passionate Cardano community members to showcase their product and meet in a virtual world. As Cardano has community members from all over the world, it could be hard for everyone from across the world to meet in a single place. Thus this proposal addressed that issue by allowing each member to meet in the virtual world. However there could potentially be a language barrier as when everyone is connected in the virtual world not everyone can communicate effectively by just chatting. I would have rate this proposal higher if the author outline on how each members inside the virtual world communicate with each other, as from what i have read it's just by chats.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal authors has a working product (Future Fest Virtual Music Event), and the people who are working on the proposed project are experience and knowledgeable in this field. Thus I believe they have the skill and experience to develop the proposed solution. The budget breakdown is clearly outlined and seems achievable with the given timeline. The proposed solution may connect everyone inside a virtual world, but it did not specify how each member may host a booth inside the virtual world. The author did mention tools, but will the tools mentioned in the proposal are clearly defined. Thus this could potentially be a barrier for users to host an event and drive the adoption.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The project milestone and roadmap are clearly detailed out. There are clear metrics and KPI (user attendance, number of chat) to define the success of the project. However those metrics does not seem accessible by the public community, thus this is where the points has been reduced. Also the number of attendants may not be active users. With all that is mentioned, i believe a score of 3 is justifiable as i hope more information on the KPI and metric to define the project a success is given.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2403", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5608, "q0": "A week-long virtual conference for all kinds of Catalyst and Cardano projects to showcase their work and network is a great project. There is nothing inherently dApp-y about this, no DID or wallet integration, no smart contracts - just plain old web / mobile UI and a lot of Unity \"brains and beauty\". Given the broad scope of this challenge setting - anything goes if it boosts adoption and user growth - this is okay. As an added bonus, the proposers' company Future Fest work with cute little Cardano NFTs and these may / should loom large in the implementation. There are a few proposals in this Fund that integrate Unreal Game Engine and Cardano, if this proposal leads to more Unity and Cardano interoperability and projects that would be great. Slowly but surely some visually appealing, Cardano-native projects are emerging and this is a good way to give the trend a boost. As far as the directions required by the Challenge go, this one fits in nicely and if implemented successfully would without doubt boost Cardano attractiveness to gamers, web app developers and NFT collectors.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is broken down into sprints and has a well-documented, itemized budget and timeline. This ticks a lot of boxes for me. The six members of Future Fest working on this project have all provided their LinkedIN profiles and those have complete resumes and recommendations, which is great and boosts transparency. The video created for the four Catalyst proposals looks amazing, and the team has traction, many Twitter followers and a unique and very immersive design style. This may not be to everyone's taste but I like it a lot and prefer it over blocky (Sandbox, Minecraft), pseudo-realistic (Decentraland, Cardano Island) or medieval (Pavia, Cardalonia) styles. I would personally like something a bit more \"Cardano\" like the friendly sprites and turtles from the Summit, but this looks great and fresh and can be customized. The only concern I have is the requirement for exhibitors / booths to contribute their own content and manage the visual appeal of their own section. This is probably not something IOHK or most Catalyst projects have a lot of experience in or appetite for, as a more expensive or less customizable out-of-the-box solution like the one provided by TerraVirtua for the Cardano summit is what we are used to. However, I think it is a risk worth taking at it also has long-term upside. Cardano folks would be forced to think more UX, more visual appeal, more metaverse ... given that we're already awesome at the tech, this is not a bad skill to add? :-)\nIn summary here is a proposal that has a high probability of success and realistic March 2023 delivery date. It may happen a little later or with a few glitches, but could provide a long term mutually beneficial relationship with Future Fest who could bring fresh, immersive web3 flair to Cardano.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The goals and KPIs presented under the Auditability section are mainly aimed at the communication and interaction during the successfully hosted event in March 2023 and the draw this might have for people currently outside of Cardano. These metrics make sense but do not provide enough data points or quantifiable targets to measure the successful implementation. Tracking the progress of the preparation will be absolutely vital to prevent a failed launch or lack of representative attendance. I recommend to create a Discord channel for this project and communicate with the community about the process and preferences.\nWhat sets this proposal apart in terms of enabling the progress and audit is the very detailed breakdown of the sprints and timeline and the web presence and social media profiles of the proposers, which is encouraging. With a bit more fine tuning with the community with regard to the feedback channels, this project is transparent and clear and sufficiently auditable.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2720", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5927, "q0": "This proposal is very unique and interesting. It has quite effectively tackled the challenge. As a matter of fact, a large portion of the Cardano community is currently unable to attend face-to-face meetings and conferences. Therefore, this project offers a completely new approach. Project creators can showcase their products in an online booth, and attendees get a customizable avatar they can use to explore. In addition, there is chat and live streaming to enable panel discussions to take place during the conference. This will increase the number of participants, increasing meaningful interactions. In addition, meeting and interacting with members of the community will increase the attachment and relationship with people in the community.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Team information has been provided.

This makes team information more transparent. With the above information, I completely believe in the ability of this team.\nThrough the images and website (https://futurefest.io/) you provide. I really like how this \"digital world\" works. In addition, the interface is also very eye-catching, which is a plus. Detailed roadmap has been provided, the project will be implemented after 8 sprints, each 2-week long sprint. You've identified the tasks that need to be done and distributed them into very logical sprints. This will help the project to develop in accordance with the set goals and orientations. Thanks to a detailed roadmap, the budget is calculated easily. However, I have a few small suggestions that might help make the budget more specific: in addition to \"development\", other sections like \"art\", \"infrastructure\", \"marketing\" should also be considered. must be determined the number of working hours, hourly wage. In addition, it would be better to determine the number of people involved in each task. You have also identified the risks, challenges and ways to mitigate them.

Also, do you have any channels to update project progress reports? This will be essential, it will help people follow the project after it has been funded. \nOverall, the information provided is quite sufficient to judge the success of this project. This project is also seen as an alternative to live events, especially during the pandemic.

In light of that situation, the team offers this proposal that depicts a possible solution, which is to use Virtual Reality (VR) to bring those who can\u2019t attend the conventions to the \u201cconventions\u201d while never having to set their foot out of the door and still comfortably seated or laid in the comfort of their homes. \nThis virtual conference, according to the proposal, will be a week long and hosted completely online. Project owners will each have a customizable avatar that they can change to fit their taste and a booth where they can showcase their products. For now, the team cannot manage all the booths, project creators and products in one single space, therefore, they intend to create tools that would allow creators to manage their own belongings, and in the long haul, creators will be able to create their own booth of their choosing.\nThere will be a tier ranking system created to attract more users, the more active one community is, the higher tier they will be assigned, and the higher the tier, the bigger size the booth will be.\nThis VR convention will also feature chat and livestream features, much like the video game streaming platform Twitch, where viewers can participate in the live event and interact with one another. \nBut the main purpose of this project is to showcase the existing or ongoing projects on Cardano and boast interactions amongst the members, ultimately the final goal is to bring in more users to Cardano, which closely aligns with the objective of this Dapps, Products and Integrations challenge.\nThe proposal has also presented one major risk to the project, which is the unwillingness of other Cardano project creators to participate. To mitigate this, the team has come up with a few options, all of which I believe to encourage project creators to join in, all for the benefit of Cardano. \nThe only flaw I\u2019ve noticed so far is the lack of key metrics necessary to measure the desirable vision of success for this project, along with perhaps a few estimated numbers. Hence, I would suggest the proposer supplement those things.

The conference will also be able to display the products on Cardano and gain interest from viewers, and most importantly, be able to invite people from other communities or blockchains to join Cardano after the event has concluded.
