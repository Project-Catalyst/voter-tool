It has included graphics and explained in a simple manner the current state of stake pools: a small minority of stake pools hold the majority of delegated ADA. More information is included in the whitepaper draft and recommended reading to understand the project further.\n\nThe proposal is for funding research on a DeFi protocol that gives users derivatives(sADA) in exchange of ADA that is staked for them. \n\nSince it is research on the feasibility of an idea, I don't know if this proposal rightly addresses the Challenge, even if the problem highlighted is right on the money. Say, worst case scenario, the proposer learns after crunching the numbers in the first 8 hours that the idea is not feasible(a risk the proposer acknowledges.) What happens to the fund? It seems unreasonable for the proposer to be paid in full for an unfeasible idea. For auditability purposes, this proposal could include a milestone schedule for payment.

The roadmap is included and it is fairly clear: research on stake pool mechanisms, calculating profitability, compiling it all on a paper, then sharing it with SPOs for feedback. Then publish it and inquire developers on whether the idea is technically possible.\n\nThe proposal would be strengthened if the proposer includes his experience in the disciplines involved; calculating profitability, understanding technical details, researching etc. There are some questions that arise, like what if it's not profitable? Will the researcher stop working on the paper and stop receiving funds? A fully composable derivative earning both staking yield and DeFi yield would be useful as it could be a lego piece used by other protocols. Would this paper include useful information on this even if staking yield is not profitable?(as in, sADA staking yield is lower than staking ADA; but the total yield from lending sADA is higher than just lending ADA.)\n\nI think adding more details on the proposer's ability to deliver a detailed, useful whitepaper would increase enthusiasm for the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There are key metrics listed like SPOs consulted, developers consulted.

Stakeholders will naturally pick the highest ROI to maximize profit but in return will make a certain SPO saturated thus causing an effect of centralization. This initiative might help remedy the problem by distributing ADA evenly to low active SPO thus maintaining decentralization. One major concern of the protocol is security. Can the protocol guarantee the depositors assets can be claimable with ADA on 1 to 1 basis. I urge the proposer to consider every point of vulnerability in their research paper. ADA holders were free to move their coins in the wallet, therefore it is a risky proposition to sacrifice the total control of holding ADA and handing it over to the protocol. Overall, this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since the 1st phase of the project is only to find out whether this idea is feasible, the proposer is eligible to research on the subject matter. The proposer also notes that he needs to consult with SPO's and devs to see whether the protocol is viable for execution.

Smaller stake pools get less stake because the fixed fee takes a bigger part of the rewards. Their solution is to swap the normal ADA to sADA and they would allocate the normal ADA to stake pool and give the return back to the sADA holder. This would give constant staking yields and the option for double yields. \nTherefore it matches the Challenge criteria, would in theory make Cardano more efficient. \nBut there are some problems with this theory. First you would swap your \u201cvoting rights\u201d to tokens which represent them. Therefore the protocol/ smart contract or Steak protocol would be able to delegate with your rights. That\u2019s very dangerous. For example if 51% of Cardano is swapped to sADA the protocol would be able to manipulate Cardano. And even if they don\u00b4t use this power, they could be hacked. So this could lead to a more centralized Cardano. This is sort of the case with staked ETH. A big part of staked ETH is swapped at the Lido protocol and has led to a more centralized currency. Also doubleyield is possible on current exchanges (like your example Wingriders). This reduces the usefulness. \nIn conclusion I think the idea matches the challenge but there are big problems that lower the potential impact.

As I understand it, the (theoretically) solution mentioned by the proponent is basically to create an intermediary protocol called sADA so that users can exchange their ADA for sADA (a token). These sADAs will link (representative) the user's SPO to other stake pools. More specifically, it acts as an intermediary protocol that receives ADA from the user and transfers it to the wallet requested by the user. Then send staking keys to stake pools. And stake pools move rewards back there. Finally, the reward is given back to the user.
