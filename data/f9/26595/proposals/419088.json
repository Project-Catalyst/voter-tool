Censorship threatens to stifle the progress of human innovation.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 3.6666666666666665, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1693, "q0": "The impact of the proposal is, in my view, medium. I say this because the idea is in theory very good and would bring a good use case for Cardano technologies, helping to expand our blockchain to a different audience. However, in practice, the project is still a bit abstract, as there is a lack of information about how it would be put into practice. Speaking more specifically about the idea, it is about creating a decentralized web3 library - whose acronym is TAP (The Alexandra Project); this would be done in order to disseminate human knowledge, as the proponents claim, so that censorship no longer threatens the progress of innovation. It is said that the library would be built by open source on the blockchain, working \u201cto revolutionize the worlds of blockchain publishing, decentralized education, content distribution, archive collections and other web3 solutions for the fields of art, information, literature, science and technology\". However, here we see a series of situations that are not very clear. It is said that an accessible platform for everyone would be built: what would that platform look like? How would the public have access to knowledge? And, the most important question I think about in relation to this project: how would people who don't know and understand about the cryptographic world be able to use the tool? Unfortunately, it is not clear how this library would be usable in practice. It would be necessary for proponents to explain in more detail how this would be done and how blockchain laypeople would use the available technologies, I believe the goal is to reach as many people as possible with this idea; it would be necessary to include a tutorial that teaches how to do basic things on the blockchain - for example, if it is necessary to create a digital wallet to pay for access to some works; there would need to be a guide on how to do this, it is not very clear what people would need to do, but in any case it is always necessary that the actions are accessible to everyone. In the excerpt: \u201cThis type of interaction plays a role in the ability of our communities to understand technology and gives them relevant skills to compete in a competitive technological environment\u201d. As? How would the community understand the technology, what would the characteristics of this technological environment look like? If it formed thinking in theory, the proposal relates well to these two points, present in the summary of the challenge: \u201cTechnical requirements - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?\u201d and also \u201c\u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\u201d. However, due to the lack of explanations, it is not possible to understand how, in fact, these points would be put into practice. Another factor that needed improvement here would be the risk part. We have two main risks: not creating interesting, high-quality content, and not finding a Cardano developer who is competent and committed to the project. Both situations are not well mitigated, it is not clear what the strategy would be for the content created to be always flashy and interesting; and as much as it is said that the team has contact with programmers of our blockchain, we don't know who they are, this is not said, so not much trust is transmitted.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal is viable, but some improvements could be made. Regarding the script, the time interval defined is very long (first 8 weeks and then last 8 weeks). Unfortunately, the 2 month time frame is too long for us to accurately understand who would do what and when. Another point that could be better would be the explanation of the activities to be done. For example in \u201cequipment upgrades\u201d: how would these upgrades be made, who would work on it? And what equipment would need to be updated? \u201cDeveloping CNFT records of important Marcos Cardano\u201d: which CNFTs would these be? How would they relate to the platform and the rest of the project? \u201cArt creation to promote the library to members of the Cardano community\u201d: what art would that be? Maybe the interface design, or marketing material like digital posters and so on? How would this be communicated to the target audience? \u201cResearching new ways to build innovation, pushing the edge of web3 technology\u201d: how would this research be done? As you can see, all we know is what would happen, but we don't know what would happen each month and we also don't have a good understanding of the activities, since they are only mentioned, and not well explained and detailed. . The way the information is arranged, we can only have a notion of what would be done, and not a good understanding. The explanation of the funding is similar to the roadmap: we have basic explanations of how the total amount would be divided; some parts could be more detailed. For example in \u201c$3500 Developing infrastructure to catalog web library 3 in human readable form - programming, web development, video, content distribution\"; we do not know what the hourly rate would be charged by professionals in this area. art creation part, it is not clear what art would be created, as I commented earlier, this would need to be better defined. The equipment upgrade part is better explained, but it would be even better if we knew how much equipment would be purchased, they cite a few examples (audio interface, iPhone, microphone, laptop, vocal recording microphone), but which ones would you buy, and how many of each? hours @ $25 per hour + $1000 Miscellaneous - discretionary budget) could also be better defined. What would the possible miscellaneous expenses be, if it was not necessary to use this reserve, how would the money be redistributed? Analyzing the team, this part is the most suitable in terms of feasibility. We know a fair amount of information about the members involved (less about Adatomsnhft, it would be nice if they gave us more details about themselves). Positives here: the team members are very well involved with Cardano and participate in a few projects (eg \u201cThis Crazy Kitchen\u201d) in the community, which demonstrates a certain degree of experience with our blockchain. Negative points: they do not attach their linkedin profiles, it would be important to have a more detailed view of who they are and their professional paths outside Cardano. It is also said that \u201cwe also have many talented artist friends in the Cardano community that we rely on for help and creative contributions\u201d. Who would these friends be? What they do? It would be beneficial to have names and examples. Overall, the topic is fine, but it could be even better.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Unfortunately this topic leaves something to be desired, the information provided for both the auditability of progress and success is quite superficial. Speaking first of the progress part, all we know is that \u201cthe project will document the number of posts, likes, comments, video views, to track engagement and will make all data available to the public with full transparency\u201d and also that \u201cthe community you can follow the progress by consulting the links of this proposal to the TAP library\u201d. How will the aforementioned data be made available to the public? What will be the communication bridge between this team and the Cardano community? It would be necessary for the proponents to make this very clear, so that we could understand how these updates would reach the members of our ecosystem. Some ideas are - open a telegram or discord channel, create a youtube channel (although I think this type of information is more practical to be passed on in text format); reports could be posted on channels that the community itself already uses, such as the telegram channel \u201cthe project catalyst\u201d or even on discord servers specifically aimed at monitoring funded proposals. I do not agree that making the proposal links available for the community to come to ideascale to see what's new is the best way to monitor the process. I say this because, as the funds advance, more and more proposals are financed, so it becomes difficult to go after specific information for each one. Ideally, the team itself comes to the community and provides us with updates directly and simply. Another thing that was missing here was how the activities of the roadmap would be monitored, in addition to detailing the partial results, such as access to library documents, etc., it would be necessary for us to know if those activities proposed in the feasibility part were being done. How would the daily work of the professionals involved be? For this information to be more measurable, ideally, we would already know who would do what. Therefore, it is necessary to reformulate the part of the auditability of the progress. About the monitoring of the success scenario, unfortunately we also have very scarce and superficial information. We know the goal is that the \u201cproject would have a big impact on reaching Cardano's message, making more educational materials open to the world. Expanding the scale and scope of Project Alexandra by onboarding more people to Cardano means success.\u201d But how can this be perceived, palpated, how would this scenario become proven and explicit for our community? It would be necessary for the proponents to make a presentation that reported how the use of the library would be, how this would be contributing directly to the integration of new active members in our community, how these people would be relating to the blockchain and etc. Therefore, it is necessary that a more in-depth research is done and that the results of it also reach all of us directly. There is a lot to be improved here so that the monitoring of the proposal is really adequate.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 5, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 836, "q0": "The team aims to build a Web3 \u201cLibrary of Alexandria\u201d.\nFor those not knowing what it symbolizes, i would suggest to follow this link: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria\nIt is a great idea, and the scale of this project could be huge. It reminds me about the novel: \u201cThe Foundation\u201d written by Isaac Asimov, in which there is an \u201cEncyclop\u00e6dia Galactica\u201d aiming to save human knowledge. I picture Cardano as a \u201cFoundation\u201d and this project could be meaning the birth of an \u201cEncyclop\u00e6dia\u201d.\nThe project is about saving human knowledge onto the Cardano blockchain, so every single human being can have access to it, no matter where they live, making information & metadatas: censorship resistant.\n\nThe proposal seems to match the campaign brief, and the proposal, if successful, could be attracting more great minds to Cardano and Catalyst, like Wikipedia did.\nThe greatest difficulty in my opinion is that a project of that size can be very challenging in the matter of being able to scale to address future challenges.

How will it scale? Even if we just want to put into an archive the knowledge about blockchain, the amount of data to store would still be gigantic!\n\nI would kindly suggest adding more details about the resources needed and you should be more precise about the knowledge that will be stored. Did you guys estimate the amount of data that will be stored on-chain/Immutable services? How will it be classified? (The first Alexandria NFT was great, but a little bit messy, no offense!) \nThese kinds of information would be very useful for PA to assess this part better.\nSame suggestion concerning the risks and challenges the team may face during development, two small risks have been listed but they are very common ones, I'm convinced we could find more, like those highlighted in the previous paragraph.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proposers are very accessible on social media, so , it will be a good point regarding auditability.
