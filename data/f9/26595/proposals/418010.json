And the solution to this problem is a social experimental app, clinical trials as a social medium that leverages the rise of individual engagement on social media to collect data on self-administered experiments while compensating users. The result will be a web/mobile application with AI services that allows users to participate and create studies that users around the world can participate in. With this app users maintain ownership of their data and can license their data for 1) financial stimulus and 2) track their progress towards a specific goal, and 3) participate in a global research initiative to promote an in-depth understanding of human health. A great idea that identified a very topical problem and offered a potential solution. Full adoption of the proposed solution will represent a huge win for the Cardano ecosystem as individuals globally become aware of the real-world adoption of Cardano. As it is ingrained in everyday life while serving up unresearched aspects of how blockchain technology can improve an individual's psychophysiology, and financial health.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Project feasibility is average, proponent presented basic details of roadmap, team, and budget, however, in my opinion, each part could be explained better Plan to implement this project within 1 year and divided into 5 milestones We know what activities will be developed at those milestones, However, it would be better if the proponent submits detailing each of the actions mentioned every month, followed by a budget, as the author states this $50,005 will be used to pay salaries.\n-Research - $22,002\n-Development - $22,002\n-Manager - $6,001\nI think this part is not presented very well. It would be better if the proposal provided more detail on these pay ranges. For example, the cost of research is $22,002, how many experts will do this research, how many months will they work, and what is their hourly rate. This is similar to the other sections, the more detailed the budget, the easier it is for the community to audit the requested amount. And finally the project implementation team, I also think it is not enough because we only know the expertise of the team, do not fully present themselves, I want to know more about their background, that is their name, their role in this project? How can we measure the team's experience and relationship with the technologies involved in the Cardano ecosystem? It is very risky to finance a project without a well-defined, accomplished, and presented team. We don't know who the others are and so there's no way we can trust them if they're prepared for the missions to come.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Regarding the auditability of the project, the proponent listed several KPIs that are very relevant for us to understand whether the project is achieving the expected results or not. The success of the project is very clearly described as creating a Dapp platform that can achieve things like:\n-Sensor-based health data collection, self-input, and upload,\n-Provides hospitals and other EHRs with the ability to monetize stored data while complying with HIPAA regulations\n-Allows universities, hospitals, corporations, and other research institutions the ability to bid on \u201cresearch\u201d data that will then be licensed with user permission for use in research Research and development products of the bidding organization.\n-Allows users to track their progress in the studies they participate in and to have data-driven ownership of their progress.\n-Distributing money back to users based on their participation in licensed studies.....\nBut the question is how can we track the progress of the project? In my opinion, proponents should prepare reports, at least monthly, with project updates, and share them directly with the community. It would be very helpful if the community could follow the development of the project on some sort of social media channel, website, GitHub, Discord, etc.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 3, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 5341, "q0": "The solution of this proposal is a social trial app (clinical trial) with AI service that allows users to join & create studies. User will have control over their data and can license data to earn incentive and participate in global research initiative. This project will benefit the individuals as they own their health data,  global research community, and the legislation towards good health. The solution is very descriptive and methodological based although the proposer could have provided some links to highlight his points. This link could be part of the project the proposer is working on so far to give project background. Although the clinical trials are very current topic as during the last.2 years pandemic make it even more important to collect and analyze this type of data. If the proposer would provide some past work examples, it would definitely help to highlight the impacts that this proposal addresses the Dapps, Products & Integration challenge. The social trial app also has high potential for future scale as it can cover a variety of trials not only clinical ones and the proposal can mention other examples when it comes to the variety of application of solution. The proposer might need to choose either prototyping the social trial app as one platform OR focusing only the clinical trial platform. The decision of which would affect the background information eg. links he would provide for this project.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is a one year project with management, research and development activities every 3 months. On 9 months mark, there will be a beta test for users to fine tune the app, complete the UX research and ready for VC pitch.  The proposer has clear approaches how he want to develop app using Flutter and create research code base. The budget breakdown is based on the activities rather than team member roles. The proposer has not provided the name of person in charge of the project but put very specific profile of this contractor position. The proposal would very much improve in the feasibility section with detailed budget breakdown with specific name given  for MD contractor position, flutter developer and researchers. The community would need to know all these details in order to evaluate how likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully and it will also convey good image to the team of being transparent for funding.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project success is the dApp that can collect & license data  and train/deploy health recommendation system (identify health pattern) and peer to peer consultation for users. The KPIs for auditability in this projects are based on 3 milestones he provided in the feasibility section. For research, he will look at flops (deep learning architecture), accuracy improvement, recommendation improvement, and published research paper generated from the solutions. For development, he will use discretionary critique of user interface and for management, the number of insitutions, daily active users, and data sharing frequencies and external funding raised. I think that the proposer might need to redirect his KPIs. Right now the KPIs he mentions are focusing on how effective and how widely adopted his solution is. Whereas the focus in this auditability section is to ensure that the community can track his project progress and success. For example, one of the KPIs he mentions for management is amount of external funding raised. The community wouldn't be able to tell from this metric if he completes the project or that project has some progress. I would recommend the proposer to focus his project's auditability (KPI metrics) that show his project is on track. This could be a completely developed dApp, Rewards distributed via Yoroi wallet, or certain number of clinical trials using his dApp etc. Also he should have the place for the community to observe the progress e.g. website or some other links. At current stage, the community cannot tell how to audit this project when there is a mismatch in  KPIs objective and no location to track it down.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2695", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15073, "q0": "The proposal intends to create an open platform for health study design, data collection, and  analysis.

There are several initiatives that have been using a social network approach for over a decade (patientslikeme, carenity, health unlocked\u2026), and of course, machine learning is used abundantly when it makes sense in health research. There are also several blockchain based initiatives the proposer might find inspiring (Galeon, Immunity.Life). There's always room for new initiatives, of course, but this proposal seem to completely ignore the reality of health research, so it difficult to believe there's any chance of it being successfully implemented.\nI'd suggest the proposer gets a clearer grasp of the current status quo of the field, identify a potential need, and maybe write a more focused proposal.\nAdditionally, the proposal is dramatically short on budget for such an ambitious endeavor. \n(For context, I've worked in health research for over a decade)", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Some of the proposed KPIs are clear and useful (number of organizations involved, daily active users,, published papers), some are overly ambitious and imprecise (\"Accuracy improvements across a wide range of metrics\"), or plainly weird (\"computational complexity of proposed Deep Learning Architectures\" \u00bfis it complexity desirable or undesirable?)\nThe description of the intended dapp is again overly ambitious, achieving only one of the intended goals would be an enormous achievement.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2100", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15177, "q0": "The proposal is identifying the problem that currently, there is no database that is collecting and evaluating data of individuals, that could be beneficial for both financial and physiological of an individual. The solution is to develop an app where users will participate in different research/surveys/data collection and form the database, which will be then utilized by another people. It will be collected across the globe, and such system can provide a lot of important information, which might not be available now. Users, for participating, will be rewarded via Cardano wallets  (it is not specified from where these rewards come, or whether it will be in ADA or another currency). Nevertheless, I can envision a large impact with such application, because in the end, it could be leading to a database that would be providing information based on what its users could adjust their decision in real world. At the same time, I find it aligned with the challenge, because it can result in more adoption \u2013 definitely via rewards that are motivational character for its users. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline is set to one year, with quarterly milestones. Each quarter contains three sections \u2013 Management, Research and Development \u2013 with a short description what is to be completed. Even though such timeline is providing some idea about the progress, since we do not know the expected time spent on each task, I must state, that it does not appear feasible. For the first quarter, I would suggest to proposer to include monthly or weekly divided tasks, to break them into more details and provide that they are aware of steps that needs to be undertaken. For the quarters 2/3/4, since it is a long term planning, still some high level tasks could have been outlined with e.g. percentages displaying the proportion. The budget in total is 50 005 USD, where we have it related to the three main sections from the roadmap (management 6 001, research 22 002, development 22 002). Unfortunately we do not know time donation for each of this section as well there is no hourly rate nor how many people will be involved, so we do not know whether it will be enough. With the respect of the team, there is no mention about proposers, or people that will be involved, but we have some \u201cContractor (MD)\u201d which I assume covers management, then we have Flutter/Blockchain developers \u2013 for development, and Researchers. Unfortunately, there are no links in the whole proposal and not a single person is mentioned so the proposal is lacking information also in this respect. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress of the proposal is hard to be measured, because the timeline is containing high level items, and the possibility to audit the progress can be done after the end of each quarter, and also only small number of the items mentioned in the roadmap has a measurable character e.g. \u201cBegin interacting with outside institutions for data onboarding and user generation.\u201c. Nevertheless, the proposer state the following metrics for tracking the progress such as so called Flops, Accuracy improvements, Recommendation improvements, Published papers. I agree with the papers only. First \u2013 Flops \u2013 I am not sure how we can track complexity, and the other two \u2013 seem to be related once the app is done. Another metric stated is related to development, and I find it also not measurable \u2013 such as critique, usability, adoption. In case of management, the metrics stated are \u2013 number of institutions brought on, daily users and external funds raised. I can agree with first two, with respect that first can be progress metric, but the second success metric. At the end, the proposer mentioned the success metrics \u2013 that is having a form a completed app with various functionalities and features, such as working tracking and data collection or working rewards distribution. Again \u2013 for audit purposes \u2013 I am missing any public channels or links. I am decreasing score for the progress \u2013 which is hard to track and audit, due to not having a clear measurable deliverables across quarters.

In the excerpt \u201cour perspective on the use of the Cardano network within our structure is that the user could collect their rewards from data licensing agreements through Cardano wallets, such as Yoroi\u201d; it is possible to have a little of this notion. However, it is still a little unclear how the development of the technology itself would make use of blockchain. The idea is to aggregate structured data about human processes, with the aim of benefiting people with the use of artificial intelligence.

How would the 22,002 be divided, how long would each professional work? Speaking of which: who are the professionals involved in the project?
