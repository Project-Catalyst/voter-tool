Challenge is how to make health information shareable & interoperable without compromising security and privacy? Existing solutions have more failures than successes.", "f6_no_assessments": 9, "f6_rating": 4.37037037037037, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1721, "q0": "The proposal fits well with the objectives of the challenge. The problem raised is the difficulty of dealing correctly (respecting people's security and privacy) with health-related data. The proponent then suggests that a Health Information Exchange (HIE) solution be built on top of Cardano's blockchain, they will leverage an already existing infrastructure (Hippocrades) and harness this into cryptographic protocols. The proponent explains that this is not simple, but they already provide some technological solutions necessary to develop the project, as can be seen in the excerpt \u201cHippocrades offers the complete configuration of health modules and APIs that will be integrated with the proposed HIE. In fact, you've already built a Proof of Concept (POC) for your HIE. However, the team further improved the framework by adding a Medical Records Rights Management and an improved protocol called Hippr (short for Hippocrades Protocol). A separate white paper is written about this.\u201d It would be necessary for users to have their own systems linked to the HIE, for APIs to be built and for all this to be interconnected. Due to technical requirements, HIEs are not so simple to be made, therefore they are not easily found neither in emerging countries nor in those already considered developed. And finally, the excerpt that makes it very clear how this proposal will be beneficial to our ecosystem is \u201cHippocrades Healthcare offers solutions for clinics, pharmacies, diagnostic centers and doctors (\u2026). Second, these systems are automatically integrated into the intended health exchange platform. Other installations that have their own systems can still integrate via the provided APIs. Once integrated, the potential number of transactions/exchanges (built on top of Cardano) can hugely drive adoption and traction.\u201d For these reasons, the topic deserves top marks in terms of impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script is ok, my suggestion is that the proponent should detail more about how each activity would be. As we can see from the example of week 1, the activities that are planned after this period of time are: \u201cDefinition of team and project goals/objectives + Requirement review + System Architecture Review (Hippocrades is a platform with several modules , use cases, and complexities). How would the team's goal definitions be made, perhaps this would already be interesting to be included in the scope of the proposal, no? Regarding temporality, I don't think there are any problems, because the time intervals are very short, usually involving 2 to 3 weeks per phase; so my only remark would really be about the details of what will be done. About the budget, it's confusing what the \"T\" is: Project Leader (1), 4 months (spread) @ $1.5T/month, $6T + Systems Analyst and Designer, 2 months (spread) @ $ 3T/month, $6T\u201d. It's probably the same as a k (thousand) so I'll consider that in the reviews. The total amount of 27 thousand dollars is divided between very clear and direct, however it would be interesting for us to know some more details, such as how many hours the professionals involved in the project will dedicate to this work, so we would know the value of the work hour of each and we would be better able to assess whether the value is fair or very high. I'm a little worried about the fact that there isn't someone focused on marketing here, in my view it would be important for the project, as we would have more guarantee that the disclosure would be done properly. Regarding the team's presentation, this part is great, we have a lot of information about those involved (for example in the case of Joff: \"has been programming and focusing on web development using JavaScript for the last 9 years (since 2012). Most of his time is spent mastering front-end development using AngularJS, Angular and Vue.js frameworks. He is currently interested in SvelteJS. He is passionate about contributing to the open source community\u201d); it is also well explained how the team is involved with Cardano, giving a lot of confidence. So, the topic is good, needing a few improvements.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent explains to us some KPIs that will serve to monitor the process, such as: \u201cTestable code (acts as documentation so that changes immediately show errors) + Team Velocity (story points delivered per sprint) + Knowledge sharing ( collaborative meetings and adequate documentation). However, it is not so clear how these partial results would be understood and how the Cardano community would be aware of such updates. How can we observe progress at the end of each phase? How will tasks and deliverables be shared on github, and how often? In my view, the proponent already guides us well in relation to what should be monitored, it just doesn't explain as well how it would be monitored. Finally, in relation to success, this can be understood through the creation of \u201cModules and resources are listed according to the tasks/activities required and their corresponding due dates to carry out each one\u201d and also by marking \u201ceach task performed per module. For overdue items, they are regularly presented in daily meetings and weekly meetings to discuss blockages/issues and what needs to be done to resolve them.\u201d However, the proponent does not focus so much on the results that could be perceived directly in Cardano, as the challenge KPIs would be supported, such as are present in the campaign summary: \u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d. Therefore, two things are important here - the first would be to understand how the project would affect our ecosystem, directly, through verifiable data; and the second is how all this could be passed on to the community, if there would be a final report that would better detail the success scenario, some presentation at townhall and so on. So, I think the topic is on track, but it needs some adjustments and deepening.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6736, "q0": "Hippocrades aims to be a decentralized healthcare infrastructure that utilizes, where appropriate, blockchain solutions, zero knowledge proof and decentralization to power a better healthcare infrastructure for the myriad of healthcare stakeholder that need to interact with patients\u2019 data: doctors, clinics, drug stores, hospitals, research centers, etc. \n\nThe proposal mentions that the main platform is completed, since it has been in the making ever since 2016, and right now they are seeking funding only to build the medical records rights protocol and to bring additional improvements to their proof of concept solution, already built on the testnet. \n\nThe healthcare industry is prone to being disrupted by the blockchain technologies, and the use cases are extremely varied: multiple stakeholders involved, all requiring access to different levels of data, makes the industry a perfect candidate for zero knowledge solutions, for instance.

They have also received funding in Fund 8 in order to onboard developers into their project. We also have available three bios of the core team: Dale, Joff and Nad, but it would have been excellent if these presentations were complemented by social media profiles where one can have a more in-depth look at their background and past experiences. \n\nThe project will take 16 weeks to complete, and is only lightly sketched. For example weeks 6 to 10 are devoted to simply SecureShare backend development, but we have no other additional information as to what this SecureShare actually entails. \n\nThe budget is divided by each resource: a project lead, a system analyst, a backend developer and a QA analyst, with costs ranging from 1.5 to 3k USD/month, for periods of 2 to 4 months. A great addition to the budget would have been an estimation of hours involved or at least a confirmation that those four resources will work full time during that time. What is also not clear is whether the entire development will take place inhouse or if they will employ additional outside resources. \n\nOverall we have a good, but not excellent, case for the project\u2019s feasibility, with more transparency necessary for the team presentation and project details. Four stars.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I am not convinced that the team is doing a very good job at ensuring full auditability. In the section concerning the project tracking, they only offer vague explanations concerning past projects, with only a very brief mentioning of deliverables placed in GitHub. Nevertheless, we do not have any Github link for previous work - and considering that we have an already existing solution - shouldn\u2019t this be the case? Also, where are performance indicators, and the concrete measurement points that track the project from a healthcare perspective? Will we be able to count on boarded patients, medical facilities onboarded, information flows available or cases intermediated? I would have expected much more at this stage, when we are dealing with a returning proposer. \n\nThe overall success is brushed too vaguely. The proposal offers a few explanations about project tracking, but no concrete targets are put on the table. When, where, what exactly should we expect once the project launches? Lacking any concrete milestones to look forward to, I have to maintain a neutral stance and can only offer three stars.
