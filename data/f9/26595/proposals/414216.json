However, as mentioned in the proposal, there is a great possibility for optimizing this sector if the logistics data can be tracked with greater precision. We realize that the proposal in question aims to accomplish exactly that, in this way, we can safely say that the project fits the goals established by the challenge. Furthermore, if the project is successful, we will have a clear positive impact on Cardano's ecosystem, as with better data management it is likely that fewer resources will be wasted, even contributing to environmental preservation, one of the foundations of the idea of sustainability that Cardano aims to promote. Therefore, despite the budget being requested being large, we see that it is justifiable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Given the technological bias of this project, it would be necessary for the team to present considerable technical knowledge of the subject, and we realized that in fact this occurs, since the team of professionals involved in the project is highly specialized in development. But in addition, we also noticed a notorious concern with the quality of the software being produced, a fundamental factor given the amount of information that will be treated. It is interesting to note that there are other proposals being presented by this company that also cover the automobile market, so we see that the team must understand this market well. And this is in fact proven by observing the experiences of the project team, including the CVs of these professionals were made available so that their skills could be proven. Regarding the budget detail, we noticed that it was clearly described, making it quite evident why the total budget was requested. At first we may think that the values \u200b\u200bare high, but we need to remember that the professionals work in Germany, where salaries are on average high. Regarding the timeline of the proposal, we see well-structured activities that evolve progressively, starting from initial organizations and configurations to the actual implementation of an MVP.

There's a very complete workbook provided with the project deliverables that can be interpreted as product backlog, that is possible to check all features that will be available in the product. Some of them have already been completed as a prototype was already developed. A diagram is also available, helping to illustrate how the fleet model would operate with this service.

Moreover, the scrum boards in Atlassian JIRA Tool will also aid on this, which will include product backlog in the same tool.

The growing connectivity of vehicles has made fleet management an essential element for a greater digitalization of the approach to large-scale operations.\nFleet management includes a wide range of hardware and software components that are tasked with measuring, recording, processing and transmitting large amounts of relevant data to a server. These components include, for example:\n\u2022 A GPS localization system inside each vehicle\n\u2022 Various monitoring devices that record the speed, acceleration and general condition of each vehicle\n\u2022 A system that allows devices to connect to the cellular or satellite network\n\u2022 A server that processes all the data and sends it back to the connected applications and fleet management devices\n\u2022 A software suite for the end user, which displays all information clearly\nIn current centralized fleet management solutions, data is processed, managed and saved by Centralized servers. This creates a potential privacy risk (data may be sold to third parties) and security risk (single point of failure. Hack potential)\nPeakchain wants to solve this problem by creating a fully decentralized fleet management platform, which eliminates the presence of centralized servers. In this sense, it responds to the objectives of the \"Dapp, products and integrations\" challenge, proposing an application that is configured as a valid alternative to the service provided by the current centralized fleet management clients (eg Avrios) whose market has been estimated to 28.66billion dollars in 2022 with an upward trend compared to previous years (https://www.statista.com/statistics/975959/global-fleet-management-market-size/)", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent wants to create a decentralized fleet management platform to solve the current privacy and security problems that plague traditional centralized fleet management platforms. To do this, the MVP (minimum functional product) of the platform will be created first. This solution will not be completely decentralized as the raw data coming from the vehicle's CAN-bus (which is the operations center to which information from the various components of the car arrives) are sent to the Peakchain server before being decoded and then saved on blockchain. To make the platform truly decentralized, the team plans to integrate a hardware device that will decode the data locally, then running a full cardan node will send a transition containing that data directly to the blockchain without going through centralized servers. This device is part of another team proposal in this fund (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414249).\nThe team emphasizes the independence between the proposals, but a truly decentralized solution will only be possible with the future integration of the device. However, it should be clarified that this is an MVP that will serve to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the project, the team has already implemented a test prototype with a VW Passat. The team has the right skills to carry out the project; participated in the Plutus pioneer program, has experience in the automotive sector and is part of a software development and consulting company duly registered in Germany as GmbH (https://www.unternehmensregister.de/ureg/result.html;jsessionid=E1F379FD0E14C05649CD0444BC13B884 .web01-1) and ISTQB certified (international standard certification of software testing skills). The technical aspects of the project are precisely described.\nThe budget is clearly outlined and divided into identifiable items, the salaries are slightly higher than the average but I find the budget required for a front end developer to be excessive. For this figure, $ 6000 are requested which means $ 72000 per year, which is excessive compared to what can be found online (https://www.glassdoor.it/Salaries/germany-front-end-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0 , 7_IN96_KO8,27.htm? CountryRedirect = true). Another critical aspect concerns the team's working weeks which overlap with the other 3 proposals presented in this fund, which risks creating a work overload. The proposer replies that as a software consultancy company they should have no problem finding the right people. The timing of implementation seems realistic if this proposal is considered in its singularity, but if all the proposals were funded and the staff were not found quickly they could become stringent. The proponent expresses the possibility of resubmitting loans in the future to expand the functionality of the platform but without a detailed plan in this regard.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The information provided by the proposer is sufficient to verify the progress of the proposal.

Really about the team, I appreciate very much.\n\nSecond, I would like to talk about the budget: first, I would like to thank the team for giving a detailed statement of the budget, but I question how the monthly salary is determined? And the jobs I think should be specifically converted to the number of hours to be completed. The accuracy will be higher when calculating the first.\n\nThe third of the steps explain how the project will be developed, and this proposal is very detailed and rich in relation to the explanations of each step organized by the team. Starting with a review of the team members, we found that they all seem to be very skilled and have considerable experience in the tech sector, as there are several senior developers on the team.\nBut, in an additional way, project managers and others not necessarily affiliated with the technology are also present, showing the completeness of the team. A positive point regarding the experts involved is that they work at the technology company Peaksoft GmbH, whose address has been provided: https://peak-soft.de. The company's website is very well structured and presents several aspects that professionals approach in projects, some of which are also covered in this proposal. CVSs of all professionals involved in the project were provided through LinkedIn addresses, helping to demonstrate their previous experience. For example, we have the CTO curriculum available through the link:\n \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/abderrahim-issaoui-b3149227. Honesty and transparency in the use of finance certainly make investors feel confident. Maybe all I need is a brief request that the proponent gives each action a specific amount of time to complete.

Typically, these days, all fleet management solutions are built on centralized servers which is critical issue for businesses because any sentitive data stored on the centralized server can be hacked.

Their solution - PeakChain Fleet Management Platform, will assure the privacy and security of the companies and drivers\u2019 data who are utilizing fleet management services in the automobile industry, particularly connected vehicles in Germany and could be extented to other countries. Consequently, increasing numbers of companies will want to use Cardano blockchain as a platform for fleet management services. Moreover, this platform will bring a lot of positive benefits for customers as they are assured that their data is hashed in the blockchain and cannot be hacked or stolen by third parties. A good point is that 3 main risks are clearly stated by the proposer and they have detailed strategies for reducing these riskes which I found very reasonable. Personally, this is a very promising and practical project. I highly appreciate that the team has a good preparation in building project's foundation: logo, website, medium, video explannation,..before submitting it for raising fund which show their seriousness. Also, the proposal is presented very well which I could follow the information easily. Therefore, I am fully support of this project and would like to give full mark for this part.

In terms of plan, from their attached Feasibility Spreadsheet, the proposer provides detailed roadmap for 3 months ahead from September to November (weekly plan with 12 weeks in total) with clearly listed main tasks and timeline for completing each task. I think their plan is very organized and easy to follow the flow of the work. For example, for Hardware configuration and Testing task, they plans to complete it within the first 2 weeks of September. In addition, the four components of The Fleet Management Platform are also listed for community to understand more about their project. I appreciate that the proposer shows the architecture of the system visually with picture. However, this system is technically complicated so it is better if the proposer could explain a little more about how this architecture system works for community.

In particular, the brightest point of the budget section is that each budget section has a specific manager and responsibility. The technical budget section will be managed and developed by a Developer department, similarly, the other sections will have their own accounting. That contributes to ensuring the safety of the budget, and helps the project go on schedule.\nThe technical aspects outlined in the platform components and acceptance criteria are absolutely necessary for the successful execution of the plan. I have looked closely at the theoretical and practical issues, and I have found that the proposal already provides a specific case-study, including numbers on data from the collaboration with Volkswagen Passat. In addition, the proposal provides detailed information on how the data works in the system, making it easy for everyone to understand the important issues of the project, and how it works. Hardware and software are explained in detail, I appreciate the carefulness and seriousness of the proposer.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned above, the information proposed by the proposer in the roadmap is very clear, besides, using Agile software development methods on the JIRA platform is very reasonable to track the project progress and ensure the plan is completed. completed within 2 weeks.\nProposer mentions that it will successfully deliver the first product within three months. However, they did not mention the number of customers they expect in the future. Proposer did a good job in planning the details, however, I suggest adding the expected traffic to increase the persuasiveness of the project from the very beginning according to the proposer's vision: \u201cTo become the world-leading automobile industry blockchain solution provider based on the Cardano blockchain\u201d.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4076", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14946, "q0": "This proposal is prepared detailed, clearly, and nearly functional. I can see that they are well-awared of the challenge they have to solve and what they are doing. This part shows that they are trying to reach 3 main key metrics of the challenge very well (by building ready to use Connected Car DApps on top of Cardano; bringing traditional existing solutions for car sharing and Cardano as well as ADA and e-wallet together; improving transparency and trust, augmenting data security and ensuring data privacy for a B2B platform). The idea and methodology is demonstrated intuitive and attractive through the video on Youtube and project's page. Besides, they also have clearly strategy to mitigate the risks they can face. However, I suggest that the team member can highlight more what your platform better than the existing ones when using it instead of focus on only the value it can bring (for example: friendly UI/UX, easy to use, faster, simplicity steps or else).", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This session basically meets the demands of a proposal. This project has an experienced team with suitable experts (both in Cardano and Car Service). The way the proposal gave the information, as well as professional qualifications of their team member with their Linkedin links, is really clear. Their project management's also trying to enhance his IT ability for this project by getting the ITIL certification although it's just foundation. I think it's a plus. There's also technology architecture and a prototype. However, I think the proposer can add more the working hours of their team member, and a number scale for acceptance criteria to help it more intuitive and clearer. Moreover, the team should provide more details at the budget so that the community can accurately evaluate it as the money provided for each team member is the same in 3 months while there's a month, only a few tasks are on track. Besides, there're some point confused me. Firstly, the project delivering a new product every 3 months, I don't know if the team members have particular goal specified for each of them. Secondly, the proposal wrote \"most components are implemented and tested successfully\", so if there's any fail case, the proposer can show it up with a solution. I think it will help the proposal stronger. Finally, the plan in the impact session mentioned to promoting as well as marketing (run in all 3 months), however, there's no mention of what team or who will in charge this scope of work, and the budget break down part hasn't included the promotion fee. If the outsourcing does those tasks, I think the proposal should also have a budget for it and an expected efficiency.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In this part, the team once again showed their excellent work. They keep track and manage their project by using Agile Software Development methods and JIRA tool, a good platform to track the project's progress. The only thing I concern here is the income in the future of the project. If the proposal provide more the income range it can reach if it meets all the success criteria, I think this will be a strong proposal.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4114", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We aim to develop a Cardano Fleet Management solution on the blockchain, guaranteeing privacy and security for the provided services.", "experience": "\nMore than 5 years of experience working on connected Car Projects alongside Germany's world-leading car makers\nMore than 10 years of experience in Software Development\nMore than 8 years of experience in Software Quality Assurance and Test Automation\nPlutus pioneers\n"}
