A considerably high amount, of 100k dollars, is requested to promote the activities of a group (Cardano Stonerz Club). The proponent points out that the group is already quite popular and corresponds to the debut space of the Cardano community on Twitter. It is not said exactly what type of content is discussed/exchanged there, we do not have a concrete understanding of this group and what they do. I do not believe that the proposal is well aligned with the challenge, since a Dapp or product itself will not be developed, but the activities of a group active in our community will continue. In my view, the proposal would be better included in the \u201cCardano <3 DAOs\u201d challenge, since the objective is to promote the activities of a group that debates issues relevant to Cardano. We know that the funding would be used to pay those involved, but for example, it is not said how these events would be organized, which CNFT gifts would be developed and how they would be distributed. For example, in the following excerpts: \u201csupporting hosts - preparing and hosting our community spaces and events / supporting co-hosts - preparing and co-hosting our community spaces and events / hosting extension - 10 hours per week Overtime to visit other shows, networking between organizations\u201d. What would these events look like? How would the spaces be managed? What topics would be discussed at each meeting? There are many meetings, it would be important to have greater clarity about what would be done in each of them. In my view, in general, the idea itself is not very well defined, not even in relation to what they have done before or what they intend to do in the case of successful funding. Therefore, unfortunately, the grade I will assign will be average. For the proposal to be more aligned with the challenge, it would be necessary for us to first understand if any product would be generated (something that had more connection with the specific objectives of the challenge, such as a Dapp, a specific interface), something that would contribute to our ecosystem, increasing the number of active members in our community, if more smart contracts would be generated, increasing the circulation of Ada and CNFTs, but still starting from some Dapp project or something similar. It would also be necessary for the proponent to specify what type of products and impacts the group has generated so far, some tangible results of its performance, for example, so that all readers of the proposal have the same degree of understanding, even if they do not have knowledge information about the Cardano Stonerz Club.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, the proponent does not present phases in which the project will be developed. The proposal is very different from the others because it does not represent an idea in itself that will be developed from scratch, but the continuity of a project that takes place through different people, promoting these meetings on Twitter, 5 nights a week. I believe, however, that it would be interesting if we had better explanations regarding the pre-production of these encounters, as the different topics mentioned (Graphics and art, Developing Metaverses of Cardano Stonerz club in Cardano, Gift wallet and etc) are grouped and merged on a singular event, or even if each night would be more focused on one of these subjects. It would be positive, then, to understand the pre-production process of these meetings, for the proponent to explain how they are planned and executed, how they are publicized, how contact is maintained after the event with the participants, etc. As I mentioned, as it is a different proposal in terms of planning and practice, it is understandable that there is no traditional timeline here, but it is still relevant to understand how the members of this group plan their actions. We have many parts that would make up the whole, for example: \u201cgraphics and art - to be allocated to graphics and art to support brand development and marketing. Banners, Logos, Promotional Content + Event Planning - Digital Marketing, Location Acquisition and Execution + Giveaway Wallet - to help with promotion by distributing Cardano NFT's to community members who are involved through the internal lottery system\u201d. How would these different actions be unified in a calendar with defined deadlines, where we could understand what would be done, how, when and so on? Talking now about financing, despite the amount being quite high, it is explained in a satisfactory way. We generally have a well-branched split of parties (\u201cGift Wallet - $3100 CNFT Inventory for Giveaways, Editing and Video Design - $3000 Create Video Content CSC, Music Talents - $5000 CSC Cardano NFT Record Label Management System \u201d and etc). We know how much each person involved's work hour costs, which I think could have been developed further, however, would be how they work in practice. Some parts, like graphics and art (of which $5,000 would be set aside), could be better explained. How many graphic pieces do they intend to produce, and in what way? How many designers would be working here and for how long? And the $3100 set aside for the giveaways - how much and what? In my view, the budget part of the proposal is good, and it could be a little clearer in just a few points. Finally, thinking about the team, it is super positive as most of them seem to be very involved with the Cardano universe, some being quite experienced in it. It would be interesting, however, if we had the same level of detail for each member of the team, and we could understand what their professional training is like in addition to their activities at Cardano. That is, that we had more information about each, a more detailed curriculum. In general, the topic has positive and negative points, in general it is ok as it allows us to understand the core of what it will be, who are involved and how the funding would be used, however it could be improved in some aspects.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponent suggests some very direct and useful ways of perceiving whether the project would be going as planned in terms of partial results, such as, for example, the \u201cnumber of posts, likes, comments, video views, for tracking engagement\u201d, for example. They say they will use the twitter diagnostics space as well. I think we're pretty well covered when it comes to tracking progress. However, in my opinion it is also essential that we can follow the pre-production process of the meetings, mentioned above in the topic of feasibility. How would the professionals involved be organizing themselves to hold the meetings? Would everyone be doing their jobs? Working the 5 days agreed, executing what has been planned? Are graphic pieces being produced at the correct frequency and in the correct way? That is, how can we diagnose whether what is behind the encounters was done correctly? I think it is essential, in addition to understanding what has been done, to also be aware of how it has been done. We have several communication channels established with the community, so it would be extremely beneficial if one of them were elected as the official communication bridge, through which we would know the feedbacks of the phases, which would have been done each month, both in terms of activities and partial results. . Finally, speaking of the success scenario, the proposer is mainly based on increasing the number of listeners and participants of the events (more specifically, he wants to increase participation by 1000% in 12 months). I think it is indeed the main data to be investigated, but it shouldn't be our only concern. How would these listeners be joining our community? How can we be sure that they have become active members, that they are participating in more projects at Cardano, engaged with our technologies, in fact being active factors in the expansion of our blockchain? I believe that it would be super positive for us to carry out a more qualitative monitoring of this audience, not just quantitative. A survey could be carried out and the general impression could be reported, or in writing, in a special meeting on twitter (for example, at the end of each month), with the focus on reflecting the progress of the project... indeed to the members of our community. Having said that, I believe that auditability still has some points to be explored in order to make it fully adequate, in addition to what we have been told so far.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2401, "q0": "We see that the proposal aims to increase the visibility of an existing hub, in order to better disseminate the concepts of Cardano's ecosystem. Thus, we have that the objective of the project is aligned with the challenge in which it finds itself. However, it seems that there will be a great effort to increase the visibility of a project that already manages to attract a certain amount of attention. It seems that perhaps a very big step is being planned, given that smaller actions with less capital demand could also, gradually, cause a considerable increase in the hub's visibility. In this way, it may be that the amount being requested, which is quite considerable, is not being used in the best possible way, putting in doubt the impact of the project in question.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Regarding the actions described in the project timeline, we noticed the existence of constructive activities that, together, form an environment for the hub to become larger and more attractive. But again, perhaps the amount of actions being performed is, at the moment, excessive. Among these activities we find the development of infrastructure for web3 integration, one of the most important stages of this project. However, when we analyze the details of the budget, we have that a small percentage of the total is being allocated to this infrastructure. Furthermore, the joint analysis of the other expenses again gives us the idea that the plan would be more viable if the actions planned here were carried out on smaller scales, with the constant verification of their effects. Regarding the professionals involved, it is a positive point to see that they have previous experience with Cardano and with blockchain-related projects. But it would also be interesting if their CVs were made available so that their experiences could be more easily verified.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "We observed that the team was very precise in choosing the parameters to follow the evolution of the project. Measuring the number of likes, views and comments are tracking modes that are very consistent with the project scope. We also have that the team took care to make this information available so that the evolution could be followed by the community. The perception of success similarly makes sense, and configures a scenario in which the aforementioned parameters obtained good results. We also have that a quantitative target of expected growth within the period of 1 year was also established.

Although proponents include links to their club's social platforms, I would still recommend they provide a description of the club's main activities right here in the proposal. The data and evidence that you give like \u201cWe have an average of 100's of people per night on the show with peaks of 1000's per show\", \"Many community members...frequent the club\" don't seem to be enough to evaluate the growth of your club.

How do members interact with the club's content/activities? Applause rate? Virality rate? These parameters will help experts assess the development potential of the project to make reasonable funding decisions as well as strengthen your assertion in the risk section that \u201cWe are the perfect group to do amazing things for the Cardano community\u201d including creating exciting high-quality content.

I have yet to see the time estimates for the completion of the WEB3 infrastructure build as the proponent mentioned. However, the budget allocation is reasonable for the proponent's fundraising purposes, I like the way the proponent applies the formula of hours worked x respective remuneration to calculate costs for their work, which increases the audibility and reliability of the project. I did not find any information about the member who will be in charge of the construction of WEB3 in the information sheet about the key personnel of this project.

The $100k price tag is far to high for a proposal that isn\u2019t absolutely clear on what is meant by infrastructure development and Cardano integration means. At one point, the proposal does mention broadcasting podcasts throughout existing Cardano DApps and protocols but it doesn\u2019t mention which ones and how those platforms would expand this groups reach. Without this information, the proposal maintains a rather weak link to the Dapps, Products & Integrations category. I think voters would respond more positively to more direct explanations as to what new audiences could be reached, what infrastructure is being built, and the quantifiable magnitude of this proposal. Voters tend to respond well to market research that displays the outlook of the status quo, as well as objective numbers that clearly shows what the potential increases in viewership might occur, and other relevant modeling evidence that might bolster increased confidence in the impact of this proposal. The last thing I might suggest is aligning with Cardano Catalysts mission to \u201cgenerate the highest levels of community innovation.\u201d If voters can clearly see what type of things are being done here that has never been done before, they would be more likely to respond positively. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There\u2019s no apparent concern that the team is capable of continuing to do what they\u2019ve already been doing, yet it is unclear what new elements are being added that would effectively link the status quo to the impacts of a post-proposal world. This rationale leads me to rank this section a 3. I think it would help voters tremendously to see which areas of funding are supporting new actions/roles/projects, so that they can clearly see what the proposal is doing to power new expansion that wasn\u2019t being done before. It may also be an effective tool for voters to be able to see an anticipated revenue model, so that they can see an ROI on the $100k request. This is one of a few different improvements that could be made to better guide voters in the budget section. Another would be a deeper breakdown of broader categories listed in the budget, like Graphic/Event planning/Autonomous Org/Giveaway Wallet/Video Editing/Infrastructure. Voters will want to be assured that the funds are being spent efficiently, so transparency in how each dollar is being spent within broader categories will be helpful for voters to judge if spending is efficient. Another area that could use some more substantial improvement is the roadmap section that doesn\u2019t organize tasks into timeframe based plan. This could help assure voters that there is a well-thought plan to accomplish various tasks to answer the question of \u201chow\u201d this proposal will reach the listed impacts. Lastly, while it might be a little less relevant than most other Catalyst proposals, voters will likely still want to see LinkedIn/Resumes for each of the core development team members to evaluate the teams capability and sustainability based on professional experience.

I tend to rank this section with more scrutiny because it can show the voters that there is a clear-calculated measure of success that the proposal is aiming at. This proposal has a good framework for this demonstration but it doesn\u2019t take that extra step by listing specifically identified numbers that the project is aiming for in the listed KPIs of posts, likes, comments, and video views. Without listing particular targets that the proposal wants to see (bonus points for different milestone targets for different timeframes), the voter doesn\u2019t know what metrics are considered a success and what would be considered a time to make adjustments.

Cardano Stonerz has a huge impact on the Cardano community, the formation of a DAO infrastructure is what we look forward to. Cardano Stonerz operates on the basis of community interests, so it must be acknowledged that the project implementation will be expanded in the future with the active participation of members. Attracting participation from the community through traditional channels such as Youtube, twitter, Tiktok is a guarantee for the number of people participating in the Cardano Stonerz Club. The implementation solution of the project is an actionable way to solve the stated problems. More than expected when the project's concern is to provide services and products that bring the best experience to participants. Cardano Stonerz operating in the digital space will create a permanent and permanent Cardano community. I have an opinion that I would like to contribute to the project to develop better, It is the content of Cardano Stonerz activities that need to be more detailed, the content of the Cardano introduction activities, the introduction to meet Charles Hoskinson and interesting stories about Blockchain, which will help the club's activities attract and really impact the Cardano community. With the confidence of the author team that the project is implemented without any risk, We have the opinion that attracting participants can also be a risk of the project, it will evaluate the project was successful.

But I have some observations to make. How will people find out about this Cardano Stonerz Club? I think for a Club to be relevant, it needs to be very popular, with many users interacting with each other and generating engagement; Marketing in my opinion has always been essential for the success of any project, but in this regard, it is much more than that, so I would like the proponents to have a focus on that since impact. The author finds that the challenge of this proposal is not to create interesting high-quality content. The author sees the challenge of this proposal as not creating quality content.

However, in items such as Graphics Art, Event planning, .. the specificity has been reduced. Who would work on that part?  What is the salary of the professionals involved? I think it is necessary to explain in detail how the money will be used in these areas. Now talking about the team, we know their names, roles in the project, and very brief history.

The proponent said that would document all of our achievements and contributions in a full report that will be publicly available. But where will this report be posted? how often? It would be interesting to know how long these updates would be released or if they would only be at the end of each phase ( I would like at least monthly reports to be shared with the Cardano community).

They are all influential in the community and will most likely promote the program to the community (friends, colleagues, fans and attract more new users). However, promoting the program through celebrity guests is just speculation, I wonder if you have any marketing plans for the program to directly increase the number of users of the new, universal cardano ecosystem to those who haven't tried blockchain yet?\nOverall, I feel your idea addresses with the KPI/key metric of the challenge and like you said, if it's done, gets communicated to spread awareness about the Cardano blockchain and to make it a fun place to be.

Thus, the proponent has properly represented the challenge of the broadcast - how to get viewers involved. The same goes for challenge settings. Therefore, the proposer has addressed the right challenge of  Ecosystem maturity requirements -Increasing the number of dapps for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.This is also aligned with the challenge setting. With a group of very determined Cardano trailblazers, I think it would be thoroughlier to recruit members with experience in marketing, communication, script editing, filming, photography, and program organization,... which I think is necessary to make an exciting program.\nIn general, this section is also not very well built.

At this stage, there is a full indication in the proposal regarding how they will report back, and it seems to me that there is a great interest in Cardano and this will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas and spread the word inspiration for many projects like this around the world.
