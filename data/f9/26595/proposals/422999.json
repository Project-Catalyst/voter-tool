I have doubts about the impact this proposal might have on the Cardano ecosystem. Who has successfully used an interactive \u2018planetary\u2019 based map previously in other domains/industries to explore an ecosystem?  The PoC provided looks nice ( and understandingly it is currently a limited, featureless, and unfinished product) but who will really use the finished version to explore the dApps and tools of the ecosystem? Beyond seeing the overall size of the ecosystem and perhaps the links between projects, what will the audience learn? With limited funding available, I would judge this visual tool as something nice to have, but definitely not critical or particularly effective towards the goal of learning about the Cardano ecosystem, and the target audience for this tool to be limited. The project does add value to the ecosystem, but does it add enough value to justify almost $100K of funding? I am not sure it does.\n\nIn my opinion, this proposal does address the challenge - but not in an effective way.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposer gave a good account of what experience and skill sets will be necessary to deliver on the proposal.

The budget seems to be reasonable to achieve the set goals although that is a lot of expected hours of project management and coordination versus the number of actual hours of development and front-end dev.\n\nThe proposal does offer a realistic timetable to complete the work ( 4 months) and some of the resources necessary to implement the proposal.\n\nThe main identified risk is the effective coordination & management of the participating developers which is mitigated by relying on IM\u2019s & Fluid7\u2019s experience and expertise.\n\nGiven the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provided a clear and detailed roadmap with milestones and actionable tasks, and a time horizon for achievement (4 months).\n\nThe KPIs to track the progress/development of the project are presented but not the KPIs to identify the success of the project ( page views, unique pageviews, unique users, time spent on page, number of people following the project, any other social or interactions KPIs).\n\nI would therefore argue that the KPIs provided can't be used to quantify the success of the project.

The core idea aims at creating an open source - interactive \u2018planetary\u2019 based map of the Cardano NFT Ecosystem With solid research & design thinking in the backend. There are justifiable reasons why this implementation is needed, and the solution is well-thought-out and addresses the mentioned problem. It is very clearly discussed, and information on the actual product as well as the process is well-served in order to be understood and assessed. The proposal's technical parts are very well described, as are the essential metrics associated with the outlined challenge settings.

A public reference to their profile, on the other hand, would have been preferable. I am unable to verify them using any of the links provided in the proposal. This is compensated by a very clear description of the executed plan, which correctly guides me on when, how, and what will happen. It is really encouraging and increases the team's stated skill to see that they have been working hard on the project and have finished all tasks in Q2 2022 and are ready to lead this project to the next steps. I'm astounded by how well the project tasks are organized. There is a reasonable timetable for completing all of the listed necessary work. The project specifies how it will be carried out and which implementation will be used. Given the timeframe and milestones, I'm quite confident in the project's viability, not to mention that the budget breakdown is handled beautifully. The team requested an amount of $91,780 to cover a timeframe of 4 months from August to November 2022 and given all the explicit details included regarding the cost for each necessary component, hourly rate for each role, and the number of working hours, I consider it to be reasonable and comprehensive.

I fully agree that this solution is viable for addressing the requirements that this challenge poses.

According to the description, the implementation team is quite young in coordination & management, but they have found themselves with support from experts in the field they are building.

I believe these measures will mitigate the risks of lack of engagament. The budget and timeline are very reasonable and realistic.
