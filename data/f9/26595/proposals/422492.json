The tokens can then be transferred back to copper seed safe team an exchanged for a copper seed safe kit to store their seed phrase. The company is already running and selling these seed phrase kits and this solution brings an open source plugin into the ecosystem for people to use to purchase the seed phrase kit with their acquired tokens. The initiative helps newcomers in a number of ways including encouraging them to stake to SPOs, getting them to pay for an item and then also to use a seed phrase solution to keep their seed phrase safe. They intend to distribute their tokens into multiple token distribution platforms which would help with the integration and usage of this token. The proposer outlines a number of risks to do with privacy, the open source plugin, the redemption program and how the token actually gets used. The risks and responses to those risks are fair and well thought out. Overall this is a very exciting proposal with a good chance to make a massive impact due to it blending together a mixture of important experiences for newcomers coming into the ecosystem whilst also providing long term potential value to those users and potentially impactful efforts towards decentralizing stake across a wider range of single pool SPOs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For the plan for this proposal the progress is broken down into multiple month groupings of work. The first starts with the development of the plugin, then the distribution of the CSST to stakepools and finally the final distribution and encouragement to redeem the kits for those tokens. A simple timeline image helps to indicate where effort will be made at different stages throughout the proposals progress. The budget is broken down into the development effort for the plugin and then the prepaid amount for the 1000 copper seed phrase kits. The amounts are fair and reasonable for the execution effort needed and are sensible in terms of the amount of kits to start with. In regards to the team the copper seed safe team details are listed with the founders twitter page also included who is called Dean. Existing stake pool operator collaborations are also included such as with Stef from Rabbit Hole Pool with their stake pool information. The only missing person for this proposal is the developer for the plugin which adds a minor risk to the execution of the proposal. Overall it appears likely this proposal will be executed feasibly due to the business already being set up and running with evidence to support that and the evidence of the background of the people involved showing the right supporting skill sets to execute this proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of tracking progress the proposal outlines the delivery of keys parts of the proposal and the expected date for that to happen.

In terms of success the proposer mentions that this would include an open source plugin for the community to benefit from and that people get the benefits of the product with a goal to reach 1000 different people in the ecosystem. The fact that this widget will be open source for the community to use and adapt is a fantastic way in which this proposal will be both auditable and also highly valuable to the community to tweak and use for themselves. The clarity of this proposal is clear and concise on what will be delivered by the proposer and the objectives are specific against what they are trying to deliver.

WordPress is said to be the most used free and open-source content management system. I remember catalyst proposals with the goal of paying for ADA plugin development( example CardanoPress). The proposer has found few plugins for ADA payment in WordPress and will use it as a base. In addition, the proposal aims to put (to be offered free of charge funded from the proposal ) a minimum of 1000 Copper Seed Safe kits and onboard single pool SPOs to offer Copper Seed Safe Tokens to attract more delegators. There are a few unanswered questions in the proposal like how will the copper seed tokens will be adding value in places other than in copper seed dApp and why should catalyst funds be used to market Copper seed safe.  However, the use of Copper seed safe and the WordPress plugin by itself can be used to justify the proposal. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is from a joint team of Copper seed business owner Dean Wenick and a few SPOs. The lead proposer Dean Wenick is selling Copper Seed safe for approximately $14 worldwide. The site also offers the option to pay with ADA. The unique team of e-commerce business person focussing solely on Cardano and SPO provide a distinct advantage.  Dean Wenick claims to have more than 10 years of experience in WordPress development and will oversee the development of the plugin for accepting Cardano Native Assets.

The WordPress plugin work is expected to be completed in 3 months by leveraging already available plugins. $25K has been earmarked for identifying and improving the already available plugin. There is a need for more information of what is the quantum of improvement required to carry out and how many plugins are already available.

While in my opinion the latter point is actually not something that needs to be funded by catalyst funds, the first two objectives are sure very worthwhile and very much in the sense of Cardanos mission by supporting decentralisation and commercial adaption and also by providing some more utility to other native tokens. Hence, I think this will be beneficial to the Cardano ecosystem. Also, in my opinion the proposal should be able to scale.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "What is good in the implementation plan: The proposers are transparent about themselves and their already existing work. Some milestones exist that define some tasks that make sense in the larger picture and enable to see what will be done and when. The commitment to Open Source is very commendable. Also, some risk and contigency discussions have been made that catch some of the possible hurdles.\nWhat could be improved regarding feasibility: The responsible person for the main task, the developer, has not yet been found. Also, the development process is not really defined in detail yet. While the proposer correctly says that said payment plugins already exist and only need to be modified to accept other tokens, the process in which this is done and the amount of time and development steps needing to be done are not defined, thus making it difficult to at the same time accept a lump sum of 25k as a well-justified budget.

In doing so, the proposal introduces a product, used in this case as a reward for delegators, based on the discretionary distribution of the rights to those rewards by stakepool operators themselves.  That product is also for sale, hence the additional element of allowing it's outright purchase using a custom designed plugin - even though the details of how it operates are not 100% clear.\n\nOverall, the project uses the recurring sale of the physical item, which is pretty cool, as a sustainability element.  And in that regard, as well as the compatibility of Cardano in the purchase process, the proposal seems to be appropriately located in the Dapps, Products, and Integrations challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "My neutrality on feasibility for this proposals is partly due to a lack of any identity or relevant experience from the proposal team.  There is a Twitter profile posted for Dean Wenick in the links section, a self described photographer and founder of Copper Seed Safe last year.\n\nAs it goes on, the budget breakdown provided in the feasibility section is basic, and results in 2 core questions:  1) Does this proposal team have the necessary skills do execute the technical requirements? - the development costs for example have no breakdown in terms of time or team members, and  2) Did he factor shipping into the cost of the 1000 copper seed kits he plan to send around the world? - 10x1000=10,000, however there is no budget allocation for shipping costs even-though rates are quickly rising.\n\nBeyond the concerns mentioned above, the proposal does touch on necessary resources, but stops short of explaining clear plans for implementation of technical feats.  Successful implementation also depends on the buy-in from SPOs, and that could be a challenge as the volume of projects increases.\n\nAs proposer discusses risks, he reveals that he does indeed have years of experience as a WordPress developer, although security risks as they relate to the technical requirements of launching a Woocommerce plugin are likely beyond his understanding.   The lack of depth in these central risks to the projects delivery and usability limits my evaluation of the feasibility at the stage where only the proposer himself is responsible for delivery if this project is funded.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer presents a clear roadmap with milestones for delivery of this project, in which he sets a goal for all of the CSST ISO tokens to be distributed on an 8 month timeline.\n\nWhile he doesn't directly define the impact to stakepool delegation distribution with this project, he does set targets from which we will be able to observe if there is traction.  And in this case of supporting attractive independent stakepool selection, it's kind of something we just need to evaluate over time, but projects like this help.\n\nFinally, as a suggestion to the proposer, there was no open source channel proposed for the coding or availability of the plugin.  I wasn't clear what the plan was to make it available, but doing so would be a benefit to other projects that want to follow your lead without doubling up on resources to accomplish it.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2517", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "This is a fair and constructive critique.

I agree with this sections assessment that this proposal effectively increases the utility of ADA by adding/proliferating this businesses product as a purchasable item. While I do feel like this product is on the expensive side, I do very much like the idea of proliferating a culture of security within the Cardano ecosystem to create a more safe environment. What I feel like I\u2019m missing from this section of the proposal is a quantifiable outlook of the impact that justifies a $35k price tag (which is relatively average for many Catalyst proposals).

The second route is the WordPress plugin that will enable ADA and CNT assets to purchase said products that delivers additional utility to the Cardano ecosystem. The second route is a little immeasurable because it appears that this team member has yet to be onboarded but I\u2019m rather enthusiastic about this teams capability to find such a person (shown by their reputability).
