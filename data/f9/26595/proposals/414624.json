The problematization raised by the proponents is very real and important to be solved. In general, they point out how the technologies developed at Cardano, with decentralized identities, are very useful and innovative, but are often not adapted for everyday use, especially in developing countries that do not have very high technical apparatus, do not have as much access to the digital world. And it is in this context that Ethiopia finds itself. Many companies, according to the proponents, hire employees thinking they have a certain qualification, when in reality they are not, that is, the credentials are not very transparent. In addition to the problem encountered in the current situation, there is still the difficulty in verifying credentials minted on the blockchain; most companies do not understand the concept and do not have the means to deal with these technologies, as stated here. This generates a huge problem, since the current situation is not good, but there are also not so many conditions to improve the scenario. Even with the difficulty of finding companies willing to engage in the use of technologies that are related to blockchain, the proponents here launch a SaaS recruitment software linked to the Atala Prism program, responsible for issuing DIDs. The idea would be precisely to work with the unreliability of the credentials that currently circulate, in this process of hiring employees. What is explained is that by connecting the software, the issuance and viewing of proof of employment credentials would be facilitated. The technology is called Fairway, and it's designed to handle this entire recruitment process between a company and the job seeker. It is not explained so clearly how in practice this procedure would be done, what is passed here is the concept and the need for such technology. At least, I didn't understand very specifically how Fairway technologies would work, but I understood the context and the solution very well. The objective would then be that \u201ccompanies with few incentives to issue credentials and without the competence to do so can participate in the process of issuing credentials with the lowest possible barrier, while Fairway becomes the credible issuer of these Credentials\u201d. The software would still have the ability to prove that the individual would be the same as the DID through KYC processes; that is, in addition to providing a service, the technology could still prove it in a practical way. Therefore, the impact will certainly be maximum, as much as I believe that some explanations about the technical part of the thing could have been better supported.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal in general is highly viable, but some comments must be made. The script is good in some ways, but disappointing in others. Talking about what would be done, we know that the proposal is based on a feasibility study, that is, would the proposed solution really solve the problems at hand? For this understanding to be made, a series of research and tests must be done, and this is all very well explained and detailed in the script part. We understand very precisely what would be done and how, and actions are well delimited through milestones. Each milestone is explained in brief, for example, we know that the first milestone aims to \u201cbuild a framework for issuing Proof of Employment credentials. The framework ensures that credentials are as applicable as possible when interacting with the following entities.\u201d But not only that, activities that would lead to this result are scored. However, in relation to the temporality of the process, more information should have been passed. In which months of the year would each milestone be located, what is the planned time for each of these activities, which are explained in the detail of each milestone? I would like to know how long each thing would last, how each part relates to the other (for example, would one activity begin immediately after another, or would it be possible for some to develop in parallel?). Regarding the use of funding, the total money is divided by milestones, and each of these is subdivided according to the tasks that would take place. In my view, the explanations given have a good level of specificity, it is possible to understand quite adequately how much each part would cost. Some specific parts could have been more detailed, for example, asking $5200 for 1 month of \u201cdevoting one backend developer on our team to build ProofSpace integration with previous DID experience development experience for 1 months\u201d. But we don't know if he would dedicate himself full-time to that, or if it would be a part-time job for example. In general, the work routines of the professionals involved could have been more detailed, in my view, so that we could have an idea of \u200b\u200bthe hourly value of their work and with that we could better judge whether what is requested is compatible with the market. Finally speaking of the team, luckily this part is explained very adequately. We know who would do what, for example: the study of the credential structure of the Ethiopian market would be done by CEO Henrik: a lot of information is passed on about him. What is his resume, his linkedin profile\u2026 If he has any kind of experience with Cardano. It is said that study would be continued by Kidus and Mearaf; we know a little about their professional backgrounds, what they have done so far, what projects they have been involved in before, if they are active members of our community, and if so, how\u2026 Finally, individual information about each one, so that we would have a better knowledge about who we're dealing with. Because of this detail, so much confidence is transmitted in the team; the provision of the above information is essential for this part. I believe the feasibility is great.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents provide us with a lot of detail regarding the auditability of progress. They point out what some KPIs would be, for example: \u201cCreation of a Tangible following framework for issuing Employment Credentials W3C standards and Ethiopian labor law standards and governmental frameworks. We'll \u201copen source\u201d this framework\u201d. Basically other projects can issue employment in Ethiopia by copying our credentials framework + Pilot our solution with at least 3 businesses who will participate to the credential issuing process with us\u201d. However, more than that is necessary for us to have a firm understanding of the development of activities. It is possible to guide ourselves from the script, since it is very detailed. We know what would need to happen very specifically, so I believe that for this monitoring to be accurate, two things are essential: first, that there is the temporal definition that I mentioned in the topic of feasibility. If we know when each specific activity is expected, it is much easier to find out if that happened or not. Afterwards, it is necessary for the team to make an effort to gather information about the progress of the processes and take this summary to the Cardano community. Ideally, both the partial results and the activities behind them should be mentioned in such a summary. In general, in my view, the information provided in the proposal on progress is sufficient for safe auditability, but this issue of being able to follow the work routines would also be beneficial, if included. Now talking about the final results, I believe that here the scenario of success is defined with a little superficiality - it's not bad, but it could be better deepened. What is said is that the project's goal is to greatly increase \u201cthe real-world adoption of Cardano-based DIDs and credentials and will do so in a market with high potential for the technology and which most needs these solutions\u201d. But how can we analyze this scenario in more depth? First, verifiable data on this claim would need to be provided, for example the number of companies and employees that were contracted using the technology. Then it would be important that the impact of all this was understood both for the benefit of Ethiopian companies and workers, and for Cardano. Could it be that, with the adoption of this technology, companies have come to understand blockchain technology better, using it for other issues? Have candidates who hold Atala Prism credentials engaged with Cardano, becoming active members of our community? The topic is generally fine, but to make it even better, I believe that for both progress and success more information should have been provided and a more careful study planned, even if the proposal does not correspond to the final release of the technology. What is said here is enough for an ok auditability, but it could be improved in some points - still, the topic is not bad.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4031, "q0": "This is a strong, well-written proposal. The main idea of Fairway is to create a platform where job seekers can connect to employers and both can benefit from the proof of employment credentials. That can be done through their recruitment SaaS software that uses Atala PRISM making the issuing and viewing of proof of employment in recruitment easy. In other words, the company is creating a novel application built on top of Cardano that addresses a real-world problem. This not only enriches the Cardano ecosystem but also increases the number of integrations for a more seamless experience between different products. The team has also discussed next steps to further decentralize and scale their solution. For example, that can be done by extending the range of credentials and interactions for Fairway employees and employers. The KPIs chosen are well-defined and are aligned with the challenge goals of increasing the number of dApps and products available for the community and of increasing the quality of products and integrations.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team described possesses a strong skillset and they provide both a short bio and evidence of those skills and experiences through LinkedIn links for all of the seven members of Fairway and six members of ProofSpace. Additionally, the budget description is quite thorough and comprehensive. They divide it according to the plan described earlier. That is, it is broken down first by milestone and then by each activity needed to reach that milestone. For example, for milestone 1 there are two main tasks, which are basically studying industry standards of Ethiopian labor information and credit issuing standards, and the second is studying W3C standards and implementing them on industry standards. Both of them are estimated to last one month. Each identifiable item in the budget has a monetary amount and corresponding deadline estimated. Additionally, the team has appropriately discussed the risks of the project. For instance, they have raised the concern of the model for issuing credits being securely built and having correct incentives in place. It is important to identify risks like these before starting the project as it allows the members to actively monitor and look for mitigating solutions.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has provided a thorough roadmap with clear milestones for each of the four phases designed as well as time horizons for them. Moreover, the targeted problem of candidate's nontransparent and unverifiable work history and qualifications is clearly described and summarized in the proposal. Also, the solution proposed, the main product offered by Fairway, is clearly explained and is effective. Additionally, the KPIs are well-thought and measure efficiently if the plan is being successful or not in achieving the goals desired. For instance, one of the metrics is to pilot their solution with at least three businesses. That in turn will allow the community to check if the project is in the right track. Finally, they have provided a public Miro board to track the progress of the project as well as stated that improvements in the model for issuing credits will be published in their platform (https://fairway.global).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4619, "q0": "One of the HR issues that firms confront is hiring employees who are not qualified for positions of competence. Ethiopian businesses are no exception. Your idea is for PRISM employment credentials. You've probably noticed that thousands of Ethiopian firms hire the incorrect people on a regular basis since their work processes and credentials are opaque and unverifiable. The proposal matches the problem with the Challenge. You have increased the authenticity and transparency of the Ethiopian human resource market by utilizing Prism, and if it is effective, it may be implemented throughout Africa. This would make Africa Cardano's continent, strengthening Cardano's real-world applicability. The plan might be expanded in the future with the assistance of governments and other organizations. The proposal might be expanded in the future with the assistance of governments and major organizations, increasing the capacity of the publisher. The proposal proposes connecting SAAS recruiting software with PRISM, making it simple to release and see \"Proof of Employment-Credentials\" in recruitment. The solution resolved two issues. The first problem is that the tools being developed use modern technology but do not adequately address the complicated circumstances in which people live. The proposal also addresses the problem that most businesses and service providers are unfamiliar with the concept of issuing or confirming \"proof\" credentials that certify employment on the blockchain. And the truth is that many firms in Ethiopia underestimate their ability to hire. The proposal offers a realistic answer to the situation at hand. Because the project has created software to handle the whole employment process and the interaction between job seekers and companies, the program will also be utilized to choose the final applicant. After both the recruiting firm and the chosen job seeker sign the contract, the project's software may utilize this information to generate a Certificate of Employment. This is an acceptable argument since, for companies and most individuals, blockchain is a relatively new technology that is not widely applied in practice, therefore the application to business operations such as the proposed recruiting process is not widely accepted. \nThe proposal has identified three risks during execution. Ethiopia is a chaotic market that has been plagued by war and a lack of digital applications for some time. The second risk is ensuring that the credit model is built safely and with suitable incentives. The final concern stated is that employers may not have a motivation to approve the issuing of certificates in particular situations. The proposal also includes ways to mitigate the associated risks. Concerning the risks of Ethiopian market volatility and a lack of digital adoption over time, the proposal provided a solution: the Fairway platform is completely focused on the Ethiopian market and confident in the development the proposing team can accomplish. The Fairway project team will handle any potential risks that arise during pre-launch testing on Mainnet as a solution to the second risk. As a response to the team's third risk, the proposal would gather the majority of the key data needed for the credentials already in place during the employment process, transferring the legitimate information of the validators to an organization inside Fairway SaaS. \nThe present state of significant global economic inflation influences the prices of products and services, as well as the volatility of the crypto market and the ADA. This made me realize that the ADA's price volatility may have an impact on the progress of your project. And my answer is to recommend that a redundancy be created that accounts for 7-10% of the overall cost of the project, another risk that I see is that candidates who are not accepted or are unfamiliar with the verification of evidence of employment. The solution I proposed for this issue was that the proposing team should promote users by collaborating with recruiting firms and providing additional advantages to applicants who are prepared to accept verification of their work evidence. \nThis is a solid and extremely effective idea for the validation of evidence of work used by Ethiopian firms when hiring employees. The proposed usage of Prism expands the use of the Cardano blockchain across Africa. The proposal's risks, reasons, and solutions are all extremely logical. However, you have not regarded the problem of ADA price volatility as a concern, which makes the proposal's impact less than ideal. My score in this section is 4.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is being executed in four stages and is scheduled to be finished by mid-November 2022 to being implemented on Mainnet. Follow critical tasks and predict completion dates. The tasks offered are realistic and detailed. The proposed first stage's work details would create a framework for producing an Employment Certificate that assures the credentials are appropriate while interacting with entities. The first phase of work will begin in two months, in mid-October. The proposed work for phase 2, which is done simultaneously with phase 1, is to integrate ProofSpace and design a user interface. The integration will involve linking ProofSpace to the project's Ancillary Software and will be carried out in coordination with the ProofSpace team by the developers on the proposal team, which includes a student who has completed the PRISM Pioneer Program. Fairway will also need to enhance its current user interface to accommodate these duties. Phase 2 is scheduled to be finished by the end of October. Phase 3 of the work was completed in two months, concluding in mid-November, and focused on evidence of employment and piloting the issuing of certificates. At this point, the project begins testing, which entails forming an agreement with one of the current clients to test the software in practice. During the pilot project time, the client uses the software to complete the whole recruiting process and then moves on to the certification process with the proposal team after identifying the suitable applicant for the role. Selected candidates are directed to use the ProofSpace App to build their personal DID. After both parties establish a formal agreement on the work post, they confirm it in our platform, and Fairway issues a Proof of Employment - Certificate to selected applicants.\nDuring the pilot, the Fairway IT team will analyze each step individually and provide credentials by manually. Once finished, comments and data are gathered, and modifications and risk assessments are done before to deployment. Following the launch, all portions of the procedure will be handled automatically. In phase 4, the proposed team will install the mainnet and deploy the Atala prism. \nThe project's development is quite obvious and thorough, and it can be viewed on the project's website. The proposed budget of $67,432 covers less than 5% of the challenge. Proposing to align the budget implementation plan with the roadmap. However, as I stated in the effect section, the proposal is not appropriate if the intention is to augment unplanned costs and to influence the price movement of the ADA. This has a slight impact on the feasibility of the project.\nThe proposed group consists of 13 persons who have been selected certain responsibilities based on their professional experience. Henrik Mets\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Co-Founder & CEO of Fairway, leads the project and creates products and strategies. He has prior expertise in digital consulting and technology sales, as well as two years of leadership in non-profit business groups focusing on design thinking. Henrick has also been involved in the blockchain space since 2017, submitting seven proposals to the Catalyst community. LinkedIn may be used to verify information about the proposed group. There is no certification or intellectual property associated with the proposed organisation.\nYou have provided clear and precise information on the project's timeline and progress. The funds and plan that they all devise make sense. Each member has relevant experience to their area of expertise. This is a fantastic proposal, however you have no strategy for the project's contingency costs. So I assigned myself 4 points.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": " The proposal shows indications of project success such as developing a tangible framework for granting employment certificates in compliance with W3C standards as well as Ethiopian labor law requirements and government frameworks. The second measure is to put the solution through its paces with at least three enterprises that will be involved in the certification process. The proposal's third successful metric is the publishing of at least ten employment credentials as proof of concept. The proposal's last measure of success is to standardize the application procedure following the pilot. The proposal also includes information regarding development and achievement milestones announced on the Miro Board app.\nThe proposal defines success as increasing the use of DID on the Cardano blockchain in Ethiopia for regular individuals in their professional lives, as well as assisting businesses and employers in becoming more familiar with the technology. This initiative will aid in the validation of all sorts of certificates issued and confirmed in the Ethiopian labor market and beyond. Because the Ethiopian government is already familiar with the benefits and testing of these technologies in the sphere of education, this project will serve as a measure of the proposal's success and give a logical way to increasing current transactions in the country. Ethiopia has a youthful population of 115 million people, which means that the number of possible DIDs and login credentials in the network established by this project is enormous. The success described in the proposal is tied to the Challenge. According to the project team, Ethiopia has a young population; the average age is 19.9, and the working-age population represents for 51% of the overall population. If this proposal is effective and broadly used in Ethiopia, it will assist governments, corporations, and individuals better understand and apply the Cardano blockchain. Furthermore, this is a proposal that already has a test product and is funded at fund 8. \nThis proposal is a continuation of a previously funded project.

This development team is focused on creating a tool to verify candidates by issuing employment certificates (helping employers get information about a candidate's job history to make the right decisions). I think the development team should add the option of notes for other audiences without employment history (eg candidates who are freelancers, start-ups there's no job history yet) they are obviously good candidates because they have start-up experience, more or less there will be a difference from the rest of the candidates). This idea is realized by providing recruitment SaaS software to the Ethiopian market and connecting this software with PRISM to help employers faster issue and view proofs of employment. The product of this proposal would be a workflow, integrated within the Fairway SaaS recruitment platform, to issue, receive and verify recruitment information, generating Employment Certificates - which will help the process.

The decentralized nature of this Dapp allows mobility for the job seeker as they could access their own credentials. The technical workings of the system are thoroughly explained through diagrams. The real question is about the target market - Ethiopia. The proposer has identified the modest level of digitalization in developing countries. It is understood that this proposal can accelerate technology adoption in countries such as Ethiopia. However, the proposer should provide more evidence that could give assurance of certain businesses that are willing to adopt this kind of service in the first place (specific names of associate businesses, schools, university,...). In theory, the target market should have certain advantages to utilize from. Therefore, the proposer should display more conviction by analyzing the potential of Ethiopia as a target market for this project that could give the necessary leverage for the project. The proposer should also clarify how this dApps, apart from integrating Cardano blockchain technology, could contribute to the Cardano community as a whole. The proposer could highlight how the adoption of Fairway will bring more publicity to Cardano and expand its ecosystem to Africa. The low level of digitalization in the target market could be used to put Cardano at the vanguard of blockchain technology in this country, where Cardano may have an edge over its other competitors in this market. While the technical risks are well-explained, the socioeconomic context in Ethiopia presents a big obstacle to the impact that Fairway could make provided that the country is volatile. However, these are factors that one could not harness. Apart from the main risks that are presented, the proposer may also take into consideration the attitude of businesses and their resistance to change. There is no surefire way to tell that Fairway will be met with approval at the target market. This risk should be addressed with market research. On the other hand, Fairway could be a positive light for recruitment in Ethiopia, opening the employment gateway for a win-win situation for recruiters and job seekers.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap includes four milestones with detailed activities explained. I further believe it is possible for the proposer to include specific time spans for each milestone (dates, duration,...) for clarity. The strong point of this roadmap is the explanation for the inner workings of the proposal. They are very detailed and well-oriented, reflecting well-thought-out plans. The feasibility is even more positive as the proposer has made necessary connections to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in Ethiopia, which means the support from governmental entities. The budget breakdown is fairly reasonable. However, the budget that goes to Milestone 1 can be elaborated even further. What determines the cost of this? The proposer may include the tuition of the certain training courses that the developers are taking - this can provide transparency in the budget for educational purposes. Budget for Milestone 2 is to be announced, which should be quickly addressed for the proposer to arrive at a total funding needed. The team members have specific roles in specific milestones. However, the credentials of the team member should be briefed through (preferably via Linkedin) for better presentation of the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability is positive due to quantifiable key metrics and a designated platform launching on Q2/2022, which makes it easier to track progress.

The Employment Credential SaaS might, if implemented properly, encourage new businesses to offer Cardano based services and goods while encouraging existing Cardano based businesses to propose more solutions.

I believe that providing Employment Credentials to Ethiopians is a difficult task that will not commence on main net until this MVP style proposal is completed. However, some efforts to clarify what success looks like during testing, on the test net, what research can be published, independently confirmed, and so on would have been very beneficial. Simply stating that the proposal will be very useful and should meet specified milestones over a twelve period is sufficient to independently audit this proposal", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4060", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Connecting our recruitment SaaS software to PRISM making the issuing and viewing of Proof of Employment-Credentials in recruitment easy", "experience": "Fairway team:\n\nIs established in Ethiopian market with good connections to local businesses, universities and to the Ministry of Labor\nIs already working on PRISM to connect Ethiopian Educational Records\n\nProofSpace is experienced in PRISM which is integrated into their ID platform"}
