They also pay maintenance fee as little as $0.80 in ADA value. This would onboard users into the Catalysts community, expand the use of Cardano particularities, grow the number of ADA holders in Ghana, Africa and beyond, and inspire interest to grow the Catalyst ecosystem.\nAccording to proposer, Cardano Rent dApp would be the first Cardano Blockchain Dapp in Ghana to transform the real estate sector.

The Cardano Rent Dapp targets landlords, homeowners, real estate agencies and individuals looking for properties for rent. Although they didn't elaborate their partnership with Calogeron Ghanan Limited (a construction & real estate firm procurement and project management consultancy) on which term but they have improved their proposal from the last fund 8.  The team might want to consider elaborate more on this partnership or highlight why it is important that they mention this partnership at all. The team considers trust as the risk for delivering this project successfully and I agree that they will need to convince the landlords to list their properties on their dapp let alone verify that the properties belong to those landlords. However, they see this risk as minimal as homeowners and landlords are actively searching for the platforms to increase the visibility on their property. The project also has the potential to scale up because of the need for sanity in the housing market in Ghana. This proposal fits the Dapps, Products & Integration challenge nicely as it will onboard users into Catalyst, a great use case for Cardano smart contracts and grow the number of ADA holders in Ghana (transactions occur in the platform will be in ADA) which will boost the adoption of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The entire project will take 13 weeks (3 phases in total). The team has outlined their action plan in these 3 phases and provided the detailed budget breakdown. They could dive deeper into the pay rate and number of working hours for the front end, back end and smart contract development. However, each cost item looks plausible. The team also possesses strong technical skill and are locals. One team member, Peter Bismark, has involved intensively with Catalyst and adds to the credibility of the project. They have considered risk and challenges as mentioned earlier. I agree with their view on trust but think this risk would require the team to be more engaging with the landlord owners. As the landlord myself, I would personally consider only the reliable platform in listing my property so the exposure to the renters might not be the only factor that will entice the landlord owners to trust their property with the platform. The competition is very fierce among the web2 platforms (although this might not be the case in Ghana) but I believe that the team will have to carve out their unique proposition here for the project to be a success.  Having said that, I believe the team has the right skill and mindset to carry this project to the end and I appreciate their tenacity to bring their proposal back in F9 and hope it will get funded eventually. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Developers will use GitHub for the transparency and they will also update Catalyst members with their progress report on the discord. I enjoy the fact that the team has provided the extensive list of KPIs making it transparent for the community to audit the project. They also plan to roll out their solution among the other countries on the African continent and that is very exciting as it has a very big potential to disrupt the property market as I read in another proposal in Congo and think that the 2 teams might even consider the collaboration at some point. The team has understood what is urgently needed in Ghana and come up with excellent solution to disrupt property market there with the use of smart contract and Atala PRISM. The Cardano Rent DApp has the high potential for succeed. One thing I would recommend is to perhaps give the name to the project so that it is recognizable or mention the name if the team already has one.

To solve this problem, the proposal aims to build a dApps to connect homeowners and homeseekers with each other. The goal of the project is to provide a transparent and trustworthy rental platform for people in Ghana. Property owners can list their properties on the platform and tenants can easily search for the property they need to rent. Direct connection between landlords and tenants, cutting intermediaries will reduce rental costs for tenants, and also help landlords reach more home seekers. By verifying identity and property ownership of the landlord helps to reduce the rate of scams, tenants will avoid losing money into the hands of scammers who post beautiful homes and charge viewing fees but don't actually own them. A market research conducted by proposer in Ghana showed that up to 1900 searches for apartments and houses for rent are made daily. With the values \u200b\u200band benefits that the project brings to both tenants and landlords, I believe that if the project is built properly, it will be one of the most used blockchain applications in Ghana while significantly increasing the number of wallets and transactions on Cardano. Therefore, I rate this project 5 stars for its impact.\n\nAlso, to make the project more successful, my suggestion is to add the feature of housing quality review to the people who have rented the house. The content of the review will be saved on-chain as metadata to ensure it is immutable and transparent. This will make tenants more confident when using this platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The information of the members involved in the project has been clearly stated and has a LinkedIn link attached. In my opinion, the skills and experience of each member are suitable to carry out this project.\n\nThe budget is divided according to each job. However, the proposer should break down the budget in more detail so that the community can better assess the reasonableness of the budget. One of the additional information that can be added is the number of employees performing each job, the number of hours they spend on the project, and the pay rate of each person.\n\nRegarding the timetable, the proposal has given a specific implementation plan, with a clear timeline and milestones. However, since the proposer also proposes another project in Fund 9 called \"African Journalists - AJEOT 2022\", therefore the proposer should explain more about how he manages the projects so that both projects can be done on schedule in case that both projects are funded.\n\nThe project outlined the use of Atala Prism to authenticate the identity of landlords and tenants, but other technical aspects such as architecture, language, and technology used to build web app and mobile app should also be clarified.\n\nRegarding the risks associated with the success of the project, the project identified two main risks: trust in using the dApp and the education levels of users. I completely agree with the risks stated in the proposal. Educating people to understand blockchain, Cardano, and how to use light wallets is necessary so that they can believe in the potential that the platform can bring compared to other traditional applications. I appreciate that the team has planned to organize educational outreachs and workshops to attract and support homeowners.\n \nOverall, I think the team has enough capacity to carry out the project, but some additional information is needed to make the project more complete. So I rate 4 stars for the feasibility of the proposal.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The project has clearly provided a roadmap with milestones for achievement.

The proposer asks for fund to support this idea. By develop Cardano Rent DApp, it allows property owners to lists their properties for accommodation seekers and avoid the scammers and the middlemen. the Cardano Rent DApp provide transparent information including cost about accommodation/apartment/flats/offices for rent. Homeowners and individuals seeking accommodation/apartment/flats through a constructive verification process (Which will require in Cardano Rent DApp) would help both parties to freely negotiate terms to build trust and competence. This confirms would contribute to the Cardano eco system. In addition, use ADA as payment app for the transaction would give double contribution to Cardano eco system and I like this idea.

They are not only careful to pass on information that would help the rest of the community to monitor the progress of the project, but they drew up an auditability plan in which they would monitor the project's growth.
