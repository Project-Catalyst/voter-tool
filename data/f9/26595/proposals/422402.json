This would create some new use cases, and potentially bring new users from other chains to Cardano. Protocols such as Monero have shown the market demand for financial privacy, and this could potentially bring users who would have otherwise used other privacy preserving platforms such as Monero or Zcash and other privacy coins. The importance of privacy tech for blockchains has always been a controversial philosophical debate, but as the founder of Panther outlines in this blog post, the importance and impact of privacy coins may not be realized until they are really needed, and by that point it could be to late. https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/oliver-gale-digital-dollar-project/\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposing team has extensive experience and expertise, as can be seen on their teams website and LinkedIn profiles.

This one-pager:\n https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.pdf\nhighlights the teams desire to provide privacy enabled compliance, which is something Charles Hoskinson has also talked about at length.

They can include:\n1) more quantifiable KPI's and metrics to track during the development phase of the project\n2) Monthly progress reports submitted to Cardano community and Catalyst members through official public channels\nThese additional progress reports will be essential for the team to secure additional funding in future funding rounds within Catalyst, and this funding is needed to complete this project.

The roadmap seems realistic for the team they have. 115k is a lot of money but developing big solutions needs some money.

Users and institutions will have identity and transaction privacy (difficult to copy and front run), allows private bridging of assets across multiple chains, and access to DeFi in a private and compliant way. The team mentions about the challenge of zero knowledge technology but the team will mitigate this risk/challenge by building cryptographers team and support open source adoption.

They should seek clarification from the community if the question is unclear to them but copy and paste the answers across 2 different questions really raise doubt on their intention on proposal. Although the team might have a ready working protocol on other chains with their own community, the proposal deals with enabling privacy for DeFi and need to be auditable for the community. They have not mentioned any channels where the public can track the progress and see the project until completion.

This enables institutional investors access to DeFi solutions and will increase transactions and TVl on Cardano as well. The project also builds on other blockchain and also will aim to connect those blockchains with interchain bridges so Cardano can serve as a hub.\nCompetitor:\nThere are no explicit competitors named. As the protocol builds on other chains as wellt he comparison between the TVLs could be made. \nLink to challenge setting and other challenge settings:\nAs this protocol serves as a financial product for institutional and retail investors there is a clear link to the challenge setting in creating products that will bring more people to cardano. As a person who works in the financial industry as well, there is a strong believe that this solution brings positive effects to the community and the ecosystem. \nRisks:\nThe risks mentioned are detailed and there are also strategies for dealing with those issues.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Showing of realistic timetable:\nThe timetable is detailed and describes each step with patience.

Furthermore, this would also help to onboard users from other blockchains onto the Cardano blockchain which is not the category it is submitted in, but an added benefit.\n\nOn top of this the proposal would:\n- Infuse privacy into the existing liquidity base of Cardano\n\n- have a wallet connect-based browser integration\n\n- have DeFi adaptors  \n\n- allow third-party wallet integrations", "q0r": 5, "q1": "https://www.pantherprotocol.io/ is already building on several blockchains. Cardano is not listed on their website at the time that I am assessing this proposal. That is a bummer as they have submitted a proposal for funding. I would like to see Cardano added to their website as soon as is possible.\n\nNow, with that advice added in, when you scroll down the website and study out the team members it is very impressive to read up on. Combined, the team has over 100 years experience in all sorts of areas!\n\n- Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)\n- blockchain (and blockchain projects)\n- security and cryptography\n- cloud services\n- IT and Software Products\n- Open Source software engineering and architecture, specializing in blockchain, Linux, enterprise infrastructure, distributed systems, and automation.\n- marketing, biz dev, product, and strategy\n- management consulting and internal corporate operations\n- and several other areas.\n\nThe team experience alone is a very good indicator as to how successful the proposal would be and based on that alone would be highly likely to succeed.\n\nHowever, when you add in their timeline with the milestones in each part of the time line, we are able to get a better idea of what this amazing team has planned out and in what time frames. Reading through some of the timeline, the time frames seem to be a little over ambitious, and not likely to occur in the given time frames as development takes time. However, going back to the knowledge and experience of the team, it is in fact achievable time frames, but no real room for errors/hiccups. \n\nThis is ok as it would not effect the overall success of the proposal, just move it out a bit further, but seeing a bit more time for each phase of the timeline is highly suggested in any new proposal going forward. For those of us who haw written code, developed programs, and the like, we know that each part is very time consuming and take dedication and usually is not completed in the time we think it will get completed in as bugs show up, problems arise that have to be overcome, and new ideas also arise in the progress of development. \n\nWith that said, I do feel that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully simply based on the teams overall experience and past accomplishments.\n\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability of this proposal is not something I can personally agree with, nor disagree with. For me, personally, there is not enough information available in the proposal to asses the auditability of this proposal. \n\nWe can determine auditability from the FEASIBILITY parts of  the proposal submitted, but not in the AUDITABILITY part of the proposal. This is something the proposer needs to consider moving forward. The proposer has stated they will need additional funding, meaning they will be submitting future proposals. \n\nSince this is the case, perhaps the proposer can learn to improve the proposals moving forward. In this proposal the answer to auditability is to simple:\n1). Panther Pool TVL\n2) Number of DeFi transactions via Panther\n3). Onboarding of Institutions \n\nWhile I agree that these will help audit and determine the success of the proposal, a lot is missing and it is over simplified.\n\nThere needs to be more detain in this section moving forward. For example:\n- The panther protocol coming into existence on the cardano chain would be a good way to check the progress of the proposal.\n\n- DeFi Integration\n\n- Zero knowledge proof Services with Decentralized Storage\n\n- a completed zk library\n\n- an evm bridge\n\n- a github link to monitor progress, or team calls going over the progress of each phase.\n\nAnd any number of other things that would help to see how far along the proposal has come as it is developed after funding.\n\nWith all of that said, for educational purposes only of the proposer in future proposals, I can neither agree nor disagree on the auditability of this proposal. Finally I do want to say, based on what they did provide for the auditability of the proposal, it can in fact be audited in its progress, just will have to wait very long periods of time to get those areas where it can be seen how far along it has come.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3237", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14423, "q0": "The idea of this proposal aligns with the goal of the challenge. The lack of privacy in Defi transactions is a barrier for investors who want to participate.

And for the Cardano ecosystem, it will bring more privacy and more wallet integration. \n\nThe risk part has also been mentioned and there is a clear solution. Zero-knowledge proof needs more research.
