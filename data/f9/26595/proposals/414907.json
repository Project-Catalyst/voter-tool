For starters, the project would bring a real-life use in a growing economy and can be extended to neighboring countries with similar issues. Therefore, the impact of such project will be huge and can be considered a RealFi project. The project indeed falls under the challenge's guidelines since it is a dapp built like a DAO integrating Cardano in the field of logistics. Furthermore, the project would have a great impact on small businesses and female small businesses in Cameroun and perhaps other countries in the African continent in the future. Since the project is like a decentralized FedEx service its ability to scale is huge and would only depend on how successful the outreach and marketing campaign from the team is. I look forward to seeing such a project in the operation phase and believe it can have a great impact on the Camerounian economy and on people's lives.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "From the information provided by the team and the links joined to the proposal and the team's planning, I feel comfortable with saying that the success likelihood of the project is pretty high. For starters, the team behind the project is competent and has extensive years in IT and development including Functional programming which is necessary for Smart contracts development using PLutus. Furthermore, some of the team's where involved in Wada organization which is notoriously known for their educational content in the Cardano ecosystem. The team presents an extensive plan on what will be done including their development phases like market research phase and so on. One positive aspect about the team is that it is building the product based on the population needs and takes their feedback as a backbone for their development. The budget is also pretty detailed and included the direction of every part of the funds like salary incentives team, research equipment and logistics costs and so on. Some of the risks quoted in the proposal are lack of funds and the lack of engagement. These risks are mitigated by getting funds from Catalyst which is the purpose of this proposal, this will help the product to be free at first to engage more users. Also, the team will use social networks and content creation mainly to promote the product and limit the marketing budget.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One of the main tools that will help the community track the project is the fact that it is open-source and that it basically means that the whole community will have the opportunity to interact with it and use it and get some data from it for KPI measurement purposes. The team is also planning to bring about some documentation for the community to familiarize itself with the project, they also want to share a whitepaper that will guide the development of the project's features but that will be after their research phase. Also, the project has many KPI that will help the community determine the project's success like the number users and transaction (deals) happening. The project's roadmap is still broad and doesn't include many details about design or development specifics but that is understandable since there is still research to be done to see what the users will request the product includes. No specific dates are given but the team specifies a timeframe for every phase counting from the date of funding which will keep them accountable with the community.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2317", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3969, "q0": "The aim of the proposer is to create a dapp for logistics in Cameroon. The proposer identifies the problem that the merchants and logistics operator are facing which is to connect them in real time within a trusted environment. The inefficiency of cargo operators having to return back to their home base with empty load makes it less profitable for them and also the challenges that the merchants are facing to find available cargo truck to send their goods to their destination makes this proposal a great solution to the problem.

Furthermore the budget requested is also reasonable. \nIn addition, the timeframe presented to complete the project is realistic, 12 months till the release of MVP. \nThe proposer also clearly explains in details of the plan to successfully implement the project, from the reputation management modules using ATALA PRISM to payment processing systems and creating native token pegged to local currency. \nIn addition, the risks that concerns the proposing team are not a major issue since it can easily be mitigated. For example, the lack of engagement of the community can be addressed by the marketing team hired by the proposer. Another concern is the funding for marketing which can be mitigated with funding from catalyst. \nIn conclusion, this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer provided roadmap with clear time horizon for achievement ranging from the 1st 3 months for ground research, following the next 6 months of developing and delivering the mvp till the final 12th month whereby users will be joining in and testing the app. The success metrics are simple and straight forward, the completion of the research paper to the deliverable of the mvp.\nThe proposer also provided with the github links for the community to monitor the progress of the project. \nWith the information provided, it sufficient to audit the progress of the proposal.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2503", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10371, "q0": "The proposal wants to solve the problem \"Trucks in Cameroon are most often loaded for only one leg of their round trip journey\". This is a proposal to help optimize the efficiency of cargo handling in Cameroon by trucks. In the proposal, the proposal's team suggests building a cargo platform (called d-Cargo) which will be built on Cardano blockchain. This cargo platform will connect merchants with agents and truck owners/drivers who can share the transportation of cargo in both directions (going and returning). This brings economic benefits to merchants, agents, and truck owners/drivers. Although the project will be implemented in Cameroon, it is completely possible to expand to the whole of Africa or even the whole world. This project also helps merchants, agents, and truck owners/drivers know the role and importance of Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "They have 3 people in their team: Manfo, Nkalla, and MeMeg. Their team has experience in programming and multilingual, however, none of them have experience in cargo transportation. If they do it without understanding cargo transportation, they will easily make mistakes in building the platform. The roadmap in the project will last 12 months. They divided it into 3 milestones: after 3 months, after 6 months, and after 12 months.

For instance, the team will create a fully redacted specification document; however, they don't mention where these documents are updated. I think the team will upload it to GitHub.

They also set specific goals with the following milestones: after 3 months, after 6 months, and after 12 months.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3183", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14962, "q0": "At first, the author describes the common difficulties that Cameroon - a country in Central Africa - is facing, which is the lack of connection methods between truck drivers and merchants who need delivery services. As mentioned in the proposal, people who want to deliver goods have to wait on the street with the hope of catching some empty delivery trucks passing by. This is completely declining the economical efficiency through random and unsecured transactions. Accordingly, a very practical solution is given, which is building a decentralized application that connects transporters/agents and customers. In my opinion, this is a very suitable idea to deal with such existing troubles locally. Together with the proposed platform, collective data that proves the application approaching capability of people living in Cameroon is also provided. Yet, I believe that a more specific source of information should also be attached for a better verification. Besides, the author also explained clearly how the application works, their developing objectives as well as technology implementations. Generally, there are 3 parties that can benefit from d-Cargo: carrier/truck driver, merchants/freight service requesters and agents. Each of them has to pay a specific amount of service fees in order to keep the application well-operating. From my personal perspective, decentralizing the system as well as building the payment method within a DAO network is a very innovative idea that ensures its security and transparency. Eventually, this would generate a huge impact towards potential customers\u2019 faith. On the other hand, I think that this platform is still missing a credibility system, where freight service users can give ratings on the drivers/agents that they transacted with and vice versa. This might prevent people from damaging their own reputation (ghosting orders, misbehaving,...). I suggest that the team should describe more about whether it is necessary and how they would develop it (for example: high-rated drivers would appear more regularly than others within the same route, high-rated customers would also benefit from earning discounts and vouchers,...). Overall, this is a well-prepared section that offers sufficient information. The solution proposed is also reasonable for such problems mentioned. The risk statement in this part is also easy to comprehend, coming along with well-planned mitigations. Personally, I believe that this is a good project to be actualized and I hope my suggestions above would be helpful for the team to improve their idea.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In this section, a plan stating what they are going to achieve after being funded is given. Generally, they offer 3 different milestones describing what they would achieve throughout the roadmap: 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post funding. However, I think that this is not detailed enough. In my opinion, they should explain what activities or steps would be included in each milestone, together with how they are going to actualize those. By doing this, the Catalyst would have a more objective point of view in order to assess the feasibility of the project. Besides, a budget breakdown is also given in this part with the total amount of required funds being $9,000, which is a quite reasonable figure. Finally, each team member has his/her own brief introduction about specific role and work experience, together with an affiliate link for background checks.

However, they might need to reconsider my suggestion above to make this section more comprehensive.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "From my point of view, I think that the information provided in this section is still quite humble. Although the ambitions for each specific period of time (3, 6, 12 months) is given, I believe that it is not sufficient. In my opinion, they should give more particular KPIs to achieve in the short-term, as well as in the long-term such as: the number of transactions performed daily, the quality of users\u2019 feedback,.. Furthermore, some sustainable development goals should also be settled and followed to ensure the system\u2019s proper growth.

Its is also very scalable as it can be implemented in other regions besided Cameron.\nProposal itself is well ellaborated, with problem statement clear even for those not living in the focused country and the solution seems to address in a proper manner. Some possible concerns from outsiders are also taken into account here (as the 3/4g coverage in cameron). The marketing strategy also seems to be contemplted (in risk management section). This is very imporant for such project success because it depends on the number of users to be effective.\nOne thing that could be added here is the business model for this app. Although the scope for this proposal is only yhe MVP, ans the business model can be better ellaborated on the future proposal for final release, at leasit some insights on it could be brought already, even for proposer to collect anticipated feedbacks.
