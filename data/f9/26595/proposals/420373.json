Process quality control and independent certification is an important use case for Cardano or blockchain in particular. There is a need for a large number of experiments in different areas to ensure success in this field with promising potential. The proposal is not referring to other similar proposals in Catalyst. There were few proposals with similar aims. As said earlier independent teams working on the same may be a great way to solve this critical supply chain quality control problem which has a substantial use case. The proposal is talking about developing a proof of concept for organic farmers in Tamil Nadu a state in India, for the Indian Agriculture sector in general. A more specific use case with the type of product that is shortlisted for proof of concept would have helped in getting a very clear picture of how the proposal would have proceeded. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is from a very strong team with footprints in academics and industry. The team also has experience. The professional profiles of the complete team are available on the referenced website. The technical challenges that need to be overcome in the proof of concept is substantial and to build a practical system exceptional dedication and talent will be demanded of the team. The time frame proposed is optimistic and more detailed task lists with timelines would have helped in the formation of a clear picture of the project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is for 19000 USD. The cost breakdown tasks are very detailed. The development cost quoted is about 40USD per hour as the maximum. These are very reasonable rates and justified. The risk analysis including stakeholder identification in the proposal would have added value. The outcome of the project/ proof of concept expected is not quite explicit. The project will create a mobile app and a web app which will be used for B2B/B2C solutions. However, the proposal is quitting a very reasonable cost for an important area of Blockchain development hence I feel the project is reasonable in audibility.

The proposers aim to combine IoT devices and blockchain technology to provide transparent supply chains to benefit all parties. This could prove to be a huge use case in the future and it is certainly an area that Cardano should be a part of. Fetachains proposed solution will develop a POC to test this out on a smaller scale and the risk versus reward ratio is great since it is being implemented on a smaller scale at first. This proposal is highly impactful since it explores new use-cases for blockchain technology and it aligns well with the DApp challenge setting.

Their claimed experience can be further verified through their linkedin profiles which makes them more credible. However, a big shortcoming in the proposal is the lack of a detailed plan. It is hard to assess the feasibility given the sparse nature of the proposal in its current state. A detailed plan should be provided and split up into phases or increments which clearly outline what will be done by whom. Additionally time estimates should be added to these tasks. \nAn overall picture can be derived from the budget breakdown but it is not sufficient enough since the proposal lacks a clear timeline with milestones and objectives.

This will both enable the proposers to strive towards a concrete goal and it will enable easy evaluation for the community. The same can be said about the definition of success, ambitious and good goals are listed but they are soft in their nature, which makes them problematic to evaluate. Lastly, a public channel should be shared where regular updates about the progress would be shared. This could be in the form of blog posts, a website or a discord channel for example. \nThe fundamentals for the auditing are present with good KPIs, but they should be refined as mentioned above, for now the score will be neutral in terms of auditability. 3 points.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2290", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2992, "q0": "The team has accurately identified a problem worth solving. Building a robust supply chain with food traceability & tracking solutions on an L1 like Cardano blockchain is a step in the right direction.

Accomplishing this will help local small businesses to scale. I do suggest you give Atala Prism a look it would also add an extra layer of credibility, it can be used by the food producers to request loans on other Dapps.

Is it the farmers, shopping malls or all of the above and how will the incentives be shared? Most of the off-chain code to achieve this is already open source rather than spending more time on bootstrapping from scratch you can save more by using some of the already available codes and doing modifications and spend acquiring IIoT sensors.

The number of IIoT sensors could also act as a good metrics-increase number of purchased IIoT sensors shows skin in the game and the supply chain is increasing.
