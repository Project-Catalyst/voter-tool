The plan to onboard 2,500 registered smallholder farmers in Ethiopia is a small but significant step that can quickly scale up if successful. Farmers are crucial members of any community, and supporting them in making profitable and sustainable decisions with Digifarm and Cardano technology will have wide reaching impacts beyond the individual farms. The proposal is also aligned with several sustainable development goals, and the broader vision for Cardano to provide beneficial use cases in Africa. The software uses global satellite imagery, and is already providing data for farmers in various countries around the world. Therefore the technology can easily scale and provide valuable data to farmers not just in Africa but also other countries around the world. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has included references for the team members, that showcases their relevant skills and experience, and they have extensive experience and are well qualified professionals in their respective fields. I would however recommend the team to include someone with extensive experience with the Cardano blockchain, development and integration. While it is apparent the team knows the digifarm software very well, it's not clear if they will have any difficulty, or if there are knowledge gaps, with integrating their digifarm software with the Cardano blockchain. I have removed one star rating for this uncertainty, as there may be a risk of unforseen issues with, as they say in the proposal; \"Develop blockchain technology for putting field boundaries and initial ledger on BC\" It is not clear who on the team has experience developing on Cardano, or if they plan to outsource this work. It may be challenging to find experienced Cardano developers if required, as experienced Cardano developers are currently in very high demand with so many Cardano projects currently being built. There is also mention of a digifarm initial stake pool offering, but no mention of who will be setting up, running, and maintaining the ISPO which will come with some additional technical challenges and risks that the digifarm team may not have experience with. \n\nThe Digifarm software is available and functioning today, with a free demo available on their website.
