The problem pointed out here is simple, but very harmful to the health of our community and the general growth of the Cardano ecosystem: the existence of scammers who seek to exploit honest members of our community by stealing their ADA or CNFTs. The SecurityBot group will \u201ccreate a free Chrome extension to automatically detect and alert users visiting suspicious websites using Cardano as a decentralized database to store insecure domains for the public good.\u201d This will prevent malicious members from pushing worthy and experienced members away from our community. However, one point that I was in doubt when reading what would be done here: how would the criteria be selected on what would be considered a suspicious site? I think this is a very important part of understanding the core of the proposal. The proponents, at one point in the explanations, state that \u201cin future steps (not contemplated in this proposal), we will decentralize this process, to maintain Cardano values \u200b\u200band guarantee the safety and integrity of the process. We plan to create a DAO to allow the community to vote on safe and dangerous links, decentralizing the entire process.\u201d This is an excellent idea as it would make this decision more democratic and better distributed across the members of our ecosystem. But in relation to the now - how would that be defined? It would be beneficial if we had a better understanding of this part of the proposal. Another very positive point is that the group is already well experienced in carrying out this activity to combat hackers, as you can briefly summarize. They claim that the bot has already been used in 85 NFT communities - a suggestion for us to have a better understanding of the impact would be for him to bring some more tangible examples here. What communities would these be? How they benefited and grew better with the help of this project. It's also positive how they specify what steps to take (create a Chrome extension that compares a database of known safe domains with the website currently visited and notify the user if the current domain is too similar to a secure domain + create all phishing links found in a policy ID on the blockchain to ensure that the whole community can benefit from this tool); with that we were able to understand well what would be done and in what order. However, another part of the proposal that caused me some doubt was in relation to the tests and iterations that would be made in the algorithm, to define which sites would be malicious. It was also not very clear to me what \u201cphishing\u201d would be, this is mentioned several times in the detailing of the impact of the proposal, but at no time is it conceptualized - I believe it would be beneficial if the proposers had attached this definition, so that our degree of understanding as a whole was better guaranteed. Finally, the most exact concepts that I believe would be addressed here would be \u201c\u201cCreation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + Integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem\u201d. I say this because at the same time a new integration would be created, which would be the bot, it would work with things that already exist (sites and users of our ecosystem), so both objectives would somehow be well covered. So I think the proposal fits well with the objectives of the challenge, just a few details could be clearer so that we have a better overall understanding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately the script is not accurate and is not in the right way, I say this because, first of all, there is no notion of temporality here. We don't know how long each of the phases - research, testing and public access - would take. Probably the project would not take that long to develop, since the proponents have already executed something similar before, several times. Even so, it would be important for our community to have this understanding of not only what would be done, but also how it would be done. Each of the phases could have their actions a little more detailed; in the first phase, how would phishing sites be selected? How would the modification and implementation of the algorithm be carried out, what would the work routine of the professional who would be responsible for this be like? In the second phase, how would some community members be invited to test the tool and how would the experiences be analyzed, so that the product could adapt as the feedback was received? How would the tool be officially launched, how would the marketing campaign be carried out, which is so important for the proposal to achieve its objectives (since our focus here is, directly, to benefit the members of our community). Regarding the costs of the proposal, the asking amount is explained ok, we know how the total amount would be divided, but it is not possible for us to understand these parts so well, even if there is a little explanation, some understandings are still pending. For example, 10 thousand dollars are requested for the development of blockchain, it is a value that depending on the time that the professional will dedicate to it can be fair or not. If it is a working month, for example, the value is very high, but if it is a longer time, such as 3 months, the monthly salary has already been made more compatible with the market. What would the marketing campaign look like, what strategies would be adopted here, and why would it cost $12,500, an even higher amount than what is reserved for blockchain development? Why would the research cost $5,000, how much time would be devoted to this part of the proposal? And finally, speaking about the team, very little is said about the professionals involved, even though they are already qualified due to their experience, it would be necessary for us to know more about their trajectories. In addition to developing the SecurityBot tool, would they have any experience specifically with Cardano? It would be necessary to report more examples about projects that have involved until today, a good option would be to attach your linkedin profiles, in addition to twitter. I'm also in doubt about the other people who would work on this project, for sure we would have to have at least one more member on this team, who would be responsible for the marketing part - who would that person be? Ideally, all team members and people who participate in the project, even if only in some phases, should be introduced. We would need to know their names, resumes, linkedin profiles, connections with Cardano and so on. So some points are positive in feasibility, but overall there is still a lot to improve as well.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Proponents suggest some ways we can audit progress, but they are all geared towards partial results: number of users using the tool, number of dangerous sites identified; and also incorrectly identified sites and the diversification of the public that uses the tool (which would indicate a success in the marketing campaign). In fact, these metrics are important and necessary, but in addition to them, it would be beneficial if we could follow the development process of the tasks, the work routines of the professionals involved. How can we ascertain whether the phases were being carried out as planned? The first thing that needed to be improved is, in my view, the issue of temporality in the script: understanding when each phase starts and ends, how long is expected for each thing to happen and so on. Afterwards, a greater detail of the respective activities would be quite beneficial so that we would have more accurate material to audit. Finally, it would be necessary for one of the two professionals involved in the creation of the tool to maintain communication with our community in order to explain what would have been advanced in the month, both about work routines and partial successes/results. The proponents do not point out, at any point in the proposal, which would be the channel of communication with the community: telegram, discord, some online platform such as miro/notion/dropbox\u2026 Where would this information be passed on? Finally, talking about the success scenario, it is said that \u201cthe success of this project would be to protect a large number of community members from dangerous websites. Users will feel safer browsing the web3 in general and specific Cardano websites\u201d. But how can this be more accurately perceived in practice? I would like this information to be more accessible. A survey with users would be appropriate here, to collect feedback on how this proposal would have been useful for them in real life, if fraud cases actually decreased, if malicious agents (websites or people) were properly removed; how this idea contributed to the further growth of Cardano, so that more people could be part of the community in a safe and healthy way, and with that more projects are created, the number of NFTs in our network is increased, as well as the creation of smart contracts, purchase, circulation and delegation of Ada, and etc? How can we realize the real benefits of the bot for Cardano? So, there is the suggestion that this research be carried out - which in my view would be more qualitative than quantitative - and that this information reach Cardano members clearly. So I think that this topic, as well as that of feasibility, still needs further delving and considerable improvement.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4051, "q0": "The idea of this proposal is to create a free chrome extension to automatically detect and alert users of suspicious websites. To do that the extension will use Cardano as a decentralized database to store unsafe domains for public good. It is a solution to a very real and present problem. Moreover, the proposed solution not only will increase the number of products available for the community but also will attract new users due to the sensation of security spread. The metrics described in the proposal focus on total users and number of dangerous websites caught. These strongly align with the campaign as they measure the attraction of new users and the efficiency and quality of the dApp created. Besides that, the proposers have also discussed next steps of the proposal that will allow it to scale seamlessly. The idea here is to conceive a DAO to decentralize the process.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The two developers have a lot of experience in the subject focused on this proposal. Evidence of that is the SecurityBot they have built which is a scam prevention Discord bot. Unfortunately, they have not provided LinkedIn links or any equivalents, just twitter accounts and the big projects they have constructed, SecurityBot and CNFTJungle (don't get me wrong, I do believe these projects should have a heavy weight in the feasibility assessment, but it's always good to see a description of the proposers' academic background and past work experiences - this is coming from someone who has been a CA (now PA) for the past four fundings and also prepares performance assessments in the work environment). The budget is a bit overpriced, especially because they have not stated how much time they estimate it will be needed to complete the developments. On the other hand, they have clearly identified where each part of the resources will be allocated. It is worth emphasizing the team has not provided a timeline for the project, which is a serious fault. Furthermore, the proposers have adequately considered the risk of not identifying false positives or false negatives. Unfortunately, this risk can never be eliminated but as they said abundant and rigorous testing can help mitigate it. To sum things up, I wish I could give them a better grade on feasibility but due to the points mentioned previously and to maintain consistency with the other proposals assessed my grade in this topic will be 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap provided is divided into four phases and the milestones for each of them were implicitly defined by the proposer. Instead, they could have explicitly stated them for greater clarity. For example, for phase three they could define the collection of thirty feedbacks and the enhancement of the product based on the top five feedbacks selected as a milestone.  The time horizons, however, were not provided in any moment, which hinders the auditability of the proposal. The main two KPIs chosen were total users and number of dangerous websites caught. These are powerful metrics and they allow to measure if the plan is a success according to the campaign point of view. Finally, even though they have presented discord and twitter links they have never mentioned in the proposal if they would contribute with regular updates on a public channel so the community stays up-to-date with the project's progress.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4675, "q0": "This is at very least a promising idea, something that fills a crucial niche in developing better security on Cardano with a tool that users can take advantage of. It fits the challenge, and could be further integrated into other tools if successful.\n\nThere is some room for improvement. A stronger case could be made here for the record the team puts forward if we could see a little bit more of the meaty data behind their claim. Their discord bot has \"prevented thousands of scammers from stealing ADA from legitimate community members\"? Great! But how do you know this? Thousands is a pretty big number. A link to some figures, or even just some detail, would help raise confidence in the team, their experience, and how much we can trust that this new endeavor will be effective.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasability portion of this proposal is arguably only partly completed. The proposers present a series of milestone with no timeline. The proposers present a budget with line-items and no breakdown for why each amount is paired with each initiative.

This proposal addresses the rising security difficulties by building a Chrome extension that will prevent users from scams. The added gain is the info is put on the blockchain so the entire Cardano community can benefit.\n\nThe goals of this proposal align with the challenge settings because more and more people interact with the Cardano blockchain. Accompanying that is the fact that safety has become an even more urgent issue recently(ADA was the third most phished crypto project in the last 90 days according to finbold.com)\n\nThe future prospect of this project is clear. The proposal will be finished presumably after 4 months and the scam prevention will continue indefinitely as long as the Cardano users keep giving back accurate feedback and experience.

As for the planned timeline, it is sensible, but who is working on what task at what point? \n\nThe responsible work team has proven themselves as they are experienced in the area of scam prevention(as seen with the SecurityBot) and have been cooperating with the Cardano community beforehand. \n\nThe possible risks of creating the Chrome extension are outlined. For example, the bulk of the tool maintenance problems is solved by frequent site testing and assessing and implementing based on user feedback. Legitimate and phishing websites will be distinguished by this method.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal addresses the Cardano community's timely problem with phishing. The solution will resolve it by creating an algorithm that is then being improved by community utilization, reaction, and feedback.\nThe development phases have no clear time milestones. That being said the project will be finished in 3-4 months as specified by the proposer.\n\nAuditable metrics consider total usage numbers, and phishing websites detected. If the extension works for the appropriate websites more people will use it. Growing user numbers will make success fairly easy to pinpoint.

The solution is in line with the installed challenge, concerns about hackers and garbage wedsites that can steal information, loss of ADA and assets will be addressed.

We can suddenly mistakenly press or access a fake wedsite (like the address) which can lose important data such as: ADA wallet, acount, password, etc. I believe that chrome utility is a useful solution and many users. The number of users increases, the security features are enhanced, users will be assured of ADA transactions and use daedalus wallet on GoogleChrome.
