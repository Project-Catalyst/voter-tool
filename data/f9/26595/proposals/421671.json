This proposal aims to integrate cardano with one of the leading open collaborative project management platforms available. This will have a positive impact on Cardano as it will bring new users and on chain transactions. This is aligned with the challenge objective to bring impactful use cases to Cardano ecosystem that help drive more adoption.

They allow in a standard manner to manage project documantations, sprints, schedule, budget, stage-gates, approvals, communication and the knowledge areas in PMBOK.\nHaving one to be used by Cardano community (and potentially by Catalyst funded projects) will be of great value. Going beyond that, it will have even more value for the ecosystem if it can be properly integrated with Cardano blockchain system, leveraging the blockchain benefits/features, and this is the final goal of the Kudo project. In this sense, I see a great fit of this proposal in the challenge it is in, by integrating an existing product to Cardano and creating a new use case (challenge kpi \"increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\").\n\nAs for the proposal hereby presented, the scope is to ellaborate a MVP with Atlassian JIRA (used a lot in agile projects), when the integration will be tested. It is generally well articulated and exposes really well the problem statement, using PMI as reference and show how a project management system can help solving it. One thing that proposer could explore a bit more what features the blockchain will add that improve the experience the tool. Its possible to see its benefits in the white paper/reports provided (such as increase in tranparency and a reward mechanism), but it could tell here in a more concrete way how they would be translated in the tool in a summarized way. This would help to better understand the value proposition for end users. However, Its imporant to say that the PoC report and the white paper are really well ellaborated.\n It could also explain better how the MVP will work, in more practical terms.\n\nA further suggestion for the future, when product is validated, is starting implementing portfolio management indicators and dashboards that will  be outputted from this tool.

It's good that it is mentioned how many months each member will work on the project.\n\nRegarding project team, there's one part-time project mananger (proposer) and 2 people still to be hired.

The author pinpoints the issue at hand and offers us a reliable and solid answer.

Consequently, a project like KudoProject might be a much better option to consider. The team has established mitigation strategies for the major hazards and has identified them well in advance.
