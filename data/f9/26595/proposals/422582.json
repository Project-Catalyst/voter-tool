With all of this experience, the proposer and their team have the necessary skills and experience to carry out this proposal successfully. On the basis of the above said observation, it is safe to say that the proposer is able to determine the kind of people and the quantity of people needed to carry out the proposal. The money requested has been broken down into the various costs involved in putting the proposal into action. For the work that needs to be done, the amount requested seems reasonable. They have provided a list of necessary tasks and a deadline of roughly six months to complete the tasks. The proposal does provide a practical and workable action plan. The proposal considered all resources that might be required to carry out the proposal.

Additionally, they stated that regular updates would be given to mobile wallet in order to add new features and update wallet as necessary. This will assist in auditing the proposal's development as well. The quantity of interactions with the app and the number of downloads will help identify the project's success.  Without additional funding, the proposer has stated that they will keep updating and adding new features to the Typhon Wallet Mobile App as required and for as long as necessary. If there are significant Cardano changes that affect the wallet's core operations and require a significant amount of resources, we will return to Catalyst for more funding.

This amount has been allocated to specific expenses (2 Mobile Devs, 1 Cardano engineer, 1 QA engineer and server costs). However, for more detail, I think the author should add an explanation and calculation basis. For example, regarding the salary cost of the team, The author calculates the average salary cost of 1 hour (or 1 month), How much is the average amount of 1 hour (or 1 month)? How much is the total time to do the job?\nThe team implementing this project is the development company Strica (the author has provided the link).

The proposer has identified a problem or rather a better method to access our wallets through the mobile app as everyone carries around the mobile. Making the cardano wallets more accessible would help attract more users as the usability of the wallets are made more effective and accessiblity is easier.

I agree wholeheartedly that this proposal successfully addresses the problem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea lacks a lot of important information. The little information I have on the team members working on this project comes from the proposal, which states that Mehul, a senior mobile and Cardano engineer, would be leading it. No information about other members is included in the proposal directly, although there is a link to their website, it can\u2019t be neither found nor checked. So all we know is the name of the leader and the company website. There is nothing else to be offered to identify the team member's expertise and competency, whether they are capable of completing the work as stated. A brief presentation of the core team's expertise and competencies in relation to the project's development, together with links to identify each of them, will significantly boost the proposal's viability and transparency. Budget-wise, the proposal includes a budget breakdown covering for 6 months. A total of $245,000 is a big sum so it is crucial to offer a rationale for the large amount of funds being requested. The author of this already lists the total salary for each different role engaging but there is still room for improvements. I believe the team could try this calculation numbers of experts x monthly rate x 6 months in order to clarify the fairness of the quoted salary. I know it is quick and easy to figure out the monthly rate from the proposal but a better level of detail would be better. Another concern I have is certain costs are going to be higher than expected. For instance, the average salary per month for a mobile developer typically falls between $7,012 and $9,395 while that of a mobile developer in this proposal is only $5,000. I can\u2019t say for sure if this $5,000 is fair or not without a mention of exact working hours. I would recommend to the team that they calculate these costs based on the actual job market. As for the plan to execute this project, that should be accomplished within a six-month time frame. There is no real roadmap to give a precise overview of how this plan would be implemented. How about splitting the roadmap into phases and including milestones for each so that we will know how the tasks are conducted chronologically.

It also speaks well for a clear success definition. Similarly, It is also encouraging that the incremental updates would be made available on a regular basis; as their website is the sole source mentioned, I assume that this means they will be updated there.

However, for a project with many features that can be used on both Android and IOS operating systems, the risk mentioned above may not be sufficient. I can offer the following advice: currently, there are many Digibank or E-Mobile Banking systems that are easy for bad guys to infiltrate and steal users' data and money, but no bank has thoroughly addressed this issue. So, as a mobile wallet, how will the author ensure that it is not exploited by bad actors?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Let's start with the budget! We have only four spending items with total funding of up to $ 245,000, which is a relatively large amount. Nonetheless, the author makes it clear how each item will be counted, which I appreciate. Furthermore, we see that the project will be finished in 6 months and will officially launch to users in the last month of 2022. The proposer's plan, however, is not as detailed as what is required in this section. Please provide the roadmap and milestones of the plan as completely as possible so that voters and assessors can understand the project's plan. Furthermore, we know that Strica company is in charge of this project, and the author has attached the company's website to help investors better understand this business. But even so, it would be preferable if the proposer briefly outlines the main features as well as summarizes the company's achievements. Also, instead of simply stating the name of the person in charge of development, including information about that person, such as experience, education, or simply LinkedIn, because not all investors can capture all of the information about the Senior Mobile & Cardano Engineer.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I completely agree with the team's expectation of success. All Cardano users will have a user-friendly mobile wallet application and will be able to conduct most blockchain, DApp, and other interactions. However, we do not have the necessary timelines to measure the project's development progress. Please provide the necessary timeline as well as an estimated number of users after each action to help voters avoid misjudging the project's success.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4104", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "We have mentioned our company details in the feasibility and the person in charge. We shouldn't be required to mention each and every company member or developers into this proposal."}, {"id": 14882, "q0": "The team realised that one of the disavantage of Cardano is the ecosystem lacks mobile wallet options. That is why this proposal gives the idea of a multi feature, Ledger and Trezoe linked, non-custodial wallet for mobile phones (both iOS and android). This wallet is already exist in Web version and google extention, it provides all features from NFTs, delegation, staking, multiple accounts... Once this app is launched, users will have a new option for mobile wallet that make their transactions on Cardano easier hence attract more people to Cardano.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project has a big advantage is that there is already a web version of the wallet, the team already has experience in making the content and all the features. The team estimate the time to complete the developement is 6 months. Yet they still need to add a proper detailed plan inclduing the timeline and milestones, divide to smaller tasks with deadlines and person in charge. From the detailed plan we can easily determine the budget. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team should adjust the detailed plan and matching budget breakdown then the community can check the process properly. Since the product is a mobile wallet app, Cardano community can easily check the result of the project by testing the app on mobile phone. However, the team should put a more specific numbers as the targets and made additional actions/tasks to reach the target rather than just saying more people download and use the app. ", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4107", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Create a user-friendly UI/UX non-custodial Cardano Wallet mobile app that enables users to transact, connect with DApps, engage in seamless staking, browse Assets/NFT gallery, and do a lot more.", "experience": "We have developed the most user-friendly desktop wallet for Cardano. We are the team who built Typhon Wallet, and hence we have a great deal of experience building a wallet for Cardano. We are also the team adding Cardano support to Ledger Live desktop and Mobile wallets."}
