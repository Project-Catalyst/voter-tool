As sustainable development is one of the core values of the Cardano mission, there is alignment and impact commensurate with the success of this project. Climate change is a critical problem requiring innovate solutions. This proposal also integrates solving of other sustainable development goals such as ending hunger, achieving food security and promoting sustainable use of farmlands.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The strength and experience of the team are highly relevant to assessing feasibility, and the two gentlemen identified in the proposal seem to meet those qualifications. As there is no past history of funding or delivering completed projects, that part of the assessment is difficult to evaluate. Arturo\u2019s profile shows an initial presence on ideascale on March 24th of this year and it was not possible to find any information on Rogelio. The proposal is extremely well written with attention to detail and includes a comprehensive timeline. The project is quite ambitious and it would have been helpful, for the purposes of assessing, if more information about past successes and involvement in other similar projects could have been provided. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating project and it has been very educational just to read the proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The metrics in which to gauge success and incremental progress are largely found in the timeline. It is quite a lengthy project which claims of a 12 year period before significant results can be manifested. Income and expense reports will be issued at 3 month intervals with aerial photographs included to provide visual verification. A complex economic arrangement is described between farmers, food and biogas industries, pest control applications and government agencies. A few more measurable KPIs would be quite helpful to enable auditing of a proposal of this magnitude, however; enough information coild be derived from the current metrics to have a ballpark idea of progress. The sheer length of the project begs the question of who currently here will still be involved with project catalyst in 12 years?

While this idea is valid, it is not clear in the proposal how Cardano will really benefit from it. It mentions social token to smooth transactions with NTFs, but is is not well ellaborated how it will work, what benefits it would bring and in which phase of the project this will happen. This can even be attested by the project plan and budget which includes only the agricultural part and has no line or task to develop this social tokens or integrate NFT in it. Hence, even though its an enviromental solution, a typical proposal type of the challenge, I dont see a big fit as it is not clear how it will be connected with Cardano.\nOther things that could be clearer here, to truly evaluate enviromental impact, is the potential of Carbon capture by hectare proposed here. This calculation would be imporant to understand on how much this would help on climate change cause. It could also mention in what country they will start with.\n\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "There's a timeline provided, contemplating the mains steps of the agricultural part of the project. there's, however, a last step of selling the products, which should involve a negotiation step that is not clear when it would start.

However, more metrics could be reported as the size of land planted, profit, total CO2eq capture/balance (main goal of the project), water and eletricity used (and generated), use of social token/NFT. Milestones of the plan should be reported also. \nA last comment is regrding the fact that it is stated here that all these information will be available to each and every one of those involved in the project.

Climate change is a huge problem that has arisen nowadays and building a bridge between that problem and the blockchain technology to start production resources on ouw own is a huge step forward when it comes to how roughly we take advantage of the environment. This proposal will initially benefit the productive base, peasants, farmers and day laborers, since we want the farmers to be partners in the processing industry and not just the sellers of raw materials, finally the communities and the environment, with the production biogas and electricity generation, seeing the proposal clearly articulatinf how it will add up value to the whole Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All the team members and their relevant skills, with all the links provided, the necessary skills and resources, a detailed plan and the architecture/langueage that will be implemented are all there and suffieciently described.

It is also quite reasonable and does not exceed any limits given, as each iteam is perfectly described as to why they would need that amount of money. The team members are mentioned and there is a brief description of their skills but there are no link to provide proof of their previous experience and that may cost a bit in terms of feasibility. Other than that, details of actionable tasks as well as the order of execution have been greatly communicated.

A lot of metrics are defined ( jobs within the agro-industrial transformation of nopal, megawatts of electrical energy with really low levels of pollution) that will serve as a way to measure the development of the project; these metrics directly correspond to the partial results, and I think the explanations about each of them are very well detailed and developed. My only issue here would be to really understand how all this information will reach the members of the Cardano community, except those involved from the start of the project. Therefore, I think it is important that this issue be clarified, other than that, I think everything is in agreement about the auditability of the process. Now talking about the final results, I found that the level of explanation has gone down a lot, the proponents only vaguely outline what would be considered success: \u201ca  comprehensive automated platform in 12 years\u201d .How can we see in practice if this has been achieved? Should there be some results sooner than that?

There is a small mention of NFTs and tokens for social good, but this proposal does not meet the impact criteria for the goals of this challenge. The proposal is detailed and in terms of the proposal goals, this would have a high impact at achieving their goals. The growth plan and development of the nopales farms would have a high impact toward helping solve climate change. I can see how they could mint an NFT as an investment in helping to achieve this goal. For example, they could sell investment NFTs that people could purchase for $500 or $2000.

The budget to accomplish this is also verifiable and achievable. The proposal team has the skills and experience to accomplish this as well. I would love to see this happen and be a part of it, but this fund of catalyst is not the right vehicle to be funded.

This project also clearly articulates how it would create value to the cardano ecosystem by putting up measures to curb the emission of carbon dioxide. Moreover, the project also clearly stated a plan for its future sustainability thus by planting different crops and then selling them after harvest to make profit and also help peasant farmers.  key metrics and goals which are to attain significant results in 12 years including comprehensive automated platform, advice and online courses for new plantations units around the world and lastly creating jobs within the Afro industrial transformation and nopal with added value and respect the environment are realistic an well elaborated.

Since it was stated in the solution that they intend generating electricity, investors would like to know how that would be done to detect how feasible this project would be if invested .\nFurthermore, the budget was well elaborated thus included land, Organics fertilizer, contingency and other resources needed but then again, the focus was on the cultivation of crops and nothing about the electricity generation. The timetable which starts from the first 2 months to 14 months of which funds would be released.
