The platform has now completed the creation of an NFT portal and has been registered by many artists, I think for the Cardano ecosystem to grow even more strongly it is necessary to thrive on Dapps, products and integrations different for the community to use, which increasingly stand out as better alternatives to centralized vendors. Therefore, developing a platform like Art Suite with unique, novel NFT products, focusing on mid- to high-end art will attract users and bring positivity to the Cardano Ecosystem in now and future. The platform has a special feature, in addition to creating opportunities for artists to earn more income, it will deduct a part of the revenue from selling NFT for social activities, which has great humane meaning, making more people known to the Cardano ecosystem with the eyes of good will help build the ecosystem to become more sustainable. From the above analysis I think the proposal can effectively solve the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team proposed a very clear plan of what the goal would be and how to execute it thoughtfully with specific, easily trackable timelines. I see that the proposed team has prepared very carefully, the solutions offered are explained very clearly and easily, providing specific information about partner companies through the website, NFT solutions including: purchase policy, clear customer segmentation, minting and purchasing technology provided by technology partner NFT Maker PRO built on the Cardano platform, to provide potential buyers with a way to admire the art NFT on their wall, in partnership with Nano Frames built by Cardano. Technology solutions investment group will cooperate with software company Crosscheck Solutions, Build the new design and brand by marketing company NFT Blue Manakin from Madrid. The budget given for Dapp development is broken down into categories, easy to understand, a lot of work needs to be done, and there are many partners involved, and the salary paid in Europe, including money marketing, in my opinion that is reasonable. I see the positive here that the team has spent their own money to set up the company and organize events, and has also produced certain results that show the team has determination, and a standard of excellence. very carefully for the implementation of this proposal. The company's strong team with the right skills and experience to develop the project, provided through Twitter, website and linkedin, increases the trust of the evaluation community.

From the above, I think the proposal will be successfully implemented.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal clearly describes the roadmap with development timelines for the project to make it easier for the constituency to follow.

The given KPIs are very useful and complete to measure the success of the project, but it is more perfect if the team proposes to provide monitoring tools such as GitHub, or posting. The results are posted on the Web for the community to easily monitor and evaluate the project's development roadmap. The project has clearly described its goals in detail and described its success.

This proposal raises an important issue: the lack of an NFT platform on Cardano that focuses on mid-to-high-end art while facilitating and catalyzing the ripple effect of social impact and a positive environment through the sale of NFTs from each Artist on the platform. The scope of the problem is relatively large. Art is everywhere, in every aspect of life. This project built on Cardano will attract many users and accelerate the development of the system.\nThe team's solution was to upgrade the Art Suite platform and expand the team to accelerate its growth and users while having a scalable impact that benefits Cardano and the ecosystem. Blockchain4Good and NFT4Good. The solutions are described in detail, identifying most of the problems of the challenge.\nThe principal risks of this project are growing the customer base enough to generate enough sales and operating the platform financially sustainably from the sale of NFTs. The team also anticipated the risk and devised a solution to minimize this risk. That is contracting with professional NFT marketing agency Blue Manakin from Madrid, creating an NFT social media marketing team, and reaching out to art collectors, art brokers, and art galleries.\nI find that the risk of competition is also vital for every project. The proponent pointed out the differences that only The Art Suite has. The platforms that exist are NFT marketplaces, which focus on buying and selling NFTs, be it as an investment or for collectors who want to bring digital art and NFT to traditional artists around the world, and combine this with supporting projects that positively impact society and the environment.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is very detailed, has a definite timeline, and has clear goals. The team also stated the long-term vision of the project and the 6-month, 12-month KPI. The proposal's budget represents only 3.3% of the total budget for Challenge. The proponent provided a detailed budget analysis. The budget is divided into 4 parts. Each expense section is presented in detail, with specific explanations and calculations. \nThe proponent provided detailed and complete information about the members. They are experienced, multi-skilled, and globally diverse. Not only that some members also have many contributions to the Cardano ecosystem. About task management. Although this is the first time the group has proposed Catalyst, the group has five projects in this Fund 9. First, I congratulate the team for contributing many ideas to help develop the Cardano ecosystem. But I am also somewhat worried about the amount of work that is quite a lot if all five of your proposals are funded, whether the team's resources can meet the job and perform the right way or not. The proponent explains that they are not only developing the technical side of The Art Suite platform but also immediately starting social impact projects to help develop the platform further. They are doing that by creating interactivity with other blockchain ecosystems and jobs with The Art Suite in Africa and Bangladesh.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The author gives many measurement indexes to track the progress of the project. These metrics are all easy to measure. However, for the community to easily follow and check, I would like to suggest that the team should update the progress and latest information on the project's communication channels every week or according to the roadmap such as GitHub, Twitter, and Youtube ... both transparent and increased interaction with the community. The author clearly defines the success of the project. The Art Suite NFT4Good Platform will be at the top of Cardano regarding users, creators, and transactions.

I would first suggest reworking the problem statement that the space lacks financing of positive social and environmental impact, as the dominant NFT marketplace on Cardano at jpg.store regularly donates (1% revenue) over 10k ADA per month to environmental causes. Voters will be aware of this and will not recognize the uniqueness that NFT4Good can bring to the table. The biggest obstacle that this proposal is faced with is that it\u2019s entering a wildly competitive market that is already saturated with many more recognizable NFT marketplaces that aren\u2019t asking for a very expensive $260k price tag from Catalyst. This proposal has to do a lot of work to bring voter attention to the uniqueness that NFT4Good brings to the table (I would start with \u201cfine art\u201d framing exclusively on NFT4Good specifically NOT competing with other NFT marketplaces), rather than spending too much time on general NFT and Cardano NFT facts. If Catalysts mission statement is to \u201cgenerate the highest levels of community innovation,\u201d this proposal will have to prove to Catalyst voters what new innovations are being brought to the table and why those innovations are worth funding $260k over other Catalyst proposals. Voters will want to see the greater impact on the Cardano ecosystem in this section. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Following the perceived lack of substance in the impact section, I end up ranking the feasibility section a 3 because of a lack of new production coming out of the money being spent. Generally, I think this is a potentially good proposal that has a framework problem. The team has all the experience in the world to efficiently run the business and art side of this operation (they might be short on software/blockchain development skills), so they clearly have the capability to facilitate what they\u2019ve built thus far and beyond. In fact, I think there\u2019s a good argument to be made that this marketplace could be a unique agent of Cardano adoption by displaying NFT4Good to tourists at Hotel Ginebra (which I would suggest implementing in a future proposal if another attempt is required). Instead, it will appear to voters as if the proposal is framed so that they are not able to run the business that they\u2019ve built and they need a bailout. This is where reframing can benefit this section most. If the funds spent on salaries and marketing (where a majority of the budget goes) is seen more as funding for a whole new company that exists on the backend of this NFT marketplace, it doesn\u2019t seem like a bailout at all. In fact, the amounts allocated to each expense seems moderately reasonable if they are funding a startup, rather than an existing company that is already supposed to have provided for these expenses. This section of the proposal can check the box for completion feasibility but it doesn\u2019t seem like what\u2019s being done is actually new which is why I land neutral.  ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I offer a little bit of forgiveness for this section and give it a 4. I think this is the most important part of the proposal and I am always looking for objective KPI targets that are being aimed at. This proposal does provide those targets, with progressing timeline based metrics, but they do not put it in THIS section of the proposal. In the first section of the feasibility section is where you can see that actual number targets that they\u2019re aiming for in areas like artists, social projects, and agents utlizing these resources at 6 and 12 month timeframes. I do think some of these metrics have a rather wide margin for what they\u2019re defining as success but it\u2019s objectively defined and that\u2019s all that matters to me. This section to me appears to be a objectively defined measure of success, that has some room for further definition by providing more target metrics in other listed categories.

However, we lack a competitive NFT platform that can facilitate and enable funding for positive environmental and social activism on a large scale. This was a project that clearly identified an important problem and solved a large-scale problem.\nThe solution was to develop the theartsuite.io NFT4GOOD platform, the project has worked to develop highly competitive thus scaling positive social, environmental, and economic impact. Upgrade the Art Suite platform and expand the team to kickstart the platform's and users' growth, and have an expanding and beneficial impact on Cardano and the Blockchain4Good and NFT4Good ecosystems.

The project will continue to provide educational resources for artists and widely promote Cardano, Blockchain4Good, and NFTs. NFT use cases are diverse, and through The Art Suite, the project will continue to demonstrate that Cardano and NFT4Good's technology has the power to change lives. NFT on Cardano has only been around for about a year. So there is space and growing demand for the kind of platform the project wants to develop on. This is important because there is space in the Cardano ecosystem for the NFT and a platform to connect artists with a global audience while raising awareness, educating, and supporting social and environmental missions. This is a market with huge potential. The potential for future development is great, the project has a foundation, and the team has worked, and produced certain results.\nCardano is a thriving ecosystem with various Dapps, products, and integrations for community use, which are better alternatives to the current centralized providers. The \u201cart set\u201d offers a unique combination of work that brings in new revenue streams for creators, combined with work that supports social projects. The project will attract many creators to sell products on a competing blockchain platform.\nThe author has calculated the risks and given suitable solutions.

They did an excellent job of highlighting the requirements for getting started in the NFT art. Over $23 billion in NFT trades were recorded in 2021, with trading volume increasing 38,000 percent year on year, demonstrating the enormous potential that NFT art can bring to the table. Due to the nature of blockchain, no one can change the record of ownership nor copy or paste to create a new version of the NFT. They can be easily traded, verified, and have no tangible existence in the real world. While NFTs utilize the same database as cryptocurrency, it allows them to store extra information, making them work differently. NFT art is growing faster than ever. Creating a platform that can help NFT artists and everyone who has an interest in it is essential. On the other hand, to be more aligned with the key metrics in the challenge, they have to be able to demonstrate how their project can Increase the number of dapps and products, which will help increase the richness of the ecosystem. What they are concerned about is also the main problem that I was thinking of when reading the proposal. Their approach to mitigating the problem is to create their own marketing team and reach out to art collectors, art brokers, and art galleries. Another good way to improve the user base is to have crypto influencers. These people have an established audience that enables your project to gain trust. This saves NFT owners the time and resources they need to create trust with new audiences.

However, they were not explicit enough since they only listed the work, not the steps or how they will be done, or which part of the team will take part in that specific field of work. This is important because of the length of the project. The community will make it easier to follow the project.
