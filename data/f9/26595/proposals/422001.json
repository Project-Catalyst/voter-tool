I strongly advise you to read the Proposal Assessor Guide F9 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g-iZhDlKhUBZkui1uv8NVNfJC4oVD3JtR-P6Fue7XPU/edit# and apply again in F10. Publish your proposal in the beginning of the fund and refine it according to the community feedback during the weeks before the deadline, this will help you.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2795", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "-\tThe proposer does not specify in detail how that platform will be anchored on the Cardano blockchain.

It is interesting learning about a new way that creates a new \"true digital identity.\" Currently there is a lack of projects that take into consideration an individual's skills and uniqueness in a Web 3.0 format. I believe that this could create new opportunities for users that before MyUnbox wouldn't have had. These opportunities take more information into consideration and that goes against the current form of identify based on a few principles. By creating MyUnbox, they plan on aggregating people's skills into a new web experience that hasn't been done before. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars as I believe it could have a large effect on the current status of the on-boarding process.

This is aligned with the Cardano project by being all inclusive. The more people around the world that can use their project, the more active users will be found on Cardano. There is a detailed roadmap of plans that goes for around 36 weeks. I like that the plan extends of a long period of time. It shows that there is a lot of work to be done, but also that they have thought about the future of their project. This helps the readers of this proposal see where the project is at. These specific dates of completion will allow for the principle of accountability to influence the team's likelihood of successfully implementing this proposal. The detailed budget breakdown is written very well. I find it important when the team stated that they see this proposal as a grant and that they will pay the rest for the completion of this project/proposal idea. There are details on where the potential funds will be allocated throughout the course of building. There are certain risks that have been carefully considered by the team as described in the proposal. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. I believe that there can be more room for engagement of the community.

When looking into the potential success of the proposal, there needs to be a main source of auditability. There are two strong factors that lead to the auditing of a successful protocol. The first including the openness and transparency of a team. When there is an honest team that is open with their community, they are likely to build a strong following. They are more trustworthy and that leads to a successful project and in this case, a successful proposal. The second principle is accountability. When developing a strong community, they will likely hold the team accountable for their project milestones. This is generally a positive form of accountability because the loyal community members want to see the project be successful and see those specific dates of implementation come to fruition. The proposal includes proper information that supports their project idea of MyUnbox. It is also good to see that the project has already been building without receiving funds. We are likely to believe that even in the event that they don't receive funds in this fund setting. That they will still do what it takes to follow-through with their proposal.

However, an integrated relationship between Unbox and the community would optimise the commitment to support the success of the project. We believe this will be beneficial in optimising the value of this project.
