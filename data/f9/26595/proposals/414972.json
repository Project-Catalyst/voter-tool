It is about creating a tool that will protect NFTs from copying, a system that would monitor the blockchain against imitators, copymints, etc. It would work by protecting the NFT IP and informing the authors in case of suspicious movements. I think that, in theory, the proposal is super relevant and meets the objectives of the challenge very well, since it would act to make our blockchain more secure, which could encourage NFT artists to mint their active tokens on our blockchain, even if have the option of using another; or also that some projects involving NFTs are developed at Cardano, for example. This would certainly increase the number of users in our community, increasing the number of active tokens minted on Cardano, transactions made, circulation of Ada (once more NFTs are minted on our blockchain, we logically conclude that more payments would be made in our cryptocurrency ). Security is one of the most complicated points in relation to the cryptographic world, because despite the advantages of blockchain technology, all the transparency and traceability of actions carried out at Cardano, there are still cases of hackers and intrusions that cause damage and increase distrust about the technology. in question. A positive part of the proposal would be in relation to its functioning and use; we know in detail what the technology to be developed would provide: \u201cIP tracking by artwork, trademark, project, brand name or artist/creator name + AI engine monitoring blockchain and social networks in real time to detect suspicious activity + Alerts on possible exploits via Discord, Telegram, Twitter, email or texts + Detailed report on unauthorized IP usage and next steps to mitigate risks\u201d. It is explained in great detail how this artificial intelligence would work, what automatic actions would be, how they would develop. Despite being a very technical explanation, it is very important as we have a good understanding of this tool. However, it was a little confusing how artists and content creators could associate their NFTs with this, would the tool be installed on the computer and cell phone, and do the work automatically, as a kind of antivirus? Or would each NFT be associated with it, individually? Would there be any cost to use the tool? I believe that the absence of these more practical explanations also slightly compromised our view of what the day-to-day use of this technology would be like. That said, I think that, for the reasons mentioned above, the idea is very good and can bring real benefits to Cardano, but some important explanations were left pending, compromising our understanding of the whole and thus our security in the impact that will be generated. Still, in terms of impact, the proposal is very strong.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "When it comes to the roadmap, we are told the initial part of the project would be developed on the Ethereum blockchain and only later integrated into Cardano; but the reason for this choice is not so clear, it would be interesting, in my view, for the entire project to be developed at Cardano. If this is not possible, I would like the reasons to be explained. Regarding the explanations of what will be done, they are quite clear, but not very specific. The whole is divided into phases, we know the status (that is, if these activities have already started to be produced or not), a small detail is given about each and what results are expected for this, in addition to the estimated time for the phase to happen . These explanations allow us to understand well what will be developed, with what objectives and when, but the ideal would be that the phases were better subdivided (ie, we knew what would happen each month); and for this to be possible, a more detailed detailing of the activities would be beneficial. That way, we would have a deeper degree of understanding of the process. For example, in phase 2, \u201cdevelopment of image search functionality for the Ethereum blockchain for real data testing\u201d would be done. How would it run? What would the development of this functionality consist of, which professionals would perform which small tasks to make this possible? Regarding financing, the amount requested is divided superficially, that is, we know for which parties the total amount would be used, but it is not explained why each thing costs what it would. For example, how long would the designer who would do the \u201cUX/UI update to reflect Cardano NFT analysis\u201d work? What would your routine be like, why does it take 4500 dollars for that? It would also be necessary for the other amounts requested (14,500 dollars and 14,800 dollars) to be further broken down. Not that the values \u200b\u200bare unfair or incompatible with the market, but they are not well justified. I notice that no amount is set aside for marketing - how can we guarantee that the project will be well publicized, and as many people as possible would make use of the tool, attracting new active users to Cardano? Finally, about the team, unfortunately this part is not properly elaborated, there is a lack of detail to get to know each professional involved in the project well. In the relevant experience part, we have the linkedin of 2 team members, but we don't necessarily know who the others would be, as we are only told which functions would be needed for the project, but not who would perform them. It is important to know the curriculum of those involved, so that more confidence is transmitted in them. So, I think the project's viability is average; some parts are good, but important information is still pending.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "To monitor the process, the proponent focuses on partial results. Everything he pointed out is extremely relevant, but it's not enough for us to 100% follow the development of the stages. In addition to what has been said, which indicates what is being produced, it is important to know how such products are being created, the work behind it. In the script, the professionals' work routine is not established; we don't know exactly who would do what and for how many hours a week, for example. This makes it a little difficult for us to audit whether things are being produced as planned. My suggestion then is that a plan (may be monthly) be drawn up for the work of the professionals involved, how they would commit to this project. Hence, it would be possible for the proponent to analyze whether what was promised was fulfilled; if the activities were being done in the planned time and in the correct way. From there, it is super important to understand the advances, the reflexes of these work routines, which has already been covered in the detailing of the proposal. We know what the goals are, I believe that each metric corresponds to a phase (first metric, first phase, and so on). Now, focusing on the final results, what the proponent points out are in fact the main objectives, but we may need to understand more specifically the reported goals, how and if they were achieved. How can we prove that artists/creators/projects are having their works protected, that fewer scams and fraud are happening in the ecosystem and that more money is being moved at Cardano? I think it says what success would be, but not how it would prove, what palpable way we would have to understand if it was achieved. It would be necessary for the proponent and his team to carry out a study, gathering proven data on what was being analyzed. Perhaps the report of some artists, the estimate of NFTs minted at Cardano from the launch of the tool, a numerical survey on the decrease in intellectual property crimes, etc. This information needs to reach the community, it is not clear how this would be done. Perhaps a written report, some participation in Townhall, elaboration of infographics\u2026 Anyway, I think that we have here a principle of auditability that goes in the right way, but not with the necessary degree of depth.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 8001, "q0": "The problem is that there are many scammers in the NFT market.
