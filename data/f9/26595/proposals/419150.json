The proposal at hand is for building a second game on Milkomeda (they had a proposal on Fund 8 for the first one: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400666).\nThe plan is to make a simple tower defense game but to also include blockchain concepts and to build it purely on-chain (as opposed to other blockchain games who use that term to indicate they have NFT\u2019s or other similar integrations). The proposer argues that having games like these will boost Cardano adoption by growing the GameFi ecosystem.\nAs risks, the proposer lists the normal problems a software project might encounter (delays, poor budget calculation), the fact that some R&D will have to be performed, as building games is not dcSpark\u2019s specialty and lastly that the game is not a market success. As a note to the proposer, aside from listing the risks, you should also state how you plan to mitigate each of them.\nI agree that having more games on Cardano will effectively address this challenge by bringing in more people, but I\u2019m not 100% convinced by this proposal, especially since it\u2019s alluded to the fact that the previous Milkomeda game was finished (Sebastian says that this is a new one), but no link has been posted for us to see what was accomplished there. Furthermore, there is no talk of what the monetization scheme will be for the game, so that it is not just a money dump. Score: 4. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is no detailed timeline or roadmap to help build a case for Feasibility, except for a brief mention that the game will be deployed via Milkomeda in either Q4 or Q1 of next year. Regarding the team, Robert Kornacki (dcSpark\u2019s CSO) will be the lead of the project and it is not mentioned who the other people working on it will be, except that an external company will be contracted to help with the graphics. employee of dcSpark. The requested budget is 80000 USD, which is understandable, because games are expensive to make, but there is no detailed breakdown of how this money will be used.\nFrankly, the planning in this proposal is almost nonexistent and as a person with over 7 years of experience in the IT industry, I find it very concerning. I know that startups operate in a slightly less structured manner and improvise on the go, but building a game is a very difficult task that requires very detailed planning on what technology stacks will be used, who the people leading each of them are, what the costs that are involved are etc. I would recommend that for future proposals, especially those involving the building of complex products like games, the proposer guide be followed in detail so that all this information is made available to the community: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit#. \nAs it stands, I can neither agree nor disagree this proposal will be implemented successfully. Score: 3.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Again, as with most dcSpark proposals, we are not provided with detailed KPI\u2019s or concrete measures of success. It is stated that progress of the game engine will be tracked, but the crucial part of it is missing: how? What are the concrete ways in which dcSpark and the community can track this? These proposals are meant to be transparent so that people can verify what the money is being spent on. dcSpark could easily commit here to giving periodic updates on their social media platforms, to having a certain number of commits per month for this project etc. Due to all the missing information here, I can neither agree nor disagree this proposal\u2019s progress and success can be audited properly.

However, many Web2 games and the platforms tend to exploitative and extracting values from players. We know many publishers and companies release unfinished games in fragmented way and call them \u201cEarly Release\u201d, \u201cExpansion Pack\u201d, etc., often selling those at the same prices with a fully finished product. We also know how Steam is stubbornly refusing to just incorporate KYC and AML procedures so at least we can withdraw our balance to Paypal or bank cards/accounts.\n\nI say we need to break free from these walled gardens we are in and claim what\u2019s us to own and control from beginning. This proposal might be able to pave the way into that reality. Purely decentralized, on-chain gaming might still be years ahead of us, but we will never get closer if we don\u2019t make any steps. Therefore, I support the initiatives driven by this proposal in spirit of crypto: decentralization and fairness to all stakeholders. We might be too old when the imagined day comes, but at least our children can enjoy games without being extracted and exploited too much and in a fairer way because fun and play is a fundamental right of free human.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I know that they got funded on Catalyst Fund 8 for this Milkomeda Game proposal. Two months since the approval and funding Seba already showed us the flashes of the games which means they are on track and is a good signal of the development progress being on track to me. Launch will be near the end of year which I will take as Christmas gift for the Cardano community. Rob Kornacki, one of the OG and Co-Founder of dcSpark, is leading the team himself so I will not worry too much about it. The proposer mentioned risk about the blockchain-based game engine which is a novel concept, but I think that\u2019s what makes this proposal can be impactful. Cardano will have the first mover advantage by pioneering the first blockchain game that is actually running on the blockchain.\n\nOther risks mentioned are standard which we will find in every proposal or project. Still, I believe the community could use more details in the budget, milestones with action plans, and the game developer they are working with for the sake of transparency and probably useful feedback from the members of community themselves since this proposal asked budget of USD 80,000 which is twice the budged funded in the Fund 8 proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While what to measure are fair enough, the proposer is missing the how and how much in order to track the project\u2019s progression. The same can be said in the success part, the definition is okay however lack quantifiers such as how many players planned to be onboarded and playing the game daily/weekly/monthly after n months of release. Maybe dcSpark can also back these numbers up with some market research and comparison to existing blockchain games with similar specifications. Lastly, maybe mentioning some planned updates such as blog or Twitter post and AMA sessions will help the community to hype ourselves about the game and keep posted regularly. I wish the team is having some fun while working on this project so we can have at least the same or more fun while playing the game later this year or next year!

The impact of the project, especially the game engine is immense if implemented successfully. Considering the new technology used, the project is very challenging, however, with the experience the dcSpark had with the first game on Milkomeda, and other successfully delivered projects, I have confidence the team can execute the plan.

In addition to a game this team is working on from a previous fund, they want to make another game that is completely on-chain, in a gas-friendly way, without the need of any centralized servers. The team also explains how they plan to continue building their own blockchain based game engine that they started building for the game funded in a previous catalyst fund.  This is an important innovation that could shape the way blockchain games are built on-chain in the future.  I believe this proposal aligns with the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This team is very competent having already built a sidechain like Milkomeda as well as had experience designing new architectures for scalable computation on the blockchain.  This will come in handy when designing a completely on chain game engine from the ground up.\n\nThe detailed plan and budget breakdown are both lacking a lot of necessary details I think.  The only thing the plan states is that the game will be deployed on Milkomeda and that they hope to do so in Q4 or Q1 next year.  Some more info about the milestones along the way would help show that the team is prepared and has a plan for development.\n\nThe budget breakdown states that funds will be split between contract work for the game development, and research and development for the game engine, but isn\u2019t specific on the exact split each will get.  On its surface, $80,000 doesn\u2019t seem like an unreasonable total, since they are building their own custom game engine on the blockchain in a way that\u2019s never been done before. However, more details about how the budget is actually broken down and how $80,000 was decided on, would help confirm that it is reasonable.\n\nI do not believe their previous game has been finished completely so initially I wondered if that would take away from their development of this new game.  After reading their budget breakdown though, it appears they plan to contract the development of game #2 out to some other game developers so the team behind this proposal can focus on working on developing the custom game engine.  I think they\u2019ll be fine working on two games at once because of the contract work.\n\nBased on my knowledge of the team behind this proposal I believe they can likely accomplish what they set out to do in this proposal.  However, this proposal doesn\u2019t do a good job of showing their competency because of the lack of detailed roadmap and budget breakdown, so my feasibility score remains neutral for this proposal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I do not believe this proposal gives sufficient information for tracking its progress.

The second main thing missing is key milestones to look for when tracking progress.  These are usually provided in the timeline section of the proposal.  Some examples of milestones could be successfully contracted a game studio, or completed Alpha version of the game engine.  \n\nThere is a single KPI provided, and that is they plan to track user growth of their game post release.
