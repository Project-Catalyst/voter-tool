The proposal targets a problem area to minimize cost and improve scalability for token issuance/management, especially if large projects/companies want to tokenize their services/products. This currently is not optimized and even though eUtxo supports multiple native assets to be combined in one transaction, for large scale projects we would need further improvements in terms of scalability so that costs are minimized. \n\nThe proposal, as step 1, targets to provide such a tool which will achieve just that and then as step 2 will be used in a marketplace named GoFunNFT, which will allow selling access to digital content. This will allow Cardano to outreach big players (such as big businesses in entertainment/sports industries) and utilize blockchain to serve their fans/customers, thereby helping Cardano to have more adoption and onboard more users. Also, scalability (of utXO transactions) is what this project is targeting and therefore both tool and marketplace perfectly fits in with these challenge settings.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team for this proposal has already had successful funded proposals in the past and this can be seen from the youtube channel they have provided link to. However, there is no further verifiable links provided e.g. Github/Linkedin for the team/lead developers/project leaders, which is a very important aspect of verifying experience, therefore as a proposal assessor, I see this as a required improvement in the write up of the proposal.\n\nAs a Senior developer myself, I agree that total man hours (3290 hours), rates and total budget ($97500) provided for both TokenMaker tool and GoFunNFT architecture, design and implementation is justifiable.  The risks mentions that token-maker could lead to changes in CLI which can currently be used to create native tokens on Cardano, this could be a breaking change, and therefore the solution of further developing this tool is provided.\n\nThe timeline is split into Sep-Nov 2022 (fulfilling token maker implementation) and followed by its release (Nov-Dec 2022). However, it would have been great if further details were provided on each of these items, such as why 2 months are needed for release and what actually would happen in Sep-Nov 2022 timeframe? The GoFunNFT development is planned for Dec 2022-May 2022 timeframe, however, given the team has significant experience for already funded proposals, I would expect a good detailed architecture/technical documentation, along with features (implementation/design side) that fulfill the milestones given here.

Additionally, improvements and further releases can be tracked via Github. Nevertheless, it would have been much better if further details were provided to include progress tracking for this proposal. \n\nAs a developer myself, I can see that this is an implementation heavy proposal and therefore, must be tracked via measurable action points, for instance: biweekly sprint stories resulting in sprint goals, splitting of milestones into tasks that are posted on either Github progress or some sort of public Kanban board.
