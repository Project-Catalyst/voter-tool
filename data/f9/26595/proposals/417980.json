The pain point which is the start of this proposal is the fact that there is a missing link in the chain of enforcement for smart contracts between businesses or even end users, since there is no way to enforce court orders if they are applicable to a smart contract or dapp. An important note I deem necessary here - such a service, when available, will provide a very strong competition to the \u201ccode is law\u201d philosophy when deciding whether to side with a court order or with a smart contract\u2019s \u201cblind justice\u201d by just doing what it was programmed to do. And the proposers are absolutely correct in noting that, when such features become available so that businesses and end users can take a dapp / smart contract to court and win, we might see an explosive growth in contract automation that today simply is not happening due to this missing link.  \n\nThe team goes to extreme lengths to explain how the system will work in practice and what is necessary for it to gain widespread adoption, and they offer many avenues for development in the future: property custodians, customer protection in DeFi protocols, potentially healthcare and acquisition activities. There is extraordinary potential here if such an on-chain justice model gains traction amongst businesses, so there is no doubt in my mind that this proposal deserves five stars for its potential impact and connection to the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Behind this proposal sits Jurat, a small team of technologists, trial lawyers, fintech professionals and external contractors. They do a fair job at presenting themselves: the proposal contains details on four key members (Vadim, Subodh, Mike and Alexzandra), including their experience, background and key past achievements, so it\u2019s very easy to get a feeling for their level of competence. The proposal also briefly mentions five other members. However, some things are just not right: a good practice for such teams is to also present themselves on their website, but this is not the case. We are also missing linkedin or other social media profiles for all the team members. Even if Jurat as a brand is present on linkedin, but not with a 100% match between the small team from the proposal and the employees shown there. These small bits are for me hints that the team is still probably in its early formation period, with higher fluctuations and people coming and going rather frequently - not necessarily the best news. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the budget. A first note is that this is a very significant request, and the expectation for quality and level of information are very high. Jurat is asking to fund its operations for a seven months period, with budget captions covering the areas of development, marketing and education. Since this product will need significant resources to be finalized, a vital missing piece of information is how does Catalyst funding fit into the wider picture? The proposal mentions that the team is prepared to co-invest if necessary to see this project being launched on Cardano. A laudable pledge, but I would have liked to see concrete details there in terms of how capable is the team to bootstrap its operations and for how long. In addition, there is no discussion regarding the financial viability, or revenue generation. Will there be monetization at any point in the future, and if yes how exactly? Answering some of these questions would have definitely taken the proposal to the next level of quality. \n\nBut diving into the budgetary details, we are provided with a month by month budget that looks fairly reasonable. I would have liked to see more details regarding the bulk of the financing (the development part) especially since it is not clear whether the team possesses all the internal capacity to do it on its own (they mention having developers on the team as well as using external resources - so it\u2019s most likely a mix). If development is 100% internal - that should be clearly stated. If not, then have they already decided on an external partner? What kind of rates have they obtained? Did they launch a request for offers and compared several of them? Have they run any due diligence process on the selected partner, if any? Many questions for which we do not know the answer. \n\nTheir timeline is nicely presented in an external document, which is very laudable. I will not go into the details of the 7 months plan, but the key message is that it offers sufficient details to have a really good overview of the activities - especially since they are all complemented with extensive narrative details on features of their application as well as the reasoning behind going one way or another. \n\nTruly a bonus point has to be awarded for their deep level of understanding of the market they will try to disrupt as well as the intricacies of Cardano, since they offer views from potential future development avenues that are extremely rare in this funding round, and they are also in line with Cardano\u2019s ethos of working with the law / governments, and not around or even against it. Just as an example, they are considering incorporating a court interface directly into Cardano\u2019s computational and settlement layers, but many other similar examples can be seen throughout the proposal. \n\nIn conclusion, a fairly strong value proposition, with some minuses at the team presentation and budgetary level of detail. Four stars. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A very good news is that they will organize office hours where anyone can interact with the team, and they pledge to deepen their relationship with Cardano DAOs. \n\nThe team will utilize Jira for sprint management and Monday for non-dev updates and will measure the daily progress across several performance indicators (deployment to testnet, mainnet, beta release, smart contract deployed). It\u2019s a rather unfortunate choice of words since these are not items that can be actually tracked on a daily basis, as most of them are binary (you are or are not deployed). If this was actually a statement about the state of development of the features behind, this should have been more clearly stated - but let\u2019s call it just a small misunderstanding. They also make a solid case for what success will look like:\n \n- developers bringing businesses to Cardano also due to the availability of on-chain legal enforcement solutions.  \n- businesses adopting the product in commercial smart contracts\n- raising awareness about the solution and its raison d\u2019etre. \n- evidence of traction and mentions in online publications and debate forums\n- 2 million impressions (of their website I think, it\u2019s not clear) following their marketing efforts. \n\nJurat has thus  a solid plan in place to ensure full auditability of the project and they are fully aware of what success should mean for their product, so five stars are definitely the way to go here.

Imagine if smart contracts could read legal decisions (they can not do so currently) and implement them on the blockchain. Imagine if a transaction could be reversed due to fraud or default. The revolutionary implications of having changing legal criteria acknowledged and acted upon through smart contracts is groundbreaking.

I agree with the way the court works that you suggest such as: Docket Connect,\nHowever, you should understand that the purpose of the generated copper box is to verify the conditions and agreements of the two parties establishing the smart contract. When multi-layer verifications ensure that the conditions established in the contract are satisfied, then the new smart contract automatically enforces the agreements of the two trading parties. so I don't think it's necessary to create a court community, and neither is your statement in this proposal: \"But currently there is no method that DEX or DeFi contracts have can respond to a court order\", why is that because the problem now lies with validators of the correct information to feed the smart contract. we just need to provide an information validator either on-chain or off-chain is enough for the smart contract to do its job. For example, other Blockchain platforms are doing it like Chianlink, but chainlink's validators can't guarantee accurate information because they also depend on the honesty of their multi-layer authentication nodes. but now Cardano we have Emurgo company which is committed to do this for us, in addition Charll3 is also developing Oracle validator for us, they are developing very well.

The proposer provides a crystal clear problem statement. By providing the litigation capability to blockchain-based transactions, the proposal would hit multiple strategic goals of the challenge (i.e.,., providing a very impactful use case to the Cardano ecosystem, driving more adoption, growth, and innovation) and strategic goals of Fund9 (i.e., building real-world solutions on the Cardano blockchain and accelerate the evolution of developer and app ecosystem). By now, we have witnessed numerous business disputes, transaction disputes, and high-profile hacks on various blockchains. We may have realized that smart contract codes could not yet reflect all the complexity of business nuances, and a very large portion of blockchain and DApps are not decentralized (which lead to mismatch and dispute of interests among stakeholders). Having access to impartial judges (who are trained for many years to understand the complexity of transactions and involved parties) and peer jurors are important for business and large amounts of transactions among individuals (such as a home purchase). Once the mass population believes that their rights could be protected and enforced on the blockchain, the mainstream adoption of blockchain would be underway. As the proposer points out, Cardano has the opportunity to attract a $10 trillion opportunity from real economy goods and services with this new capability. The proposer has been thoughtful about risks, comprehensively addressing the main risks and providing reasonable mitigations. Overall, this project has the potential to set Cardano way ahead of other layer 1 and propel mainstream adoption for Cardano in particular and blockchain in general. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I strongly agree that this project is highly feasible. The proposer provides comprehensive content regarding their implementation plan via the proposal and on their website. The work has been underway, with the website, white paper, lite-paper, and technical paper being done. The team has a clear idea of their business models and the first use cases. Within the proposal's scope, the team provides key milestone and later breaks them down to sub0milestone for each phase. They share a GANNT chart that makes it very easy to understand the process and later keep track of their implementation.  The team uses modern software development methodologies and tools such as sprint (Agile), Jira and Monday. The budget looks very reasonable and the overall budget is on the low end compared to many other proposals of similar or less caliber I have assessed on Catalyst. The budget breakdown is very clear, and I like that the proposer explains both the high-level responsibilities for each function and the detailed budget by function and sub-function by month. It is also very professional of the proposer to have a framework in place to compare the budget and the actual user of funds for each sub-function. The roadmap and budget show that the proposer is highly experienced in software development planning and has strong domain knowledge in legal areas. The team profile reinforces my previous point. The team comprises four team members with complementary experience in law practice, software development, distributed systems, and marketing. Each of the team members has a strong track record (e.g., owns a law firm, owns patents in digital ledger and cryptography, led startups in a hyper-growth phase, etc,.). The proposer clearly explains the technical understanding and plan for implementation through their white paper and technical supplement. The fact that none of the team members works on any other proposals in Fund9 or any proposals from the previous funds gives weight to their focus and commitment. The proposer also discusses in detail when and in which scenarios they would come back for further funding.
