This is the problem that this proposal tries to resolve by developing an AI chatbot for mobile phones. The idea looks feasible as this technology is not new and there are several chatbot solutions found in various support systems. The proposal is fully aligned with all goals of the challenge by providing clear answers for each KPI. Besides supporting only the Catalyst community, the AI chatbot has a lot of potential to extend its information base to the broader domain of the Cardano ecosystem.  The proposal has also identified two major risks and provided a plan with mitigation actions. As a conclusion, I strongly believe that this mobile app will have a positive impact in both Project Catalyst and Cardano including their communities.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The development team consists of two people with strong background in software development and blockchain technology including experience in the Cardano ecosystem.

In contrast, small teams are more agile and fast to accomplish their tasks.\nThe proposal provides a very detailed and well defined plan for the current FUND9 and it also includes some bullet points about the next phase to be executed in a future funding. I would easily say that this project plan should be a reference point for other proposals.\nSimilarly the budget analysis can be used a reference too. It is clear, it is reasonable, it is consistent, it is broken down to several identifiable items and includes whatever is needed to understand the calculation of the costs.\nThe only missing item I would like to be included is an overview of the design and architecture of the software solution showing also how the bot will be trained to provide more information.

The success of the project and solution is also clearly specified and it leaves no doubts on the way it will be measured.

This is necessary because the information on catalyst is huge and constantly updated. When having this application, helps everyone including newbies learn about official catalyst information, quickly, with new updates, right in focus, making it easier to integrate more new people into our platform. Clearly, This proposal fits the challenge.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are two people working on the project, Cao Thinh and Darlington Wleh, which, according to the information listed, as well as the links provided by the proponent may identify them as experienced programmers, developers application developers, database analysts, they are all experienced with blockchain and knowledgeable about our blockchain platform. With such information can assess their project suitability. However, the proponent should provide information on what work they will undertake for this project, who is the project manager, who is the developer, who is the loser and database analyst, who will be in charge of the communication position,... to prove that the proponent understands, can categorize each position and the number of personnel needed for the project and they also say that there will be 2 more engineers participate in the project. however, they do not disclose who they are, what their professional experience is, what position they take on this project. implementation plan proposed by the proponent will be divided into 2 phases and this proposal is for phase 1 of the project. It is expected to roll out in 5 months. they have specific work to achieve for each month, I think this plan is enough to be able to implement the project if they only do this project. however as the information i read about the proponent he has 2 more projects. I advised him to provide a reasonable time allocation plan for all 3 projects to better clarify the possibility of successful implementation of this proposal. Finally on the budget, the proponent provides a fairly detailed list of the tasks and the hours worked for each of them. normally it would be sufficient to assess the feasibility of the requested budget. however with this project I see the item \"Cost to hire 1 person to update the database for 1 year\" I don't know if I missed any information? as the implementation plan for this proposal is phase 1 it will be implemented in 5 months, it is clearly contradictory. Besides, the job of creating a chatbot to update this data I think is quite easy. I am a telegram community manager with nearly 300 members, I don't have much experience in programming, but I also use the chatbot \"rose\" to continuously update information about catalyst as well. like Cardano information for the community and I know many other groups that have also used this type of chatbot. Moreover, for programming and application building jobs, 50 dollars for 1 hour of work I think is reasonable. other tasks such as data collection, analysis, team management or marketing are simple tasks that the proponent also charges $50 for an hour of work which is not reasonable. From the reasons given I disagree with this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As mentioned in the feasibility, the proponent provided the month-by-month timelines and corresponding results achieved. The progress of the project will be tracked through the Kanban management method in Trello. The recommendation's KPI is determined by the number of downloads on the AppStore and Playstore, and the star rating on that. The above information can be targeted for measurement. but I want the proponent to clarify how this information reaches the Cardano community, they will have a monthly report provided on the group's media pages or catalyst chat groups. Will they report monthly to the IOG coordinators? About project success definition is a chatbot mobile application available in Appstore and Playstore. Ideally, the chatbot is frequently used and appreciated by users. Users will have a good experience and benefit from chatbot responses. In short, the auditability of this project is there, however it can be further improved. so I rate it 4 stars for the auditability of this project.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2323", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2674, "q0": "The point of the proposal is that the information related to Project Catalyst is constantly being updated. Making it hard for users to find the latest information when they need it.\nThe proposed solution is to Build a \"Chatbot-AI\" that can quickly answer most Project Catalyst related questions when the user needs it. The project's product is a Chatbot-AI that will be applied on smartphones such as iOS and Android, which is very convenient for users. Chatbots can answer frequently asked questions and provide Project Catalyst-related information (such as proposal name, proponent, voting, and funding...). It has the following benefits: Saving time and effort; Reliable information; Provide principles;\n\nIn addition, the proposal describes how the solution will solve the Challenge such as:\n-Increasing the number of dApps and products available to the community -> Chatbot is a free mobile application.\n-Increasing the number of integrations that bring together existing solutions -> Chatbots will bring these pieces of information together in one place where people can instantly query the information they need.\n\nThe proposal also introduces two risks:\n- \"Understand the user intent behind the question\". The solution is to deploy the most modern natural language processing AI algorithm.\n- \"The chatbot's database needs to be updated regularly\" they will hire a person responsible for updating the database. With these risks, they have solutions to reduce risks. The proposed team can consider the risk that the number of users is small because they are afraid to download a new software to the phone. The team can develop bots on tellegram, or other popular platforms. I appreciate this project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project roadmap consists of two phases. With this proposal, phase 1 will be implemented in 5 months. The roadmap built for each month is as clear as:\n- First month: build landing page; Design the main functions and user interface of the chatbot; Collect data related to Project Catalyst.\n- Second month: Processing of collected data; Build a chatbot database.\n- Third month: Training AI models; Evaluate chatbot responses.\n- Fourth month: Build iOS and Android apps; Run tests with a small group of users\n- Fifth month: Modifications based on feedback after testing; Application marketing and advertising; Launch the official app.\n* Phase 2 will apply for funding at Fund10\n\nWith a roadmap like this, I value the team with good expertise in software, AI and information technology products.\n\nRegarding the budget, the Group also detailed each item including 3 main parts: Development Cost: $36000; Infrastructure and Deployment Costs (Total $3124) and Redundancy: $1000. The cost details are quite reasonable. Particularly for the AWS Infrastructure for development and testing: $3000 the team needs to be more specific such as how many months to test, how many months to run for the community to use, when the funding runs out, can it continue to be used by the community? use anymore?\nThe capacity of the team consists of 2 members, they are experts in AI, and computer science and have a lot of experience in Blockchain, and Cardano.

Metrics during project development such as Number of \"completed\" tasks (we will use the Kanban management method in Trello); Number of design documents and reports; Amount of Github committed (we will use CI/CD to ensure the quality of our code); Number of unit tests. At the same time, they also give other indicators after the project is completed and put into operation such as: Total downloads on AppStore and Playstore > 500; Star rating on AppStore and PlayStore above 4.5, and other metrics.\nThe success of the project is a chatbot mobile application available on the Appstore and Playstore.\nI strongly agree with this item.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2331", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4411, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is very practical and can be applied to life to bring efficiency and convenience to the community - those who are interested in Project Catalyst. This proposal correctly addresses the goal set out in the Challenge: \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\". I found the team's proposal very interesting. The problem to be solved here is that information related to Project Catalyst is constantly being updated and disseminated through various channels and media, making it difficult for users to find information neatly when needed... This proposal was created to solve an existing problem by building an AI chatbot that can quickly answer most Project Catalyst-related questions when asked by users. This is great because this is a problem that almost no one can do at Project Catalyst right now. While many people want to find concise quality information about Project Catalyst among the many different sources of information, this proposal serves as the key bearer (chatbot) to open the door to the best information. for community. Thereby helping to add value to the Cardano ecosystem (if it succeeds) and fully scaling and solving future challenges (quality information will bring a lot of opportunities for the community to there are ideas and proposals in all aspects of society - understood in a macro-expansion sense). Not only me but the whole Cardano community, Project Catalyst is looking forward to it. I hope in this proposal and wish it to become a reality as soon as possible. With such impact when I completely agree - vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I found that the author and team have extensive experience in computer science, data analysis, web, software engineering, etc... The team also provided sufficient reasoning to explain the related problem. regarding the proposal. The team has disclosed the identities of all team members via the Linked social network link. I strongly support this public disclosure, because it will be convenient for the community to look up the members' identities and verify the feasibility of the proposal. It is very commendable that the team has been clear and very specific about the detailed list of members (not all proposals will work). The number of core members in the team as I understand it is 2 people, these are the key members, and the team may also have other collaborators that have not been identified.\nThe budget is divided into sub-sections (the work to be done) and is reasonable with the goal. The team lists in detail the key milestones in the important work to be done, which clearly shows professionalism. However, as a PA - I am very pleased with this listing, the community can look at it and feel more confident about the feasibility of the proposal. The fact that the team presents the budget in such a clear and detailed way makes it completely understandable to newcomers in the community. That's how I feel about the budget breakdown. The method of calculating the team's wages is calculated by working hours - this is consistent with the calculation of wages of large companies and corporations in the world today - it brings accuracy and outstanding efficiency. . Also, I have the additional question that if Fund 9 has not been funded by Catalyst, will the team continue to work on this proposal? And what other sources of funding does the team have to be able to implement this proposal (from contacting support from other organizations)? I want to know the clear feasibility of the budget so I ask 2 such questions.\nThe plan and implementation method have been fully and professionally stated by the team. This is one of the points in the proposal that impressed me the most (one of the key factors in clearly defining its feasibility).\nWith the necessary resources for implementation, I would like to divide it into two main resources: financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. With the current 2 key members, with professionalism and good expertise, I am confident that the proposal will be successfully implemented (although as the team shares and explains it is a member of the team that is currently working on the project). made another proposal at Fund 9 - but this did not detract from the work of this proposal).\nIn terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. This is a collection of high-tech technologies: Chatbot related to AI applications on iOS, Android platforms, cloud system software engineering, Cardano blockchain, etc... It is mainly implemented by 2 people with a lot of experience and expertise in information technology market. That is the basis for me to believe that the team will do a good job when implementing the technical aspect of the proposal implementation.\nThe team is also pretty clear about the risks involved in implementing this recommendation: Understanding the user intent behind their question; The chatbot's database needs to be updated regularly to keep up with the latest Project Catalyst information - accompanied by two solutions to prevent these two risks. I add a third risk which is Ada's slippage - which will affect the budget. We know that the digital currency market is in a downtrend phase (the price movement in the downward direction of digital currencies happens every day), so Ada may lose value when the team receives Catalyst funds, then the team will face the problem of lack of budget to implement the proposal. So my advice is that the team consider the detailed budget related to Ada's slippage to make the budget request accordingly.\nHere are the questions, and my positive advice, that the team can consider improving this proposal. I strongly agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Through the proposal, I see the team's progress and clear milestones. What I am very satisfied with is that the team has attached the milestones that need to be done in combination with the small jobs that contribute to the big work. It also demonstrates the team's interest in the proposal milestone roadmap. I only regret one thing if these milestones were tied to specific months of the year (January, February - this is just an example) it would be even better. Because it makes it extremely easy for the community to assess work progress, and demonstrate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Having such a detailed roadmap is very helpful for newcomers to the community - they can easily read what the team needs to do at the milestones.\nThe team presented performance indicators (KPIs) and key metrics. The KPI that the team gives is specified in numbers: Downloads on AppStore and Playstore > 500; Star rating on AppStore and PlayStore above 4.5. With key metrics being the number of interactions that the chatbot has weekly; Chatbot response time, etc... We all know the role of KPIs and key metrics in auditing. This makes it much easier for the community to evaluate and audit the proposal. KPIs and key metrics play an important role in proving the transparency and auditability of the proposal. Therefore, I am very satisfied with the KPIs and key metrics that the team has come up with. Having these two indicators in the proposal will greatly improve the transparency and auditability of the proposal.\nOn the other hand, the team stated what success is, it's simply a chatbot mobile application available in Appstore and Playstore - Very practical. I agree with this definition of success. Throughout the proposal is a clear and understandable description of the problems, along with a clear solution of the problem - the team made a strong effort to identify the problem and provide a solution to solve the problem. subject.\nHere are some of my positive comments to build more transparency and auditability of the proposal.

This could become a proposal that will help improve the organization of Project Catalyst and will help all users to find what they are looking for. Most of the time that would be in search of educational content which is extremely important to the Cardano ecosystem. The team plans to address the challenge by providing a AI Chatbot where users can search what they are looking for, and the chatbot will help guide them to the right area to find the information.

There are typically two concepts that help gauge the potential success of the proposal. The first principle is transparency. Without transparency from the team. It can be hard to monitor how likely this proposal will be implemented. However, when the team provides a lot of information and keeps the community updated on accomplishments and potential changes, there is more room for trust and accountability. Accountability is the second principle that plays a similar part as transparency. Once there is trust built within the team and the community. There can be a positive form of accountability where the community will keep the team on top of things. They will help ensure that the proposal is progressing and that it will be successful.

The budget is outlined well and broken down into identifiable items. The proposer clearly presents how working hours for the appropriate items were calculated and grouped related items in the budget.

I also completely concur with the proposal's assertion that one of the major hazards is the information's obsolescence and the best way to gather, organize, and update it. This risk mitigation strategy also has a logical solution.\nThose are reasons why I am giving 5 stars to this proposal \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal goes into great depth on the size of the team, the backgrounds and experiences of each member, and the schedule for development. The budget needed to bring the product to the market is divided up into identifiable items.\nHowever, it would be preferable if the proposer included additional details regarding the tasks assigned to each team member in order to carry out the plan. Even though the 2 main members are experienced IT engineers; the proposal might be more convincing if crucial technical element such as architecture and technologies are illustrated to more easily determine the feasibility of the plan.\nThose recommendations are minor, so I am giving 5 stars to this proposal.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides quantifiable KPIs and indications that are easy to understand for gauging the proposal's success. These measurements match the challenge setting. Additionally, the proposal includes detailed guidelines for monitoring development progress and public evaluation. But no mention is made of a publicly available channel for providing the community with regular updates on the auditing process. I would thus advise using a public method to inform the public of this update, such as making frequent announcements that increase voter confidence.\n\nBut this is minor, as a result, I am giving 5 stars to this proposal.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3832", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Building an AI chatbot that could promptly answer most of the Project Catalyst-related questions when users ask.\nExamples:\n\u2022 \"How many DAO proposals are there?\"\n\u2022 \"When are proposal drafts due?\"", "experience": "Cao:\nPh.D. holder in Computer Science.
