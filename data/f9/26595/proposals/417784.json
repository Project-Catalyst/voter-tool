Since then, there has been a behavior of alienating the game, after identifying the problem, the team has come up with a solution that will provide a game application, only participating in intellectual experiences and cartoon-style actions. the goal then is to direct players to and engage with the NFT market, guided by the SPO...etc. In addition, the proposal also encourages players to create NFTs and trade them. In particular, this proposal will not apply games or gamefi-related terms (playing to make money) but will tailor them to the needs of each gamer. Along with that, the team is committed to integrating this game platform on traditional digital platforms, such as Goog, Twitter, players can experience right on these opening platforms and then lead them to the application. will be suitable for their smart devices, iOS and Android support platforms, thus ensuring a truly sustainable healthy game.\n  However, this is also an angle to attract members of the community who do not want to participate in the game to make money, also a branch in the gaming community.\nthere were 3 risks raised and the team provided solutions for me to optimize them. according to the documentation and the arguments and explanations of the game's components are provided sufficiently, and the specific explanation therefore makes this proposal suitable for the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has specified in August or early September that it will hand over the project funded in F7, and this is a continuation of the team's game project.

As the proposers stated in their original Fund-7 Catalyst proposal, it is great for Cardano adoption to go for low hanging fruit and use a simple, viral mobile game to boost adoption and get more people into cNFTs to showcase the strengths of the Cardano alternative to Ethereum and other chains.\nGaming is, of course, one of the possible directions of the \"Dapps, Products & Integrations\" challenge setting, and if executed incrementally and with the community in mind, a great way to boost users and adoption. It is refreshing that the proposers are trying to stay away from \"GameFi\" language and move closer towards the mobile game community, which leaves only the desirability, ease of ownership and transfer, and seamless integration of the NFTs into the mobile game platform. It would be good to see this aspect of the game receive much more attention in the alpha release.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Since their first drafts for Fund-7, this team has put everything into their Roadmap and shared it on Gitbook. Predictions about deliverables along the timeline where not too far off, and the game has taken shape as promised. Although the proposer seems to struggle a little with IdeaScale (who doesn't) and some of the picture embedding did not work as planned, the mini-rap by Big Joe the Don and the demo all look nice. I am personally not totally convinced about the gameplay yet, but that is not up to me to decide. The team lead and lead dev work together as colleagues in real life and seem to be building this game mostly with people they already know and trust. The documentation is near flawless and delivering on past promises makes the realization of the \"alpha\" MVP highly likely. Some choices of budgeting seem a little odd to me, for example $3k for rewriting the website versus $2k for marketing budget - the website of a mobile game should probably be only an afterthought whereas marketing is the absolute lifeblood as P2P without peers to battle is not a lot of fun, and the Catalyst community is unlikely to provide critical mass. The same goes for the desirability of the NFTs - here again gameplay and marketing are crucial.\nThe sample use cases are a valuable addition to a business plan in the games category and I like the suggestions, for example the \"twitter battle\" example.\nIt is encouraging to see that the lead dev has participated in the Plutus Pioneers and Atala PRISM pioneers and I look forward to see some details about the Cardano-specific design features taking shape. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The transparency and clarity of this proposal are exceptional, with a very detailed Roadmap on Gitbook which has been there from the start of the project, as well as personal emails of the team lead and all relevant LinkedIn and social media contacts to track the progress and ask questions to the team. \nI would love to see the proposers think what they want to communicate about the Alpha key deliverables however, as the timeline promises much more \"meat on the bone\" than the actual listed KPI:\n1. Quantity of features delivered\nI would scrap this and predict/plan what kind of features you want to add to the alpha, and then set targets how to achieve this. The number of features is rather arbitrary and probably not correlated to the game experience or number of users reached.\n2. Social media engagement : Discord and Twitter following size. This is a good metric, but followers are not necessarily engaged - the Elon Musk takeover of Twitter has exposed (again) how many bots and fake account exists out there in social media land. It might be preferable to have online users, interactions, or downloads of the alpha as target quantities.\n3. Community engagement and the desire to be able to play the alpha version. This is a really good metric in my opinion, but may benefit from more specifics.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 10022, "q0": "The proposal is to further develop The Eternal Tournament game and provide alpha phases. At F7 the game has launched the MVP version, to continue to be projected proposed at F9 is in line with the installed challenge. Developing the MVP version, the project shows the technical and experiential development of the game. The solution is appropriate when it comes to the attractive features of the game, the images and videos given by the author are vivid evidence of the game experience activities. The Eternal Tournament directly impacts the player, providing NFT for them, players will participate not to earn money but to have interesting experiences in it. The game aims to build a community of players, create a sense of enjoyment and the ability to compete for achievements achieved on Twitter. The Eternal Tournament has an impact on Cardano, creating the publisher's NFT and the asset transactions created. Games on the Cardano platform have a large number of users that help the Cardano ecosystem grow and diversify. The expansion of the project has clearly demonstrated the ambition to develop in the future with the finishing stages. The risk of implementing the project is that insufficient implementation funding will be addressed if funded in this proposal. The difficulty of attracting players will be minimized with media programs and game marketing.

The plan was detailed on the project's wedsite: https://litepaper.minininjaheroes.io/project-information/proposed-roadmap#beta. We have comments to contribute to the plan, the timelines for the implementation of the author's work should clearly state the completion milestones, the communication and marketing plan needs to be more detailed, the number of NFT collections is determined specifically. I hope the author makes appropriate adjustments to the implementation plan. In order to export the identified project implementation member from F7, the current proposal is a continuation of the project so that the members continue their work. The clear assignment, detailed information about the members' competence is shown on LinkedIn. The project has the addition of members to carry out communication and marketing work, helping the project to complete as planned. The asking amount of $75,000 is in line with the funding for the installed challenge.

Your proposal is very suitable for challenge setting, because it is capable of attracting a large number of participating communities of all ages and backgrounds on all platforms.

I appreciate the presentation and graphic design of the characters, they are lively and easily accepted by all ages.

You have proposed the implementation process within 3 to 4 months, focusing on solving game and NFT issues exactly as mentioned in the problem statement, which is handling issues from employees. , NFT techniques, graphic techniques, visual\u2026 I think you need to add experimentation and testing before final releasing.

When a series of \"junk\" games were born when the Play-to-Earn trend emerged solely for the purpose of profiting gamers and game makers, it brought a negative view to Play-to-earn games. .\nOne thing that makes me have a positive view of the game is that they guarantee the game will not have a \"Pay-to-win\" mechanism, which is the main cause of games crashing when causing imbalance in the tournament. Yes, the NFTs that you sell should be just emojis, music and taunts, this will level the playing field and keep gamers.\nI think the proposed solution solves the challenge very well, the game tries to focus on improving the game's beauty instead of the Play-to-earn mechanics, so I suggest the team can be more concerned about the story in the game, in my opinion, is also quite important to attract players that most other Play-to-Earn games take this part lightly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer says this is a continuation of the ongoing project and this is the Alpha phase.
