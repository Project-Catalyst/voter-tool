I appreciate that the budget is defined by category and per hour by line item.   After reviewing the bios provided, it is clear that the team has technical skills along with interest and experience in gaming.  Their website is well designed and contains quality art related to the project.  I do not have expertise in game development, but the target of Q1 2024 seems realistic for this type of game.\nThe team acknowledges the difficulty of game development in creating a quality game that is fun to play without the resources of AAA gaming studios.  They are hopeful the potential funds will allow them to hire some skill sets not currently on the team and improve their chance of success.\nThe team transparently noted they may require further funding to complete this project.\nThe team has provided a discord where they give updates on their progress.\nIn summary, while creating a successful game is a difficult and ambitious target, the team does have both technical and creative skills and a realistic timeline/budget.

The proposer intends to develop a game to attract gamers who are not familiar with blockchain gaming especially, game in the Cardano. I agree with the proposer argument that many gamers do not understand about game in the blockchain, not to speak about game in blockchain, they do not event understand what the blockchain is. Thus, the proposer would like to introduce the blockchain through the game. Name of game is World of Pirates. It is strategy card game and any gamers can play without paying the dime. Through this game, the team expect that the gamers will learn about the game and technology behind it i.e., blockchain, In addition to this, it will increase their awareness that led to Cardano ecosystem. Speaking about the game, new gamers no need to buy any NFT\u2019s to play the game as mentioned above, only to those like cards/project, then they can invest in esthetics items that offer better performance than standard ones. However, they can still get points and rewards. The rewards can be in-game consumables items or NFTs, that help the player to earn some money once they are ready to learn about the blockchain. It is good move by the team to attract people join in the Cardano since the game develop in the Cardano blockchain. Meanwhile, the team also outline possible risk and also provide the solution which shows a lot of prudence and a sense of reality. Speaking this proposal give many contributions to Cardano ecosystem and also the information has given, the proposal address the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the script, the team is concerned with defining which activities would take place based on the quarters.

This bring positive effect that proposal will be implemented successfully. About the budget, the information is there and sufficient to understand how they spend the budget. Thus, community could find type of cost to make the game. Given sufficient information, the proposal will be implemented successfully", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Regarding game monitoring, I believe the team provides us with enough information to carry out a detailed follow-up, not only of the final results but also of the process. I say about the process because we know what would they do and when, in this way we could maintain direct contact with the professionals involved to talk and monitor the progress of each part. And in terms of the final results, the team divided success into three phases i.e., short time, mid-term and long term. Thus, the community will be able to find success of every plan of the project that they promise.

A free and strategic card game project that can be played with friends. I welcome projects like this because Cardano currently has a shortage of really good and engaging games. Making it difficult to compete with other blockchain ecosystems of games and gaming communities.\nYou mentioned your goal to get players to learn about your game and the technology behind it, and to raise awareness and the Cardano ecosystem. I think you need to explain in detail about this little part, the method that you will use to achieve this. Because I think this will be very difficult, most gamers look to games for fun and maybe just to make money for Play-to-Earn games. To be able to get them excited about the technology behind it. , you need a method to accurately identify potential audiences - people who really intend to learn but they don't know where to start, maybe through questions in the game, thereby bringing them closer. with Blockchain and Cardano.\nThe game is more about fun than rigorous brainstorming. So I hope there won't be any \"Pay-to-win\" feature here, it's a double-edged sword that kills many projects. And if the Gamefi trend explodes again, you need to be really calm and sober, because your game should develop slowly but safely. A lot of Gamefi projects are caught up in the Play-to-earn craze and become \"junk\" after the trend ends, leaving many investors empty-handed and the project will be scandalous and discredited.\nAfter all, the project is quite understandable with the aim of creating a game that is not too inclined to make money but it is entertaining and free. I have no comment because I think most of the information provided is satisfactory, above are some of my tips for the project, hope you listen. I rate this part highly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Thank you for providing the necessary information and experiences of these project members in related fields. I have a small suggestion that if the project returns to the fund later, you should attach the links of the members' proofs (Linkedin, twitter,...) right below their information.

And the Project Roadmap you should add who will be involved in which phase of the project will help the community understand how you are assigning work properly and ensure that the project's human resources are capable of handling the workload of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Thank you for providing your KPIs very detailed and complete.

A nice connection they have already implemented is during \u2018Pawn of the Month\u2019 competitions they partnered with Sea Shepherd and 50% of the money gathered was donated to this reputable cause. They plan to continue this sponsorship model and support organizations that fight to change or improve something, particularly environmental concerns.\nMy concern with this proposal\u2019s possible impact is the game itself. Card based strategy games are not the \u2018mainstream\u2019 of gaming, more a niche market that will need to be tapped into. So in turn, the impact is lessened as the potential customer/client base is limited by the number of people interested in these types of games. The gaming market is hoped to be significant player within blockchain and potential client base in the Cardano ecosystem, some estimates are that there are 2.5billion gamers world wide, we just need to ensure Cardano projects are going to be adaptable for a large proportion of those potential players.\nOverall, this proposal could have a small impact, bringing a niche market of gamers into the Cardano ecosystem. I give it 3 stars in the impact category.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The proposal contains enough details about the timeline, budget, staffing and success criteria to acknowledge it\u2019s feasible.\nThe team have provided a brief timeline, even though the question did state \u2018detailed timeline\u2019, however, further along in the auditability piece they have given further details. Combining these two sections, they have many objectives set aside for each quarter. Given this isn\u2019t a totally new project, there is a great website and resources already in place, which lend credit to the team being able to continue the development once funding is granted. It would be interesting for them to detail how they would \u2018increase awareness of Cardano\u2019 in the game itself, or would it maintain as just a little logo when you scroll to the bottom of the website?\nThe budget / staffing breakdown is simplistic, but does list the planned salaries and expenses. One concern is the high hourly rate listed for the Game Developer and Music Composition, however, later in the explanation they describe planning to hire two junior developers. For clarity\u2019s sake it would have been clearer to state that obviously. \nTheir existing team has a wealth of knowledge and experience directly correlating to the development plan for \u2018World of Pirates.\u2019 They list a social media manager type person, which will be vital to promoting the game towards success, but don\u2019t have a salary listed - but perhaps that is being funded by another proposal or another company?\nA last feasibility note is that they realize they will probably need to return to Catalyst for further funding rounds to develop a fully successful and sustainable game. I guess voters are being asked to fund this proof of concept game, to which then further deployment financing might be needed.\nOverall, I give this project 4 stars for feasibility given the team\u2019s development progress so far and evident commitment to their project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal lists a commendable list of statistics that will be proof of progress towards the ongoing success. They include metrics such as NFTs sold, player numbers and social media engagements. They have set numerical goals for each of these criteria, initially aiming to have >20 players in 2022, to a total number of active players >100,000 in December 2023. \nAlthough they have this detailed list, they\u2019ve not documented where this information will be shared with the Cardano community and those funding this proposal. A simple page within their website, or even just more details on the \u2018Roadmap\n Section could add confidence and support to their delivery of outcomes. Similarly, some sort of financial accountability and ledger for funders to see the spending and money distribution plans along the way.\nOverall, there are a lot of ways to audit this proposal\u2019s success, but the proposers have not made it easy or obvious to find this information going forward, for this reason I give it 3 stars for auditability.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3840", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Very good points and some harsh ratings, but we accept them."}], "solution": "World of Pirates puts the gamer first by providing a fun online free-to-play game, that any gamer can play without paying a dime!
