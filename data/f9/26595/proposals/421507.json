This proposal, and by extension the successful launch of the Landano Dapp, could be one of the most impactful projects launching on Cardano. This project, along with projects like World Mobile, Empowa, and IAMX has the potential to scale and impact from millions up to a billion people with a focus on RealFi in Africa. Landano has already shown early success in Mozambique and Ghana with NFT land records along with the help of successful Catalyst funding in F8. This proposal clearly contributes to the challenge question, and also the greater vision of improving lives in Africa with the Cardano blockchain. In terms of driving adopting this could be one of the most significant endeavours on Cardano that could onboard 80,000 new users in  the near future and continue to scale up as it develops and expands further. The team has clearly identified the risks involved and explained their mitigation strategies for each. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I have rated this 5/5 for feasibility as it is highly likely the team will be able to deliver this proposal successfully. The team is included in the proposal with extensive background information and LinkedIn profiles. The team consists of highly qualified professionals with relevant experience. They have also successfully received funding and delivered results through Catalyst in Fund8. The budget is reasonable for a project of this size and scope, and it is clearly broken down and itemized. They have also stated this is the final funding amount that they will be asking from Catalyst, and the project will be self funded for future growth after this bootstrapping phase.  The team has the required resources to complete this project already in place, and will be working with some of the leading professionals in haskell (MLabs) and wallet/Identify management (IAMX). The team has an impressive list of professionals to help with legal risk mitigation and implementation, as well as experience collaborating with government agencies and land registries.

The community will be able to easily assess if the project is minting land registry NFT's after the 6 month timeline. I have rated this 5/5 for auditability as I believe the KPI's and publicly available metrics will make this proposal easy to audit. The team has also committed to monthly progress reports that will track the stated KPIs and these are to be published on social media channels and communicated to the community.

This time, Landano returns to request complementary funds allocation for their project after being selected for budget allocation in Fund 7. What are their goals? In essence, they require resources to transition to a full-fledged Cardano project based on the Web3 architecture, incorporating Vasil's improvements to the code. For me, it is more than justified by the value it would add to the ecosystem if this project is successful. As well as that, it will provide a variety of benefits to the target population, one of which is the ability to access financial services that have remained out of their reach until now. Further, the team mentions that they have established what appears to be a partnership with CaVaTeCo, which will allow them to onboard 80,000 land rights via NFT, making this one of the most successful \"RealFi\" projects in the current Cardano ecosystem. If it turns out to be a successful use case, it will open up the possibility of reaching a market that, according to the team, would be around 1 billion people in the Global South. They also mention that if selected for the allocation of funds, and after the implementation of what is planned in this proposal, the next steps would be to migrate to a business model where the transaction fee would be one of the sources of revenue, as well as the possibility of making an ISPO and / or ICO.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Landano has assembled a team of capable individuals with profiles that provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem to be addressed. It has also established agreements with organizations such as MLabs, Empowa, and AMX.id, all of which are well known in the community and bring a high level of trust and integrity to the project. The budget was presented in 12 differentiated items, which in some cases represent professional fees, infrastructure costs, design and development contracting, among others. Unfortunately, it was left at a very high level, so high that it is very difficult to evaluate the logic used by the team to request the amounts of certain items, for example, \"Software development and quality assurance: $92,000\", how many developers will be hired? Inferring from the description of the plan, there is at least a frontend (or full stack) and a Haskell developer, as well as a quality assurance professional. Now, how many hours are planned for each skill? In the case of hiring at least three professionals, the amount of $92,000 appears a bit low. Of course, it will depend on where they are hired. The actions described to be carried out seem appropriate and cover all the scope stated in the Impact section. Although it seems a bit ambitious to be completed in 6 months, considering that they already have the experience of building the MVP v1 in the Cardano testnet, and have the development support of MLabs I think it can be achievable. I found the description of the risks and possible challenges to be impeccable, aligning with the major risks I see associated with this project, and the mitigation measures outlined appeared reasonable to me, especially everything associated with the legal and regulatory aspects, which could be the Achilles heel for projects that ignore them from the start.\u00a0Finally, I would like to add that I missed some description regarding the smart contract audit topic, how they plan to address it and if it is contemplated within the estimated timeframe.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is described in time phases of 2, 4 and 6 months, which contain each of the actions to be executed. Although some of the milestones can be inferred by reading the actions to be completed, others are unclear or ambiguous. The description of success is concise and encompasses all of the deliverables in the scope of the project. Landano proposes ten metrics to track the progress of the project, most of which are appropriate and will provide the community with an overview of progress. It should be noted, however, for the sake of transparency, and considering that this proposal is a follow-up to another proposal funded in fund 7. I would have appreciated a more detailed update on the status of the milestones proposed in the previous proposal (beyond the report sent to IOG). For instance, it mentions that there is a version 1 of the MVP. If they are not ready to share the code, at least a mockup of the frontend, as indicated on their website (http://www. landano.io/roadmap).", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4542, "q0": "I strongly agree with the impact of this proposal. The problem statement is very clear: it identifies that Landano needs to launch its Mainnet to fully realize its potential after the success of its MVP. The proposer provides metrics that land rights for 80,000 in Ghana could potentially mint as NFTs on Cardano Mainnet, with the possibility to scale the solution to serve 31 million people in Ghana and 20 million rural Mozambican citizens. It fits well with the challenge's goals to create a thriving ecosystem of DApps, drive adoption, and meets Fun9's strategic goal of building real-world solution on the Cardano blockchain. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I agree that this project is feasible given the success of the MVP, well-documented track record and roadmap on the Ladano website and very strong and committed team who has been working on Landano MVP and MLabs. The project team has also established relationships with strong partners such as Terra Firma (a land rights consultancy), CaVaTeCo (Community Land Value Chain system), and IAMX.id (SSI solution), Empowa.io (affordable home loan to the unbanked population),  Ghana Land Commission, and community leaders who manage community land rights. These partnerships are evident in the high success and feasibility of the project. The proposer gives a roadmap with milestones for every two months. I would suggest beefing up the roadmap details, including key work processes, and roles and responsibilities to make it easier for the community to evaluate it. The budget looks fine to me, but I wish to have a breakdown of the capabilities required and man-hours or days to justify the budget. The amount for Cardano NFT minting fee is the 2nd largest fee (1/6 of the total budget) and there is no further context to evaluate if the amount justifies. The proposer explains the technical aspects on a high level and provides a quite comprehensive risk evaluation and mitigation.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I strongly agree that the project is verifiable. The problem to solve is clear. The roadmap, even though high-level, provides sufficient key deliverables to keep track of. Success is defined as having a decentralized infrastructure to mint legitimate land rights NFT on the Cardano blockchain's mainnet and roll it out in Ghana and Mozambique markets.

The solution offers Switching from username/password to wallet-based authentication and login information and implementing mvp refactor client/server to use decentralized storage and WASM-based processing. In line with the situation in Africa, the fact that the project has had test products in Ghana, Mozambique and Kenya shows the impact of the project on the local Land Management Commission. The solution is implemented to reduce the disadvantage of land rights and manage the land records of african people, Landano implements through a mobile interface that creates convenience and ease of use. The impact of the project on the people of Africa is in line with the development of african communities, Having credible evidence of rights to land will bring confidence to long-term investment in agricultural land to create sustainable development for Africa. Che demonstrated that documents in the form of NFT on the Cardano blockchain create high security and help improve the transparency of NFT. Every African gets a certificate of their land through Landano, which means they have been able to get to know Cardano and be a part of it. This helps the Cardano ecosystem thrive in Africa. The project integrated on Cardano adds to the Dapp richness of the ecosystem, Landano can be expanded in the future with features developed. The goal of casting Landano NFTs for 80,000 new users is suitable to solve the challenge. The biggest risk the project cares about is the recognition of Landano NFTs as a legally valid record, the risk reduction given by the author is appropriate. Landano has established de facto relationships with local land commissioners and community leaders, who have the authority to approve documents and their approval of Landano's methods and infrastructure. There are three risks in place and there is a mitigation plan for this that will help Landano be successfully implemented.\nI rated: 5\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With the project already having mvp test products, the first implementation in the project plan put forward is to develop mvp product graphic design this is appropriate.
