I\u2019ve used apps like Sweatcoin and Lifecoin over the past few years, I\u2019ve also played with some similar concept NFT projects that utilized this idea of incentivizing fitness. All blockchain based solutions that I have encountered have a problem with either appealing incentivation or sustainable economic mechanics. The former I think is more easily imaginable, in which smaller/shorter forms of exercise receive essentially no reward so there is no legitimate incentive to participate. This can be a problem for the cited population of obese individuals. The latter problem is at odds with the increase of attractive incentives because it becomes more unsustainable if the inflows of value are not matched with the outflows of incentives. It is important for projects, voters, and investors to refrain from falling into the perception that cryptocurrencies can simply create money ex nihilo and freely give it out to users. There has to be proper attached utility to generate demand for the token/platform that generates enough money to freely share with users AND make a profit as a company. Some platforms utilize advertisement and share that revenue with users, some establish token utility so that people will want to buy the token, and any platform that expects to see success needs to develop a creative income stream that is substantial enough to sustainably support outflows of the rewards. This is where this proposal falls short. While this proposal does present some facts of the status quo that demonstrates a general need for exercise, this section does not spend any time articulating the unique/innovative features or structure of this app that addresses shortcomings of previous versions of this type of app. These are fundamental articulations that are needed to make the impacts sound compelling and attainable but there\u2019s also an element of quantififying those impacts to show voters how much impact can be expected. The proposal starts with an attempt at quantification but it doesn\u2019t further define the potential of THIS app to attract users with modeling evidence from other blockchain fitness-incentivized projects, or perhaps attained customer acquisition from an existing audience base. Essentially, there\u2019s not enough substance here to demonstrate what the impacts are and how the impacts will be reliably attained. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "For lack of development team details and roadmap outlining to demonstrate potential for success, I rank this section a 1. This proposal provides no names, experience details, or LinkedIn profiles to verify experience. The only information we get is that the team is made up of UI/UX designers and developers who have previously worked on health & fitness apps. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t enough to justify reliable feasibility. Experience in health & fitness app development is not actually saying much because the 90-day retention of these apps is 31% and the annual retention is 19% according to 2021 statistics. A vast majority of the ones that do succeed are ones that have personalized/customized features that cater to the needs of a variety of different individuals. Since there is not an indication of a dedicated health/fitness expert on the team, I\u2019d say there is a high likelihood of failure at the expense of Catalyst funding. The overall cost of the budget is rather average for Catalyst funds but the breakdown of spending reveals some rather exorbitant spending. The highest paying regions for backend developers goes as high as $70/hr to start, while this proposal allocates $90/hr. Frontend developers see a similar disproportion between this proposal\u2019s allocation and industry standard. The biggest budget allocation doesn\u2019t give any hourly rate, which doesn\u2019t provide a whole lot of optimism given the other budget allocations. As far as the roadmap goes, this proposal didn\u2019t get to submit it before the deadline, so there\u2019s not anything of substance to evaluate here except that the budget breakdown adds up to only 100 hours from each role to reach completion of this project. At full-time hours, I do not expect completion of a quality app in 2.5 weeks. I can\u2019t vote positively on this proposal because of the uphill battle of the industry and the shortage of experience and time. ", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Since the only measure of success for this project is the completion of the app, I think the concerns I\u2019ve indicated previously lead me to give this section a rank 1. If the only measure of success is completion but there isn\u2019t any confidence in the feasibility of completion, voters will not be able to salvage any positive responses. Especially for a fitness app, there\u2019s a lot of KPIs and analytics that could be pulled from to define success that might give voters a sense of potential. For this proposal, there could be usage analysis on average weight loss, accumulated miles run/biked/swam, rep-weight ratio, or total user adoption. There could be analytics on app usage demographics like countries using this app, weight classes using the app, male/female stats, or other metrics that point to widespread usage. Especially since app completion is a demonstrably higher risk for this industry, the completion of a functional app is not going to be enough to generate positive voter reaction. Expansion on the definitions of success will be vital for this type of proposal in particular.
