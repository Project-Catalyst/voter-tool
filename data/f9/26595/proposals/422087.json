The proposal is to develop multi-hope swap smart contracts that have the potential to exploit the liquidity available in Cardano DEXs to the optimal level. There are a large number of pools and DEXs in the Cardano ecosystem which is also growing at a rapid phase the availability of these types of open-source smart contracts will greatly enhance the developer ecosystem in the Cardano universe. Therefore this proposal is very much in alignment with the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "MuesliSwap development team had proved its technical capability in a very clear manner in the past.

Such (multi-hop) liquidity pairs are needed for creating new AMM protocols, which are needed for adding trading pairs on Cardano DEXes. For the community, this will translate in a big potential increase in transactions, hence an increase of the total value of the Cardano blockchain. \n\nThe proposal fits well in the challenge as the latter encourages research and development on decentralized technologies.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the experience of the team, the provided plan, the budget breakdown, and the risk assessment, I believe the proposed plan has a high likelihood of success. \n\nThe team have extensive and relevant experience in DeFi, SmartContracts, Cardano Technology and Auditing. Most notably, they have already developed a well known DeFi product: Muesli swap. \n\nThe execution plan is split in two phases: Development and Auditing. Being a R&D project, we don\u2019t get to see much information on how the phases are carried out, but we get clear indications on expected total time per Phase, and on how much time will be spent in specific areas. This information is enough to understand that the technological key points are defined, and that a solution is outlined.\n\nThe budget breakdown is detailed, and the team is willing to cover part of the costs, seemingly because this proposal is in their core interest. With some math, we can compute an average rate of around 80$/h, which is cheap considering the skills needed to carry out the project. \n\nThe team provided a brief and concrete risk assessment, focusing mainly on budget and development risks. In short, the risks are mitigated by the large size of the team in terms of financials, number of people working on the project, and vast experience in development On- and Off-chain.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project\u2019s delivery dates are clear, and the output is well defined. The team approaches auditability through transparency, meaning the community can check progress by monitoring GitHub activity or by reading the Project End-Report. \n\nFor some tech guy, checking GitHub and reading a final report are enough. However, since this is R&D inside a community, I believe the team could have gone the extra-mile by providing a mid-project checkpoint, in the form of an AMA in a TownHall Breakout Room. This approach would have the benefit of getting early feedback from the community, increasing the potential outreach of the research, and sharing information with the community members who want to better understand the internals of DEXes, AMM, and liquidity protocols. \n\nNote: The rating is 5/5, but I was leaning toward 4/5, because of the lack of in-person feedback with the community. I hope the team reads those words and can decide to provide such additional feedback to the community.\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2548", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6763, "q0": "The proposal acknowledges an important problem, which is that DEXs on Cardano don\u2019t have a way to trade token X for token Z if a liquidity pool doesn\u2019t exist between those two tokens, even if there is a pool for token X and Y, and another for token Y and Z.  This team states they plan to develop a way for multi-hop trading on Cardano so you would be able to trade token X for token Z in the example above.  They explain clearly how this would provide value by not only allowing for swaps between tokens that don\u2019t directly share liquidity, but also help generate swaps using multiple different pools to achieve lower price impacts.  They also plan to make their solution open source to go along with their current open source smart contracts, which should help other DEX projects on Cardano as well.

They are innovators of the space and have proven to be reliable developers.\n\nAnother great thing about this proposal is the team states it is impossible for the funds requested to not be enough, because if something unexpected comes up, the team says they will cover any extra costs.  They also explain there is little to no technical risk of this proposal being implemented successfully because they are already close to having a working prototype.\n\nI believe the timeline and the budget breakdown in this proposal are some of the most detailed I\u2019ve seen of any proposal in fund9 so far.  It shows the team is well prepared for doing what it takes to implement this proposal successfully, and that they have carefully thought about what amount of funds would be reasonable to request.  Because of all of this and the experience of the team, I believe enough information is provided to believe this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I believe enough information is provided to sufficiently track the progress of this proposal.  The team states that they are trying to be very transparent throughout the development process, which is exactly what we want out of projects who request funding through catalyst. \n\nThey plan to have weekly twitter spaces to update the Cardano community throughout the development process.

This problem stems from having multiple DEXs on Cardano that are not connected through liquidity, and having users from each dApp experiencing somewhat of unconfirmed price action when placing orders. By having a multi-hop integration as a guideline for all Cardano DEXs, this could potentially enable swaps between tokens that don't share liquidity and also help lower price impacts which make for a better user experience while improving the competitive nature within the Cardano ecosystem. The impact that we could see through this solution could bring the Cardano investors a true decentralized DeFi option that surpasses all other blockchains. This proposal receives a rationale of 4 since liquidity pools are still not mainstream for all of Cardano users, but as the future impact would help create the most efficient decentralized exchange platform in all of cryptocurrency, we could potentially see a migration of users coming to Cardano from other token and exchanges.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Within this proposal it is stated by the proposer that the solution to the problem would take place between 2-3 months time and the team up for the task is OpenSwap Technologies; who created Muesliswap.

That aside, the proposer has insisted the budget for implementing the solution should only require upwards of 300hrs of off chain code development as well as an internal audit, in total just under $30,000usd and any further costs will be covered by Muesliswap. There is no risks presented within this proposal as the team has stated a prototype is under development and the team is already well established for the tasks completion.

This has become a very common form of outreach to the Cardano community, yet I still find it less impactful than actual documentation which can be read and reviewed at a Project Catalyst member's leisure.

So there\u2019s very clear convenience appeal but I would really like to see more information about the user\u2019s cost for initiating such a transaction. I think it would benefit voters a lot to also know if this feature exists in other ecosystems (I think it exists on Uniswap) and I would also like impact to be further defined with quantifiable impacts. Both these features would help voters better formulate the cost-impact ratio and have a measurable understanding of how this could help the greater ecosystem.

From the roadmap portion, voters get a clear breakdown of how long it would take to build out such a feature (which is excitingly fast). The budget section further defines the roadmap by breaking down the allocated hours and total costs of labor. While they don\u2019t fully breakdown the budget to hourly rates, the totals breakdown to a pretty reasonable (though certainly not inexpensive) industry standard of $70/hr. Voters may appreciate having that work being done for them but my impression is overall positive.

This section appears to only appeal to the completion of the proposals feature but there is a lack of connection between the definition of success and the potential impacts. I think voters would like to see KPI categories that measure usage of this feature as well as further definition on what numbers for each of those KPIs are being targeted.
