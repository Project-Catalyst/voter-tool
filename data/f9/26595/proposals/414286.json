We know that the minting, exchange and commercialization of NFTs are already quite widespread practices both on the Cardano blockchain, as in others, it is something that has really become popular and many people are aware of the cryptographic universe through these practices. However, really, the function of building your own NFT is something I haven't seen before in the proposals I evaluated, this new look could attract a more specific audience, such as the younger audience, who are interested in this type of gameplay ( build your NPC and evolve, a kind of RPG I would say). The problem I identified in this proposal was that the proposers unfortunately did not explain very well what Flooftopia is all about. Personally, I already know the game, I understand the construction of the world and its gameplay, what are the main challenges and the differentials that this game will provide to the public when released and so on. However, other CAs who haven't contacted the project before may find themselves a little lost on the whole. So my suggestion here is that there was a more detailed and in-depth explanation about Flooftopia, so that the impact could be reinforced, that is, that we evaluators and also future voters who come in contact with the proposal, can believe in the real impact and in alignment with the specific objectives of the challenge. Another issue I would like to comment on is the risks to the development of new functionality. Proponents explain that they exist, but careful planning is being done with experts in the Cardano and coding sectors to mitigate them. Okay, but what are these risks all about? How can they be overcome? I think this part got a little abstract, people outside the coding business, for example, or the blockchain universe, don't have such a direct notion of what challenges we are talking about and this considerably undermines our understanding of the whole proposal. That said, I think yes, it is a good idea, relevant and that directly meets the objectives of the challenge when it comes to developing value Dapps (in this case a platform that would be a game, with NFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain). I believe that this project is very attractive to an audience that is not traditionally who we are used to dealing with in the cryptographic games sector - I myself find the game very interesting and I want to play it, but it would be important if we had more details 1) in in relation to what is Flooftopia 2) what are the challenges present in this approach to building NFTs and how they will be overcome.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The best part of this topic is the team presentation. We know exactly who those involved are and their skills, since their names, professional roles and also a small CV about each are presented, in addition to linkedin profiles, where we can have a more detailed view of who they are and what their professional paths are. until then. That is, this part of the proposal is very good and does not need improvement. Unfortunately, the other parts are more superficial. Starting with the roadmap, the progress is divided into very long time blocks (in the year 2022 in quarters and in 2023 as well, with even less detail). For example, we know that 3 activities would be developed in the third quarter of 2022, namely \u201crelease the testnet version of the \u201cBuild-an-NFT\u201d functionality\u201d, \u201crelease the mainnet version of the \u201cBuild-an-NFT\u201d functionality and \u201cstart the KPI monitoring and other metrics\u201d. But in a period of 3 months, how long would each one last? What would these KPIs and other metrics be that bidders cite? I would like more specificity in explaining this script. In the following year, 2023, the explanation is even more superficial, it is said that in the first and second half of the year, the monitoring of metrics and the updating of the code would continue. But it takes 6 months to carry out these activities, we don't know precisely who would do what, when and how. Therefore, my suggestion is that this part of the script was broken down a little better, with the aim of increasing our degree of understanding of the process as a whole. Now talking about funding, 15k dollars are requested for the development of this functionality, the total amount being divided into two main parts (the payment of the code and the commercialization). We are told what activities minus the coding is divided into, and we know the hourly value of work. I particularly found a very high value, but I believe that it is up to the whole to judge whether it is adequate. Regarding commercialization, I feel that this could be better explained, because we don't know exactly how this activity would develop. That said, I think the proposal is viable, the team presentation part gives us a lot of confidence, but the other two parts could be improved, both the explanation of the script and the argumentation and funding requested. That way we would have a more specific view of all parts of the topic, which in my view are equally important.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In terms of how we could monitor this project, I believe the information provided gives us a sense of what would be done and how success would be perceived, but not with the degree of detailed understanding that would be most appropriate. Starting to analyze the development process, this proposal does not have a detailed roadmap, so it is not so simple for the Cardano community to follow the advances accurately. Proponents have their own website for Flooftopia, where we can see some tasks and their status (whether they have been completed or not). However, this is still quite superficial, we do not know, for example, what would happen monthly, nor who would be responsible for what (we have a super strong and competent team, as I mentioned, but it is not delegated which of these professionals would do which tasks, for example Regarding coding, this is easier to understand, but who would do the marketing, for example?). With that in mind, I'd like the team to outline more palpable ways for the Cardano community to stay abreast of all developments. A suggestion I would like to make is: short videos could be posted on the youtube channel so that the members of our community understand what level the project is at, for example. Or, monthly reports could be created with the updates that were achieved in that period of time. Moving on now to the analysis of the final results, this part is more detailed, we have the notion of the final success scenario (the public's acceptance of the new functionality and after that, its propagation to other projects), and we can also conclude which ones would be the small goals achieved, for example the number of new Floofs generated from customization, the increase in digital wallets linked to game users and so on. It would be important, in my view, for the proponents to make a general study of how specifically this new functionality contributed to the popularization of the game and especially to the benefit of the Cardano ecosystem. In fact, did this idea impact the specific objectives of the challenge, as it was planned? So, I think that the auditability of the proposal is possible, but it could be better explored, especially in terms of monitoring the process and the phases of development.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 8, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 10525, "q0": "This project answers the challenge of impactful uses for cardano well. It is innovative and offers something noone else does. One big problem with NFTs currently is the lack of customization. People are less likely to invest in something that is not personal and their own. Furthermore, a lot of people do not like the gambling/gacha nature of a random NFT design, so Build-Your-Own is a very attractive concept. In games, personalisation is a big part of enjoyment and fun, so this would have people very engaged and excited.

This shows the close alignment of the proposal with the challenge setting.The proposed solution also focuses on integrations between the idea and current and future Dapps.  This development will provide more options to the ecosystem on minting functionalities, and it will provide the next step in NFT development that other projects and dApps can integrate or build upon. The risk that prevents the success of the product is the metadata limitations for NFTs. The writer has already had a solution to mitigate the problem.

For example, the proposal has mentioned \u201crelease the testnet version of \u201cBuild-an-NFT\u201d functionality\u201d, there should be an illustration of what and how they do to prepare for the release. The budget breakdown is presented briefly. The funding is used for coding/implementation and marketing. It is easy to understand the budget breakdown, it is explained by the clear activities of the projects.

Firstly, this functionality will be implemented in a social MMORPG called Flooftopia and it will be the playground for the implementation of this Dapp. Secondly, this looks more like a niche product as is tied to this social MMORPG platform which is in its infancy and it may require years to have it working. Thus a plan for the project's future sustainability is necessary (I can't see one in the proposal), as it seems that the output for this project will last for some time.\n\nIf this project will succeed it could add some value to the Cardano ecosystem as is targeting a niche audience.\n\nI rate this section with 4 stars.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We found from the proposal that the team has 2 members and each one has a role assigned, as one will be coding and the other is responsible with the marketing activities. Regarding the Dirk's experience, it seems that he has a lot of programming experience for some technologies but is not clear if he has the necessary skills and experience related to Cardano, and its tools and programming languages. A NFT is created using a Smart Contract and also there is a need for storing data on-chain and off-chain. Unfortunately this proposal lacks in providing relevant info about technologies that are to be used for minting the NFTs (Marlowe/Plutus, SDKs, wallet integration etc.). the proposal covers in depth the image creation, being flexible in choosing parts and dimensions for the character that is to be created, but is also important to know what is happening on the blockchain.\n\nThe budget is broken down into identifiable items and it consists of estimated developing hours and $1,5k for the marketing activities. The total amount for the developing hours is 135 but is unclear how many are for each of the 3 components (frontend, backend, minting)\nThe timetable is presented as quarters (4 of them) but is unclear when the project stars and when it ends. It is recommended to give a starting date for this project and to present the roadmap with achievable milestones, monthly preferably. Saying this, for me is unclear what is the output for the Marketing activities as in the timetable there is no mention about Marketing and what is the meaning of the following statement: \"Have a streamlined \u201cBuild-an-NFT\u201d functionality\" as the output for the Q3 should be something with clear description (i.e.: character creation based on the following criteria: a, b, c etc., smart contract released on testnet etc.)\n\nThe risks and challenges for the implementation of this project are presented in a vague manner (\"natural risks\"), and is unclear how the \"metadata limitations for NFTs\" is to be solved as the proposer doesn't provide the solution for this.\n\nDue to the fact that relevant info is not presented by the proposer I rate this section with 3 stars\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The presented roadmap is not very clear for any outsider as it seems that milestones ar not easy to be identified (testnet and mainnet functionality - more details needed) or are missing (marketing related).

A kind of regularly report, with what was done and what was left to be done, should be presented to the community and for the technical aspects a GitHub (or something similar) channel should also be made public.
