We are looking to fund Dapps that somehow add value to the Cardano ecosystem; and that is exactly what would happen here. The problem situation raised is that acquiring tokens is not so simple on Cardano, as there is no open and free self-service acquisition standard for native tokens. What we currently find on our blockchain are closed options, so that those companies looking to develop on Cardano's network need to write their own acquisition agreements. According to the proponent, this increases development and auditing costs, and also reduces the security involved in the process, leaving room for third-party distrust. This is exactly the situation that is addressed in this proposal, through the creation of a \u201cpoint and click\u201d tool, in which any user could acquire tokens in a much simpler way. This would also mitigate the problem that \u201cthe few proprietary acquisition tools that exist are kept at the gate and may not support advanced features such as unlimited timelines, cliffs, installment frequency and tradable derivatives\u201d. Furthermore, the application would be free and cooperation with the proposal team (Unvest) would be optional, which would represent a lot of advantage for the developers, since the process would be cheaper and more reliable, it would not be necessary to pay additional fees and carry out any type of exchange with the team in question. Developers would then have the release of their tokens simplified, while end users would have a simpler, more reliable and seamless experience. Although the project is very technical, and at first glance is complex to understand, the proponent attaches a 17-minute video, in which he explains in more detail and in accessible language what this tool would look like, through examples. Another positive point of the proposal is that the team involved is already very experienced with blockchain, having developed some projects for other blockchains. They confess to not having such a solid experience with Cardano, so they will hire experienced developers from our community. Overall, I thought it was a very valid idea and one that will directly achieve the goal of creating a Dapp that increases our community's engagement, because it would facilitate some of the most fundamental activities within our ecosystem. This can directly contribute to the better establishment of our projects, greater facilitation in minting active tokens, and with that perhaps more people will be attracted to Cardano. We know how our blockchain is still new in the cryptographic world, which creates the need for tools and innovations of this type to be constantly under construction - so that the network becomes simpler and more reliable to work with.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of script, unfortunately the proposal leaves something to be desired because the information is passed on in a very lean, superficial way. The timeline is divided into quarters, that is, we know what would happen in these 3-month intervals, but we don't know in detail how these activities would be developed. In the third quarter of the year 2022, all the project planning would be executed - but what would that look like? The proponent states that \u201cdeep research, testing, setting internal milestones, assigning responsibilities\u201d would be done. How would the research be developed, what exactly would the team be studying and trying to unravel? In my view, the definition of internal milestones and the assignment of responsibilities should already be defined from the moment the proposal is launched on ideascale, so that we have a clearer view of the process. The fourth quarter of the year would be reserved for the development of the application, that is, the programming of contracts in our languages \u200b\u200b(Haskell/Plutus) and so on. It would be more appropriate if the proponent had better detailed the programmers' work routine here, so that we could understand how these technologies would be built. Finally, the launch of the project would be around the second or third quarter of next year, from what I understand. It would be interesting if a marketing campaign were attached here - how can developers in our ecosystem become aware of this new functionality that would then be available? Moving on to the next topic, when we talk about costs, the project as a whole would require an investment of 74,420 dollars, the amount is divided into some parts, but these are not well explained. We know where every bit of the money would go, for example: Ongoing infrastructure, hosting, network fees, software and services costs + Project management throughout the pre-launch and dApp lifecycle + Engineering hours for implementation and back -end of smart contracts and etc. But each of those parts should be more unraveled. For example, $13,000 for infrastructure services (perhaps to maintain the team members' physical office?). What is hosting, exactly? What would be the legal costs involved in the project? A very high amount of the total amount (32K) would go towards the work of the smart contract engineers, but what would be the hourly value of work here, how long would they dedicate themselves to this project? Unfortunately, from the way this information is passed on, it is not possible for us to understand as accurately how the money would be used. The team, in turn, does convey confidence, but it would be very positive if we had more details about each of the members involved. Some, like Kiran Matthews, provide us with more information about themselves; but for example Juan Ubinatus and Sergey Stepanets could have explained a little more about their CVs, previous experiences and so on. That said, the feasibility of the project in my view is average, because we have basic information needed, but not as detailed as I think is ideal.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Finally, when we analyze the auditability of the project, it is possible to notice that the level of detail also leaves something to be desired, unfortunately. Regarding the measurement of progress, it is said that the process would be audited and organized through logical sprints, and that the metrics would be the completion of the Dapp Cardano Unvest + number of users + the quality (I believe that the level of user satisfaction, or how they would be using Dapp). It is noted that the suggested information gives us a basic perception of how the monitoring of the phases would be done, in fact the part that refers to this is the sprints, it would be necessary that some improvements were made so that this process was more adequate. First, the tasks that lead to the achievement of partial results would need to be better detailed, so that we would have more content to monitor, more understanding of what would be done, how, when and by whom. As I mentioned in the feasibility analysis, I believe that the exact timeline, responsibilities and plans should already be defined by the time the proposal is submitted. The ideal would be that everything was already well programmed, so that we could better control if the activities were being done the way they were planned. It would be necessary for the team to maintain an open dialogue with the Cardano community, that is, to provide us with periodic updates on what is being produced, on the difficulties being gradually mitigated and on the daily work of those involved. So I suggest that a gathering of general information is done at least once a month and that this reaches clear knowledge of the community, it would be important to define a communication channel from the team to the members of the ecosystem (discord, telegram, Notion, Miro , etc). And speaking of success, what is said is that the ideal scenario would be where \u201cseveral projects distributing and investing their native tokens using the Unvest+ protocol will leverage our contacts at partners CardStarter, Spores and GeroWallet to find projects that benefit from our tooling free\". Once again, the suggested information gives us a somewhat superficial view of what would need to be analyzed. A suggestion that I consider appropriate here would be to keep in touch with some projects that used the tool, to understand how the technology was important and a differentiator for them, how it contributed to their development in a more organic and accurate way. With this, we could have a more accurate understanding of how Unvest would be beneficial to Cardano, how it would be contributing to the specific objectives of the challenge being met, so that more people use our network to develop their projects and more applications are created through the facilities found here (and this should also, ideally, be brought to the attention of our community, either through a final report or through the participation of those involved in Town Hall, for example).", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6751, "q0": "This proposal clearly defines the problem that there are no open and free vesting services for Cardano Native tokens yet.  To fix this the team wants to update their existing dApp to support all native Cardano assets.  This definitely aligns with the challenge seeing how it is an existing dApp looking to integrate Cardano native tokens into it.  I believe this would be valuable for project owners looking to set up vesting of their tokens without needing to write their own scripts to do the same thing.  This also provides value to end users by giving them a vesting dashboard and consistent token claim experience of any project that uses this dApp for their token vesting. The dApp also supports the secure transfer of unvested tokens, allowing users to make trades using their unvested tokens, which in turn reduces price dumping when those tokens do unlock. They do this through \u201cliquid vesting tokens\u201d which are tradeable tokens that are redeemable for the vesting tokens they represent when the token\u2019s vesting period is over.\n\nThe KPIs of this project also align with the KPIs of the challenge.  They are looking to measure the number of users of the dApp when the Cardano integration is complete, as well as the number of projects distributing and vesting their Cardano native tokens through the dApp.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This team has already successfully integrated multiple other chains into their dApp.  One thing to point out is they have only integrated with EVM blockchains up to this point, and they acknowledge this in the proposal.  They plan on bringing experienced Cardano developers to help with the integration and also teach their existing team a bit about developing on Cardano so they can build more on Cardano in the future.  I like this idea but I\u2019d like to know more about how they plan on finding a developer to help them because I\u2019d imagine that most are pretty busy already.  If they already have someone in mind, they don\u2019t mention it in this proposal.  Also I noticed in the comment section of a different proposal by this same team that one of their developers is experienced in Haskell, just not Plutus and has never developed on Cardano before.  I think this would be good to mention in the proposal because I assumed they didn\u2019t have anyone with experience in Haskell at all and would have to learn everything from square one.\n\nThe roadmap provided in this proposal could use a little more detail I think. Currently it's very basic with the first step being Project Planning which includes setting internal milestones and assigning responsibilities.  This gives the impression that maybe all steps of the process haven't been completely thought through yet and increases the risk of something unexpected coming up that would prevent this proposal from being successfully implemented.\n\nThe budget breakdown is pretty good, but I would\u2019ve liked to have seen more of how the numbers were decided on.  For example, they are requesting $32000 for engineering hours toward smart contracts and $7300 for engineering hours towards UI/UX and front end stuff.  It would be nice to know how many hours those actions are estimated to take, so we could have more information to determine if we think the requested amount is reasonable.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d like to bring attention to is that this team has submitted another proposal to Fund9 where they are integrating Cardano into another aspect of their same dApp.  I\u2019ll make a separate assessment for that proposal, but basically it aims to provide a way for projects to allow vesting tokens to only be claimable by specific NFT holders.  It\u2019s very similar to this proposal but instead of using a liquid vesting token, they use an NFT to fulfill the same purpose.  This makes me wonder if they really needed to be separate proposals, because it seems to me if you implement one of them successfully it wouldn\u2019t require too much changing of code to implement the other, but perhaps it\u2019s more complicated then I realize.  Also, the timeline provided in each proposal is the exact same which supports my feeling that the proposals could\u2019ve been combined into one.\n\nDue to the roadmap lacking details and not having a developer experienced with Cardano on the team yet, it doesn\u2019t give me confidence that the proposal can be implemented successfully.  However, this team is still made up of experienced developers, just not on Cardano, and they do at least have a basic plan of attack and are willing to learn, so I\u2019m not saying I think it\u2019s unlikely to be implemented successfully either.  It could go either way.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team provides some basic milestones to look out for in the roadmap like a private and public beta, and a 1.0 release.  This would be helpful but there is no public channel provided for where to expect updates on this project.  The only thing I can think of is periodically checking their website to see if Cardano tokens have been integrated yet, but that doesn\u2019t help tracking progress during the development stages.  I think an official twitter or discord would be helpful for the public to follow along on any progress made and watch for announcements of any milestones being reached. I was able to find a twitter on their website, but it would be nice to confirm if updates for this proposal are planned to be announced there. The proposal does provide some helpful KPIs for measuring the success of the project once completed.  \n\nThe main things I\u2019d suggest to improve auditability is provide a public channel for updates and include more milestones that would be indicators of progress being made during development.

To solve those problems the team proposes a very good idea that can effectively solve this problem, which is to create a free point and click tool that anyone can use. Complex schedules can be built easily. The contract is unmanaged, the parties can be assured of the security and integrity of token emissions on Cardano. Developers receive a free tool that simplifies their token launch. End users get a consistent dashboard experience and token claims across multiple projects - with enhanced trust and integrity.
