Yes, the proposed solution can bring positive impacts to our blockchain, but in my view this project fits better with the \u201cDAOs <3 Cardano\u201d challenge, as it fits well with the specific goals of creating \u201ceffective collaboration management platforms for organize community intentions and actions\u201d; and it is also an idea that will contribute to more people being \u201cinvolved in collaboration using the Cardano DAO authoring tools\u201d (the tool that will be created will be a separate ID/Function solution: DuckID). This challenge, from my understanding, aims to produce new use cases for applications that involve our blockchain technologies, and with that, foster our community, attracting new active members, increasing the number of Ada in circulation and being delegated, the number of NFTs minted in our network, etc. I believe that these small goals will also be achieved with the creation of the hub, since the platform would be a place that would bring together different stakeholders, as the proponents declare, who might be having difficulties with Catalyst and Ideascale. We know through which media this content would be delivered: discord would be used for coordination, github for documentation and tracking and twitter for outreach. But a doubt that came to me was: what contents would these be, exactly? How would the experience of those who are having doubts about our ecosystem be improved? I believe that to better understand the core of this project, it would be very necessary that more details had been given in relation to the contents worked here and how they would be addressed. It is positive how the proponents intend to create an identification system that would have multiple purposes, such as \u201centry into a script, freeing up funds for specific users + roles in a DAO/Server + establishing trusted users in a public space, requiring members to have a policy key minted with its unique identifier\u201d and so on. The creation of this tool already demonstrates in practice that they are familiar with our blockchain technologies, which is an important factor for the success of the proposal. However, when the explanation of the proposal arrives in the part of the risks, the proposers took some problems that can be faced but it does not propose how they can be solved. How would the correct connection be made between the three aforementioned platforms? How can people who don't know how to use any of them get the best out of the project? For example, we know that github is commonly used by developers, but a wider audience is not used to using this platform. So I believe that as good as the idea is, it would be better tuned if it were posted in the DAO challenge (because in my understanding a DAO will be created here) and it could also be better clarified the nature of the content covered here and how the challenges would be mitigated.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal has points that really need to be worked on, it would be necessary for more details to be provided, especially in the part of the script and in the explanation of the funding. About the script, first: the timeline is every 3 months, the ideal would be that the activities were detailed monthly. That way, we would have a clearer view of what would be done and when. Talking about the level of detail in the explanations of the activities, in my view it is insufficient, it would be necessary for us to have more detailed activities to solidly understand how the development process of this project would be. For example the first month would be focused on preparing the launch of the platforms and on the integration of additional participants. How would the project be presented to third parties? How would proponents present the idea and engage people to participate, understanding the benefits of getting involved? When the project was finalizing, at the 12-month mark, an expansion would be made to new social media: which ones and why? How would they relate to the project and what will be done, in what way would they be actively added here? Therefore, I think that the information in this part is not conveyed properly as it tends more towards superficiality. I would like to understand what would be done, how, when and by whom, more precisely. Now talking about costs, the total is divided into 3 parts. Approximately 22 thousand dollars are requested, which are not well explained. We don't know why the DuckID OpenSource Solution would cost 9 thousand dollars: how would the professionals work for this technology to be developed? A good part of the money is earmarked for community management, what activities would be included in the management? It is said that 2 people would be paid for 6 months, the monthly salary would be a thousand dollars, which is a very fair value and compatible with the market. But I would like to know how many hours a week they would work on the project, whether it would be full-time or part-time, for example. And finally, the documentation could be better detailed as well: what would be the documents needed for the development of the project and why would they cost 1200 dollars together? From the way the funding is divided and explained, we understand in a very basic way how it would be used, as well as we understand the information pertinent to the project development process. As for the team presentation, it's about two people, Deryck Lance and Dan Verowski. It's very positive that they both have a lot of experience with the crypto world, but it's not as clear about Cardano, specifically (Dan is said to have already been funded in the last two funds, so it would be interesting to know more about his project). But in general, trust is transmitted in the duo, as we know some basic information and we also have their linkedin profiles. However, in my view, it would be important for some marketing professional to also be involved here, since disclosure is a key part of this proposal. With that, I think the feasibility is average, as the first two topics need to be better worked and the last one is the most suitable.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Talking about auditability, finally, as in the previous topic, a series of improvements are necessary for this to be adequate. Regarding progress, we have little information on how this follow-up would be done. It is said that the projects would be monitored by a github tool, \"zenhub\", it would be necessary for the proponents to explain better about this tool, as I believe that most readers of the proposal (including me) do not know it. How would the daily updates mentioned here be made? What exactly would be updated? Would we have any way of monitoring the activities of the responsible professionals, their work routines, and also the partial results achieved periodically? As our roadmap is divided into quarters, we don't have much idea of \u200b\u200bwhat to expect at the end of each month. And we also don't have much detail about the activities that would be developed, so it's not so simple to perform the auditability. In order for progress to be more easily measurable, the first step would then be precisely to define greater specificity for the roadmap. That way we could better understand what would be done and how. Then we would have more tangible material to carry out this monitoring, which must be provided to the community with an overview of all the main information of that month (because I believe that community members have many projects to follow up so it is not so feasible to carry out a daily monitoring, a monthly summary in my view would already be quite adequate). Under the final success scenario, it is defined as \u201cthe participation in Catalyst by stakeholders who were not actively engaged prior to this proposal, including new participants who previously held their ADA on exchanges and other stakeholders such as SPOs and exchanges, perhaps a native partner of Catalyst\u201d. How can we measure that, in fact, those people who wanted to get better involved with our blockchain and Catalyst had their paths facilitated by the project? What has changed? The best way to understand this scenario would be to carry out quantitative and qualitative research in relation to the public. How many active members were added to the community because of this platform? Who would they be, how would they be involved with Cardano's diverse possibilities and opportunities? It would also be very valuable if we had direct feedback from both types of audiences: 1) those who already knew Cardano and Catalyst but who had difficulty engaging, how they benefited; 2) how new people arrived in the community through this project. It would be very good if the proponents were to keep in direct contact with these people afterwards and for them to be able to share their testimonies. In general, more in-depth research is needed so that we can understand what emerged from the project, the real consequences of all this for our ecosystem. And regarding duplication for other languages: which languages? Would we already have some other language-speaking members who could make this a reality? Therefore, the information provided here is quite basic, requiring more careful study in general.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 937, "q0": "This proposal is about increasing social media engagement which has very little to do with the challenge objectives which is to create products (dApps) and integrations.\nThe problem statement is not supported by any data or facts.

Furthermore, the scaling of such a project can be problematic especially if there are no plans the decentralize the organization of the hub.

To my surprise there is another completely different solution too, regarding ID/Roles for DAOs.

It's not clear if the proposal was presented in the correct challenge either, if the goal is to develop a tool to make the flow of information faster and easier from Ideascale to various social media platforms it should be stated more clearly. As well as the relation between the proposed Hub and the ID system for DAOs.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team provides detailed description of their two members, with background information and their LinkedIn profiles.

If this is not required because both of the team members have these skills, it should be stated as so, while providing a link to their portfolios or github repositories. \nThe detailed plan including the timeline and key milestones is too broad for such an ambitious project. The first month milestone is described as on-boarding several participants to engage the stakeholders, but no information is provided on how many participants qualifies as \u201cseveral\u201d and to engage which stakeholders? Users from Github, Twitter and Discord? Or DAO participant? The three months milestone mentions providing data for the KPIs but there is no mention of which these KPIs are. Continues with on-boarding several groups of stakeholders, including SPOs and exchange, it should be stated what amount constitutes as \u201cseveral\u201d and the plan to onboard exchanges since it\u2019s the first time exchanges are mention in the proposal. The six month milestone mentions entering the scaling portion of the project. But this stage is not described in detail, what does scaling look like for this project? They also mention having additional clones of these hubs, what does this mean? Are these extra hubs aimed for other language communities? The last milestone of twelve months is as vague as the previous, they mention expanding to other social media platforms, which ones? How are these other platforms affect the original point of integrating Discord, Github and Twitter? \nThe budget breakdown requires more information and detail. The DuckID OpenSource solution will cost nine thousand US dollars, how did the team arrived to this amount? How many hours of research, coding, quality assurance and integration with the previously mentioned platforms will be needed? The second point is the community management which surprisingly has a bigger budget allocation than the development of the ID system. In this case it\u2019s stated that both team members will work on this task for 6 months, additional information of the hourly allocation would be beneficial.

For example, if every proposer who arrived to Catalyst thanks to this project sets the team members as their referral then that\u2019s a clear and simple way of measuring success.

A landing/launchpad hub is proposed that aims to onboard users into the Cardano eco-system.\n\nThe KPI's in the proposal including onboarding numbers, users of platforms, SPO's and holders in exchanges match that of campaign.

This shows that in terms of clear plan and team cohesion is likely to be good. Similarly Deryck has been at the helm of various companies and shows a good background at brining teams together. The proposal would have been improved if they had provided a plan of what specific skills were required to have a successful outcome where be it, x number of software devs who special in chosen sectors.  \n\nThe team also have a clear backlog showing the planned tasks and displays a public way to track progress of the project https://github.com/orgs/The-HardForq/projects/1. The Hard Fork github also shows that they have been active contributions by Dan to various repos, as a software developer I can see that Dan has the technical skills to pull off the desired project. He has strong credibility given that he was involved in previously funded Catalyst projects SecretDecks. The proposal would have been improved by outlining more backlog details within the Project Catalyst page and what sort of impacts they will have and how feasible each item is. The team have requested 22000 USD and have said how much funding each project component requires. Some elements such as the community management costs make sense, for example shows that 2 people will work on that for a set period of time, however it would be interesting to see what elements of documentation and administration are required and how is that reflected in to the 1.2k USD costing. Similarly with the $9K DuckID solution, how is the cost reflected into backlog items with more detail would make it give assessors a better idea of degree of feasibility of the tasks. However on balance of the budget and the tasks outlined it doesn't seem unreasonable that the project could have a successful outcome. Mitigations should be outlined as to what would happen if the project goes over budget or is not completed. Is backup funded required or will the team continue work until it is completed regardless if the budget is met or not. Where will additional funding come from? \n\nThe proposal outlines some details as to what is required for success, however it would be good to know what sort of technical skills are required, languages and be good to know what the software architecture looks like in greater detail. For example where will the solution be hosted? Will this require fundings, for example will servers be hosted on AWS? If so this will should be costed. How will software bugs be addressed? Is there funding for bug fixes and longer term platform support? The plan shows that 4 different risks are accounted for and the proposes understand that the main risk is poor community engagement  and user uptake.
