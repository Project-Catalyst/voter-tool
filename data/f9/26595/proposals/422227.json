The problem solution is to offer a clear path for projects to launch digital equity tokens without unknown risks from regulators to then sue, shut down, or otherwise create problems for the company and token holders and investors. This proposal is aligned with the challenge which includes bringing impactful use cases that will help drive adoption. The challenge also incudes, under potential success metrics: \"Nation governance systems - Amount of population onboarded, amount of costs saved due to new solution, security difficulty improvements over previous approach\" Therefore this proposal, if successful could begin onboarding companies from the Venture Exchange (TSXV) in Canada, and scale up to other countries such as the US and beyond. I have removed 1 star for the impact rating due to the fact that Cardano is a global decentralized system, and it is not certain that funding this would benefit ada holders who are not living in the countries affected by this regulation. In theory this could increase on-chain transactions, volume and ada price in the long term, but this proof of concept is still unproven, and could potentially not be embraced by regulators. Furthermore, it's debatable if cardano users should fund the development of government surveillance tools, or if that should be left to the government regulators or the private sector to fund, but that is up to the voters to decide. This is however, one step closer to automating much of the legal ambiguity that is slowing down adoption and has the potential to facilitate much larger players entering the digital asset space through Cardano. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposing team has provided links to the teams LinkedIn profiles, and they are highly qualified and experienced, and capable of delivering on this proposal. Wolfram Alpha is well known for bringing world class technical innovation and scientific research to the space, and has worked closely with IOHK and Cardano in the past. The mission of Wolfram Alpha from their linked in page: \"Wolfram|Alpha's long-term goal is to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable and accessible to everyone.\" This is why I believe this company is well suited and qualified to make the legal processes involved with launching digital equity tokens much more accessible to the project teams. Additionally Shaun Crumbys linkin profile includes \"Brought QBTC.U to Toronto Stock Exchange in April 2020. Managed 3iQ Global Cryptoasset Fund that holds bitcoin, ether and litecoin. Wrote prospectus for QETH.U, an ether based closed-end fund on the TSX launched in Dec. 2020.\" This is among several other crypto and exchange related achievements and he is well qualified for this project. I have given 4/5 stars, and not 5 for feasibility, because of my concern of the risk involved with the following statement: \"A small portion of the grant will be used to support an intern who will be tasked with the development of the case study and the presentation to regulators in Canada and the US.\" There is no mention who this intern will be, what their qualifications are, or if they have even been hired yet. This sounds like a critical piece to the success of this project. Additionally for this project to succeed, the Canada and US regulators must agree to the proposal and like the presentation prepared by this un-named intern. Convincing government regulators to adopt this solution may be more challenging than building the technology. The team has addressed the technical risks, and funding risks, but has not mentioned the risk of politically motivated regulators who may be opposed to this idea. The budget I will assume is reasonable, however it is not broken down to show how the budget will be allocated to the different tasks required to complete this project. I would recommend this proposal could be improved by including a more detailed list of specific and actionable development tasks, the estimated time required to complete each task, and the cost required to complete each task. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a timeline and milestones for achievement, although there is very little information included in these milestones. For example: \nMonth 1: Create detailed plans for Cardano blockchain support of token mechanics\nMonths 2, 3, 4: Build and test the technology\nMonths 5, 6: Apply the technology to a case study and present it to regulators and policy partners. \nThis is a vague overview of what will be completed month to month for a project of this scope and budget, and there is no discussion of reporting anything to the Catalyst community throughout the project. I have also noticed that Shaun is the founder of a Arxnovum Capital which is \"a venture capital fund manager focused on Canadian and US early stage ventures in the digital asset ecosystem from custody to trading platforms to services.\" and the proposal states that success is defined as \"A small, simple company currently listed on the Venture Exchange (TSXV) in Canada will be selected as a case study for the application of the technology to demonstrate that Cardano\u2019s blockchain and the Wolfram Language can deliver, at a high level, the minimum viable product (MVP).\" However, this company has not been named, and I would like to know if Shawn will be directly investing into this company or not. I would appreciate more transparency around who will benefit the most from Cardano holders funding this proposal, and how this case study company has been, or will be chosen. I would also recommend including monthly development progress reports to Catalyst community, and including key metrics that are quantifiable that the community can track in a transparent and easily accessible way. \nThe proposal includes the statement that \"The team will have a weekly review meeting and a deep dive on a monthly basis.\" however; this is assumed to be an internal meeting, as no mention of how the community can join these meetings, or receive updates has been included. As a final note, the impact section of the proposal includes; \"The disclosure of financial reporting, particularly on a continuous basis, has been a challenge for regulators, companies and investors in the SME and digital-asset space. DADF seeks to address the parties\u2019 concerns with a framework that is completely electronic.\" While this proposal focuses on transparent easily accessible reporting, I find it odd that the proposal has neglected to include any plan to report the development progress to the Cardano community. Perhaps in the future Wolfram could build a similar reporting tool for Catalyst users?

This is of interest to regulators, companies and investors in SME and digital asset space.\nMetrics are simplified since the proposal aims to make an MVP, which will include one company listed on the Canadian TSXV Venture Exchange.\nOverall, this is a step forward in connecting the digital and real-world in finance and investing and is in line with the challenge goals.

The budget lacks any details, expenditures or rationale on the amount and how it was reached. A more focused and detailed approach to the budget and plan is recommended. The timeline is presented also in a simple manner such as: \u201cbuild and test technology\u201d 3 months. As this is an important part of the proposal delivery, it is recommended to elaborate more on the individual steps. In addition, the resources are not clearly defined or presented.\nOverall, I believe that the proposer and Wolfram are capable of delivering but the proposal as it is submitted now has areas for improvement for better understanding and clarity.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer mentioned building a milestone timeline for monitoring the progress, but this should have already been a part of this proposal. Internal team review meetings on a weekly/monthly basis are not sufficient to enable audibility by/for the Cardano community. More clarity in progress on milestones in the reporting is needed in order to evaluate how the project delivery is ongoing. For example, finishing the legal framework, signing of assistance with the Law firm, successful listing on the TSXV and so on.\nThe final goal and success of the proposal is clear, which is proven MVP listed on the TSXV.

This is the result of fragmented platform policies, weak regulatory support, and the poor disclosure framework desired by regulators and investors.

Next is the budget, the proposal asks for $100,000 we need a detailed explanation of this amount. Why $100,000? How will this money be spent? What will be the salary of the experts involved in this project? \"A small portion of the grant will be used to support a student internship\" how much of the proposed amount is required??? Unfortunately, we have almost no information on budget usage.\nFinally, about the project team, we were provided with information about 2 members, Jason Cawley (Director, Wolfram Solutions), and Shaun Cumby along with their LinkedIn links and for not having any further introduction so I don't know if this project has to be done by these 2 members, and what role will they play in the project? What is their experience, is there any connection to the Cardano ecosystem or not, just relying on the link is not enough basis for us to evaluate their capabilities.
