This marketing solution has good and bad points and bad points can be more bad than good, because there are projects that are not good, they don't think about the interests of shareholders, and so it can be solved. This will help with those projects, and below I would like to comment with this proposal\n  * do the proposed team understand how Catalyst works they are empowering the community right now and we are evaluating proposals like this to find good ideas for funding development, and Decentralization is Cardano's guideline, please keep this in mind, because the team's solutions are completely governed by a group of community administrators and people who have the power. affect the community, so it is no different from advertising the project to the community to FOMO according to the price.\n  I would like to add one idea to the proposed team about possible risks that is, how does this platform know what is a good project in this ecosystem and spread it to the community, no statement yet for that in this proposal presentation. \"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"I have no opinion on the project team and development roadmap, but I have a little problem with the budget detail sheet, the requested amount of the proposal is $ 60,000 but the budget table has not been provided. any specific activity for the payment of this amount that the team only if a general problem is to use to pay for smart contracts, and other activities\n  would need suggestions for detailing each expenditure by example\n   -Phase 2 - 1 month - how much does it cost to build MVP\n   -Phase 1 - 1 month - verify feature set with community manager how many dollars or how many hours worked and how much per hour worked. if so, it will be easy for the community to evaluate and determine the feasibility of the project\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "there are three project progress metrics that the proposal introduces but it has not been stated where these will be published or support the community with any reports, to get high marks in transparency the proposal team needs to provide adequate monitoring support to the community or an easily measurable success index will receive maximum evaluation, the success of this proposal will also be difficult for the public to see because only the reward of this Dapp is visible and such a project is difficult to determine the success of the proposal.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2352", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 2, "ng": 4, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6645, "q0": "Starting with the problem statement, we are told that Cardano projects could use some help in increasing the engagement within their respective communities. The value proposition is to build a platform for projects to reward community engagement. Sadly, it is not very clear how this will be done. Skimming through the proposal we get impressions of getting closer sometimes to what google analytics is doing, but some other times you have the impression that DripDropz would be a more appropriate term for comparison. This is a conclusion I draw after reading the proposal as well as looking at the five minute video embedded in the proposal - useful but not greatly so. \n\nOf course, such a platform to foster community building around a given project would be beneficial for the community, I am just not sure whether the business model is very clear. This is why I would like to err on the optimistic side and offer four stars for potential impact, also considering that we already have something built, so they would not be starting from scratch.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Sadly we don\u2019t have much to work with in terms of team. We are informed that the team has \u201cfront-end, back-end, creative, and dev ops on staff\u201d, but that they need to find a Plutus expert for smart contract development. However, we are not offered names of the team members, bios or previous experience, so definitely the team presentation is not where it should be. \n\nThings go from back to worse when we move to the budget section, since no budget split is provided. All that we know is that funding will go towards Plutus smart contract and front end development, plus a mention of staking, but it\u2019s not clear how it will work in practice.\n\nWe have a similar story with the timeline - a a four months project with little to no details except that first month would imply verifying features with community managers, second one would see the MVP being built, the third would involve trials with Cardano projects and the last one would open the platform to all community members. \n\n \nFor me, an excellent proposal would have included: \n\n- a clear budget with captions, necessary development hours and hourly rates charged\n- a description of every team member, their bios, experiences and links to social media profiles / github repositories, where relevant\n- a more detailed project description and a better outlining of the features to be built, including possible tokenomics and rewarding systems for the communities. \n\nLacking any of those details, I must remain neutral and have to offer three stars, since it\u2019s not really clear if the project is feasible or not in this condition.

Success would represent having a system that facilitates an easy interaction between Cardano projects and the community which is boosted by the rewarding mechanism to be used. \n\nSo we have a fair description of how auditability would work, but not perfect. A better approach would have been to shed more light onto the following topics: revenue sources for the rewarding activities, discussion of possible financial sustainability of the platform through revenue sharing agreements, and also setting real figures in terms of how many communities and how many members should the platform host after 1/2/3 years to call the project a success. \n\nLacking these details, I have to go again with four stars since we have good, but not perfect, auditability settings here.

The evangelist mode will positively impact project owners and social media managers to boost their community. I think it will be important first to make the Mainline community bigger. Currently there are 19k followers on discord, 30.6K followers on twitter and 15k members on TELEGRAM. This project will currently only have a limited impact on the Cardano ecosystem. It will be very important for the evangelists to promote the project to communities and their administrators. The platform will give a clear picture to the people who actively participate. It will certainly be an incentive to reward the people and make this happen automatically. According to the creator of the proposal, there are few risks because the underlying platform has already been in development for a year. It also takes a reliable expert to build the Cardano native staking and rewards mechanism. I think it's important to also take the risk that not enough communities are interested in this project and how to convince these people.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The team is not clearly defined in the proposal. You can find the team members on their website (https://getmainline.io/). Preston Tesvich is the CEO. The team consists of a Creative Director, Lead developer, Solidity Developer, Technical Advisor,.... all with relevant experience. Their experience can be found on their Linkedin. The objective is to find 1 more team member to build a Cardano native staking and reward mechanism. There is no detailed breakdown of the budget. It just says that the funding is for Plutus smart contracts and front-end dApp for creating campaigns and project tokens. It would be interesting to display the hourly wages of the people running the project. How much money will go to the campaigns and token expulsion? The team will return to fund more useful open-source tools for the entire community to use. There is a time schedule that is divided into phases. The plan could be implemented in more detail. Each phase will also last 1 month and this seems quite short to me. The makers of the proposal show in a video what already exists and what will be further built on. Few risks are included in the proposal. The hardest part will be getting enough communities to participate in this project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "There is a very limited roadmap that is subdivided into 4 phases, each of which will last 1 month. I miss a more detailed elaboration of this roadmap. The roadmap also includes the milestones. The miles are also included very abstractly. A few KPIs are included to measure success (number of projects, number of evangelists, growth activities). These KPIs are clearly measurable. A distinction could also be made between the most successful projects and the lesser projects. The goal is the acceptance of the cardano community and the use of this tool to increase community involvement. This can solve the problem if enough people use this tool. It is good to provide a reward system so that more and more people will use it.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2940", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8197, "q0": "\"The team has successfully described their proposed solution in a quite clear manner including the benefits of their platforms, the outstanding features as well as their target audiences. The idea is well aligned with the challenge settings in increasing blockchain technology adoption and expanding the Cardano ecosystem. \nThe team also states that there are very few risks during the execution process, which indicates the huge success potential of the project. However, there is no addressing plan on the concern regarding trustworthy experts to build technical sections. I feel like this can compromise the viability of the project. The team can add solutions for this issue such as recruiting plans, expanding networks for talent acquisition, or a reasonable backup plan.\n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"I think the community expects a more detailed delivery plan and reasonable financial allocations accordingly. Besides presenting 4 main tasks in 4 phases, the team can break them down into smaller tasks and provide the team or department who will take responsibility for the certain activities. \nAs I can see the funding will go to the smart contract development, front-end dApp for campaign creation and staking project tokens, so how much the team will spend on each of these sections. The financial plan here is a bit obscure so the team can work more on this based on the action plan since there is a need for cohesion between them.\nThe proposal also needs to have more information on the team members. The team can give a summary including names, positions, background, and relevant working experiences so that the community has a foundation to evaluate the capability of the whole team. I suggest the proposer can provide a team\u2019s portfolio consisting of all information above and a demo of your platform developed so far. By doing this, the team can effectively support the assessment process and prove the feasibility of the project. \n\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Some of the KPIs have been provided to monitor the progress and development of the project.

Firstly, about the roadmap, according to the proposal presented, the project will be implemented in 4 phases. In each phase, you mention the duration and the general task. Such a route is acceptable, but it would be better if you covered the small tasks in detail in each stage. In terms of budget, in the introduction, you ask for a grant of 60000 USD. So in the detailed budget breakdown, you have to show us how that money is spent. You should make a list of what you need to spend and how much you need to spend. All budget information should be open and transparent. This will make the proposal more convincing as well as more feasible. Similarly, about your team, you state that you have front-end, back-end, creative and dev ops staff. You have to introduce who they are. In short, with this proposal, you need to add more information.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Overral, your presentation provided metrics to measure project progress and describe project success.

It wasn\u2019t until I watched the video that I understood that this app was not its own social media platform but rather an app that interacts with larger social media platforms (keep in mind that not all voters will watch the video). I do think there\u2019s adequate incentive for both social media users and companies in need of marketing to utilize this sort of platform because it is a substantial improvement upon common practice to purchase followers (many of which are often fake). I think it would be great to sort of paint the picture of the post-proposal world because it will display to voters what competitive advantage this can bring to the table.

In this section we do not get any names, details, or amounts of core team member staff. Voters will be looking for these details, ideally with LinkedIn profiles to go along with it. I can understand that sometimes people in security/software development are unable to provide information about themselves as it might compromise their work in other areas but voters will need something of substance to even consider a proposal that costs $60k. In the area of cost, this section of the proposal also doesn\u2019t provide a breakdown of how the funds are being spent, so voters won\u2019t be able to judge if they think the proposal is spending fund efficiently.

I think there\u2019s a lot of room to add additional metrics like number of wallets connected, number of active users, website traffic, social media engagement facilitated by this platform, success stories of onboarded projects, user retention statistics and any other metrics that would show an intention to adjust performance when necessary. The best proposals in Catalyst add specific target metrics that are being aimed for after the product is completed and adds different targets for timeframes post-launch.
