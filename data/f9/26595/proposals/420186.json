However, the proponent also has the long-term goal of implementing the same concept globally. \n\nThe fact the project is already funded in Fund 4 ($50 000) and has made significant steps since then made it possible to be adopted by thousands of users.

The origins of the project go as far back as 2008, when it was initially launched. The app is currently complemented by the Littercoin token, which originally launched on Ethereum but now has migrated to Cardano. What is remarkable about the project is the fact that the niche is an excellent candidate for real world adoption: users simply need a phone app to interact with the system, the \u201craw material\u201d, the litter, is ubiquitous and easy to document its presence and therefore the barriers to entry are minimal.  \n\nThe value proposition of the app + token is intriguing, since the combination can create an immediate connection between the general population (non-crypto adopters) and the crypto space without the need for a fiat on-ramp or opening crypto exchange accounts, but rather through a reward system for tracking and documenting litter across the world simply with the use of a phone app and geo-located photos. If you need a similar example to relate to the use case better - think about the Brave browser, which aims to democratize the advertising sector and rewards users directly for the ads placed on their devices. \n\nThe project initially secured funding in Fund 4. This proposal is now asking for funding in order to gamify the entire concept and popularize it through a championship-style event amongst 500+ schools in Ireland. The proposal also mentions Littercoin rewards for the winners, as well as physical prizes offered by their partners (UNESCO, University College Dublin and Science Foundation Ireland) although it is not quite clear which one of them will actually fund them.\n\nI find that the project fits very well within the challenge, whose role is, I remind you, to enable the development of various decentralized applications and foster adoption amongst the population. Since we are having in front of us an already built application, enhancing its features with a gamified educational challenge for schools is definitely a proposal very useful for reaching this challenge\u2019s goals if implemented. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Sean Lynch, the founder of OpenLitterMap, is a very well articulated project leader and a truly passionate person about citizen science, crowd-sourced data gathering and tracking litter across the globe. He is a geographer by formation, a self-taught developer and a Bitcoin / blockchain enthusiast. Unfortunately, unlike other successful projects, there aren\u2019t any other second tier team members that can stand out and bring a solid proof of an already existing team, well-bonded and working hard towards the project\u2019s mission. The rest of the necessary dev positions are actually advertised as available within the proposal (a frontend dev, UI/UX specialist, videographer, community manager - none of them already filled). For me this is a worrying situation, and it makes me wonder why hasn\u2019t Sean managed to already attract more seasoned devs close to him. Would it be the lack of ongoing funding, or perhaps is it a culture fit issue, an unconvincing business case for them? We don\u2019t really know but these questions definitely need to be asked. \n\nThe timeline of the entire project is well presented. We are told that the project would start in august with devs being hired, as well as a pilot implementation. Early next year (Feb-Apr) would see partnerships finalized, while in May the official event would begin. \n \nA bit curious, the budget is split by functions (for each additional person), and not by task, which makes our job a little bit more difficult in terms of making the right connections when assessing the budget\u2019s reasonableness given the proposed timeline. We don\u2019t know the actual tasks necessary to complete the project, since we do not have estimations of hours for these tasks, or anything else for that matter. We are however informed of hourly rates for the team being around 20-25 USD/hour. The only exception to this is the budget set aside for educational resources, of 10k USD. I find this budgetary caption fairly low, considering we are in front of an educational project, and in stark contrast to the budget allocated for development, 100k USD, hence ten times higher. \n\nOverall I find the feasibility of the entire project good enough, with only a few worrisome points like for instance not having at least part of the team already or the rather too general budget, so in my opinion four stars is the way to go.

The new LitterWeek program will collect data from citizen scientists around Ireland, and possibly abroad, about litter distribution and type. In order to complete this expansion funding is needed to increase the website/application capability, market the campaign and hire five staff members. The success criteria will be shown through detailed statistical analysis of the litter, as well as the culminating live LitterWeek that will be published on social media and have prizes awarded.\nThe impact of this proposal for Ireland, Cardano and possibly the world is clearly evident. Everyone knows that litter is a problem that urgently needs to be solved, however, the scale, quantity and responsibility are issues that society and governments are struggling to deal with. Involving students as citizen scientists to collect this data, places the issue at the forefront of the community conscience and the personal awareness for these future generations. The social media recognition, prizes and LitterCoin incentives help reward those who are choosing to do the right thing for the earth. Another evidenced impact in the proposal are the Sustainable Development Goals that can be attributed to this program - 16 out of the 17 SDGs, which is a significant achievement. The proposal has already been piloted in 2 schools with the plan to expand to 500+ within the year, furthermore, if this expansion is successful the future scalability of this program is likely. One point that has a slightly less articulate explanation, is how the proposal adds value to the Cardano ecosystem directly, the proposal mentions connecting with other Cardano citizen science projects, Cardano teams competing in the challenge, and the connection to Littercoin being funded in a separate proposal. Possibly, these connections could be strengthened and within the educational materials produced there could be references or examples of existing Cardano projects to raise awareness with the participants of the LitterWeek challenge.\nOverall, I rate the proposal\u2019s impact at 5 stars. As a teacher working in schools around the world for 18+ years I see the need for students to be involved in authentic projects, connect to experts and be encouraged to take action to ensure their success and the future of our planet.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan for implementation and budgeting are well thought out for this proposal. The proposer has worked with the OpenLitterMap project since 2008, and LitterCoin since 2015, so he has a detailed knowledge of the system and what is needed to implement the scale increase needed to run LitterWeek. I\u2019m not familiar with salaries in the fields listed for recruitment, but I am confident that the appropriate roles have been identified and hope that the compensation is fair for the work. Of some concern is that none of the staff members have been recruited as yet, apart from the Founder himself, and there could be more detail added to the job prerequisites to ensure the right team members are hired early on in the project. The budget is reasonable for a new, yet simple educational program, as well as website development, and has money budgeted specifically for creating educational materials - which needs to be a significant focus for the project to succeed, not just an afterthought. As an educator, I am extremely confident to comment on the time and roll out of the events planned for the schools. Too often new incentives by government or companies are given to schools without testing or support, leading to wasted time, resources and a lack of adoption. Although nearly a whole school year sounds like a long time, beginning with a few trial schools, course correcting the materials from their feedback, then deploying to more schools is a very wise approach. Also, the culminating LitterWeek celebration event is an ideal way to celebrate the school community and the competition itself offers a chance for students who don\u2019t shine at academics or sports to be rewarded for helping the program. The only feasibility question I wonder about is how to get permission from government or private schools to run this program, how does the team propose to acquire all the schools? With choosing the schools in mind, the proposers also need to recognize the increased child protection needs around the world, it would be imperative that safeguards are built-in when students are collecting data, locations and exploring as citizen scientists.\nOverall, I have given this project a feasibility score of 4, based on my extensive knowledge of program adoption in schools and believe that if the goals stated are achieved this program will not only benefit the students and community, but act as a model of how feasible it is to run citizen science projects within the education sector.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This proposal can be clearly audited as long as the proposers provide the project progress measures they have listed. Financially they have listed a cost breakdown google sheet, monthly team report and open access to invoices and proof of funds at all times. In terms of project accountability, they already host a weekly community call and post a progress blog. They plan to add a weekly video showcasing the program progress and community development. Towards the culmination of the project, the success of LitterWeek will be evident on social media and through their website. Following the conclusion they aim to create a comprehensive national baseline dataset from the information collected and publish the results in a journal. The proposal lists three main KPI, grouped under the themes of the challenge. I think there are a few too many objectives and some that go beyond the scope of the actual proposal, however, it does show the planned development and any additional scope they acknowledge that could improve the project.\nI have some reservations about the lack of breakdown within the CTO/CEO role, it encompasses many aspects within one role. Is a single staff member going to be clearly responsible for \u2018management, code review, full stack developer, business development, outreach, sales, marketing, scientific writing & more\u2019?

Schools and teams can take the LitterWeek challenge any week that suits them and repeat their effort any number of times with not much difficulties \u201c You don\u2019t have to be good at anything if you want to get on your school's data collection team and compete against other schools for 1st place in the championship to earn prizes like iPhones, xbox subscriptions, and laptops.\u201d I can understand that the project hooks more students into adopting the ecosystems. To explain how the proposed solution will address the Challenge, the proposal shows the KPIs transparently with clear indication. The purpose of the proposal is to increase the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases, increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products,... These objectives are closely to the challenge setting. The proposal has mentioned two risks that can be the barrier for the project to be successful and they have the solutions to those problems.

Gradually, in the long-term vision, the challenge should be adopted by not only schools but also the Cardano community, or even anyone that finds it interesting. The project offers very valuable prizes for the champions, which are iphones, xbox subscription and laptops. Moreover, an opportunity to get a remarkable scientific publication and experiences with citizen science are also very attractive and worthy rewards. At my first reading, I did not think that the project could expand its partnership to 500+ schools within 1 year. Yet, after considering carefully and checking relevant links about OpenLitterMap, I believe that it is possible for 2 reasons. Firstly, this is an innovative idea which aims towards a noble purpose, which is solving plastic pollution, climate change and many other global concerns. By aiming at the education from the early for children and teenagers, it has successfully offered a very reasonable and practical solution. Accordingly, I believe many schools would consider adopting this campaign because the next generations would be creative pioneers in solving these environmental problems. Secondly, a detailed plan with specific KPIs were given sufficiently and convincingly, including steps and ambitions to deliver the project successfully. This shows the dedication as well as the passion of the team towards the environment and the well-being of the society. In addition, one feature that makes this campaign special is that they apply an open-source mechanism, which allows anyone with the compassion to help develop it efficiently. In general, the information offered in this section is well-written, easy to comprehend and well-aligned with the challenge setting. Personally, I hope to see this project achieve some proper success in the future. However, there is still one omission point that I would like to offer. In my opinion, the proposal only expressed how it would affect education and the environment, but not how the Catalyst would benefit. I agree that leveraging some specific existing products such as Lace wallet or collaborating science projects on Cardano are good ideas, but not enough. My suggestion is adding some detail about how the challenge would integrate into Cardano, how it promotes Cardano or how it widens the Cardano ecosystem, etc.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "A plan with specific timeline and milestones were offered in this part.

Yet, I am still confused on the estimated quality of the work and whether it is sufficient to develop the whole project, since the total number of working hours needed and the average working hours per day are still not clarified. Moreover, $160,000 is still a huge amount of money, which requires thorough consideration. From my point of view, the developers should describe more about the results in their mind. They can consider giving out some imagination about the website displays, what categories it would contain, whether it is easy-to-use and attractive enough for students\u2019 attention,... These criterias would be very helpful to evaluate the feasibility of the project.
