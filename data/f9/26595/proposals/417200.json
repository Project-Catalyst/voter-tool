The issue you mentioned is in accordance with the Challenge, and it meets the requirement of using Cardano blockchain technology to create clean energy to help offset carbon emissions. This is a helpful product, a solid idea that is widely applicable, and there will be a new energy trend, thus this proposal has the potential to scale up in the future. The project adds value to the ecosystem by developing a platform built on the Cardano Blockchain that aids in the decentralized distribution of solar energy in San Juan to everyone in the globe in order to prevent climate change and its effects. The proposal produced the product that is also the environmental objective that Cardano is aiming for, with the intention for the community to change habits that have two for the environment. The solution is to create an ADA solar platform for solar energy decentralization that allows anybody in the world to participate in the Cardano Network's future 5 MW first solar farm. The proposal addressed centralized control of electric power plants and, in certain cases, huge corporations. The proposed solution is a platform that allows anyone to participate in the generation of solar power in order to decentralize solar energy and reduce maintenance and operational expenses. This is a good concept, because we all know that climate change has had and will continue to have major consequences for people's health, society, and the global economy. Many solutions have been implemented, with the ADA solar platform project being one example. The solar project serves to lessen the environmental consequences of power plants, and because solar energy is renewable and emission-free, it avoids future environmental costs. The proposal presented compelling reasoning. \nHowever, like with many other environmental projects, the proposal acknowledges the risks of project execution taking longer than expected. Furthermore, because this is an integrated technological product, the project is subject to platform security vulnerabilities. Because this is a new technology, project implementation is another risk that the proponent recognizes. The implementation of the platform might be difficult when there are few participants. Another risk the project may encounter is legal and tax issues, given there is no defined legislative structure for the area. Given the potential risks of implementing the project, the proposing team has created a solution to reduce the risk of implementation time, which is to use Agile software development to make decisions in the software projects that are required, and the solution evolves over time based on the needs of the project. The project's work is carried out through the participation of the self-organizing team and a shared process of fast and suitable decision-making when errors in the implementation process are detected. \nIn terms of security threats, the team has a comparison strategy in place that involves the project's two programmers cross-examining all platform designs to verify transaction security issues. A solution to the security issue is that the project expects third-party developers to independently review and test the platform. If there is a problem with the number of people involved in the project after the proposal is completed, the team proposes to come up with solutions to improve platform promotion and marketing so that more people are aware of the concept of new energy decentralization, the benefits of investing in new energy, and so on. There are incentives to promote participation. Faced with legal and tax risks, the project will propose a study to find a legal and feasible complete funding solution to ensure that the entire project can be used safely, which is expected to open an account in a cryptocurrency-friendly country to find the safest way to ensure that the entire project can be used safely. Claim that such funds have no effect on or limit one's capacity to execute. Another risk that I perceive is that rising global inflation would impact the price of the ADA, thus the team recommends having a provision of roughly 7-10% of the entire project cost. The project will have a significant influence on future energy trends. \nThe ADA solar platform will be the Cardano network's first solar decentralized platform, allowing everyone in the world to join and farm 5MW solar. It also assists many individuals in developing new energy habits, lowering emissions, and protecting the environment. The platform integrates Cardano blockchain products and technology to optimize global solar energy redistribution potential. I completely agree with this proposal, my point on the impact of this proposal is 5. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is implemented in three phases, the first of which has received catalytic financing from Fund 7. This proposal focuses on implementing phase 2 from September 2022 to February 2023. This is a plausible implementation timeframe because the project currently has a solar farm platform in place, therefore these proposals carry out the project's next task. The panel design and development, as well as platform infrastructure design and development, will take place between September and October 2022. In November-December 2022, the project will generate 3D platform game effects. It is expected to incorporate cryptocurrency and FIAT payments, security problems, and the design and development of additional features between October 2022 and January 2023. The proposed team will test the platform. The project will be coordinated by the team from September 2022 to February 2023. Those interested in the project may visit the project's website to learn more about it, track its progress, and download the project's various applications. The funding budget for the project is $78,000, which is less than 5% of the challenge. A suitable spending plan is included in the budget. As I indicated in the effect section, the proposed team does not provide a redundancy cost, therefore the team may think about doing so. I have an opinion on the utilization  of panel solar cells since this is a proposal that follows the proposal for the foundation for the cardano solar farm that was funded. I would like to comment on selecting the quality and technology of good panel solar cells to ensure and be compatible with the platform that you will build on Cardano in your earlier proposal that you intended to find a supplier of solar panels and materials. This includes preparation to dispose of or reuse batteries when they are no longer in use to ensure safety and protect the environment. \nThe proposed group of 8 members is given tasks that are clearly related to their experience. The members of the proposal team are all experienced professionals, and the proposal team's information may be verified on LinkedIn. Jose Ladicicco is a Catalyst community member, SPO ADA One, which has submitted 7 proposals, including co-hosting the Cardano Summit 2021 and hackathon 2022 in Buenos Aires. He has 20 years of experience working in the energy and technology sectors, and he has completed a solar power project in San Juan to power telecommunications systems in remote areas in order to create seismic detection networks, as well as business model research and feasibility studies for solar farms (Fund 7). This is a great and ecologically significant project that can be completed with an acceptable project progress timeframe, a sufficient budget spending strategy, and an experienced staff. Although my perspective on the utilization of solar cells is not part of the proposal's implementation at this time, I would want the proposing team to take this into consideration. This part is 5 point. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal provides the project success indicators such as tracking, pricing, and summarizing the project's progress and status using Agile software. The chart depicts task measurement and project status. A detailed evaluation of the project. These metrics are easily accessible via the project's website. Personally, I have no other recommendations for project success measures. The proposed group also states the project's effectiveness as being reflected in weekly group meetings. There are detailed monthly assessments. Set specific targets to guarantee that all essential milestones are reached. Soon, the proposal will outline the quality criteria that may be offered, as well as careful implementation planning and realistic expected timelines. \nThe proposed team would do early risk analysis and continual risk management. The proposal would find a competent team to support best practices in project management to guarantee projects are completed on time and under budget. The project's success is linked to the Challenge. However, because this is a new project, the second phase of a proposal approved on the foundation for a cardano solar farm, there is no test product. The proposal was funded. The proposal's website contains indicators of project success and project details. Although this project does not have a test product, it is the second part of a previously funded proposal, therefore the proposal's transparency may be verified weakly a bit.
