The first milestone is to get the proposer's codebase to become compatible with the Cardano code base. Later milestones have a milestone such as decoding data at the cost of 30K by two resources etc. The service of offering Cardano Chain data through API is well laid-out and there are some initiatives to open source the code base too.
