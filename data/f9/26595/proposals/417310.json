With Atala Prism induced anonymity comes the challenge of compiling detailed actionable data for the consumption of the advertising industry who will ultimately financially incentivize individuals who choose to participate. A series of specific quizzes allow end users to self report personal preference and interests that form the basis of interactions between brands and their customers. This project will create the methodology used by Profila to obtain user data in a pilot program using the travel industry as a client. By providing data stream acquisition and analysis using the model of self owned anonymized data, A Better Data Source\u2026.

In this case, Luke is a political scientist which gives him unique insights into data science and analysis.

Behavioral scientists and artificial intelligence professionals complement what is already a very strong and capable team. As a founding member of Profila, Luke Bragg\u2019s ongoing involvement in many prior funded projects demonstrate the capacity for seamless integration with the existing ZKA proposals.

It's based on surveillance and guesswork so impersonation issues are very likely. The solution is a new data source called Profila, which is directly created and controlled by individuals and is more accurate, authentic, and valuable than anything currently available, which is how the model is. Current monitoring will be destroyed. Profila's ambition is to bring self-determination and sovereignty to individuals to protect and monetize their data, preferences, sentiments, and insights. Profila will build two features under the name \u201cYouQ\u201d (for consumers) and \u201cEvergreen\u201d (for Brands) so it will ensure individuals have sovereignty over their data and how commercial and civic organizations interact with them, for their benefit. I agree that this proposal if implemented, will help grow the Cardano network. This proposal will build on other Catalyst projects for Profilela that have been funded in previous rounds.

For example, the progress of the project will be published on your website or Telegram, Twitter, or Discord so that the community can follow it at any time.

Detailed roadmap ensures tasks will be completed on schedule and feasible. Next is the budget. The team proposed a budget of $68,000. I believe the asking value is quite fair for the work and time of the project. The team explained in great detail the requested $68,000 budget.

The granularity of the proposal allows us to measure progress and audit in a secure and transparent manner.

This move will open the door for innovation in advertising, and Zero - party data is the most effective data source for advertising campaigns as it is exchanged based on the user's voluntariness and is as personalized as possible. However, this sudden change will make it difficult for many brands, especially small and medium brands, to find an external zero-party data source when they do not have the resources to collect and build a new database on their own, and this idea was born to solve that problem. The main goal of the project is to build a platform for collecting zero-party data (users provide data to the platform) and sharing data with third parties (partner brands of the platform) will be through the user's permission to access data. The author has done a great job in providing the concept of external data and how it is collected and used. The data collection model they plan to develop is also clearly described in terms of how it works, its core features, risks, and mitigations. However, the author has only clarified the positive effects of the proposal on brands and individuals, predicting its positive impact on the Cardano blockchain is quite vague. For example, will the integration of the solution on the blockchain bring Cardano user growth, engagement, and adoption?

I think with the solution Profila, a platform for customer engagement and marketing could help us to have the right to control who uses our data and for what purposes, besides, we also get a share of the revenue that Brands pay to access our data and to advertise to us. I think your idea about ZeroPartyData solution is very brilliant, it used innovative Blockchain-based solution that advocates the issues of privacy, security and transparency. We have been seeing massive surveillance, trafficking and abuse of personal information, and it is true that the current paradigm is dying because it fails to address current issues.
