Discord is one of the biggest platforms that has a lot of crypto discussion. Most defi projects building on Cardano have a discord where their community can talk. It would be amazing to be able to reward people that are active in the community. The current challenge is that there isn't an easy way to reward users for their on-chain interactions. The proposed solution to this challenge is to create a tool that will allow for these users to be rewarded. I think about the projects that would love to reward some of their early community members that help keep people in the community up to date. I think that this proposal has a very interesting idea and if implemented successfully it would bring a lot of utility to the Cardano ecosystem and people would like the idea of this proposal. I would suggest including a more specific solution to the challenge. There doesn't appear to be much detail describing exactly how this plan is going to accomplished. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 3 out of 5 stars. I like the idea, but there can be a more clear solution to the challenge. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "It is important to note that this proposal has included specific details on the individual working on the project. This is a good sign because it shows that the individual behind the project is willing to be held accountable for this proposal. This also shows that they feel confident being held accountable and suggests that the proposal may be implemented successfully. I found it interesting that the proposal includes Favro for most of their information. This is unique because it shows that the proposer has spent time on creating a more detailed roadmap. This includes all of the things that will be worked on in order to create this Discord tool. The specific details are important because it gives certain measurements that the community can follow-up with. There is also a budget breakdown given in the same Favro website. Most of the information is located there and requires the reader to access that information. It gives a detailed description on exactly how the proposer plans to user the requested funds. I like the idea of this product and I think that it can benefit a lot of users. My only question would be how the proposer plans to implement this tool when finished. How will the community find out about it? For all of the specific details given, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There is a good amount of information included in this proposal. I like that there is information included in the proposal and also on the Favro site. If all of the information was strictly on Favro then it wouldn't be as easy to read. It is also important to note that the proposal includes information on the individual that plans to work on this Discord community manager tool. There is specific information included in the roadmap and budget breakdown. I mention this because it is important to recognize these specific details as it helps audit the potential success of the proposal. This is because of the principle of accountability. Without this, it will be hard to determine how likely the individual will implement their proposed idea and how it will bring utility to the ecosystem. The proposal could include information on how the proposer plans to create a community behind the project that wants to see this utility come on-chain. This would be directed towards those active discord members who participate often. I would love to see this idea come to fruition. There just needs to be more thought put into this. I give this section 4 out of 5 stars because I believe it can bring a lot of value to the Cardano community members that are active in their Discord groups.

This project will help Discord communities display and query data from the blocj=kchain in the app. Tis project is mainly targeting Discor communities like: Stakepools discord, NFT projects Discord, Dapps Discords,...\nThis functionality is highly requested in the community and would scale linearly with the number of Discord communities in the Cardano ecosystem. Such project would limit the numerous scammers using address publication in channels on Discords to get newbies to send them ada. It will also help projects to verify users and match them with wallets for giveaway and voting purposes. The project also matches the guidelines of the challenge, more specifically it is an integration tool of the Cardano Blockchain in Discord that will facilitate querying the Blockchain and getting data from it. For instance one can obtain a wallet's ada amount, specific NFTs held by the wallet, its staking pool, Token help and many other data points that can be used by projects in the ecosystem to effectively manage their community and avoid technical issue that come with third-party authentication tools that might span users and mine their data.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The person taking responsibility for the project is a pretty experienced developer as it can be seen from the previous projects they worked on and their Github pages both the business and personal one.

Furthermore, the developer has shared an extensive portfolio that witnesses their experience and shows that they have the necessary expertise for this project. The time frame is not really explained in the proposal but te total number needed for the project is specified which makes sense since the dev is working on multiple projects in this funding round. The developer says that these projects do not intersect and can be accomplished simultaneously.  They also provide an inphographic that makes the project's idea clear to the laymen. Finally, the developer mentions that the projects has no risk since they are very experience in the field and knows what needs to be done and is confident they will be able to do it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The project will be an open-source tool that the community can check its development from github and will also be open for cloning and contributions from community members.

The developer has an extensive history in open-souce development and is experienced enough to make the project. The roadmap is presented in the form of main features and an overview of what the final project will look like. This will help the community jusge the final product and see if it matches expectations. No clear time is given for delivery, but the dev specifies that 120 hours will be needed to finish it which gives us a brought estimate of how much time it might take.

No way to verify wallet ownership.\". This as far as I know is not entirely true, as HAZELnet.io has already build a Discord bot suite for Cardano that at least allows integrating wallets, and has a proposal in this fund as well (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420382). Maybe the two proposers should try to collaborate where there are overlaps?\n\nRegardless of the status quo and lack of Discord integrations available, this project promises an open source, easy to use solution to manage Discord communities with Cardano projects, using the Blockfrost API and the discord.py API wrapper, and would take about half a year and a relatively modest budget, with a potentially very versatile and useful solution to all budding DAOs and blockchain gamers, dev communities and special interest projects on Cardano. This has immense potential to empower these communities to make use of the blockchain, and move from the old joke of the DAO to be \"a group chat with a bank account\" to become integral building blocks of the Cardano web3 structure. This is a neat fit for the challenge!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The provided Favro milestones, portfolio, proposer profile are much more detailed than most IdeaScale-centric proposals. The timeline and implementation steps looks credible and demonstrate good project planning skill.

Given the meticulous project planning and strong proposer background, I consider it highly likely that this proposal can be finished successfully and on time.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposer has prepared a tick box like Favro board for the entire implementation of the Discord Community Manager already, so it will be extremely easy to communicate the progress and for anyone to publicly follow the project going forward if it gets funded. As we are provided the personal and professional Github profiles of the proposer, LinkedIN, Twitter and Discord, this should be among the easiest to audit and most closely trackable proposals, at least among what I have seen so far.

However I took another look, and indeed buried in FAQ & the footer of the website was a link to the source! However, there are a few core problems\n\nThough the source is available, it's completely undocumented with no guides & not even basic steps have been taken to onboard collaborators. For example:\n\n- https://github.com/nilscodes/hazelnet\n- Virtually No Comments in the code (\ud83d\ude1e\n- No GitHub Issues\n- No Public Roadmap\n- No Setup Guide\n- No Contribution Guide\n- Confusing Structure for newcomers; multi-plugin repo with no map/directory.\n\nWith that in mind and considering the following:\n- They seem to have a few Communities using their paid tools\n- They are looking for more funds this round to start something unrelated\n- Only paid tools have documentation & advertisement\n- Changes on source are from 1 person\n- Seemingly no focus on supporting the Open Source community\n\nI am not hopeful on any changes in this area anytime soon.\n\nTeaming up may be a good idea, & I may reach out to them, however, it would not affect this proposal. I believe it's important for developers to have a Python based Discord bot for a few reasons, and Hazel is not written in Python.\n\n- Python is a known favorite for users just starting to program\n- There are many Python APIs, some that are only available in Python\n- Users may have pre-existing Python functionality they'd like to implement.\n\nOverall, I believe this Python based Discord Community Manager bot would appeal to developers who know python & allow that community to thrive with the tool. I'll also be putting a focus on Community to help sustain its' future growth.\n\nThanks again!"}, {"id": 9060, "q0": "This proposal seeks to create  an integration tool for Discord that also brings in information from the cardano blockchain. Something like this already exists as the Catalyst swarm is using it to track treasury spending funds. I am not sure how similar these two projects are and so I still believe there would be a positive impact. Having a plethora of these tools in the ecosystem would be beneficial. This is an integration between blockchain using blockfrost and Discord.  I think a little more market research could have been done prior to submitting this  proposal to see what tools are out there, other than that I'm willing to agree that this will have an impact on the ecosystem by enabling Discord communities integration with the blockchain.", "q0r": 4, "q1": " The feasibility here has been laid out using a unique presentation display, but there is sufficient detail to determine this is a feasible project.
