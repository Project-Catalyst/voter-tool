The primary focus will be put to ukiyo-e, which are traditional Japanese paintings. The proposer aims to become a widely used antique marketplace, and another feature that will be offered to users will be tokens, that will be issued to antique holders. I find this idea quite narrow-focused, because antique collectors are representing a small portion of the population. At the same time, I did not find a reason why such antique NFT marketplace would be preferred option comparing the current antique marketplaces/stores, that would drive mass adoption. The good start would be to identify the current problems that antique collectors are facing, and this platform would solve it. Otherwise, it will end up just another app, with more issues for its users \u2013 1. How to secure that if you buy NFT, the person who put it for sale does actually own it? 2. How to make sure, that the person will send it in physical form? 3. If the idea is not to send it in physical form, so how to get traction? Why would you buy such NFT? 4. How to make sure, that it is not advertised on different marketplaces over different blockchains, or current marketplaces off-blockchain?  5. If the focus group are antique collectors, why is assumed, that they will find joy in owning NFT, that is far from being antique? 6. When creating an NFT that is derived from real antique, who will check that set parameters are not falsified? E.g. \u201cred color\u201d instead of \u201clight-red color\u201d and we end up with different shades of the same antique? 7. What is the current number of people interested in antiques? Is there any research indicating that this would have the expected demand? To sum it up - more information is required that would support the popularity or adaptation of such marketplace. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The roadmap is divided into phase 1 \u2013 phase 3, where the each phase is having their high-level goals stated. For example, the first part is to convert Ukiyo-e to NFT and have it on Fibo = name of the marketplace. Then, another step is to prove ownership (but it is not disclosed how). And another goal is to have low gas fees on the marketplace. Also not discussed how to make sure of it, not mentioning that cardano has no \u201cgas fees\u201d at all, but I think the proposer was referring the transaction fees \u2013 which are very low in general. To be honest, the roadmap is missing a logical plan, and details how to accomplish what is aimed to be delivered \u2013 it appears that 3-6 months is just to mint NFTs, do \u201csome\u201d marketing, and content creation. The detailed time schedule, and expected time per each category is not disclosed e.g. full time? Part time? 2hour per day? What about wallet integration? When? For how long? Etc. The budget requested is 40k USD, and is also poorly prepared \u2013 5k for \u201cgas\u201d is again not clear. Why? 15k for artist commission \u2013 what does it mean? 5k for travel expenses \u2013 not sure when, since first 6 months are devoted only to mint and marketing + proposal is about NFT marketplace. 5k for experimenting with issuing tokens \u2013 the proposer admits that it is not clear for what it will be. The remaining 10k is for marketing, but it is not sure how much time is expected to spend on it, or how many people. The team is consisting of 3 people, with 2 linked in profile and one short bio. It appears that the main proposer is working with antiques, and another member is having experience with project management. Since there will be a lot of programming with creating such marketplace, a short bio of their engineer is not very convincing + visiting provided links is also not increasing the confidence. Also, no one of them seems to have marketing experience, and most likely Haskell dev will be required to write smart contracts for their marketplace. So more people will have to be hired, but there is no mention about it in a roadmap.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The progress of the proposal will be very hard to track, even tough the blogs and posts are scheduled to be created, what will be their content? Since the only activity is to mint NFTs. Token issuing is scheduled after one year \u2013 in phase 3, so what will be these blogs about? + how often will they be posted? Weekly? Bi-weekly? The success of the proposal is to be first antique NFT on cardano, to have users (buyers, sellers) and to set up development environment for Cardano. I think that the last metric is somehow misleading, how the proposer aims to set up a dev env for Cardano. Nevertheless auditing users is a good metric, as well as number of transactions would be valuable too. At the same time, following engagement of the community on twitter/youtube/tiktok could provide the sentiment of the market. To conclude \u2013 progress will be hard to track, because there is no clear tasks to follow + success can be tracked, based on some points mentioned in the proposal + some I have suggested.

It does readily admit that the team doesn\u2019t have a solution to guarantee that an antique represented by the NFT is genuine as it could be easily swapped out for a fake and manual tests are still needed to verify the authenticity. The proposal also acknowledged that they are still figuring things out which is quite fair given how early tokenization is. But this calls into question the value of using blockchain to tokenize physical assets which still needs physical and manual verification and enforcement of property rights and has been debated many times over with no satisfactory answer yet. What the team then proposes is simply to make an NFT capturing the traits of the antique, or put it more crudely, a JPG of an antique. One possible direction the team might go into is to custody the antique, verify its authenticity then issue an NFT with the right to redeem it. This way people can trade it and own it without having to deal with it physically. Again, what the team will do like many different teams that aim to tokenize physical assets, is to experiment with different levels of trade-offs between convenience, trust and security. If you want to physically own the antique you have to have the expertise to evaluate the antique or hire someone and have a secure means of storing and transporting the antique. Letting someone custody the antique gives more convenience but requires more trust in the custodian, only time will tell what the market and consumers prefer.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "It should be relatively straightforward given that the main deliverable is to sell NFTs of antiques already owned by the team. No new technical work needs to be done and no extra funds are needed to acquire antiques, the funds are mainly used to commission an artist to produce the NFTs.

While antique is known to hold high value, it seems hard to understand what the proposer aims to achieve with tokenizing the items. If minting the NFT's alone to produce value out of thin air, it sounds like a means for speculation thus inflating the true value of the antiques. The NFT space has enough speculation going around, the proposer needs to provide a utility instead for the NFT. For example, if the NFT is used as a means of verification for the authenticity of the antiques, then it is more useful rather creating more NFT images of the item for speculation. The NFT value should be hand in hand with the antique item itself. So the NFT should be sold together with the antique item. Unless the proposer is planning to make fractional ownership of the item by using NFT technology, then its a different story. It all comes down to the utility of the NFT. Therefore, in my opinion, this proposal does not addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The proposing team are experienced in antique items and also skilled in developing software. The proposer notes that he needs a haskell devs in order to work on the NFT tech even though he knows other languages such as solidity and java script and also marketing team to promote his project. \nThe budget of 5000USD for gas issuance is unclear. It might translate to the cost of minting the NFT's instead. 15000 USD for artist to create the NFT's are also unclear. I thought the subject matter is about antiques, so why should you hire an artist for the creation of NFT's? Unless you are talking about photographers to take professional photos of the antique art work. \nThe entire proposal will take about 2 years to complete, from the creation of NFT to marketing which is quite long in my opinion. The proposer did not explain on why it will take that long to complete the project. Was it because of the complexity of minting ? Or is it hard to get the attention of the audience for marketing? \nIn addition, the proposer acknowledge the risk in implementing the proposal which is to define the value of the NFT. As mentioned in the impact section, the proposer needs to find out the utility of the NFT itself before continue to execute the project. Without figuring out the utility of the NFT 1st, it seems that the proposal is just a concept rather than an executable project. \nTherefore, I disagree that this proposal will be implemented successfully", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposal provided a roadmap with timeframe of the project which is 2 years from the date of commencement until the delivery date.

In this example, it will be with antiques. This proposal addresses this challenge by creating an NFT version of the real-world antiques. My question would be, what is the use of someone owning an antique in the form of a nft? Most people have antiques because they want them to be displayed in their home. Will this be a big enough market at the current state of the world's understanding of blockchain technology? I would love to see this space become bigger and other physical items migrate to on-chain.

In this proposal, I would include a section talking about how your idea can benefit the Cardano ecosystem and how it will begin changing the space. I see a lot of utility with this idea.

Based on this information, the community can get an overview of the project and facilitate the assessment process. \nThe main risks during the operation stage are predicted; yet, the mitigation plans seem a bit vague. For example, risk (1) mentioned the problem with expressing the value of antiques but the solution is uncertain. The goal of the project is to bring new value to antiques through NFTs, it is quite contradictory at this point. Taking a look at risk (3), there is also uncertainty about how the team will figure out the target audience. These mitigation approaches might be not clear enough to ensure the viability of the project. As I can see, the promotion of the project is also a big challenge during the cycle of the project. How can the team approach the target audience, how to gain their trust with blockchain technology and NFTs token? The team also needs to take regulation concerns into consideration, in what ways the project will comply with legal procedures.\n\"", "q0r": 4, "q1": "\"The delivery plan has been provided in the proposal.

Regarding the marketing plan, the team plans to create content for about 6 months, so how many blogs/month will be published, how many videos will be distributed on social platforms (Tiktok and Youtube), who will be in charge, what is the translation process as the blog posts will be in Japanese and English? I believe a clear plan with solid deliverables will significantly increase the feasibility and logicality of the project.\nDespite a vague delivery plan, the budget has been well broken down. The funding is reasonably allocated given the costs for producing NFTs, traveling (the project currently targets 3 countries: Japan, Finland, and France), and experimenting with tokens issuing and marketing. The plan is presented quite clearly, supporting the community in the evaluation process.\nThe information about the team members presented is not really effective in indicating the capability of the team.
