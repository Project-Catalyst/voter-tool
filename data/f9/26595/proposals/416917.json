With explanation in the Impact section, Proposer and the company Mehen, seems are already prepared to develop this stable coin. In the cryptoverse, we can easily find articles about Tether which is not transparent in their USDT issue & redeem process. Proposer wrote that USDM or MUSD (need a concistency to write it) will issued and redeemed by Mehen company and will be backed by 1:1 $1 in an account at a US bank. That's the good things with this stable coin they plan to launch.\nProposer also already have a plan to get licences to run their USDM stable coin in their other proposal. One thing not mentioned in this proposal is \"who will auditing the Stable Coin?\" Once they get funding and launch their stable coin, it can be hard to audit when the majority are already using USDM in the DeFi ecosystem that will \"generate new USDM from interest.\" It might be nice if Proposer can explain it too in the Risks section.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In our local workshops, we are taught to assess every Proposal in a professional manner like there's no correlation do with any other proposals. Sadly, in this Feasibility section, Proposer only tell us to \"go check our detailed plan in Mehen Licenses\" or \"go check our team in website.\" Yes We can check them that way. But I believe that is an unprofessional way to write a proposal. If this method is allowed, it means that everyone can fill out all parts of the proposal by simply \"check our website for more details.\" Please take the time to write a good proposal according to the rules that have been determined.\n\nSo okay, I read the detailed plan and it's all well-writen and make sense to run it. The team are full of people with strong finance background. Their budget breakdown is a simple breakdown: $2 for KYC services cost and it allow 5,000 people to KYC. I think Proposer should explain where it ($2 KYC cost) come from too. Also, since this proposal is 1 of 3 Mehen's proposal, what if this proposal does not get a funding? So people should pay their KYC cost individually or else? This can be explain in the Risks part too.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Their metrics to measure who can literally measure is geographic regions where Mehen is being used, and the others (create future Cardano projects incubator) is can not be measured.

It is about creating a stable coin minted on the Cardano blockchain, this is something that so far does not exist in our ecosystem, and in my view it can bring real profits to Cardano. Some activities need stable currencies, for example: a bidder is financed and receives monthly money from the IOG to pay his team's professionals, but if he receives a certain amount in Ada and it depreciates, how will he pay the full amount to his workers? Some of the proponents convert Ada to USDT, but this crypto is minted on Ethereum, so it would be very positive if a new currency was created \u2013 MUSD, as the proponent christened it, and that it was fully pegged to our technologies. In my view, the proposal deserves top marks for impact because it represents a solution that can make life easier for community members and drive Cardano adoption.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately what the proposer does in the script part is not adequate. He asks us to consult other proposals to understand the action schedule, it would be necessary for the script to be posted here as well. We have no way of understanding how the two suggested parts would relate and how this would generate a single script to be followed. Ideally, he would explain, right here, what would happen each month, how, who would do it, etc. Talking about the budget, on the other hand, all that is said is that \u201cKYC services cost approximately $2 per individual. This proposal will allow more than 5,000 people to receive KYC verified wallets.\u201d These are not good explanations to justify the $10,000 asking price. No confidence is transmitted in the proponent either, as he does not attach any information about himself or about other people who would work on the project.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "Auditability is 100% composed of partial results, in my view. The bidder did not include a number of necessary information, as I will enumerate. First, we don't know how the monitoring of the development process would be carried out \u2013 what would be done, when, how, by whom and why. No bridge is established with our community capable of positioning us on small advances. The success scenario is constructed in a somewhat generic way, it would be essential to have more details, to carry out a more in-depth research on the impacts of the creation of this stable currency.
