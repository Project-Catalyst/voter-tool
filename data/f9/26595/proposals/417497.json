The solutions proposed by the proponent identify most of the problems of the challenge. The first is to use electricity as an identification point. It will then create an operating system and a decentralized application ecosystem (Reid). The goal is to Build the Software and Hardware devices of the future.

The solution to this risk is that the author will outsource to places where there are verifiable like fiver or freelancer.com etc. They will build a community and have people participate in projects and develop the ecosystem as needed. Create a payment mechanism to incentivize people to complete tasks and automate the process. I think this idea is great because it's decentralized, it's really transparent, and it's open to more people.

I found that the budget and roadmap sections of the project did not match. This $408,000 budget is for 1 year, but the roadmap is until Q2/2025. This budget has not been analyzed in detail. In addition, it took 3 months (Q3/2022) to set up the website and whitepaper, 3 months (Q4/2022) to find a team and build communication and a total of about 6 months to start developing the money system coins and rewards. The director's salary and media expenses are for 1 year, so how does the author plan to pay after that? There are budgets like Dapps, hardware... but according to the roadmap, Q1/2024 will just start. I really like the idea of \u200b\u200bthis project and I would like to have my personal opinion. If this project is long-term, then the author should divide it into several stages and apply for funding in many Funds. From there, the author should provide a more detailed plan and a more appropriate budget for the community to easily follow the roadmap and evaluate the feasibility of the project.\nI can see the author's profile through the link provided by the author.

In addition, new information and project progress should be regularly and periodically updated on the project's communication channels such as Twitter, Website, Github... both to increase transparency and increase interaction with the community. than.\nThe success of the project is determined when the user no longer has to worry about remembering his wallet, keys or credit card.

Besides, the proposal should specify about the target audience they aim to in details of the age or the outcome. One thing I wonder about the app is that if is is necessary to have that many smaller dapps. Can it be ccustomized in to one big REiD app with all of those smaller apps' features. I think that would be much convienient. I expected to see more information about the result of this project when completed and funded.

I find the budget is really big and there is no detail provided. The proposer should have slipted into smaller part.

Despite all the reports on how people lose money and even reputations from fraud and hacked accounts, many people still don\u2019t fully understand the real security implications of having their identity, as represented by their account credentials and information, stolen. They appear to be on the right track; the goal of developing future software and hardware is both inspiring and ambitious. The team truly knows what to do in terms of planning since they mentioned developing the operating system along with the decentralized applications. Having a rewards mechanism is a realistic way to attract people to the system. The proposers believe this project will have an impact on the entire global population, which shows the confidence they have in their \"child\". To compare with the challenge settings, they listed some categories that closely aligned with the key metrics, decentralized applications, products, and integrating. The targeted goal is to secure biometric data with a new ecosystem of daps. From all of those key points mentioned above, this project can lead to a successful result.

Skills and experience requirements should be included and how much time do they need to acquire a full team can not be passed as well. Not only that, in this Q4, there is a lot going on. For instance, building a media presence is a necessary part, but there is no solution or how they are going to do it to let more people know about the project. In addition, although they have not found the right people to work on the project yet, they still have a proper release date for software and hardware. This creates concerns about the true team deadline because even the proposers themselves don\u2019t know the level of developers they are getting. The budget breakdown also caused confusion since only yearly payments were reported. The total suggested budget for one year is $408,000, not a small amount of money, but what this money will be used for is vague. Funding reports should be at least monthly so that the community can follow it easily. Furthermore, they said they are finding a team for this project, but the salaries for the team and hiring payments are unknown, they are missing the most important element and it could affect total spending for the project.

The solution is presented in an excellent way, so it is easy to understand how people will be benefited. A video with a clickable design prototype enhances my understanding of the platform and its features. So I definitely agree that this project has clear goals that will create a huge social impact on Cardano.
