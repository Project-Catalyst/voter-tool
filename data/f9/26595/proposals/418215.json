The biggest issue is the lack of urgency in the problem statement. There\u2019s a lot of good data and research that can be presented about the importance of security by showing how much in crypto assets has been stolen through DEX exploits, the amount of assets that are traded on DEXs regularly, or any other piece of objective information that quantifies the magnitude of the problem/need. However, these stats are not likely to be unique to this particular project, so this proposal also has to make the voters understand why it matters that this DEX is written in \u201cPlutarch.\u201d This uniqueness is going to give voters the perspective to see why this proposal would be worth $96k, which is well above your average Catalyst proposal\u2019s requested funds. If these elements are provided, it better enables this sections ability to know what\u2019s actually going to happen as a result of this proposals approval. A security audit is not really aligned with Catalysts mission to pursue the highest levels of community innovation, but if the project itself is demonstrably innovative and unique then there might be a better reason for voters to protect it with a security audit. DEXs on Cardano are wildly competitive right now, with only a handful that are live right now and STILL there are many that are falling dangerously far behind. There is a risk that ought to be addressed that voters will approve $96k to pay for a platform that will not see substantial usage, therefore less than substantial impacts. I can\u2019t vote positively because I do not feel like I am shown that the benefits are worth the rather higher cost. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I rank this section a 2 because the given information is not enough for me to confidently see an objective plan and the efficiency in spending is unclear. I get the feeling that this team expects that voters will know who they are, which is a rather risky assumption when requesting funds higher than most. I would suggest putting a little more work into listing every relevant member of the core team (especially those that will be handling the tasks of the proposal). The information provided on the website appears to be out of date, as one of the two cited software engineers behind this team is no longer with Cardax (according to their LinkedIn page). There is an additional software engineer but the website does not provide a LinkedIn page or any professional experience, so I have nothing to evaluate. I suspect there could be sufficient experience on this core team, I\u2019m just not given enough information to vote with confidence on it. It\u2019s a similar story with the roadmap. The only actionable step on the roadmap is \u201ca full external audit\u201d but it doesn\u2019t really layout what the process of the audit would be. I can understand not wanting to confuse voters with overly technical process outlining but I think it\u2019s worth the effort to take the audit plan and simplify it into some actionable steps that voters can understand. As far as the budget goes, I\u2019m not left with a great impression in seeing that the audit will start March 28th, 2022. This tells me that either this project is looking to get reimbursed for an audit that was already done or the proposer is submitted information from an older proposal and didn\u2019t care enough to fix the details. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I\u2019m going to assume the former. In this scenario, I\u2019m not so optimistic about the need for this proposals approval because it\u2019s already been done. If it hasn\u2019t yet been done, the given budget does not show efficiency in spending and it doesn\u2019t add up accurately. A security audit should cost $100k if you\u2019re a large corporation that has a wide variety of needs to attend to. Every bit of information I can find on the cost of a professional outsourced security audit says that it should cost $60k at most but can often be closer to $25k. At $3200/day for two people, the hourly rate is coming out to $200/hr. At face value, this seems wildly inefficient/exorbitant spending to any average voter. It could be conceivable that the needs of this type of security audit requires highly specialized knowledge or additional work that isn\u2019t in your average security audit, so those special circumstances need to be justified for voters if they are to react positively. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "With the 3-4 sentences given in this section, I do not feel like I have enough substance to properly evaluate this team\u2019s perception of what good performance/success would look like. This section is the opportunity for the proposer to show the voters why the approved funds were worth it. If a proposer asks for a large amount of funds, but doesn\u2019t expect to see a lot of usage or impact on the world, then voters can\u2019t confidently vote positively for that. I think Catalyst funding was a lot less competitive in funds 4 and 6, so it may take more work in crafting a quality proposal to see approval in the future of Catalyst. The only given perception of success in this proposal is completion of a security audit. However, there\u2019s no information about what is intended to come out of the security audit. I think there\u2019s a lot of room here to present something about reactivity to the security audit, ability to make adjustments, the number of successful fixes, and perhaps some kind of objective security score goal. This section needs to link the expectation of outcome to the potential impacts that could come out of it.

This challenge setup I find perfectly suitable for large projects like Cardax. I know, Cardax Dex is already a well-known DEX in the community and will be coming to Cardano soon. The ultimate goal of the project is to allow anyone to trade Cardano and ADA native tokens in a non-custodial manner.
