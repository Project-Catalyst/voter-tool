The objective is easy to process and so is the target market - lodging. That being said, the proposer should still demonstrate the vast potential of the lodging industry (preferably with figures and coupled with the growth of tourism) to highlight the great impact the proposal could have on the Cardano community. Imagine if the project could promote tokens to be used for widespread bookings and rental fees, Cardano will receive huge publicity as well as investment from traveling and accommodation giants (hotels, resorts chains) as well as individual lodging estates). This is a great point on Impact that can be explained further. The financial incentive for using $KIRK is a discount on payment - this is a simple but effective way to encourage the use of cryptocurrency. The proposer highlights how receiving funds will add assurance to investors as well as the short-term growth. Initially, Erdos will offer token transactions for a discounted fee which gradually progresses to more services (ex: tokenization) as counterweight to mainstream centralized lodging services. The selling point of this project and also the key idea of the solution is to reduce conventionally overpriced exchange fees to minimum using cryptocurrencies. To better highlight how fiat money transactions are overpriced, the proposer should make a comparison with clear figures for better visualization of the proposal. A good point that the proposer makes is that the high exchange fee does little to the community, unlike Cardano. From this point, the proposer can explain how the Cardano community has a clear mission to work towards a better world through innovative ideas from blockchain technology. Therefore, using $KIRK to support Cardano is a way to do good. Another strong point in this proposal is the clear presentation of resources (Kirkstone), output (dApps - practical integration to Cardano ecosystem) and a whole section dedicated to explain their impact on the Cardano ecosystem, Catalyst, homeless community: the Cardano network will be utilized, fiat users can also onboard Cardano - which are of significance once achieved; charitable offerings for the homelessness - a good gesture of altruism that puts the Cardano community in  good light.

Hours of development are provided, with an estimated cost of 70usd/hour for an arrival at the total cost. However, hours spent on marketing is yet to be announced, something that should be rechecked once information is fully updated. The team members are presented with clear information that gives assurance to their credentials. The number of team members seems to be sufficient to carry out the project of this scale and their roles in the project are specified. A plus point is that the proposer is confident that no further funding will be needed.

Many People allocate a portion of their disposable income every year for planning vacations. Then there are students and employees who are away from their homes and need a place to stay. These are just some examples of how much demand is there for this industry. Normally these services are being booked through traditional marketplaces like AirBnB and Vrbo. The problem with the these systems is the excess fees related to the use of fiat as a payment vehicle. Furthermore, the fees included in these lodging systems do not contribute directly to the community. Also if the consumers and landlords are from different countries, this involves more the one fiat currency and makes the payments more difficult. \nThrough this proposal, named Kirkstone, the team is developing an online marketplace for standard lodging. The platform can be used by landlords and renters to find the suitable options which fulfills their requirements. The payments can be done and accepted in the native currency of the Protocol $KIRK and later on other options like ADA and COTI might be added to the options. Tenants who use $KIRK to pay their rental fees will be given a discount, incentivising them to use this currency. The project aims to bring the public to Cardano by offering renting service that is integrated within the Cardano blockchain. Taking market share within the renting space would bring the masses to Cardano, further driving growth and innovations within the space. This proposal, if successful, might help to onboard a significant number of fiat users onto the Cardano blockchain.***\nThis aligns with the objectives of this challenge and will help in the adoption if Cardano through the development of dApp. The concern I have with the project is that renting a space specially for medium to long turm involves legal issues like making formal contracts and verification of Tanents  through law enforcement agencies. As there are no laws, at present, which can help in conducting these activities using Cardano blockchain, getting the real world adoption will be quite difficult. Also looking at the fact that project is focusing on UK market, it might further limit the scope of the project specially if there are some anti crypto regulations posted in that Jurisdiction.

The team did well in predicting the main risks that might happen during the execution process followed by a brief of reasonable solutions. However, if possible, the proposers can give more details on the risk management plan so that the community can access their capability. For example, when working on the government regulation, the team can predict some upcoming changes based on collected data, or how they can keep up with changes (e.g. hire local lawyers). Some of the characteristics of fiat currency are that it has social-economic consensus and is accepted for taxes.

The team aims at solving this by providing a cryptocurrency alternative to AirBnB and Vrbo called Erd\u0151s dApp, which is cheaper and easier to use for hosts and guests. I like how the problem statement and solution are both comprehensive and relevant to each other. The proposer is specific in articulating what the benefits are for each stakeholder and provides a picture of how the project will be implemented. It's also extremely great how the author discusses the essential tasks that would take place in the Dapp, providing us a solid understanding of what this idea is about and how it would work in practice.

Various activities are required in each phase but we can know how long it takes to finish every single one of them in the form of working hours. The proposers demonstrate not just when, but also how the task is completed. The idea described here is very straightforward, therefore I don't see why it should be split more. In terms of budgeting, it is extremely helpful to have a breakdown of the actual costs that are planned in the roadmap. The team requested an amount of $88,100 and did a good job describing how the money will be used and distributed.

It can be said that their application still acts as an intermediary application, but they will charge a lower fee than the intermediary fees on the market today. I think users always like what the promotion is and this app will be able to attract a number of new users to sign up in the beginning and later if the intermediary fee keeps it the lowest and lower than the average fee of other online marketplace for lodging service applications in the market. Incentivizing the use of cryptocurrencies for payments instead of fiat could also boost Cardano's liquidity capabilities. however, the proponent still hasn't provided us with the exchange rate between other currencies to their native currency $KIRK, for example, how many dollars is 1 $KIRK?

Monthly reports, and report from new phases were updated. The KPIs were well set up, splitting the KPIs into development phase, short-term phase, long-term phase. The success scenarios were provided (from \u201caverage\u201d to \u201cbest\u201d), helping the audience to follow up the projects and understand if the project was successful or not. \nHowever, from my point of view, to improve this proposal, the proposers should try to have certain numbers of these KPIs in a given timescale.
