If the proposer is able to deliver charts and data about the Cardano ecosystem in a portable form without the need to host the data on local servers, it would likely go a long way towards promoting Cardano projects and metrics to the general public. \n\nOne could make the case that this project could fit in the Developer Ecosystem category, but its functionality and sustainability model more closely mimic that of many existing SaaS integrations, so it's probably fine where it is. \n\nOn that note, the business model aspect of this proposal is perhaps as important to it as the product itself. LIDO Nation will essentially leverage the Cardano stake pool system, as well as its own tokens and NFTs, in a way to make the components accessible to a large audience for \"free.\" While there's no guarantee the Rising Tide model will work, the ramifications if it does are significant, as it would demonstrate the viability of model in which the user does not permanently lose money, but still contributes to the sustainability of resources. In that sense, Cardano Components is conducting two very useful experiments for the community. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Darlington and James look to be a solid pair to lead this task, bringing together engineering knowledge and education. As noted above, LIDO Nation's Catalyst stats are attractive and easily read. \n\nThe project's design is to be self-sustaining after this round of funding, with budget outlays made for learning modules to encourage the creation of additional components down the road. Given that LIDO Nation is already creating attractive charts, the timeline appears to be reasonable for creating an infrastructure for components with API access. \n\nThe budget looks reasonable, but we need some clarification on the Component & Blockchain Developer line item, which is for 100 hours of Senior Developer work at $75/hr. That still leaves $1,500 of the requested funds unaccounted for. Is this a typo, or will those additional funds be used elsewhere in development?\n\nQuestions, of course, will remain as to whether the Rising Tides model can sustain this project indefinitely. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Auditability for the components should, as the proposer claims, be pretty straightforward. Stakeholders will know rather quickly if the components offered work or not when completed. In the interim, auditors will be able to follow the open source development of the project.\n\nThe success of the Rising Tide model will be harder to assess, and will be dependent largely on the proposer's self-reporting. As it's not the primary deliverable, however, I'm not factoring that aspect into my scoring here. Nevertheless, brownie points if the proposer comes up with a system for tracking the monetization outcomes of this project.

It will be possible to sign up for the service, grab embed code, then show rich data with no maintenance. It will benefit developers in their own Tech Stack along with people who want to learn about Cardano development: Project based learning (PBL). The project also plan to scale the project with RisingTide revenue model designed to increase community engagement. The proposal fits the DApp, Products and Integration very well in that the integration will lay groundwork for the community to visualize the ecosystem better and increase interest in new people groups. The risk for this project is community buy-in which the team will try to tackle with RisingTide revenue model. The team mentions that the service is for free if the individual participate in cardano communities who are  focused on education, open source blockchain tooling, DAO enablement and community building. However, it will be tricky for them to classify people working on projects which may not be directly related to education, open source tool or DAO enablement as they stipulate. Since the project is funded with catalyst community, wouldn't it be fairer that it is free for all?

Step 3: Public library, documentation and incentive implementation. Total project length is 6 months and beyond with RisingTide Model. The budget breakdown is detailed and sensible. The project will be led by 2 individuals who are very much involved with community. The RisingTide model for later period is a good idea as delegation and NFT sale to incentivize their participation in creating new components. However, hope the team would consider the free for all users in the beginning (maybe at least the first 6 months) and then later implement the RisingTide Model. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success of this proposal is that the community come together to create new components. Since the code is open source, it will be fairly straightforward for community to track. There will be 4 outputs ready for the community upon the new release: 4 starter component, 4 additional component for bounty deliverables, website hosting all components and Gimbalab PBL modules. The community can track buy-in contribution along with the adoption easily.

With this challenge in the community, LIDO Nation Foundation plans to create a website that promotes education within the community. They will do this by allowing their product to host their own infrastructure so that teams of certain projects don't have to. This proposal plans to bring more utility to the ecosystem by improving these steps. This will benefit both developers working on projects and community members that are interested in development such as Program based learning. This could have a positive impact on the Cardano community by promoting decentralization due to implementation of DAOs in their project and creating tools that benefit different members of the community. For these reasons, I give this section 4 out of 5 stars. I think that the team can be a little more specific in the solution category.

Their roadmap is split up into three different section and states that this entire project will take about 6 months. This may seem simple, but it is extremely important when determining the likelihood of this proposal being implemented successfully. This is because it gives specific details that will allow for the community to hold them accountable to. There is also a detailed budget breakdown. Within this section, they explain where all of the requested funds will be used.

All of the information helps suggest that the team will be capable of creating their Web Embeds. There will be implementation that allows for more tools for builders and community members of interest. The team at Lido Nation Foundation and Gimbalabs have given their personal details and in a sense have provided KYC verification. This helps the community to hold them accountable to this proposal. As stated above, there is also specific details and timeframes that the team plans to reach. The team should remain transparent with the community and be open to suggestions and comments. When the team is transparent with the community and trust is built between the team and community, there is more room for accountability.
