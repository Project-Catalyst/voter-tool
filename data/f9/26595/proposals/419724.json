A communication tool with the wallet holding the desired NFT. As stated in the proposal, we can find our desired NFT at the marketplace (JPGStore) along with the owner of the NFT. However there is no way to communicate with the owner. With this proposal, Cardano community members in the NFT are able to communicate and thus providing benefits to the community. With that in mind, I strongly agree this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal has all the details listed down clearly. By allocating each milestone by modules, the proposal clearly shows the time needed and cost breakdown of each modules clearly. With this information, the project is achievable. The team seems solid, with a group of software engineers with experience ranging from 2 to 3 years along with an experience graphic designer. Though lacking track record, I still believe the team can accomplished the project. The biggest challenge and risk of a messaging platform are security and spam. The team addressed this by mentioning they would include several prevention measures to mitigate the issue. Though I would have prefer message encryption being develop with the release rather than an future development. With this, it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Clear roadmap and deliverables are listed in this proposal. There is a clear communication channel using Discord which is a plus. The proposal has 2 target set Short Term and Long Term success. On the first Short Term Success, the key metric and indicator are well listed, with the given information, I believe its sufficient to measure the short term success of the proposal. Now for the Long Term success, again key metric and indicator are listed. But they are not as detail as the first. Though this is just a small set back, I am grateful for the information is given.

An example would be 2 people holding NFTs that represent an interest in protecting the environment. There is no easy way yet to talk to another wallet which might have the same interests as you and thus makes it hard to find like-minded people to collaborate with. This could also add more depth to GameFi and metaverse dApps and make it easier for them to integrate chat features and build a community. Though more details would strengthen the proposal such as how is it being run and where the chat data is stored, do users have to pay fees every time they send a text? And what if a user does not yet use the messaging platform, is it still possible to reach them?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems well rounded enough having experience from engineering to design so they should be able to finish the project. Milestones, timelines and budget are detailed and seems reasonable. It is also nice that the team indicated not needing further funding but it is likely that future upgrades will always need to made, the only question is whether the upgrades are going to be done by the open source community or does Catalyst have to fund it. It should also be noted that the team is working on other proposals from the current and previous rounds so they might be stretched a little too thin.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team will share monthly progress reports to Catalyst and on their discord.

As the article correctly notes, ecosystem maturity and Cardano adoption are likely to arise within and outside of the chain. These measures are very closely linked with the KPIs to measure the challenge, which gives the proposal a favorable outlook. They have plans to encrypt messages as their future plan, which demonstrates that the author wants to ensure their product is to the best of its abilities. The proposer also takes it upon himself to thoroughly identify any dangers that the project may have to overcome in order to offer effective outcomes. The community members would be truly independent if the implementation were effective because they wouldn't need to use their web2 IDs for any form of communication. Since wallet-to-wallet messaging is open-source, it will always be free and available for any company or person to integrate with their services, encouraging greater acceptance and simple usage.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the likelihood of the proposal's successful execution, there is no room for question. As a reader, I am given a lot of information about the background research that has already been done, the types of references the proposer has consulted, the action plan's succinct description of the strategy the team is considering, and what the community can anticipate throughout the development phase. Even though the budget breakdown is relatively superficial, the quantity of development required and the type of team assembled undoubtedly demand a price in light of their experience and skills and the total fund isn't enormous too. Since Sam has experience working with names like \"rarely.io\" and \"Gimbalabs,\" which are extremely popular in the community, his contributions are clearly valued overall. Given the importance of hassle-free chain communication and the type of tool the team is offering to address it, the community should take a chance on the proposal's viability and work with them. The only reason to deduct a point would be because there is no set deadline to reach the milestones and they are not clearly defined.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal's objectives are clearly stated, quantifiable, and based on the clear road map in front of us. More trust is given to the plan via the Monthly Reports, ongoing debates, and feedback loops on disagreement. The measures are in line with the requirements of the challenge and will certainly be crucial in encouraging people to start utilizing their wallets as their identities going ahead. Because the project is open-source, assessing it in terms of technological progress is simpler. The pre-launch and post-launch metrics are quite clear and useful, despite the milestones' lack of technical specifics and timelines linked with each of them. Whether or whether the proposal was successful will be determined by the number of organizational and individual adopters as well as the number of dApp logins. The ultimate success story to look forward to would-be developers using their code to integrate into their projects, as stated by the drafter himself as the long-term goal. I agree that the auditing of this idea should be very simple given the abundance of KPIs and ambitions, and if financed, this may offer Cardano a completely new outlook and the holders a new identity.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 0, "ng": 10, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7902, "q0": "This project aims to introduce an interesting feature: The ability to communicate with our new web3 identities.

It was easy to find the wallet address containing the NFT, but not so easy to get in touch with the owner of that wallet. \u201cNot so easy\u201d is really an understatement. It was near impossible. Except if the entire collection was only a few NFTs and almost all of the people that owned those NFTs were in that collections Discord server.  Having a \u201cA wallet-to-wallet messaging app where individuals can privately message each other\u201d will allow for lots of engagement between community members. People will get messages for offers on NFTs they have probably forgotten about already\u2026.or that they themselves think have little value. \n\nThis proposal adds value to the Cardano ecosystem in the following ways. Providing an integration between wallet messaging that the community can use. Also it will allow for more transactions being performed due to users being able to directly message a wallet holder.

These are all encouraging signs and since they are proposing to build a wallet messaging app, their skills fit well with this type of proposal. \n\nAll of the budget is allocated to working hours spent on the project. The ability to block or enable messages and sharing of links is a good way to mitigate some of the risks(scams, private data leaking) this project can face. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One could not match the budget timelines with the tasks on the roadmap. For example the budget allocates ten days to UX research while the ten days are not indicated in the roadmap for the same topic. Also on comparing another budget item with the roadmap I found a mismatch in completion time. On their budget the backend and frontend development is said to take 50 days while on their roadmap the indicated time is 34 days.  An assessor and a voter will now have to guess which one is it. The proposer should include numbers of days/weeks or dates in the roadmap and not leave this open for interpretation.\n\nThe proposer lays out the problem clearly and shows steps on how to go about developing the app. \n\nThe proposer will submit bi-weekly progress to Catalyst and their Discord.

These wallets help users make many transactions every day. However, messaging between two wallet users is quite difficult. I am using Yoroi and Nami wallet. In Yoroi, we can transact but cannot include a message in each transaction. Nami wallet is a bit better, when making a transaction, there will be an \"Optional message\" section for you to send a message. But to send a message to the receiver in the Nami wallet, you have to make a transaction, and it costs a fee of at least 0.17 Ada. This proposal would build an open-source wallet messaging app that can be integrated into Cardano wallets and users can send messages between two wallets. This idea has many benefits for both Cardano wallets and the entire Cardano ecosystem. It will also facilitate the move towards fair trading between wallets without going through third-party platforms with audited smart contracts.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As I mentioned above, when you make a transaction on Nami wallet, there will be an \"Optional message\" section that allows you to send a message to the recipient. However, you can only send a message when you make a transaction, and that will cost you a fee. So I wonder if the open-source wallet messaging app is integrated into Cardano wallets, will there be any fees when users send messages through the wallets? Is the mechanism of the open-source wallet messaging similar to that of Nami wallet? The proposal's team should have explanations for the above questions to help users better understand the proposal. About the team, there are 4 people: Sam Jeffrey, Harsha Gullapalli, Satwik Gade, Srinivas Vijayakumar. They have experience in programming, design, and web. The project roadmap is divided into 3 parts: UX Research, UI Design, Backend & Frontend Development. To make all of these parts, they need a total budget of $13250.
