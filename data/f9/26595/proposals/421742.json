Multisigs on Cardano is much needed as our ecosystem is growing fast with increasing number of DAOs and communities where funds are controlled by multiple parties. Generally a multi-signature make it possible for 2 or more users to have access to the funds but WH Cypher wallet has edge over its competitor as it covers multiple blockchains. The multisig schema (utilized by WH Cypher) allows wallet users to generate unlimited amount of anonymous t-of-n multisigs on any blockchains at no cost. Hence, WH Cypher has high potential for scaling to address future challenge. The proposer team is prudent and acknowledges that their work is based on threshold signature which have to be extra cautious in implementation and require a security audit by external company. WH Cypher wallet is \"noncustodial\" and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Bitcoin cash and more.

The team has  knowledge in blockchain protocols and cryptography algorithms and also mobile development. Part of the funding will help them to deliver this wallet solution to mobile. The ranking of 5 is based out of many factors: the team knows what they are doing (skills & experiences) , their solution will enhance the growth of ecosystem (solution is limitedly available for institutions and now available for Cardano DAOs), and that their technology is cited by third party media report which give me a strong confidence in this team that they will be able to fulfill their project promise to the community. Since they will come back for future funding round to provide Cardano web3 support, I would highly recommend the team to consider putting linkedin or any links that shows skill and previous work of team and also not only mention what needs to be done but by whom and elaborate more on the budget breakdown( number of working hours and the pay rate of team members) to boost their project feasibility.

It seems the impact of such a solution could help a mass amount of ADA token holders by providing a new way to store and access their crypto and assets, while allowing big investors or companies within the space to allocate transactions where multiple signatures are required for a plethora of different reasons. As multi-sig wallets may not be top priority within the Cardano ecosystem today, having such a wallet readily available could be viewed as a huge benefit to new investors, DAO's and veteran holders of ADA that have been waiting to take advantage of the possibilities of multi-sig transactions.

All they do is describe how complicated multisig technology is. The solution they mentioned above about providing a unified multisig wallet seems to already be built, according to them: https://www.whalesheaven.com/whcypher. I looked into this project however and I found the following: a youtube channel created in 2020 that has 4 subscribers and 6 videos, no reviews or sources other than themselves talking about it and a website that keeps pointing the user to installing this wallet, which is a chrome extension with 0 reviews and 261 users (for comparison, Eternl wallet, created much more recently has 41 reviews and 70000 users). To be blunt, I do not think this project is legit. \nAs risks, once more, all they added is that cryptography is difficult and they need to be extra cautious during implementation.\nWhile the proposal fits the challenge, the information in the Impact category and what I found on the internet about the project leads me to believe this proposal will not effectively address the challenge.

The requested budget of 15000 USD is actually extremely small for something the proposer claims to be extremely complicated and as a result needing top tier developers. They also wrote the following line: \u201cWe will request a security audit (optional, external company) - 2 weeks (this is additional expenses, we will appreciate Cardano community will be able to help with that)\u201d. What does this even mean? Will that security audit be requested or not if you state it\u2019s optional? How is it an additional expense, is it not part of the proposal\u2019s budget? Moving on, there is no budget breakdown, only the mention that the money will be used to cover the developer time mostly.

The budget breakdowns is important because Catalyst is an open community funding, and the community needs to know how the budget will be used.
