It also identifies a major pain point in existing systems--namely the cost of compliance for carbon removal credits--and offers a potential blockchain-based solution. \n\nThe impact statements do a good job of setting the background table before zooming in on the two use cases that would be funded by this proposal, though I'd encourage the proposers to drive home to precise scope of the proposal just because this is such a big, sprawling issue with many moving parts. \n\nShould this project prove successful, it would likely greatly raise the profile of Cardano and push the boundaries of what the average person believes blockchain technology can be used for.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This project is largely building upon existing work and projects, some of which are from previous Cataylst rounds. The proposal cites, in particular, the Fund 8 proposal \"NGO transparency,\" which sought to build an accountability tool that tracks the allocation and outcomes of NGO expenditures. Since NGO Transparency is a major part of the foundation upon which this proposal is being built, it would probably be helpful for voters to know the current status of that tool and how successful the project was, and to have that information easily accessible to voters.\n\nThe timetable for this project looks ambitious and seems largely dependent on how well pre-existing tools and technology can be leveraged, and how well the proposers can coordinate between all of the partner organizations they're teaming up with. Despite the many potential points of failure, the project's team looks very strong, combining decades of experience in NGO management, product development, agricultural science, and satellite tech, as well as familiarity with the Cardano blockchain and community, so I think there's reason to be optimistic. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team's promise to make the satellite data they gather available should make auditing this project more fun than most. Confirming that the data that's made available is of high quality may take some expertise or at least familiarity with the subject on the part of auditors, but the Cardano community should be large and diverse enough to handle the task. \n\nAdditionally, the team has demonstrated an ability to put together effective reports and an interviews.

The project has launched a Wed3 construction solution that features tracking, soil quality assessment, jobs are done on the Blockchain platform. The solution is in line with the challenges installed at F9, meeting the needs of environmental improvement. The transparent solution is the interest of plant protection organizations, clean food manufacturers such as WhatIF-Foods, whose authors have come up with links that prove this. What is the current state of the land? The author gave specific information, evidence on Wedsite shows that the quality of the soil is being sliced, we will lose 24 billion tons of fertile soil and 95% of the land area degraded by 2050. Huge amounts of land are lost, agricultural productivity decreases, food supplies decrease, product quality decreases, human health has many problems, climate change will affect the global economy. Preventing climate change is the implementation of major challenges, the author has appropriate research to come up with solutions to the problems. The project has specific information proving that land degradation, climate change needs to be quickly overcome. The use of satellite imagery, the use of AI to determine forest status, the collection of data on plants, temperature, cloud cover, spectroscopy, etc. The figures are written on the Cardano chain and shared, the figures prove that the donors, affecting them to renovate areas that are seriously affected, degraded land needs to be renovated. The project's solution has an impact on Cardano's development goals, helping developing countries have better agriculture. The image of the Cardano ecosystem is promoted, donors make positive moves for the ecosystem. The solution of the project has answered the appropriate purpose to solve the problems presented. The project has identified challenges to the implementation plan, the work needs to be done carefully with the appropriate monitoring mechanism that increases the accuracy of data from satellites, the work of recording data locally is specifically guided to bring the most accuracy to the project.

Technical solutions, wed construction structures, applications such as: UX, ledger integration, satellite technology development, etc. are clearly explained, the method of logical implementation. After 4 months of implementation the product is delivered with the wed application and all the data is in accordance with the stated solution. The project, carried out by Yosef Akhtman, had full information and demonstrated competence when implementing a proposal at F8 with the theme \"NGO transparency\". In addition to the support of 3 team members, they have information about the ability to perform proof on LinkedIn. There is a clear assignment for each member for the fields of engineering, management, satellite technology, etc. The help of the Forest Conservation Fund, the Pond Foundation, and WADA is a factor in the successful implementation of the project. Recommended amount: $88,000 is only 1% of the cost of the F9 challenge.

The KPI is appropriate to determine that the project is implementing in accordance with the schedule. The success indicators of the project are clearly described, easy to understand, the data collection process is completed, the amount of CO2 is isolated. Data from satellites and local people collected is public and transparent. Application, wed provides additional foundation for Cardano's environmental projects. The phase of expanding that application is the method of land reclamation, habitat, combating climate change. The proposal is a continuation of two projects in F8 and will be extended to F10.
