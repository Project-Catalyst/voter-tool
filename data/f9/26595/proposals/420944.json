The idea is to improve upon the process of creating a proposal (by incorporating a collaborative and efficient feedback-method), and thereby potentially increasing the quality of the proposals and overall experience. It is a very modern approach of working in 5-10 minute bursts, and fits where modern learning are skewed towards (speaking from my experience as a teacher and researcher of education and social behaviour).\n\nQuoted from the proposal, which I found to be very describing of the intention of the proposer: \n\n\u201cBy using an iterative design process that uses findings in 2-week cycles, we demonstrate to\u00a0the catalyst community that we can work towards novel design approaches within weeks, instead of months or even years.\n\nEducating the community on how social iterative design leads to compounded insights into design solutions, cost-cutting, and increasing development speed.\u201d \u2028\u2028This integration is directly aimed at the Catalyst workflow and experience, so instead of starting from the outside (for example wanting to create a mobile game and bring it to Cardano) this will grow from within the ecosystem and possibly affect many different proposals that come in contact with Catalyst, and possibly for a very long time.\nIn my experience as a recurring PA since Fund 6 I\u2019ve seen many discussions on the proposal process being discussed, and expanding upon our perspective and options how proposals are grown would only benefit the ecosystem, in my opinion. \nIf the workflow addresses more people with different preferences, it will most likely attract more proposers to Catalyst (and considering the focus of this proposal, higher quality proposals), more projects lead to increased adoption, increased adoption leads to the ecosystem growing, etc. \u2028\u2028What the proposer aims to achieve is very clearly stated in the proposal, as is how the proposer plans to achieve it. The explanations on the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 are very thorough (very much appreciated the inclusion of the value pyramid, and the explanations on iterative design work), and explained in terms that are inclusive. Even without technical expertise, the proposer makes it easy to understand the proposal. From my experience as a teacher, if someone can explain something complex in simple terms and are able to address a lot of different people, that shows that they have deep understanding of what they are talking about. They also seem to have considered the risks of not attracting enough participants during the research-stage by implementing a small reward structure, even though I believe (personal opinion) that the project has the potential of attracting enough people during development (due to its inclusive nature).\u2028\u2028Conclusively, I consider this proposal to be highly relevant (aims to increase proposal creation process and proposal quality), and also having potential of bringing a huge amount of value to the Cardano ecosystem. \nI strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Reading through the roadmap, I\u2019m very impressed with the details included. The development process has a very clear method of first researching and preparing, then inviting peer groups to help assess the research, reflection, improvements and repeat. As with the main idea for this proposal, the development reflects the same form of inclusivity. I love these kinds of collaborative and communicative approaches to learning, and in my experience as a teacher it fits this system really well. I have no suggestions for the roadmap to be improved upon. It includes a lot of details on the process, includes milestones along with estimations of timeframe. \n\nThe budget breakdown is as detailed (linked spreadsheet), and combines the estimated working hours/hourly wages and combines it with the timeframe of the roadmap, superb. The budget estimations seems reasonable, although it depends on if the team members are working on other projects simultaneously. For example, the UI-designers are budgeted for 25 h/week, for 5 weeks, but what if the person responsible for the design has other proposal that they are working on? A discussion on the potential risks regarding the workload would benefit the proposal greatly, I believe. \nOne of the two proposers has another active proposal for Fund 9, and one funded proposal active since earlier funds. In order to measure the potential workload (and by that adding more Information on assessing feasibility) it would be nice to see a paragraph mentioning how the proposer will address that potential risk. In my experience of being a PA, this is very important since it can be the difference of a project being successful or disbanded. The Total budget asked for (13 110) is quite reasonable considering that the proposal aims to achieve structural changes to proposal quality, potentially every future proposal produced. (A bit too dramatic, I know. But I\u2019m just conveying the grand idea of the project).\u2028\u2028We are provided with relevant links (LinkedIn, portfolio, official website) that aid us in validating the experience, competency and proof of person. The website looks active and professional. Most parts of development of the actual product will involve UI-design (which there are ample experience of in the team), and the inclusive approach to inviting the community, peer groups and other collaborators will bring further expertise and insight to the project. \u2028\u2028Overall, I agree that it is highly likely that this problem will be implemented successfully. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The official website of the proposer seem to post updates related to the development regularly. Due to the reflective and inclusive nature of both the product and the process, I believe that the community will have an easy time of both following the development and communicate feedback with the proposer. \u2028The KPIs listed includes bi-weekly attendance totals from the peer-groups, system usability rating from the peer groups, proposal assessor feedback, and tracked UI design output (proof of production). All of these seem highly relevant, and I like (personal opinion) that the KPIs come from different parts of the ecosystem in the form of themselves, the peer groups or proposal assessors. \u2028What would make this proposal even stronger is the inclusion of an official social media channel. Although the official website exists, I believe in the spread and communication on social media platforms (discord, twitter, etc) will reach different people. And in some ways, they are tailored for fast, easy and wide communication.\u2028Conclusively, I agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

While I've seen some good improvements in the process recently I think creating a more collaborative environment would generate a lot of synergy among the community. \n\nAm personally also an advocate for gamifying processes like this as it seems to have a major impact on how we can go about tasks, and I know a lot of people feel similar. This feels like a logical next step given the growing audience that will be writing and reviewing have grown up with games and/or have kids that are gaming\n\nFor the gamification, have you seen what the catalyst team is doing with the bounty desk (  https://app.dework.xyz/catalyst-swarm/catalyst-swarm-bount)? Might not be exactly the idea you have but looks like there are some features like \"task points\", etc.... as well as paying people \"bountys\" in ADA and other tokens when they complete tasks. I can see this becoming very popular and engaging and will keep people coming back and recommending  to peers, further helping to grow the ecosystem and improve the processes. \n\nThe proposal asks us to  \"imagine meaningful sessions that last 5-10min instead of weeks to progress towards a quality proposal\", and as a current proposal reviewer and potential future proposer myself, this resonates with me very much.\n\nLoved the \"UX Storyline Example\". This bumped the section from a score of 4 to a 5.\n\n\"A new Iterative Design process makes people part of the system design. \".... seriously check out the swarm bounty board idea....\n\n\nThe potential impact of this proposal is to create a frictionless experience for proposers. Great stuff IMO.\n\nYou mentioned \"One of the risks that most research projects face is a lack of research subjects.\".... sounds like a good use of a bounty board to me! lol", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Most of my thoughts/knowledge is provided above in the Impact section and I didn't see much to comment on in this feasibility section. That being said, everything provided checks the boxes. I dont see anything missing. The budget is broken down well and the amount asked is fair. Attached spreadsheet is easy to follow and should give confidence here.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "One of the bigger challenges I have seen so far in proposal reviews is in how teams are planning to audit/track things like participation. Across so many viable and necessary social channels this could be a dauting task.  Providing some detail on how you plan to do this and any maybe checking with other teams on how they have or have not found success.\n\nI like the following \"Educating the community on how social iterative design leads to compounded insights into design solutions, cost-cutting, and increasing development speed\", but this could use some more elaboration as it sounds like a dauting task.\n\nThe SDG sub-goals were very objective which is helpful.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2329", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 3017, "q0": "I think that this idea is a very new one and it will have great impact on the Cardano ecosystem, as increasing adoption by introducing new incentive models, reducing stress by increasing quality feedback, new incentive structures that attract users to the ecosystem as well as inviting experts into the Proposal Assistant. The only thing i would like to ask is the meaning of the phrase \"game-like proposal\" that you mention at the start of the proposal, as myself, like other community members, do not have experience or knowledge with the UX/UI  model design and its definitions.  The KPIs indicated in the proposal match the ones indicated in the challenge, and that is something that proves that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge. It is a nice idea that can be the start of many others that will make the whole proposing experience better for the community members. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a very detailed plan there and I also find it very useful that the details for each week. The budget is described in a clear way and has been broken down into identifiable items and seems quite reasonable. The hours needed for each task and their equivalence with the funding needed are perfectly described, actually one of the most clear and good/transparent descriptions i have come across on the last few Funds. The necessary skills and resources, the team members of the project, their relevant experience as well as their Linkedin profiles are all there and stated clearly. That also applies to the future risks that might appear along the implementation. I absolutely believe that the plan presented is highly likely to be implemented successully. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "A time horizon and a roadmap with milestones are all there and that is something that is encouraging to ensure the auditability of the project. There are some key metrics which i do not think that necessarily need nu,bers to be measured as we are talkign about a qualitive report etc. The only metric that might needs to be numbered is the total group attendance by referring to the number of people needed, but that is not something that actually costs in terms of auditability on this project, as it has all the other featured needed to be audited successfully. As being an interactive tool, i understand that the community will be able to track the progress easily, maybe via the groups that will be formed. May you consider providing a report with weekly attendance etc at the end of each month.

For some proposers, the fixed siloed process, which repeats every 3 to 4 months, has been exceedingly laborious because it requires them to rework their ideas if they have been rejected in prior rounds and, if financed, to submit proposals for the next stage of their projects. And it is obvious that this ongoing cycle has caused the proposals' quality to decline. Additionally, many proposers no longer care to make their ideas in the most persuasive way. Additionally, evaluation rounds are now essentially used to determine whether or not a project is financed. By moving from this one-step process to a much more agile iterative path, the author offers a lovely method for helping the proposers. Before applying for financing, proposers can significantly improve their ideas thanks to ongoing feedback and evaluation of their work. The author is well aware of the difficulties involved and has plans to motivate the process by offering rewards to professional assessors in order to keep them engaged. As a result, this might change the way the catalyst operates now and might encourage everyone in the ecosystem to write proposals, evaluate them, and even propose ideas with higher quality each round.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I was highly impressed by the proposer's concept and the thorough plan that he or she presented. The actual strategy itself appears to be perfectly transparent and doable in every manner. The concept is made feasible and practical by the quarterly game plan with clear targets established at each stage. The team's methodical approach and the concept of two groups working concurrently make it more practical and efficient. This product appears to be well suited for development by the committed team that has been assembled. The members have a tremendous amount of expertise, and everyone appears to be a well-known figure in the ecosystem. The suggested budget is really fair, and the way it has been broken down is excellent. To ensure that similarly strong proposals are given an opportunity, the requested fund does not occupy the majority of the granted funds. The project's commencement as a large project, as mentioned by the proposer, increases the likelihood that the team will succeed in implementing it. Giving full points on the metrics for viability, in my opinion, is the only way to recognise a plan that has been thoroughly thought through and investigated.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The process of auditability is made simple and productive by the unambiguous mention of both the individual success criteria from the perspectives of development and business. The auditor's job is made more enjoyable by the thorough analysis of how and where every dollar of the budget is spent. Along with the development tracking metrics, the proposer offers a wealth of qualitative indicators that may be utilised to frequently audit the status of the project, such as peer group findings and analysis of proposer-assessor comments. As the proposer mentions doing every month, the UI Design output can be utilised as a visible repository to manually track the development activities. It is quantifiable from every viewpoint thanks to the success KPIs and the well defined success measures at many levels, including product development, product delivery, and business outcome standpoint. The project has all the makings of a success and will soon make the entire developer ecosystem cheerful because it has such a thorough plan and a team that has already shown itself in prior rounds with successful funding.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2704", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7669, "q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge by innovating around  the Catalyst proposal process.

They could help me not only with shaping and expanding the problem statement but also join me in writing the proposal and realizing it. Thinking of it  another way around, I could also join any projects within Catalyst that interest me or just help other proposals with my feedback and recommendations, and in turn get incentives. \n\nThe Assistant fits the challenge. It aims to make collaboration more fun and easy by providing the space and tools for collaborative writing that will be less boring than Google Docs and more comprehensive with the features of possible multimedia comments/editing.
