There isn\u2019t actually a lot of substance here for voters to evaluate, except for the fact that there is not yet an NFT renting mechanism on Cardano. An advantage for this proposal is that NFT renting isn\u2019t at the top of anybody\u2019s priority list. In working behind one of the larger lending/borrowing platforms on Cardano (through which I\u2019ve established connections to multiple NFT marketplaces core team), I\u2019ve workshopped ideas about features for greater NFT utility. In my relatively thorough experience, I don\u2019t see any major players that are aiming at NFT renting capabilities before 4-5 other major items on their priority list. With this proposal, I would expect Lending Pond to be the first mover in developing this feature. The problem is that this section of the proposal lacks a clear quantified vision of impacts that directly justifies the $30k requested funds. I think it would give voters a much clearer understanding of the potential impacts by having cited information about Lending pond\u2019s user base, the amount of transactions facilitated, the volume of transactions facilitated, and other stats of that nature. I checked their Twitter page and they do have some of this information collected (2 million ADA All-Time Volume, 24 hr 150k ADA volume, and highest ATH loan 30k ADA). Additionally, weight could be added to the potential impacts with modeling evidence from other NFT renting mechanisms on other chains. Even more specificity could be added with indicated numbers of how many P2E NFT games are building on Cardano. Another piece of information that needs clarity is the data on loan liquidation on this platform. One of the biggest fears about this platform among the big DeFi players is the lack of collateralization standards on this platform. Lending Pond allows their users to set their own lending terms, which is a great commitment to free market fundamentals and unrestricted decentralized decision making. However, interactions with this platform are extremely risky (especially for newer community members that might not be thoroughly familiar with the assets on the platform) because borrowers most often list loans for the full value of the asset. If you spend a decent amount of time on the platform, you\u2019ll recognize the color-coded risk mechnaims they put in place but they don\u2019t clearly define that mechanism or provide any education to borrowers on industry standard practices for collateralization. These risks of the existing infrastructure may leave voters with concerns that the approval of Catalyst funding will increase the magnitude of the existing risks. While this feature is not yet built within the Cardano ecosystem as a matter of fact, this section of the proposal lacks substance on what the impacts will be, what the impacts are worth, and a thorough assessment of the risks. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I rank this section a 2 because of a significant lack of detail to demonstrate capability, planning, and cost efficiency. If voters are judging only by the information given on this section of the proposal, they are not left with enough information to confidently vote in favor of plausible feasibility. On the core dev team, voters are only able to vote based on the built product of the Lending Pond team, even if they do the extra work to visit the Lending Pond website. The website only provides each team member\u2019s role, pseudonym, and Twitter link. With the resources provided, there is no verifiable information on professional experience or demonstrable capability (outside of the existing platform). If voters are understanding this section through the lens of the core team\u2019s capabilities, this proposal carries a major disadvantage. On the roadmap, the given plan shows a 1.5 month timeframe (perhaps too ambitious without provable capability) but doesn\u2019t provide any information on what will be done outside of coding, testing, and launch/outreach. This doesn\u2019t provide voters with a lot of substance to understand what is going to be done and when. Voters are used to seeing breakdowns of when smart contract design begins, front/backend development, UI/UX development, testnet deployment, mainnet launch, actionable steps on marketing/social-media/community building, and a lot more in-depth specifics on what is going to be done and when. The budget also lacks essential detail like hourly rates + hours of labor allocated, number of workers needed, and cost breakdowns of each non-labor expense. Given that this team will be working on 2 other proposals in the same timeframe, we can\u2019t assume full-time hours dedicated to this specific proposal. While the overall budget is a very average cost for Catalyst proposals, the spending does not appear to be on the efficient side, especially with most of the budget going to auditing (rather than development). I think more substance/detail needs to be established here to secure confidence in a positive voter turnout. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "While there\u2019s only a couple sentences of substance in this section, I rank this section a 4 because there are quantified commitments/expectations to a level of performance that directly links to impacts. Perhaps I\u2019m being generous here but I am technically left with the information that I want to be seeing for a positive reaction. I think the measurement of NFT rentals is the exact framework needed to measure success of this feature and I think 10 partnerships and 100 rents a week is a perfectly reasonable/valuable goal to attain. Obviously, this section could benefit from some big improvements in detail and expansion of auditiblity. First, this proposal does not contain sourcing for updates on this proposal for public accountability but the short timeframe given doesn\u2019t leave me with a lot of concern about the community letting this one fly under the radar. Second, there could be more KPIs included like rental listings, rental volume, increased user base, social media engagement, website traffic, and other changes that could be made to the status quo as a result of this proposals approval. I am in full agreement that this section has very little information provided but there is still enough for me to see that the team has a specific vision for success/perforamnce that they intend to see.

This innovation could lead to a lot more traffic coming from those that are avid NFT collectors.
