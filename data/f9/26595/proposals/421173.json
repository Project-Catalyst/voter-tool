The Cardano Feed team intends to deliver a universal marketing and campaign platform for the Cardano ecospace. There are always new and exciting projects or events popping up and the proposed project will help to lower the barrier for many such projects. The Cardano ecospace could gain an even greater impact on the blockchain domain by providing a seamless solution for projects and events. The proposed solution is impactful in that sense, furthermore it is aligned with the \u201cDapp\u201d challenge setting and the score will be 5 points as a result.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team consists of well experienced members with a great background of development, their claimed experience can be further backed up by their LinkedIn profiles, this makes them very credible.

Together with the detailed plan that is split up into monthly phases they prove a strong evidence of knowledge about what has to be done in order to successfully deliver the proposed project.

A marketing tool to replace various Google tools would absolutely add value to the Cardano ecosystem, but there's not a lot of discussion of how those tools will be replaced on a 1:1 basis. Most of the meat of the Impact statement reads a bit more like an advertisement than a clear presentation of what's being built.\n\nA lot of the impact statement discusses NFTs, which it sounds like will be used to manage ownership of assets on the platform? The proposal needs to draw a more direct, clear line between the problem statement and the feature set of the platform.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The roadmap provided by the proposal, in contrast, is very clear and concise with reasonable monthly milestones for a team of seven. Likewise, the budget breakdown gives a clear picture of how much money is being allotted to each position, as well as an adequate idea of how long each position will be engaged with the project. The amount asked for looks reasonable. \n\nThe team is responsible for building Cardanofeed, a news ticker that aggregates Cardano-related news from a variety of sources and various languages. While the UI is a little rough, the site is quite functional and a handy place to see what the media is saying about Cardano. The Cardano ecosystem explorer is a tad on the slow side, but is an effective way to find projects. Overall, these previous projects and the professional backgrounds of the team lead me to be pretty confident that they'll be able to execute this proposal.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Using Cardanofeed to present project updates is potentially a great way to leverage previous work while also making it easy and convenient for auditors to keep up with the project's development. \n\nWhile the project does appear to be very auditable, it still needs a bit of work with regard to clarity (see above under Impact).

Since the whole world is moving towards web3, this project will be great use for future businessmen and content creators. \u201cor any other that doesn\u2019t connect to a blockchain\u201d has an effect on the general public only if the people know about the blockchain technology. Only around 7% of the population know about cryptocurrency and NFTs and of which only 3% are aware of the underlying blockchain technology. Therefore, only the fancy features will be the only tool for attracting users without the technical knowledge about the technology.
