Essentially, the team wishes to achieve a situation in which their token becomes inflationary (gains in price), as opposed to the trend of such tokens losing in price (becoming deflationary). The proposal does fall square into the challenge and the team has aligned their proposal well with the challenge and with many of the Fund 9 goals for Catalyst/Cardano. The expected impact of the Dex and whether it will be more competitive than other Dexs is debatable and open for discussion, but in terms of alignment with the challenge \u2013 the team has done as required. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed budget for this proposal is very large and it does provide a budget breakdown \u2013 but it is a bird\u2019s eye view of a budget breakdown. For a proposal with such a huge budget, we have large components in the budget that cost $473,665 (First iteration MVP Dex without BAR) \u2013 and that is it. The cost is attributed to engineers and that amount is to be spent in the first 10 or so weeks. I don\u2019t know, but half a million dollars would require a much more detailed plan \u2013 to convince me of its feasibility. I think the proposers should [if the proposal is not approved this round] submit a much more detailed budget breakdown for all the stages of the planned work. Not just an umbrella budget breakdown, as this proposal \u2013 seems to be requiring one of the largest budgets in this challenge. With great funding comes great responsibility for transparency of utilization of funds. The same is evident with other components of the budget. We are given a lump sum for the \u201cMerge Bar with CClib/Finish Bar Containers\u201d that costs $426,299\u2026 etc.. Yes, these partial budgets to contain a small (but that is negligible) component that is paid out to the Haskell consultancy Well-Typed of up to $10,000 per budgetary component\u2026 We have no hourly rates, or number of engineers working on the project, it is very difficult to extrapolate the feasibility of achieving what the team wishes to achieve. The team has provided the links to their respective LinkedIn profiles. The link to the Vyfi.io website and app did not impress me. The homepage left me underwhelmed and the fact that the Dex is not functioning \u2013 but the proposal is focused on a deflationary aspect of tokens by other Dexes has me questioning whether the team has really presented and developed this proposal well. The challenges and risks section seems to be a very generalized and very ad hoc approach to these challenges, there is a lot of discussion without clear specifics for a proposal that is seeking $1,673,728 in funding. For example: \nBusiness risk: Cashflow Proposed solution: \u201cWe have cash reserves, and a Cardano reserve. But as for any start-up, this is always something that needs to be managed appropriately\u2026.\u201d \nCompetition. Proposed Solution: \u201cWe won\u2019t be the only DEx on Cardano. We believe that whilst our design is unique and economically more capable, it is important to ensure that the user base is aware of this fact\u2026\u201d\nThese are general statements that are not backed with facts, but are backed with statements or statements of belief. For me, this seems insufficient for a proposal of this magnitude. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team has stated that the solution to the problem that they raised [Most DApps mint their token, then use this token to distribute rewards to existing holders. This causes a downward trend in token value. Income should be generated not minted and distributed to users.] is to bild a second layer solution to the DApp. However the proposal seems to be for much more than just building a second layer solution. The proposal is broken down into components such as\u201d First iteration MVP DEx without BAR (integrated with CCLib)\u201d, followed by \u201cComplete and merge Bar with CCLib\u201d, then \u201cSecond iteration merged (DEx and BAR integration)\u201d, then \u201cBuild farms\u201d and then \u201cStart Audit\u201d. Effectively this seems to me to be a proposal not to build a second layer solution to a functioning DApp and Dex, but a wider proposal to complete the Dex itself. What I am trying to say is that the scope and budget of the project seems much wider than the problem statement and the proposed solution. I find the presentation of the proposal relatively unclear for a project that is seeking $ 1,673,728 in funding. If it is not approved I would advise the team to resubmit the proposal with a clearer focus \u2013 if the proposal is to build a functioning Dex (or an MVP Dex) \u2013 then the Problem Statement and solution should clearly reflect this intention. Further, as regards Auditability, again the team seems to use somewhat vague terminology. \u201cWe have a clear sign of progress to share with our community for each stage. This is our Public Testnet. Once launched, we will be continually updating the testnet with features as they are constructed. This will allow us to have an open dialogue with our community whilst development is taking place, as users will be able to interact with the platform itself.\u201d However, the testnet appears in the project timeline between weeks 22 and 24 \u2013 which is a long way away. Also, for a project worth $1.6 million I would expect much more than \u201ca technical update fortnightly\u201d \u2013 as we do not know where will the technical update be released, who will be releasing it and in what format (two sentences \u2013 or a full report). The AMA\u2019s on Twitter and Discord for the community to speak with the team directly \u2013 seem not to have a regular time schedule. I would advise the team to use part of the budget (if resubmitting this proposal) to make a much more mature public relations and auditability component of this project that will allow the Catalyst community to be convinced that the extensive and exhaustive and precise information will be made available all the time during the implementation of the project. This proposal\u2019s auditability segment seems more akin to an auditability segment for a proposal that is worth 100 times less funds. The definition of success \u201cSuccess for this project is a fully functional DEx with an integrated distributive mechanism (BAR)\u201d \u2013 seems modest if it is not used by users and is not superior to other Dexes by other metrics. I would advise the team to be less modest with the definition of success, as a functional Dex that is not better or not used \u2013 is no big success.

The BAR will redistribute a percentage of every swap made on the DEX for those participating. The BAR has a number of ways it generates income such as from NFT sales, a percentage of yield farm staking, a percentage from swaps and 15% from a fund investment. The last one regarding the NM trust as shown in the diagram is less clear in the proposal. This solution helps to give an increased reason for holders who earn tokens through the DEX to stake them in this solution which will help to prevent the downward pressure on the token price. In terms of risks the team detail regulatory risk, cashflow and competition as three main business risks each with a response. The competition response to the risk could have done with better analysis on why it is unique to other DEXs due to the high levels of competition that exist in the ecosystem. Stating their design is more unique and economically more capable without providing a resource to confirm this makes it hard to believe without sufficient evidence. Technological risks are also included with solutions focussed on either creating tools themselves or needing to wait for IOG to finish their releases like the Vasil hard fork. Overall the deliverables for this proposal sounds promising in being able to deliver impact to the ecosystem and would provide further utility and use cases to the token holders of the VyFinance DEX application.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "For the proposal progress roadmap a list of items have been provided that the team have already completed such as full integration of CIP-30 wallets and smart contracts, initial construction of the BAR and development of a Concurrency Library (CCLib). The next five steps are then provided in a simple list. It would have been good to expand on these items in more depth - especially considering the size of the proposal budget being requested! For each development cycle they mention the different parts that are involved such as on chain and off chain development, audits, UI development, query integration, testing and use of a testnet prior to launching. The budget break down helps to both show how the funds are being distributed and also a timeline of when each part will be executed. Team details are provided, and the link for the VyFinance team also has professional profiles on each of the members. The team have already launched a working application which gives sufficient evidence that they are able to deliver on complex projects such as this one.

In terms of public disclosure of progress the team intend to do a fortnightly update of the technical developments along with AMAs on Discord and Twitter to collaborate with the community. For progress it would have been good to have any clarity on what, if anything, will be open source, and if so provide a Github link for the community to track the progress and benefit from this work. Due to the large budget being requested I believe this is some fair feedback for the team to consider - how are you going to give back to the development ecosystem with tools or increased understanding of how to effectively develop on Cardano? This is both good from an auditing perspective but also to improve the wider ecosystem as well as the VyFinance DEX. The ecosystem thrives when there are more collaborative efforts! In regards to success the main points given are around the fully functioning 'BAR' layer for token holders to use and stake with and to ultimately try and put an upward pressure on the token value over the long term. The team could have broken down some more specific objectives to show how the community can determine what to expect in terms of adoption and also what can be considered a success in terms of the outcome of this proposal. The clarity of this proposal is overall fairly high however could have had more depth and resources to cover the proposal deliverables - especially when considering the higher budget requested.

We can take one page or two from OlympusDAO or even the last Terra Luna\u2019s collapse story books. The Bar is also a relatively novel and interesting concept as a mechanism to distribute incomes from the protocol through creation and preservation of value to stakeholders by providing an extra layer of utility and service to sustain the liveliness of the protocol.\n\nWhile it is true that we already have few working DEXes such as MuesliSwap, SundaeSwap, MinSwap, WingRiders, and others, the ecosystem is still in an early phase and each DEX is still finding their own respective niches. Many alternatives for consumer also result in positive outcomes and benefits to the greater ecosystem of stakeholders.

Proposer had also completed in advance three major milestones of integrating fully CIP-30 (dApps-enabled) wallet and smart contracts with the PAB, constructed the initial structure of the Bar, and completed the Concurrency Library (CCLib). This puts the proposer team about halfway through the delivery of full proposed products. The technical necessities staring from the protocol design, programming languages, and solution architecture are mentioned explicitly and given enough rationale.\nThe fact that this is the only submitted proposal from VyFi team I think it is safe to assume that we will get all their teams\u2019 hand on deck. The focused attention and resource from VyFi will surely be beneficial to the fullest delivery of this proposal. Risks associated with the delivery and implementation of this proposal have also been addressed and VyFi team had indicated some mitigations such as careful and prudent financial resource management, implementing Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedure during ICO, and working with advisors to ensure compliance with current and future regulations. My input to proposer is to state the hourly rate of the functions especially the engineering. Alternatively, how many engineering work hours will be needed in the listed weeks to finish each stages/milestone will help to estimate and benchmark if Cardano community is paying a fair price in funding this proposed project. According to my calculation by breaking down the table and assuming the team of 8-10 engineers working 40-hour week, the hourly rate came out to be between USD 60 to USD 100 which is a fair rate for most developer works in the US. Still, there is a chance that I am totally off in above calculation here.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap is defined explicitly: fully working DEX with the Bar integrated as protocol\u2019s income distributive mechanism then in the future they will propose the Auto-Harvester which is an automated Yield farming tool (liquidity aggregator) as stated in the VyFinance Whitepaper. If all goes well, we can expect the delivery of the final product in about 28 weeks or end of January 2023. Since the success is mentioned to be solely the DEX and the Bar, it can rather be hit-or-miss. However, when we are looking at the track record of VyFinance and the dApps they already presented to the Cardano community already, I will not worry too much about non-delivery. Delay is much more plausible since software and application development involving significant values will need to be measured twice and cut once, adopting the development philosophy of the Cardano blockchain itself here.\n\nVyFinance team also promises bi-weekly technical update and both Twitter and Discord AMAs to communicate with and update community members regularly, which are fine standard for most projects in the crypto space. Public testnet will also be launched as the primary feedback loop on the performance and user experience of the deliverable DEX. Since this is a commercial, for-profit project and competition is quite fierce in this area, open-sourcing is still not in the picture for now. The same constraint can be said for the usual Github tracking. Nonetheless, if this project got funded through Catalyst, community can check Cardano\u2019s DeFi metrics such as Total-Value-Locked (TVL) later next year to benchmark and measure the real impact of this dApps and help deciding for another project funding in the next Catalyst series or rounds.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2482", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6361, "q0": "This proposal is about creating a DEX and a second layer on it as distributing mechanism (BAR) for the Vyfi DApp that allows users to access yield generated from the swapping of tokens on the DEX and other income generated in the Vyfi ecosystem. The proposer says that some DEXes incentivize the liquidity providers with their DEX token by consistently minting it only. This is not true as we can see already established DEXes on Cardano Sundaeswap & Minswap both offers both the liquidity fees and their DEX tokens. They provide liquidity fees to liquidity providers and both the liquidity fees and DEX tokens to Yield farmers.\n\nThe Vyfi protocol also offers one more source of income from the fees of offshore Bank (Vyfi's lending platform). The proposer thinks that these benefits will encourage the Vyfi token holders to hold their tokens to earn more rewards, thus reducing the selling pressure on DEX tokens. This feature, along with the other two reasons, will incentivize the holding of the Vyfi tokens and will be helpful for them to compete with other DEXes and make Vyfi an attractive DEX.
