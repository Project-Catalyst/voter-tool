I agree that a Staking Platform for Cardano NFTs is a valid and impactful application of the challenge brief. On the Cardano blockchain and under the eUTxO model, an NFT is simply a token with a monetary policy of minting only one (unique), enabled by the unique UTxO consumed. Outside the real of staking high value NFT collections (maybe a rare Dino Spacebudz?), this could potentially be very useful for a lot of use cases, such as real estate, antiques and any sort of rare off-chain goods benefiting from NFT for provenance and documentation. Building this Platform around an existing community (Canucks) that spans SPOs, Cardano publishing and governance seems like a synergetic way of going about it, and should further help to make this available fit to customer's needs and with impactful uptake. I strongly agree that this is a good fit for the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team includes a dedicated scrum master and the business plan is highly detailed. The visually appealing roadmap gives me a good picture of what the team want to achieve and how to get there. The team already have two Plutus developers who have worked with them over the past six months and on other projects, and this common bottleneck for Cardano development should not be a problem for this project. The team would have to work seamlessly between the Canadian and Indian teams and remote work, but they have apparently handled this well in the past (and it is not uncommon anyway).\nThe only element of the proposal that could have been clearer to assure the feasibility is the budget breakdown, which is an extrapolation of the weekly costs presented as the sum of all functions, without elaborating hourly rates, buffers, slippage, currency conversion or what other factors may or may not have affected it - more transparency would be welcome here in this regard. This does, however, not make the project any less likely to be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For a project requesting over $150k, I would have liked to see a more detailed cost breakdown and risk analysis (see above). The KPIs and performance metrics are dealt with much less detail than the Feasibility and roadmap, and it would have been a positive to see more goals set to reflect the scrum and development process itself - to allow auditors or interested community members to follow the progress of the project or understand the thinking behind design decisions and onboarding success.\nAgain in the light of the budget requested, I would have liked an existing website or github page setup that allowed the assessors and voters to see the roadmap in full resolution, and for example bookmark the project, connect to its social media etc. This is simply a recommendation and not a requirement for the project however.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4550, "q0": "I agree that the proposal covers most of the impact criteria. First, the proposer states a problem within the challenge that needs to be solved (i.e., an easy way for cNFT projects to allow NFT staking). By providing a Staking as a Service solution, the proposer would enable the inception and thrive of other dApps, thus driving more adoption for Cardano. The impact of this solution is not geography-bound and on a global scale. The key metrics and goals of the proposal align with multiple goals of the outlined challenge settings (e.g., number of projects onboarded, # of users who stakes). The team also briefly discusses that they have a monetization plan to scale the project sustainably. What I would have hoped to see from the proposal are some data or estimations to gauge the magnitude of its impact. For example, if cNFT projects have a turnkey solution to allow staking of their NFTs, how much more users we may expect to see (using some benchmark or proxy) or how much cost they may save (by not having to build the staking infrastructure themselves).\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I agree that this proposal is feasible to implement with the proposed timeline and budget. The proposal has identified the required skillsets for implementation (e.g., backend developer, frontend developer, architect, smart contract developer, product owner, scrum master) and the corresponding team members to assume those roles. The core team members (CTO and CEO) have in combination 30+ years of software development and have been building products on Cardano (Canucks Publishing, Voteaire.io, Canuckz NFTs). The team also comprises Plutus developers, front-end developers, scrum masters, and operations with a solid track record of experience, evident by their Linkedin credentials. The team employs the Agile approach to develop the product. The proposer provides a roadmap summary with the high-level activities and key deliverables (it will take 15 one-week sprints to complete the project).  The proposer considers the key risks and provides reasonable mitigations to mitigate those risks. The budget is outlined for the 15-week plan and the weekly budget was proposed. However, the budget is not broken down into identifiable items, for example how many man-hours each task will take and the average hourly rates for the different roles. This is the point that I would suggest the team add in their proposal.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I agree that the project is auditable. The proposer provides a timeline for 15 weeks with the key activities and milestones for each week. What success looks like for the product is defined from both the cNFT project owners' point of view and from the end users/token holder's point of view. The proposer proposes a list of KPIs for (1) standard scrum metrics (how well they progress as planned, e.g., team velocity); (2) pre-launch success metrics (e.g., waitlist; (3) post-launch success metrics (e.g. # of project onboarded; # of users, total tokens staked).

However, it seems that the Linkedin profile of Mr. Mateus Santos is still lacking.\nYou've identified what needs to be done for 15 weeks. However, I couldn't find any attached roadmap summary as you said. And the roadmap image in the FEASIBILITY section is too small. This makes it difficult to assess the project's roadmap. Regarding the budget allocation, you mentioned that the budget is calculated based on the hours worked and the hourly wage. But what is the specific number of working hours, and what is the hourly wage?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In addition to the issues that I mentioned in the previous section (adding linkedin profiles, splitting budgets, clarifying the roadmap,...). I think it would be great to have concrete numbers to gauge the progress of the project.

Besides, I also appreciate that you have identified the difficulties, risks and ways to overcome it. This is a solid basis for the project to develop sustainably.\nOverall, this is a potential project, but if you want to implement it, you need to add a few more information as I mentioned.

The staking feature of this platform to earn yield rewards will add value to the NFTs issued by different projects. \n\nThe proposer mentioned a few potential risks regarding this proposal and stated his mitigation strategies to deal with those risks. But I think the main risk will be to onboard an adequate no. of projects as no statistics are provided on how many projects are looking for this kind of solution. In addition, there is already competition to build this solution, and I have seen at least a few proposals in Catalyst proposing to develop a similar service platform.

This would increase the number of Dapps and also increase the number of integrations on the chain effectively addressing the challenge.
