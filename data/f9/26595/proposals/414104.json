The author proposes a portfolio tracking solution that helps users centrally track and manage their asset portfolio on DEXs and dApps running on Cardano. As a result, users can conveniently check account status (loss/profit due to impermanent loss, token price fluctuations and other variables applicable on DeFi). The interface demo address is available at https://www.cardafolio.com/. The author explains, the first purpose of creating this solution is to serve the needs of the individual. Later, the author wishes to extend this solution to users on the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, the demo interface of the current solution is in its stub form, simple, with wallet connectivity and basic portfolio tracking, without charts and details. Author-indicated tracking data, received using the DEXes API. However, this is only temporary, as the author assumes that DEXs will be able to block these types of requests. The proposal needs a standalone toolkit to check values across DEXs. Personally, I think the asset management tool is familiar but challenging. Currently on the market, there are also many projects to build and develop this feature on separate or multi-chain ecosystems. Of course, with the advantage of the latter, our Cardano ecosystem resonates and creates more valuable characteristics. Making a portfolio management tool an interesting, engaging user experience also requires a lot of effort and focus. Users of our Cardano ecosystem need the best experiences. For example, at the same time can interact with platforms (DEX, lending & borrowing, Yield Farming), easily and proactively monitor aggregate position and profit, manage portfolio risk, find the best source of profit\u2026 Reducing time costs, enhancing convenience, profit/risk management is the aim of the solution. However, I personally feel, the author's Cardafolio solution is still quite simple and primitive. To really focus on the user experience, I wish the author would add feature areas for the Cardafolio to be more engaging and lively. For example, swap feature on Cardano blockchain through integration with Dex exchanges, transaction history lookup feature, referrals feature (helps to expand new users, existing users can also use split link) share to receive a part of the transaction fee of the person you invite to use), cross-platform access feature (using bridge ports to access protocols on other platforms)... This category of course requires a step-by-step implementation roadmap, but I suggest it should be seen as part of the Cardafolio solution. In addition, the diverse integration of Cardafolio with lending & borrowing platforms, Yield Farming, NFT & gaming... on our Cardano ecosystem is a priority to do soon.

They want to create an APR/APY in order to read the blockchain directly from the different DEXes (cardafolio.com) on a unit platform instead of using Google sheets or similar. This could lead to an increase in the number of integrated products for community use to help enrich the ecosystem and tie projects together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products. As a result, the Cardano attracts more users. The solution brings a place to check APR/APY and graphics in order to see documents or lose due to token price fluctuation or other variables that apply on DeFi, especially a place contact between debunk and apy.vision. They will solve the challenge by reading blockchain to check trades, the price histories of their investments or decreased and how IL impacts. They receive data by API DEXes, but they realize that it is not a good solution because DEXes will block this request sometimes. Then, an open source will be established and create a set of independent tools to check values on the DEXes. The proposal said that they can not find the relevant risks and could fulfill emissions within 3 months and maintain new dApps on the Cardano catalog.

However, they only describe 2 months, while they mentioned 3 months to complete the project in the impact part.
