The proponents explain to us in great detail what this application would be and what its advantages would be. In short, Dapp would support any type of document, storing it on the blockchain, so that multiple users would sign it. This signature would include some basic data of the signatories, as mentioned by the authors: name, surname, date of birth, etc. There would be the possibility of some special conditions being linked to the contracts, for example, from a certain value, the contract would also need the signature of the company's CEO and so on. Proponents are very successful in explaining how the solution would simplify the bureaucracy involved in signing and developing legal documents, clarifying which bureaucracies would be excluded from the processes and how certain types of users would benefit (e.g. large companies that make several similar documents) . So I think Dapp has high value, and in relation to Cardano, it would be interesting for our blockchain since this kind of solution already happens but only on Ethereum, and as the fees are lower on Cardano maybe this is a very good way. assertive way of attracting new users to our blockchain. I believe that it is also a good idea because it would not be creating a technology for a new activity, but something that already exists, it is already a necessity, a demand from companies, and where Cardano could act so that the advantages of our blockchain would reach to the knowledge of such customers. The only observation that needs to be made here, in my view, is the total price of the project. The asking value, around 630k, is quite high. From what I understand, the authors justify such an investment because, in addition to the salaries of the technology professionals who would work on the development of the application, a lot of publicity would be necessary, so that the tool could stand out in relation to the competition that already exists. It is a very consistent amount, however the amount requested still corresponds to a considerable portion of the funds allocated to the challenge. Other than that, I think Dapp is in a position to be a great leap forward for the adoption of the use of our blockchain and it aligns very well with the desired conditions in the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The script presented is not as accurate as it should be. We know what would happen in certain phases and how long they would last, however, the activities mentioned could be better located within each phase. For example, in the second phase (M1 - 3 months after M0), \u201cdocument storage in IFPS, document retrieval, document signing and email notifications\u201d would be done. What of these things would happen in the first month, and in the second, and in the third? It would also be interesting if each of these activities were more detailed and if we knew the professionals assigned to each stage, respectively. So, my impression is that, yes, we have a general idea of \u200b\u200bwhat the development process of this project would be like, but without the ideal level of depth. Turning now to the budget explanation, I believe that the situation is similar to that of the roadmap. We know how the total money would be shared out, generally speaking. But the level of detail could be greater. The marketing and promotion subtotal is said to be 191K, and this part is broken down into various parts such as \u201cproject website, speeches at 9 conferences (dedicated to cryptography or document management industry), content marketing, etc. \u201d. It is also said how much each of these parts would cost in relation to the 191k share, but still the values \u200b\u200bare high and could be better broken down. Another observation would be that the proponent explains how much each part of the technical development would cost, but we don't know exactly the salary of the professionals involved in the team nor the amount of monthly hours they would dedicate to the project, so our understanding of this part also is a little impaired. And finally, analyzing the team presentation, I think this part is very good because we know the names, a small resume and the professional contact (of some) of the team members. It's just not perfect because the amount of information about the team members is irregular, that is, we know a lot about some and less about others (for example, very little is said about Muhammad Hassan and Vismay\n Raj), some have provided their linkedin profiles and others have not, so we don't have the same degree of knowledge of each involved. I would like to suggest that everyone attach some kind of contact, whether linkedin or another platform. Therefore, I believe that the proposal is viable, with only a few points to be improved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Proponents are concerned with providing many KPIs, so we have material to ascertain whether or not the expected partial results are being achieved. They promise that there will be an open source GitHub repository, which is a pretty straightforward way for us to see how the work is being done in practice. There would also be sprint management, task assignment, problem solving, documentation publication - that is, we can conclude that basically the entire development process would be possible for direct monitoring by the Cardano community. I think, however, that it would be interesting if these professionals involved in the projects made reports summarizing this collection of information, in a more general way, so that the community could have faster and more direct access to what has been done, when, how and what results suggest therefrom. I believe it is important to verify not only the numerical information but also whether the tasks planned for each month were being fulfilled. Regarding the final results, we also have some numerical data, such as the numbers of signatures made, documents stored, registered users, etc. They also outline what the success scenario would look like after 1 month and 3 months. But after these breaks, what can we expect? I think it would be important to carry out a deeper study of the real impacts of all this for our blockchain, to understand if Cardano has become considerably more adopted in the legal sector and by large companies, if the number of smart contracts has actually jumped, if new people have been coerced into actively participate in our community, in short, if the most direct objectives of the challenge were observed in practice. This data can be analyzed and taken to the Cardano community directly, also through a report, or perhaps through some participation in Townhall, for example. Therefore, I think that the proposal is auditable, but not fully and with the desired level of understanding. It is necessary that a more detailed study be done, mainly in the second part of the auditability - of the final results - I believe that a very valid way of doing this is through a direct contact with the companies, to understand how the solution would have changed their functioning and what are the main changes noticed (one idea is to bring some representatives to a future meeting between this team and some members of our community, this would be a very interesting way to see the results generated by the project in practice).", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 11, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6639, "q0": "This proposal has an excellent fit within the challenge. Its aim is to develop a solution that allows for seamless upload of encrypted legal documentation on a distributed storage solution and signing such documents by participants. The signing of such documents can be then stored onto the Cardano blockchain (through a hash function).  \n\nThere is an obvious demand for such a service, since there are, or will be, many Web3 businesses searching for solutions that offer cryptographic certainty and encryption when interacting with one another. The scalability potential of such a product is also high, since once the development costs are done, there should not be any significant maintenance costs to keep the solution functioning. The only caveat to my previous assertion is that over time, the cost of decentralized storage (IPFS-like) should remain low in order for the cost of such a service to remain below the perceived value of singing / storing contracts in a decentralized manner. But with the marginal cost of an additional signature being exponentially lower, as for any automated solution, the prospects of having a viable long term solution seem pretty high.  \n\nThe proposal gains extra points from my point of view also for tackling KYC and smart contracts integration in the development phase. I believe these two aspects are very important: KYC being crucial of bridging Web3 solutions to real life applications / businesses that are bound by their regulatory regimes to perform KYC producers, while smart contracts being of course instrumental in terms of positioning the Adastamp application as the natural solution for digital natives interacting exclusively through blockchain technologies in the future. \n\nWith a good implementation this project can deliver a staple and ubiquitous application that can be used extensively both by individuals and organizations. Amazing potential.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "An excellent point of the proposal is that they have kept the description of the roadmap very simple, and it is very easy to be followed, even by people with less than ideal knowledge of the development environment and the jargon normally used within the industry. And the milestones make perfect sense to me. Here is a brief version of them: stage 1 would bring to life a technology teaser, a very simple proof of concept, but not fully functional: signing, storing and verifying signatures. A minimum viable product would take shape in stage 2 (M1 in the text), with real document storage, document signing, email notification. From stage 3 onwards we would see constant features being added (pdf and Google sheets integration, smart contract calling, pay as you sign, etcetera). I think that this agile methodology is an excellent choice for this product and any negative aspects can be quickly discovered and corrected since the product will be out in the open (and on-chain) very quickly after funding starts.      \n \nLet\u2019s talk about the team building this product. MigaMake is the company behind this proposal. They are a Singapore based company launched in 2017. They are doing an excellent job at presenting the entire team on their company website (and even better in the proposal itself!), so another excellent point highlighting their commitment to openness.  \n\nAnother point I would like to highlight is that timing makes a lot of sense in how they are organizing the delivery of their products. Here is why. They already have an ongoing Catalyst project funded in Fund 8, StreamCardano, a serverless SAAS for building Dapps. They have a dedicated web page for it, but it\u2019s still rather empty and too early to judge the quality of their products based on it. The app is expected to be live at the end of July, with a wallet available in September. But from their comments we understand that Adastamp is scheduled to enter development in stages considering their existing workload and dependencies - and that is just another key piece of information that we are dealing with a solid team that takes into account many aspects when planning their future activities\n\nAt the first glance the budget looks significantly on the high side, since they are asking for a big chunk for building the product. I have to give them credit for sticking to budget descriptions again in a simple manner (just like with the roadmap) and captions that are easy to understand and relate to. Each development stage is accompanied by its own budget, with relevant subsections populated with bullet points. There are two points which I would like to highlight for voters looking to judge the value for money proposal. The first one is that we are not being offered at any point in time hourly rates or estimations of time necessary to build each of the modules / features - doing that would have offered an excellent chance of diving deeper into the budgetary proposal and judging its quality and reasonability. The second point is that there are two points capturing a significant part of the budget (30%, a bit over 200k USD in total) for which I feel that more explanations are necessary as to their relevance for the success of the project: speeches at conferences (crypto or document management industry) and \u201cproducing and sharing viral\u201d which I suppose refers to (video?) content but we are not being told exactly what it is all about. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Auditability scores again very high and the team is doing an excellent job in outlining how the Cardano community can track the development of the project. A first point worth noting is that they intend to work within an open source environment, with commits to open-source GitHub repositories for both the libraries used but also the main app build through an own repository. They are also promising to publish the documentation behind the project and to track its health via the FreshPing application. \n\nThe team also does a very good job at offering performance indicators to be used, which are very relevant given the nature of the product: number of signatures, documents stored, registered users and smart contracts engaged. A fairly classical manner of tracking success of the product. They are also proposing two key ways to measure success in a more concrete way: individuals and organizations using the solution after stage 2, and at least an implementation by a large organization to automate its workflows after stage 3 is complete.

Because the administrative and working procedures, as well as the laws, of each country are distinct from one another, I believe that this presents a significant challenge to the successful execution of the project. The necessity of storing data and the requirement to utilize smart contracts in order to validate the signatures of various stakeholders is something that, in my opinion, has a significant effect on the community. And in my opinion, it is not a dream that governments of other countries will be able to use the group's platform in the not too distant future due to the development of the network and the CARDANO ecosystem as it is now.

You guys come in at $319,000 for the subtotal of the software production and maintenance costs. You are only able to provide the total cost in this manner, but you have not mentioned the specifics of each component, including the work that goes into each item, the price for each item, or the total cost for each month. In addition, the total amount spent on marketing and promotion was $191,000 USD. The sum of $629,250 does not seem to match the costs that you have listed, and that is a significant amount of money for a proposal of this nature.

The AdaStamp creating opportunities for users to sign online (cut off the travelling costs), and the signatures can neither be faked nor changed thanks to the blockchain technology. Apart from signing, this application also allowed some significant features such as KYC, smart contracts, etc. The advanced features also allow users to sign a large number of documents, saving tons of time for large companies. If this Dapp is successful, a great number of people will pay attention to and join the Cardano ecosystem, and this aligns perfectly with the challenge setting.\nThe proposers clearly described the signing procedures, making the procedures easy to understand. \nThe proposers addressed well the risks. The major risk of this app is that there are numerous competitors in terms of electronic signatures. The proposers analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of competitors compared to AdaStamp. The major advantage of AdaStamp is that AdaStamp support storing and sharing/transferring the document, blockchain-integrated.\"", "q0r": 5, "q1": "\"The detailed project roadmap was proposed. The proposers divided the project into six main phases. In each phase, the proposers divide the phase into several smaller subtasks. The feasibility could become clearer if the proposers provided the due dates for each subtask as well as its execution method. For example, for the subtask \u201cstoring the signature on Cardano blockchain\u201d (in M0). What is the due date (for example 3 weeks after project launching), and how do the proposers store the signatures? \nOn the bright side, the proposers allocated the budget according to the roadmap (from M0 to M6), the marketing and promotion were calculated in-detail. The proposers estimated the budget by using the Cosmic Function Point Method. It could be more specific if the proposers attached the financial analysis for the sub-tasks. For example, in M0, what are the cost breakdown of the three smaller subtasks? Tackling to these questions will help to increase the feasibility of the project.\nThe human resources included high-quality, experienced programmers, engineers and business analysts, etc. These backgrounds are necessary for the project to function properly. The projects also have open-source collaborators and advisors to help whenever the project is in stuck, showing great potential that this project could be accomplished. \"", "q1r": 5, "q2": "\"The source code will be audited in the open source such as Github, indicating good integrity of the developer team. The set KPIs such as number of signatures, documents, contracts, users in the app system were well align with the goal of this project. However, to increase the auditability of the project to the community, I recommend the proposers to specify the target KPIs/metrics achieved, and when to achieve them. For example, after one month of officially launching, there are 1000 signatures made. The success scenario (after M1 or M3) was drawn, showing high ambition of the core team. \nMoreover, the project aimed to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) since the environment could be beneficial from this project, by cutting the amount of paperwork. \"", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4098", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "The dApp allows uploading any document, storing it in a distributed environment (decentralized IPFS storage of encrypted documents), and signing it with a digital signature by defined participants.", "experience": "Migamake performs high-performance Haskell projects, including parsing, data summarization, and blockchain services.\nSome our devs participated Cardano development.\nThe StreamCardano.com project was accepted in Fund8."}
