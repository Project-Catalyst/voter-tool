It is suggested that tickets be traded electronically through a \u201cdigital nominative ticket\u201d (I believe CNFTs), Cardano\u2019s technologies would be used to ensure that this industry becomes less subject to practices such as ticket duplication, for example. . When there are barcodes and fixed tickets, the chances of scalpers trying to take advantage of fraudulent tickets is real, this makes it necessary for active tokens to be used. At least, that was my understanding of the issue. A passage that makes it very clear why the proposal is relevant to the challenge is \u201cBeing able to dispense with an intermediary to sell your tickets online and cut the rug from the fraudsters and second market resellers that have a web base, is what a technology like the Cardano blockchain. Blockchain ensures the direct and secure transfer of tickets between individuals. This will pit peer-to-peer against the secondary market and reduce the number of squatters who buy as many tickets as possible when the box office opens for the sole purpose of reselling them at a higher price.\u201d So I think the idea is very valid, although the other parts of the proposal have serious flaws, in terms of impact, the proposal is of high value.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately we have a very serious flaw, the bidders forgot to include a script (it is still written to be done). In this case, we have no way of commenting, as this information is totally absent. It would be necessary for us to know what the phases of the project would be, what activities would comprise each phase, how they would be carried out, what the daily work of professionals would be like\u2026 without a roadmap, it is not possible to understand the project development process itself. The expenses are also not well explained. They are only cited, but not argued. For example in: \u201c10000$: Smart contract development / 10000$: Code audit (CERTIK) / 5000$ : Marketing\u201d. Why would the marketing cost 5 thousand dollars, how would the publicity campaign for the project be carried out? How would the target audience be reached here? What would the developer's monthly salary be? We only know the total amount that would be paid, but we do not know the number of months, or even the hourly rate of this professional's work. Therefore, a lot of information is missing to understand how this money would actually be used. Talking about the team, we have some information about Mady, we know that a web developer is already hired (which is not shown) and developers from Cardano would still be hired (this needed to have already been provided). So unfortunately not much confidence is passed on the team. For these reasons, I consider that the proposal is not viable.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "While we have serious problems with the roadmap, it is natural that we do not have good means of auditing the proposal. The proponent says they will set deadlines for each defined task: which tasks? How will the weekly reports guide us to the right progress of the project, relating it to the members involved, if we don't know very well what to expect? The monthly goals for each project member should have been defined from the moment of publication of this proposal, in my view. About success, it is defined as \u201cMeet deadlines for each defined task; Do not go over budget; Completion of the project before the expected date; Smart contract validation by CERTIK\u201d and so on. This is all about the project itself, not how it affects Cardano. How will the campaign summary KPIs be guaranteed: \u201cIncreasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products + Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that are supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community\u201d?

In the proposal, the author states that their aim is to reduce the problem of fake tickets to concerts or sports events by applying blockchain technology, but I don't know how they do that. Is the solution to tokenize tickets or is there another way. Metrics and goals of the project are also not clear, I suggest that the proposer should clearly state what will be delivered when the project is funded to make the project better.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Proposer mentioned that in the project team there is a web developer, a mobile developer, and an IT specialist. But the skills and experience of these people have not been clarified, the proposer should provide more LinkedIn links so that voters can have a deeper understanding of the capabilities of each of these people.\n\nThe budget given is quite general, not broken down into identifiable items. For example, in terms of $10,000 for smart contract development, the project needs to state how long it will take to develop, how many developers are needed to program the smart contract, how many hours each developer works a week, and what is the pay rate of a developer. In addition, I find that spending $10,000 to build a workroom is not suitable for the initial phase of the project, the proposer can consider working under the work-from-home model to minimize operating costs. Spending $10,000 to buy IT equipment also needs to be more detailed about the number and name of the equipment.\n\nThe proposal does not present its detailed implementation plan. This is really a huge shortcoming that the proposer needs to supplement if the proposer wants to be supported by the community and Catalyst to get the fund.\n\nThe risks that the team faced during the project implementation were also not mentioned. One of the risks that I can foresee in tokenizing tickets (if they develop this way) is to make sure tokenized tickets have the same legal validity as physical tickets. That means the sports event organizer must agree to accept the replacement of traditional tickets with these NFT tickets. If the ticket is not recognized as an entry ticket to the event, it will become worthless.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The information provided by the project is not enough for the community to audit the progress and success of the project.

Information such as how long to complete the project, how many phases there are, and the deliverable of each phase needed to be presented for the proposal to be more complete.

The proposer stated that ticketing system in Africa still use in traditional way and this is creating practice of duplication in selling the ticket especially ticket for concert, for show and for football match. In addition to this, the proposer proposes to develop e-ticketing system through cardano blockchain so that no more barcode or manual ticket sell to the public, everything will be in electronically. Furthermore, the more important is, it prevents duplicate ticket sold to the public and I like this idea. Since the proposer aims to develop ticketing system through Cardano blockchain, I would like the author make it clear how the author develop ticketing system in Cardano blockchain, what would the author name it of that system and what risk that could prevent the author from delivering the project. perhaps cybersecurity risk occurs in the implementation of ticketing system, therefore, how this risk being mitigate. no detail information about that in the proposal, therefore,  I felt a lack of assurance about how this project would be implemented successfully.

Many proposals establish phases, this is because we understand well what would happen but not when it would happen, that is, when each thing would start and end, which is essential for a full understanding of the activities including developing ticketing system. Furthermore, I think, it would be better was if they had also included the time each of these development systems would take. In term of budget, perhaps the budget can be breakdown into detail. For example, there is budget $5000 for marketing. You may breakdown into how many people in the marketing and what are they market it (specific tasks/job) and there is $10.000 for purchase IT equipments, thus you may breakdown into what is that equipment and how many.

The proposer does not establish success matric and the information too short which does not allow for a deep understanding of what is planned for results.

It is important that there is someone to oversee the entire project + progress which in this case is the applicant himself, but it is also important to bring a marketing representative and with him who has knowledge in this area and is also able to drive this forward and properly monitor the same applies to the event industry.

I would have liked a clearer breakdown to be able to give a good assessment. That means a more precise description of how these values given there come about.
