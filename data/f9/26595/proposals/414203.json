These anime works will be tagged with NFT tokens based on the Cardano blockchain technology. The development team will integrate the most advanced technology solutions to solve the problems they pose such as building 3D spatial models and integrating Web3 features to realize the ownership of the technologies, artists, and all of the end-users on this Metaverse platform.\nSpecifically, the techniques they apply focus on Ubiquity, Semantic Web, Artificial intelligence, and 3D graphics. These are Web-3 features that fit the ideas to be implemented for this proposal. As we know the global anime market is growing, especially in Asian countries, the team that proposes this project comes from the most dynamic place of Anime art creations. A market that brings a lot of value and impacts on other economic sectors, with hundreds of billions of dollars each year, anime is directly related to many industries\u201d (Anime products are also a source of creative inspiration for other) industries to develop such as film adaptation, music, game publishing, advertising, food, or cosplay production ...)\u201d In my opinion, with a large volume of anime every year being created with only a small fraction of NFT-linked digitization, it will greatly accelerate the shift of traditional anime and NFT Cardano technology has a lot of work to be created, This is really a project that affects a lot of people in addition to the money community, but also the anime community and creative content on the internet. The risks of the project raised by the proposer revolve around many issues such as (communication, NFT anime user education, cryptocurrency market price, or bad techniques of Cardano blockchain ..) Besides clearly explaining the implementation steps and necessary solutions for future problems. The development team has foreseen many possible risks, this is very good, fully understanding their project and confidently developing it. Indicators to measure the development and goals of the project are covered, the proposer also offers legal solutions, licenses, communication campaigns for the product, and a wide range of features usefulness of the ANIMETA metaverse platform. This is a proposal worth investing in and developing, wish you success.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I tried accessing the 3D anime space that you guys are building, https://lp.anique.jp/exhibition/fireforce really the system runs very smoothly, the player can move in that space, click and look at the anime paintings on display, walking along the corridors of the 3D museum, there are a lot of artworks, be it anime paintings, anime films and interactions with exhibitors. I tried writing a few comments on the pictures and clicking on the heart icons for the anime I liked. I wonder if this is a necessary 3D anime space to combine with NFT, you guys have done a lot before submitting this proposal. More about the proposer of this project that I see, they have very good professional skills, they are entrepreneurs and creators of entertainment content on the internet. With those people, it's great to develop a proposal. Most of the members have clear and authenticated identities, I tried connecting with them and got a lot of useful information about this project.

I also took a close look at the Roadmap sections in this proposal, it's the most complete and detailed I've seen, the items listed line by line are what they're going to do. The required budget is not too high for a large project like ANIMETA, specifically, the web programming part is $12,000, the 3D Builder is $14,950, and the Blockchain developer $16,000.. those are important parts of our core work. project and the budget are very modest. I think these are cost estimates that are very realistic and somewhat below the market, which is beneficial for the Catalyst fund. To summarize in this section, a complete explanation of feasibility is proposed, complete and clear, your team has been successful with many products, and I hope you continue to succeed with this 3D Anime NFT Museum project.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The success of the project is briefly defined, what is needed to succeed in the Fund 9 phase of this proposal is covered, which is: \u201cBuild APIs and mint NFTs; Attach NFT products to that of NFT on the Cardano blockchain; Build a 3D gallery space for anime works; Build a wallet of the ANIMETA platform that serves customers to create and manage their assets.\u201d In addition, the token for the anime museum ecosystem is also issued, the tokennomics implementation is presented in the excel file and the proposer is attached. In the internal team, it is recommended to use a software development process that is very popular these days like SCRUM, which allows tasks to be defined and completed according to those KPIs. The Catalyst community can also follow the development of the project through the links (community, source code submitted, or website) provided by the proposers.\nOverall, ANIMETA is a great proposal that includes many items that need to be done, has many useful features of the anime exhibition museum, and the graphics are beautiful and harmonious. The proposal has a wide impact on many communities and the ability to execute successfully with this development team, they have many achievements in funds8 with other dApp platforms.\nI would like to advise proposers to develop more mobile versions of ANIMETA to serve a larger set of customers, young people who want convenience and always have a smartphone in their hand. If ANIMETA's dApps are deployed on mobile devices I believe this export can go even further, possibly expanding in the next funds like funds 10, and 11 on this Catalyst fund. I support developments that add features and versions of the ANIMETA platform that you are after.

The authors plan to build a museum that will display Anime and allow it to function as a metaverse platform. This way, artists can create, define and manage their NFT anime assets in the Cardano ecosystem. Combining WEB3 technology with 3D will create a more vivid and luxurious anime world in the metaverse. This anime world is built on the Cardano ecosystem to ensure the right to own the anime work is tied to NFT, and the artists can freely create and manage their anime resources without going through any intermediary. ANIMETA acts as a dApp platform and solves significant problems in the anime world, such as securing the best ownership, accelerating progress, expanding the Anime and blockchain world community, and attracting many participants for fairness and transparency of assets based on the Cardano ecosystem.

Specific roles for project participants have been divided and explained in detail in the description to increase the controllability of the proposal. In addition, the author team also provides evaluation indicators such as the number of NFT anime displayed on the ANIMETA platform, the number of accounts registered in ANIMETA, the number of connected ADA wallets, etc. Four significant risks (media, ADA coin down, internal teams, technology not yet supported) that could impede the proposal's implementation were analyzed and proposed to be remedied by the team.

Fortunately, this project made me understand the problems and features of a metaverse. Perhaps this is the best, most practical, most understandable proposal of the metaverse that we need to popularize. I am also a software engineer and understand that defining a commercial product is very difficult, moreover, it has to be understood by everyone, even people who are not in the blockchain industry can understand it. You guys did a great job on this definition, very intuitive, and easy to understand without being too academic - A museum of pictures exhibited in 3D in a Metaverse platform, those anime are NFT attached. or self-defined by end-users. Indeed, even though high school students reading this proposal know what NFT ANIME is, I give you a plus for the problem-solving part of this project. The problem-solving part is also very easy to understand, why to build the ANIMETA museum, you take advantage of Cardano technology to decentralize with traditional Anime platforms, and at the same time divide rights for artists who create and produce those anime products. You apply Web3 technology as the foundation for asset creation, asset management, and property ownership for the participants in this Anime museum. Once again the technology in this proposal is very simple and easy for everyone to understand,\nI am very impressed with what you present here. Really Web3 technology makes me still confused but you guys have made me more knowledgeable. Your project addresses a real need in the global Anime community, the need to digitize assets, the need to protect property rights, and the need for decentralized exchange of assets. Now an anime artist or more broadly a content creator can attach NFTs to his or her production as the sole security of exchange and that is the property attached to that product. . The project has a strong impact on artists, publishers, or NFT investors on Cardano's blockchain platform. Proposal to build a 3D space museum with full functions of exhibits, galleries, spatial corridors, live commentary, and upcoming collections.\nProposed towards a really large market with annual sales of several tens of billions of dollars, according to the statistics pages you refer to \u201chttps://aja.gr.jp/english/japan-anime- data https://animetide.com/anime-industry-statistics-and-facts/ \u201cI see that in 2020 the Japanese market alone is worth nearly 5 billion USD. Those are impressive numbers and a potential market for the NFT ANIME industry. There are a few risks that the price of cryptocurrencies fluctuates up and down affecting the project you have proposed. The rest I think is not a significant risk. You are writing a very meaningful proposal and opening the future for the digital industry with works of art. I will totally vote for your project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal offers a roadmap that could not be more detailed, the time being each quarter of the year with dozens of jobs listed as a to-do list. I give an example in Q3 that you have clearly planned and done a lot of work such as:\n\u201cAnalysis and design system of Anime Metaverse museum.\n    \u2022    Build 3D digital space modules. \u2028\n    \u2022    Design the Metaverse features needed in the digital platform. \u2028\n    \u2022    Design the database architecture of the platform system. \u2028\n    \u2022    Build and set up Node Cardano server. \u2028\n    \u2022    Build Cardano's DB-sync server. \u2028\n    \u2022    Build APIs that communicate with the Cardano blockchain. \u2028\n    \u2022    Detailed definition of the enhancements of the platform. \u2028\n    \u2022    Design features of the ANIMETA system. \u2028\n(In this section the teams involved in development: 3D design, backend, system, network, and blockchain technical team)\u201d\nThis is just a small excerpt that I wanted to demonstrate to the voter\u2019s Catalyst community, in addition to the numerous portfolios of diligent work the proponent wrote. Well-planned short-term and long-term goals: In 3-6 months:\n(Complete basic 3D design modules.\n    \u2022    Completed programming the basic functions of the platform. \u2028\n    \u2022    Release of MVP version of ANIMETA platform. \u2028\n)\n12 months (Complete programming of application features.\n    \u2022    Release ANIMETA version 1.0 with full functions on PC. \u2028\n    \u2022    Develop separate community channels for customers. \u2028\n    \u2022    Open funding rounds from investors, and collector Anime NFTs. \u2028\n    \u2022    Complete product marketing of phase 1 \u2028\n)\nThis is very suitable for the roadmap of the tasks to be executed, with such a time period that is not too stressful on the completion of the project but also does not prolong the work, the factors here are very logical. . The project development team is highly specialized, they already have many funded projects in fund8 and are working hard on them. They are experienced in software development and have worked on the Cardano blockchain. I came across a few of their projects, which are high-quality and impactful projects in our Cardano ecosystem. Like the bWorks, cBilling, and IronSky projects they are implementing. With the digital content experts of the development team, I believe that the project will soon be fruitful and successful. The proposal has a total required budget of 111033$, which I find to be a small number compared to what it takes to have a great platform like ANIMETA. The proposal has divided the budget into corresponding work items, which is easy to control and avoids loss of funds. I agree with this budget for the development of the project, if I had to choose a Metaverse project on the blockchain platform I would definitely choose ANIMETA because what you are doing there is very practical and highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal has been very professional in impact research related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).
