This concept of Refer to Earn has been used widely when it comes to tracking the lead from marketers. It should be possible to apply this concept to draw delegators for the SPOs. The more SPOs that don't have to retire their pools due to lack of delegators can survive, the better decentralized blockchain and the more secure network is.

The project development roadmap is clear and easy to understand including timelines, the goals to be achieved at each of those timelines. However, the requested budget is quite vague, presenting the overall budget for each piece of work is not enough to assess the feasibility of the requested budget, it needs to be analyzed in more detail.

And sometimes the pool owners have too little commission or not enough ADA to close the block (the minimum number to close the block is about 1.2 million ADA, which is a rather large number), so having support from a large number of trustees will increase the ability to close the block, thereby helping to maintain the operation of the pool. Marketers have customers through their social media channels, and sometimes the pool owners do not have enough ADA to close the block because they do not have enough commission. For example, I have not seen you guys give a commission for the referral milestones. For example, if I refer the number of people with an amount of ADA equivalent to 1 million ADA, the commission must be different from 100K ADA. I have not seen you guys give a commission for the referral milestones.\n\nYou mentioned in your proposal that the risk of the project is due to a lack of funds; money to maintain your protocol and money to finance the project. However, you stated that you would sell NFT in order to finance the project. And I would also like to contribute one more part of the risk, and that is when you introduce pools to your customers, there are pools that will have very high costs (costs), even 99 percent, so the pool selection needs to be well controlled, because the pool owner can change the commission fee for the trustee, and it is a relatively sensitive issue.

Before I can give you an accurate estimate of the hourly rate, you need to provide me with more specific information regarding the work that you are required to pay for. For the purposes of developing this project, the group of friends is comprised of only two people who have accomplishments and jobs that are comparable to one another. In my view, having only two people to work on a project of this magnitude is, in my view, extremely challenging because of the complexity of the work involved. It is my recommendation that you look for assistance from the community; there, you will find people who are knowledgeable and highly qualified who will be able to work on the project alongside you. My suggestion is that you look for assistance from the community. You mentioned in the export that after the completion of the project, you won't require any additional funding from Catalyst because you will have income coming in from service fees, so you won't have any need for additional funding.

However, the success indicators that you provide need to be more accurate and specific. For instance, you need to be able to see how many more trustees there will be with an ADA number for how many pools after how much time has passed. And how much of a fee will you collect after the project has been completed successfully for each successful referral on the ADA that the community places their faith in the Pool? In general, this is a good idea for a project because it has the potential to be successful, it has the potential to bring value to pool owners and users, and it has the potential to help the community identify good pools that can be trusted.

They run the matchmaking service by providing a platform and smart contract, take a commission off the top, the marketer gets a percentage of the rewards earned, the SPO or NFT minter gets delegators or sales, and everyone is happy.\n\nBut up close there starts to be issues.  One thing that immediately jumps out is the lack of discussion around risks related to an affiliate contract.  There really needs to be an addition of legal help for the budget here, as the affiliate contracts will need to be designed to some kinds of standards.  In addition, which side does the fee come out on?  The affiliate won't get paid until the delegation happens and blocks are rewarded *which may not happen*.  If not enough delegates have been sent to a pool (and the implication in the impact section is that this will benefit small pools who struggle to get delegates, which makes sense...why would a pool with delegates approach an affiliate?) that pool won't make blocks which means neither the delegate nor the affiliate is happy.  If fees are charged up front, the SPO won't be happy either, and if they stay on the backend after rewards, the proposer won't be happy.  Not an ideal situation.\n\nAnother thing that crops up that affects impact, is that if an affiliate has enough marketing power to help an SPO produce blocks...the affiliate could just start their own stakepool.  And this is exactly what we see right now.  Any marketer with a big enough market in the ecosystem starts up their own pool, and most do well and even expand.  The affiliate protocol may fit somewhere in between as a niche, helping small marketing pools sort of consolidate, but the impact case for that situation hasn't been described here.  They do leave open the future scaling of the platform to other protocols like NFTs, and it is possible that these same issues would not be present with a change in protocol.\n\nBecause the protocol described here is attempting to address a real problem in the ecosystem, but because what they have described will have an unknown effect, and because the possible alternative protocols do not address the same problem, I find I can neither agree nor disagree with this proposal ultimately having any impact. 3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Several of the issues mentioned in impact show up here as well.  The timeline is decent, but the descriptions of the milestones are quite broad and hard to quantify.  Given some of the struggles I anticipate for this project, I do appreciate that a large portion of the early 12 month timeline (3 months) is dedicated to research and planning, which will be needed.  However in the here and now, these things are not well fleshed out and leave a lot of space for doubt.\n\nThe budget is not broken down very well.  A huge portion ($80k) is for one role, which is the full stack developer.  I'm not saying that rate is a problem, but the role characteristic simply isn't giving enough information.  Mapping the development budget to specific milestones in the timeline, or forecasting hour required per month would at least break down that amount so it could be assessed for how reasonable it was.  Ideally, the architecture knowledge that will likely be discovered during the first phase of the project would have all the specific details needed for the cost of the platform (an indicator that the research should really be a Version0.0, i.e. before the proposal is submitted).\n\nThe team has provided some basic profile information, and there is some experience included that is relevant to the work at hand (affiliate experience).

These are solid metrics, although not really accounted for in the budget or impact statements.  That it isn't broken down in the budget is a problem, but it makes sense that it doesn't get a lot of play earlier in the proposal: it doesn't speak directly to the high level impact that helping SPOs does, but to this I would ask the proposer to think twice.  It may be that this marketing course has the most connection between the proposer and what they are trying to accomplish (help small SPOs reach delegators), and it may serve as the backbone for laying out a more robust proposal if this one isn't funded.\n\nBecause the team has provided limited tracking information, and equally limited measures of progress, but does include some basic success metrics that tie to their description of impact, I can neither agree nor disagree that the proposal will be auditable and able to stay on track. 3 stars.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15383, "q0": "I personally amaze with how Proposer see the problem and compile the solution with Proposer's experience as a full-time affiliate marketer.
