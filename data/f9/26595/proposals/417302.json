This proposal links well with the challenge setting it aims to build a solution that allows the project to grow rapidly for faster user adoption and prototyping on Cardano. The identified solution to this problem is for people to use Profila's App to learn about + exercise their data rights, and privacy metadata ledger then provides legal proof of the event this: \"unsubscribe on steroids\". This solution solves the problems of the challenge. The only risk for this project to fail is that failure to execute this project will lead to the bankruptcy of our company (Profila GmbH) during this bear market. However, the author also had a workaround if let the project survive the next 12 months.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The success of the project was the timely development of this additional fourth aspect of the user privacy metadata ledger, its integration into the Profila platform, and testing with our customers. Success will also be traction with several governments and data privacy authorities in Europe, letting them help spread the news that a consumer-focused privacy app on the Cardano blockchain exists. The solution is a distributed product and integrates with the Cardano blockchain by adding metadata each time an individual exercises a right. The profile is a platform that allows individuals to communicate with different organizations in their lives, privately, one-on-one, and without supervision or tracking. This proposal is a continuation of funds that preceded our data sharing through the NFT workflow and is extending existing basic consumer content creation to a more professional platform where artists and Doctors can create branded content that brands can purchase as NFTs and use commercially.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team has been very transparent including a large list of partners and supporters, some of which include the likes of IOG, MLABS, and Microsoft.

All the main ingredients are given, this team is highly qualified and the team has also been funded from previous projects I just briefly listed the experience they have currently. The budget applied for funding to develop the second use case ZKT/Cardano-native token of the proposal is $97,000 for a 6-month development project. The author has provided a detailed road map and analysis of the costs involved and how they will be spent clearly and coherently: The author lists 4 stages to develop: research and development PRD - $8,000, business analysis and UX/UI design jobs - $7,000, project management and overall reporting - $10,000, project management and overall reporting - $10,000.

It is interesting that the author has provided all the essential details with respect to their earlier projects and fundings which clearly shows how competent,dedicated and ambitious the team is.\n\nThe outlined solution statement is succinct .The proposed solution will make both legal parties( people-brand) to allow third parties to access their meta data ledger entry by providing them a temporary key pair. This clearly shows how it integrates with the cardano blockchain by adding meta data each time an individual exercises right. Moreover if the solution is made public then it will have a great impact on the cardano.This proposal speaks directly to the main objectives of the challenge and thus all the goals and metrics of the proposal are well aligned to the challenge statement.\n \nThe proposal is clearly aware of all the possible risks and challenges involved within the solution however, they also have a detailed plan to overcome those risks effectively.\n\nAfter reading through all the crucial information provided in detail regarding their earlier work and how it will influence current proposal, I can clearly say that this proposal has full ability to scale to address future challenges.\n\nThe proposed solution will have a global impact as every individual out there will be directed to the dapp to utilize their data rights to their advantage.\nThis part of the project is clear and pretty detailed so we have an accurate picture of how this will add value to the cardano ecosystem in different ways by aligning to the challenge statement.\nHence I strongly agree that this proposal addresses the challenge effectively and a score of 5 out of 5 does justice to it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposers of this challenge are an impressive combination.

The breakdown of the weekly/ monthly activities is clearly already working. The provided time frame and tasks look realistic and conductible .\n\nThe budget is clear, appropriate and is well presented for a proposal of this size and relatable to the tasks that are proposed. The proposer is unlikely to return to catalyst for further funding unless they see an another opportunity to further\u00a0build out this project.\n\nThe proposer seems to be aware of the risks and challenges posed by this proposal which they will require to look into further subsequent phase after this proposal.\n\nTaking into account all the above facts, I strongly agree that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal states that the community will be provided with the detailed periodical progress.They clearly outlined few important metrics.

Adding an aspect that enables courts and arbitrators to practically settle disputes is only consequential if you want to render the entire concept functional and thus a much-required project within the challenge and this fund.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As mentioned above i have been following these projects since the very beginning and can see their growth and progress. Both the team have shown their competencies and the credible implementation plan adds to this. The roamap covers the main topics, could be a bit more detailed however. Regarding the budget: While the rates are realistic compared to swiss industry rates, it needs to be wondered whether in the fiscal regime of switzerland where still a lot of the money will be left after taxation it is neccessary to charge such rates on COMMUNITY FUNDS. I can see a lot of proposers having charged lower. Other that the budget seems in order. The proposers are very transparent about their team and their further plans.

The roadmap contains the contents of the work. but with a project like this I ask for a more specific route. In the end on budget it's broken down into subsections but as the content offers they say $8000 for PRD research and development. I am asking for more specific information about what the job is, how many people are present and how long it will take, so that the reasonableness of the requested budget can be assessed. For other items of this budget I don't think it's unreasonable for example $1000 for a day's work by a senior blockchain developer. given the information about the team and the implementation roadmap, it seems reasonable so I have no objection but due to the costs as explained above I cannot agree with the feasibility of this proposal because so i give 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "according to the information provided I know how and where to check the progress of the proposal.

I think a lot of people wonder \"wen profila?\"  A brief overview of the project as it relates to Catalyst (and they have other partnerships as well) is that they have received around half of the $445k in funding that they have been awarded to date (that being a subset of over $2m in requested funding including fund 9).  In the process they have turned the Profila launch brand into a 4-sector juggernaut that at this point needs to deliver a homerun.  And if you have been keeping up with the demos, it is starting to look like that homerun will be a reality.\n\nIf you don't already know, Profila is a data-privacy protocol, that lets you interface with the modern web while taking back and preserving your digital rights.  It is heavily rooted in GDPR, which is the flagship standard for data rights, and which is quickly becoming an expected norm, with legal rulings and legislation consistently favoring the individual over the corporation.  Humanity still has a chance to get this one right.\n\nThis current proposal, part of multiple funding proposal ask that doubles their Fund 8 rewards, looks to be the final step for a specific leg of the development protocol that handles what I believe to be the most significant piece of the Profila puzzle.  Unlike the tokenizing/gamification leg that will make engaging with Profila a daily routine, or the NFT leg that will open up opportunities and drastically clean up your daily browsing experience, or even the critical DID leg that will allow this technology to scale into an SSI future, what we are talking about here is the *right to privacy*, and it is the whole reason for the platform.\n\nSo far, they have developed the core components of the right to privacy as an educational module (we have to know what our rights are), a dashboard in the app (managing the rights we have now learned about is a seamless experience), and blockchain integration (tamperproof records make managing rights effective and powerful).  In this proposal they introduce the final step, the integration of third party access, via privacy protecting protocols to allow the blockchain integration to be legally accessed and parsed to satisfy any claims made of rights violations, the final mile of resolution that marks the ability of this product to actually change the conversation around the value of manipulating or abusing someone's personal data.\n\nBecause this final integration into the Profila app is critical to deliver the promise of data rights protection to individuals, and because it is the last step towards that goal, I find it as impactful as the ones that were approved and funded to get us to this point.  5 stars for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team details leave nothing to the imagination.  With over 20 core members, this has become a massive partnership with the Cardano community, with strong outreach into the most forward thinking areas of adtech.  The experience accumulated here and the development partnerships (they have Mlabs on speed dial) would be the envy of any project.  And they just keep adding.\n\nI have no complaints about the timeline (which includes updates on all current proposals in this quadrant of the Profila project), the milestones (which are clear with excellent descriptions of the architecture involved) or the budget.  The budget, though large, is spread out over a 6 month development period (and they helpfully note that the project will continue to iterate in the months immediately beyond the funding period, so we don't have to wonder if funding has been assigned correctly on the 9 month timeline).  It is broken down by day, and the highest rate goes to the plutus/blockchain developer at approx $125 an hour which is extremely reasonable right now (it may be crypto-winter, but builders are building).\n\nBecause the team has provided clear details and demonstrated a deep understanding of the tasks to be accomplished in this proposal, and because they have committed resources in a reasonable way over a specific timeline, I believe they deserve full marks for feasibility.  5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The metrics for progress are fantastic, as this leg of the project includes a github repo, and this repo, along with their newsletter are updated monthly (and their discord is great too.  I requested all past newsletters and they sent them right out).  They are up to date with Catalyst reporting (on a LOT of projects) and are regulars for breakout rooms and other AMA sessions.\n\nIt is worth noting that in AMAs, it is still the original founders that are reaching out to the community.  It definitely doesn't feel like it is a project that is untethering from the community as it grows, which is great to see.  Catalyst adopters of this tech will be some of the most appreciative, seeing how far it has come.\n\nThe team places a hard delivery deadline and a clear description of what will be available at the delivery event, which is all you can ask for.  It is certainly a metric that is within reach.  Because they have provided solid lists for both success and progress metrics, and because the team remains as accessible and transparent as they were in Fund 4, I believe the community will be able to keep track of this privacy ledger on its final trip through the neighborhood.  5 stars for auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "People use Profila's App to learn about + exercise their data rights (e.g. right to be forgotten); the privacy metadata ledger then provides legal proof of this event = \"unsubscribe on steroids\"", "experience": "Privacy/Tech lawyer with 10Y XP in (project relevant) legal issues - consumer privacy & data rights + Profila team of (20+) industry experts.
