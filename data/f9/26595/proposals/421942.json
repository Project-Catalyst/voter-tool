I find the author's idea very good to serve investors on Cardano. Help them reduce the time to research a project and choose good projects to invest in.\nHowever, I watched the video on the author's channel. The videos about project evaluation, the content is being stretched, I think a video evaluating an NFT project should be less than 5 minutes will be better in terms of content quality and attract investors to watch those videos.\nIn the description of the solution, I found that the author has described the benefits and features of this solution quite well. If the author can clarify which challenge this solution addresses, it will be easier to understand and more appreciated by voters.\nRegarding the analysis of risks, I suggest a few other risks that the author has not thought of. For example, ADA slippage resulted in insufficient funds for the project to complete the proposal. Hint here: the author should ask for an additional 5-10% of the total amount requested. Another risk is the small number of people watching the video. Hint: The author should have an advertising plan to attract and increase views.\nThis is a very useful recommendation for investors specializing in NFT and I think it is quite necessary.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In my opinion, the author's implementation plan should be built in phases or month by month. Hint: What tasks will the author perform each month, and who will perform that task.\nThis will be the easiest way to present the plan that I and the voters consider to be immediately understood.\nIn the plan, I see the new author mentioned recruiting members. This will lead to the author not making an accurate assessment of the implementation costs and may lead to increased costs beyond the originally requested budget. That's another risk the author needs to consider. Another risk is that the members that the author recruits or offers to cooperate with do not complete the assigned work tasks. This leads to a delay in the proposal progress, which is another huge risk that the author needs to think about.\nRegarding team members information, I need more information. The author provides very sketchy information about team members and there are no other sources of information to verify such as Linkedin. This leaves me with no basis to accurately assess whether the expertise and skills of the author and the team are suitable to complete this proposal.\nThe author needs to include this information in other proposals to gain confidence from PAs and voters.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Overview of the proposal, I found that the information provided by the author was incomplete, especially about information about team members. Is there any verifiable information available to assess whether the team has enough experience and skill to complete this proposal?\nThis is a huge minus point in this proposal.\nRegarding the KPI, I think the author needs to add 1 more indicator that is the average number of video views. Hint: 100 views/video for example.\nThis number will help voters gauge the author's commitment to quality content to investors on Cardano and the Cardano community.\nThe author should build a public channel and post reports on the results of the work on the completed proposal on this public channel or the author's channel. Let the community see the results of the work that the author has done and how it affects the overall development of Cardano.\nFinally, if possible, the author should build a survey to receive quality reviews from viewers to improve the quality of the content.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3702", "no_vca": 2, "ne": 2, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 837, "q0": "The proposer aims to create video content about the CNFT space, his Youtube channel is followed by approximately 2900 people and it looks like an interesting one !

My only criticism is that I don't feel this is the best campaign to host the proposal as there are no new dApps or integrations being created or incentivized, or existing products being improved. Having said that I do believe such an initiative would enrich the ecosystem and potentially attract new users. The metrics chosen are well-thought in terms of tracking the project's progress, but again, they don't really align with the challenge settings as they are not measuring the expansion of dApps and products available or number of integrations between different solutions.

Additionally, the tasks described in the detailed plan all have deadlines and they all sound realistic. Moreover, the plan itself is also clear and well-structured and shows how each topic will be implemented. Finally, the proposer pinpoints two main risks, people losing interest in crypto related topics and his content lacking consistency. In order to mitigate both he reinforces he has been producing content for a while and with great consistency, and that by producing interesting content people will be less likely to lose interest.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provided has clear milestones and reasonable time horizons. The main topics are the website building and the content creation. The rest are shorter activities that will be done in the beginning of the project. In addition, the KPIs defined are well-thought and translate well if the proposal is a success or not. For instance, number of subscribers and videos/podcast rating are very good measures to identify if he is pleasing the audience. Even though he has provided a twitter account he could have emphasized he is going to use that channel to provide updates to the community about his progress. Finally, as mentioned before, even though the proposal has strong points in the auditability field it does not effectively addresses the problem of the campaign of building or improving Cardano dApps to attract more users.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4485, "q0": "This proposal is by an existing CNFT content creator who is already successful on Youtube (3k subscribers) and Twitter (4k subscribers). The idea is to move from a hobby with irregular and partially paywalled content to much more regular and part-time commitment, with the potential to go full-time. The content presented in high quality and likeable and a great service to Cardano and the NFT community. While I hope that Blake will get funded and continue to produce videos, I do not think that this challenge setting is ideally served by the proposal. It states that \"novel and viable applications and products get built on top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.\" While surely Blakes work continues to contribute to Cardano adoption, the funds intended to build new apps and make the blockchain technology and its tooling more sophisticated are \"diverted\" to content - there should ideally be a special category for this to separate what is popular from what may be more long term beneficial. I also see a potential conflict of successful Youtubers who already commercialize content receiving additional grants from Project Catalyst while continuing their current fees and income. There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but it may divert funds from more publicity shy dev teams and add to income inequality in a community that wants the opposite. A community wallet is a great idea to give back, but does not solve the problem meaningfully as it comes out of new Catalyst funding.\nI would score this very strong proposer and his great work therefore only average in terms of impact as the challenge is not addressed perfectly (tradeoff between yes: adding users and adoption, no: not building dapps or integrations). Unfortunately, there is not much the proposer could have done to score higher except perhaps proposing in a different category, so I am only deducting 1 and not 2 stars. It is also worth noting that the reason for this proposal is to create a central source of CNFT \"intelligence\" which may help boost the value of Cardano NFTs as a whole, drawing in more creators and users and therefore also incentivizing developers.

The proposer has a Youtube channel and talks about CNFT projects. It is a place where community members can watch these videos and learn more about the good NFT projects on Cardano. I like this idea because education in the community is very important and there are a lot of CNFT projects that have no real value behind them. This could potentially benefit the Cardano ecosystem by promoting the good and safe projects in the community. I would agree that there is a need for NFT education because it would not be good if a new user in the community goes and buys lots of random nfts and then gets scammed.

After looking into blakeCNFTs videos, I saw that there is a good amount of active viewers/subscribers. Something I would suggest if it hasn't been done already. Is for blakeCNFT to talk about this proposal in one of his videos. This leads to the second concept which is accountability.

Having consistent content being put out and follow ups on NFT projects before and after they launch is essential for the community to thrive and grow on Cardano. The proposer is a Youtube content creator becoming well known on Twitter and discord servers throughout the Cardano NFT space, and wants to solve the problem by being more active and producing more videos on a consistent basis so the community can be well informed and take advantage of the research the proposer plans to endure. The Cardano NFT space is still growing strong, even in a bear market, and many investing do not do their own research but instead watch content creators for answers. As content creators become more knowledgeable and dedicate more time to finding out the answers to the hard questions among members of a certain project, viewers flock to them for advice NFA but NFT advice. The impact this proposal could have on the Cardano ecosystem is yet to take full affect but overall, more word of mouth or video within the community is a positive impact nonetheless.

There is no definitive evidence via Twitter to see if either member is completely qualified, but the existing Youtube channel as well as the number of subscribers is a good indication that the proposed team is capable of completing the tasks outlined. Content contributors are also listed, and some are even more highly regarded within the Cardano NFT space than the proposer and having collaborative efforts on Youtube and Twitter is a great way to bring more people into the space and promote a healthier community at large. The budget break down includes the development of a website creation, discord moderation which is essential for community growth outside of subscribers as well as equipment upgrades which can be costly. It might be difficult to complete the necessary research and keep fresh content flowing on the channel for 10 videos per month, which is the only risk I find within the proposal.

If the proposer can maintain motivation and continue to produce quality content for the viewers, then higher growth will take place. It is not well defined within the proposal how the proposer will remain transparent throughout the projects roadmap; as it would be best if perhaps weekly or monthly reports were available to Project Catalyst and it's members of what progress is being made (website development*). It will become more apparent to the community that the proposal is being implemented successfully by checking and reviewing how many videos are produced each month, might be the best indicator of success.
