NFT collections will be created from the cause for the protection of bees, which is at the same time benefiting the activity of beekeepers and developing our blockchain, as the digital tokens will be created will help popularize Cardano. I think it's a very good idea because it can attract a new audience to our ecosystem, not those who are necessarily interested in the cryptographic world, but those who want to support the cause of bees. The objectives that would be directly met in the case of funding this proposal would be: the creation of \"Marketplaces - Total number of users, number of transactions carried out\", in addition the proposal would also work with \"Social Media - Total number of users, number of significant interactions\u201d (because it is said that the project\u2019s publicity campaign would be through social networks; and finally, an issue would be addressed in relation to \u201cEnvironment - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing a habit harmful to the environment.\u201d In this case, we are not working with the CO2 issue, but fighting to combat the decline in the number of bees, due to human predatory activities, is a way of benefiting the environment, without The proponents well argue the need to carry out this project, since the bee market, according to them, moves around 30 billion dollars annually. Currently, in addition to being very important for the balance of ecosystems (we know, for example, that bees spread pollen from flowers, even helping in the matter of maintaining the flora). The project would, as the proponents claim, \u201cincrease and sustain the bee population, support the work of beekeepers, expand the use of Cardano in commerce, increase Cardano users/holders, and ensure sustainable living for all.\u201d This would be done through some actions, such as the creation of NFT collections, from what I understood, 25 unique works would be created initially and each one would be directly linked to some hive, so once the NFTs were purchased the money would be destined for beekeepers treat bees better, acquiring more materials, fighting diseases, etc. In addition to this initiative, a web page would be created with the objective of keeping people informed about the subject. Here, I think further explanations would be in order. How would awareness of the issue be raised, what would be the approaches? Some examples of posts would be interesting. Another question that came to me while reading the proposal would be: how would beekeepers be instructed to take their first steps in cryptography? Who would teach them how to create digital wallets, cash out Ada, turn our currency into local currency? Finally, two other comments I would like to make are: it would be positive if the proponents explained more about the videos that will be posted for dissemination and also about the trips to find the hives (why would they be done?). In general, the proposal is very interesting and deserves maximum marks in terms of impact, although some doubts remain in the air after reading it.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Unfortunately this topic is not 100%, some details would need to be corrected for the proposal to be fully viable, in my view. Talking first about the script, the way the information is passed we only have a superficial notion of what would be done during the project development process, without the appropriate level of detail. To start the temporal division is every 3 months, several activities would be done simultaneously in this period of time, the way they are scored we can't understand what would happen in month 1, 2, 3 and so on. The detailing of each activity could also be better. For example, in the first quarter, we could have more details on how the team meeting and task definition would take place; how the web page would be developed; how NFTs would be created; we could have a better idea of \u200b\u200bhow the interaction with beekeepers would take place and also how the marketing campaign would be developed\u2026 In other words, all the actions could be explained at length, so that we have a more solid view of the process and the progress of the phases (however, the way the information is passed we do have a considerable understanding of it, it just wouldn't be ideal). When we think about the budget division, this part is better than the roadmap presentation, because we know how the total amount would be divided into small parts (for example, web development would include both the developer work - who would do the configuration, plugins and graphics), when domain and hosting and maintenance). Even so, some more information could be passed on, for example how much time the professionals involved would dedicate to the project (what is the value of their working hours); how the meetings with beekeepers would take place (whether they would be online or in person, with how many beekeepers, or individual); and mainly the management of the project that alone would cost 3500 dollars monthly (it's a very high amount, so what would the manager's job be like?); why would the promotional video cost 2000 dollars? Although we have several divisions, it would be important for more detail to be provided on some specific parts so that we have a better understanding of the need for such expenditures. Finally, speaking of the team, this part is ok, but like the other topics, some more details could have been provided so that we had a clearer understanding of those involved. We know their names, a small summary of their professional performances and some links are also provided that allow us to see what was said in practice. The issue that concerns me here is that, apparently, none of the professionals have experience with Cardano, in the case of the developer, it is not clear if he has already done work previously in which he developed with our languages \u200b\u200b(haskell and plutus), or even that Georgios, responsible for marketing, does not seem to have previous experience with blockchain and etc. In this way, these issues could be revised to make the proposal more safely viable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As to whether the proposal is auditable or not, I believe the proposers have suggested good ways for us to track progress and success, but I would like to offer some suggestions so that this monitoring can be taken even further. In addition to the suggested partial results, such as \u201cnumber of registered hives (linked to the number of NFTs sold), products developed (webpage/marketplace, NFT artwork), user engagement on the webpage (through CRM)\u201d and etc, it would be important that we had a way to audit the proposal development process behind this. There are several activities that would lead to these partial successes, as we can see in the script, from initial meetings between the team itself, contacting the beekeepers, carrying out the trips, creating the web space, starting to design the NFTs, until they are ready for commercialization\u2026 How could we follow these processes? It would be necessary for the team leader to gather information so that the Cardano community is constantly updated, abreast of situations and how the phases are unfolding. It would be appropriate for a monthly report to be made available, since the project is quite complex and involves many different activities, that is, all information must be gathered and summarized in a simple way, so that we can follow each step. In total it would be 9 months into the project, so estimating 9 progress reports would be ideal in my view. Talking about the end results, I believe the most accurate KPI this project could achieve would be \u201cincrease the number of integrations that unite existing solutions for a more integrated and connected experience across different products\u201d (challenge description). How could we be sure that the sponsorship of the hives, the generation and commercialization of the NFTs and the creation of the web page not only addressed the problem at hand, of greater protection of the bees, but also actually helped the Cardano ecosystem to become more popular? The KPIs suggested by the proponents are very good because they think about these two sides: from bees (sell the first collection of NFT, have a sustainable number of populated hives and integration of beekeepers from different countries) and from Cardano (increase cardano users and increase the adoption of cardano by all parties involved in beekeeping (beekeepers, NFT buyers, etc.) So I think the only thing that would be pending here would be precisely that these data become more tangible for our community. carry out studies and research aimed at understanding who these new members of the community, brought by the project, would be, and also how they relate to our ecosystem.

This is a quite meaningful proposal, definitely. The NFT will link all the relevant information about the geography of each hive, number of hives, and honey production in detail and all information is stored permanently, of course.

A plus point here is that they explain how to calculate those numbers of costs. However, I\u2019m still confused about there are some potential risks in this proposal. How can the proposer ensure that the in-time information will be delivered for the buyer and updated on blockchain remotely in case there is a change in number of hives, or the problem related to those honeybees\u2019 health? Maybe it seems impossible but if the buyers do not care much about this problem as much as at the beginning, what will be the marketing strategy at this stage and is there any back-up plan if the amount of supporter\u2019s declines?

It is part of the marketing to keep the buyer happy hoping that they may bring more buyers in.

Buyers of NFTs will be able to know the geographic location of each hive, the number of hives, and honey production because this information has been incorporated into the NFT from the time of its initial creation and This information is permanently stored on the blockchain. On the side of the seller, they will receive a sum of money from the buyer and will use this money to ensure the sustainability of the honey bee community as well as increase the honey bee population (care for treatment / protection of the hive).
