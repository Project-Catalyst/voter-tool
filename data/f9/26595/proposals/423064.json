Hardware wallet improves security and they are recommended for any high-value wallets. The issue with these wallets is they need to integrate with the dApps in a hardware-specific way. Gimballabs have been pioneers in Project Based Learning(PBL) in Cardano which is a very practical way and has contributed immensely to the availability of Plutus and Cardano-trained developers to the ecosystem. The proposal is a great combination to develop software with utility and also train people in the niche technology of hardware wallet integration. The proposal is to train people to develop and integrate their dApps and products with Ledger, over three quarters in 2022. The course output is expected to be open source therefore the reach of the material is likely to be wider than the initial cohort. Therefore I feel that the project is very much in alignment with the challenge.

Ledger is a very reputed brand in the world of Crypto and I have personally seen outstanding work of similar nature from Gimbalabs in the last two years. They have demonstrated the commitment and the quality of the work to the community in these nascent years of Cardano. Therefore I have a firm belief that the proposal is in one of the best hands possible to achieve the aim. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal is to prepare 6 modules for training on Ledger integration over three quarters. The cost quoted is $2500 for developing one module and $2500 for coordinating and conducting the training with experts from Ledger. An additional amount of $10K has been included for overall project management and proposal stewardship. ($10,000 for 4 months of proposal stewardship). The project deliverables are quite clear and well-defined. There can be questions on the amount of money for each module. However, I feel Ledger Hardware integration is an involved technology and resources with state of art knowledge in programming will be required to create content in this field. Therefore these amounts are quite reasonable 9 months of high technology effort to prepare opensource training material on an important aspect of the Cardano ecosystem.

Furthermore, the reach of the 3 organization will certainly attract new developers to Cardano, spur conversations, create connections and possible new projects, which will likely be open-source as they will be building on top of the open-source material of the course.

There exists a detailed timetable with actionable items and a very detailed and reasonable budgeting structure for each phase of the project.

Especially those that have the strategy to buy and hold long-term. It is one of the safest options to store your crypto and gives you complete control. The idea of this proposal is to create a project-based learning course where they will be educated on how to create ledger live integrations and enable ledger for their own use. This could have a positive outcome for the Cardano community because it promotes security. This can decrease the number of newer users who get caught up in various unfortunate events. This increases trust in the Crypto industry and in this case, will specifically increase trust in Cardano and it's blockchain.

This helps suggest that the team can be trusted, and that the proposal will likely be implemented successfully. However, there is still more information to consider.

There are specific details that share what the team plans on completing throughout the year during Q2,Q3, and Q4. This is important to note because it will allow for the principle of accountability to help ensure that the team reaches these milestones that have been set in their roadmap. There is also a detailed budget breakdown that provides details on exactly where the requested funds would be allocated. This helps the readers of this proposal to visualize how this is going to look and will make sure that the team utilizes these funds properly.

There are a couple of concepts that may suggest an even more successful route for the project. The first idea is transparency. The team at Gimbalabs and ledger should be completely open with their community of this proposal. If the team hasn't provided this information yet, this could help the auditing process. This is because it allows trust to be built within the community members. Once there is trust, there can be a great deal of accountability that will influence the project positively. In this case, the community will help the team reach their milestones as suggested in their roadmap and promote hard work to get the onboarding course out in public.

Since it will allow all Cardan Dapps users to add another layer of security when putting their assets to work in different smart contracts.\n \nFinally, this proposal is well aligned with the objectives of this challenge.\n \nFor these three rationales, I see no reason to deduct any point in this category, so the Impact score is the maximum.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This is the category in which this proposal shines.
