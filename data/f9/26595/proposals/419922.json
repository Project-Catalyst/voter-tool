You have clearly defined the tasks that need to be done in each specific time period. The budget is calculated based on the number of working months, the amount per month. But it would be great if you split the budget even more. By determining the number of hours worked, the amount paid per hour. This will make the budget a lot more transparent.

Or apply any technology of the Cardano ecosystem? Let's be clear, this is the core of the project.\nRegarding the risk that sales channels have not yet accepted the application of web3 technology to their site, the project has a mitigation plan, I would like to add a few options such as starting to connect with small websites. locally, plan to clearly analyze the competitive advantages they have to help attract customers, and partner with third-party code audits to verify transparency with them and their customers. their goods\nThose are my little suggestions.

Regarding months 1, 2, and 3, the project should focus more on technical construction for web3, this is an important process for the project to be successful. Web3 really needs to combine many elements to form, from construction, design, and programming. At the same time, in the final months, months 5, and 6, there should be an additional step of code review from a neutral 3rd party. Make the launch more smooth, help increase transparency, and create peace of mind for users and customers. Things that are directly related to personal wallets should all be specifically audited.

This solution can solve the problem of the challenge. The main challenge of the project was to get early adopters of e-commerce to develop Web3 digital strategies in their online sales funnel.

It is recommended to articulate the problem like there is a real world situation that needs improvement (i.e. Lack of use of web3 features (NFT) for the e-commerce platforms for the goal to increase customers' retention and gratification). It seems that the solution is to create some sort of add-on for the e-commerce platforms and with the help of NFTs to create unique (exclusively) experiences for the users in demand for some products/services.\n\nThe goal of this project and the KPI/metrics align well with the Campaign settings. However the impact is difficult to be assessed as isn't clear if there are to be used the tools and features of the Cardano ecosystem (the NFTs are minted on Cardano blockchain? is there any use of ADA? etc.)\n\nI rate this sections with 3 stars.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "I will start first with the presented roadmap. It seems that the development phase of the product will last for 5 months, and in the 6th month it will be released to the public and each month has a to do list for that is to be done. From what I see in this list, there is no mention regarding the interaction with the Cardano blockchain. In the presentation of the solution there is a statement about \"wallet connect\" but in the roadmap there is nothing to point to this direction and also nothing related to what the use of NFTs means in terms of programming/developing. Another concern is about the integration of \"plug and play script\" into the various e-Commerce platforms that are available. How the cross-platform functionality is assured? For how many platforms? Is there a need for SC development?\n\nThe proposer is well known for the platform cardanofeed.com which has a lot of visibility to the community. The team seems to have 4 members and there are enough info to emphasize their skills and experience but unfortunately none of them has the necessary programming skills for developing on Cardano. Even there is a mention of additional resources to be hired (\"a bank of technical professionals\") is still unclear if there is a profesionist specialized in developing Cardano dapps.\n\nThe requested budget of $48600 is broken down into items, and some of them need clarifications (what is the purpose of \"Comercial Executive\"? what is the output for the \"Marketing Budget\"? - stationery, advertising?) It is recommended to have each budget item (where possible) as a hourly rate multiplied by an estimation of working hours, thus the community to have a clear view. Because of this, it is somehow difficult to assess if the requested budget is reasonable or not to achieve the set goals.\n\nRegarding the risks that are to be taken into consideration the proposer makes the following statement: \"We believe that there will be no risk from cryptocurrency users, as many already understand the operation of Web3 wallets and the use of NFTs\" which is fundamentally wrong, as there are a lot of risks associated with the use of crypto assets (most hacks occur due to the poorly written/implemented SCs for third party interaction). The proposer should reconsider the risks that can put in jeopardy the implementation of this proposal. An audit of the released code con help to mitigate some of the potential risks.\n\nThe proposer should explain what technologies and programming languages are to be used for this project (FE/BE development - JS, Java, PHP?  - or any other relevant info)\n\nI rate this sections with 3 stars.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The roadmap has to show also what integration with the Cardano blockchain means and which are the milestones and deliverables to be achieved for this essential part. (wallet integration, NFT use etc.)\n\nThere is a list of KPIs with some numerical values as set targets. What is unclear, the needed period of time to achieve these numbers (1 month, 3 months or more?). Having monthly targets and increase them over time, as the adoption of the dapp grows, is a better way to measure the success of this proposal.\n\nThe main communication channel will be cardanofeed.com where progress reports will be posted. For the technical part (script source code) maybe is better to have a specialized channel on GitHub or any other related platform for the community to audit the progress of this proposal\n\nI rate this sections with 3 stars.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2336", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "The NFTs as the future of e-commerce.
