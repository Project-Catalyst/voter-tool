The proposal presents a pleasant read on the possibility. One such example is like the following comment in the proposal \u201c reviewer is independent of a news outlet their incentive is not to maximize the reach of a news article so they can be as honest as they like\u201d these are excellent features to have and can open up new ways of generating valid reviews with inherent compensation for the reviews.

The proposal has been broken into four phases of one-month development each of which seems reasonable and doable. He has about 15 years of experience in their related field and the breakdown of the complex subject in the proposal and in the white paper is fairly self-explanatory which presents the clarity of the idea in the proposer's mind.

There is a scope to quantify the 480 hours of development. The proposer will be hiring one or two others with experience in business development and building engineering teams to create a sustainable business plan including engineering and marketing teams. The rest is for hosting charges for the infrastructure for 12 months. The rates are reasonable and the costs are justified. The return and sustainability of the project are issues. The proposer has also recently received a micro-grant from IPFS to sustain development of a prototype and expects to get more fund to launch the proposal in a full-scale sustainable model.

Legacy institutions combine many (if not all) of these branches into one company with aligned financial incentives\nThis proposal is clear, complete and concrete, based on IPFS and Cardano blockchain, guarantees solidity in deliverables, support transparency and accountability for all Cardano community.

The hype over the truth and the lack of neutral third-party reviews reduce trust in the news. The team is working on a solution to partially solve that by using the IPFS protocol and blockchain to create an immutable, verifiable publication history, from which to select the right article content.\nIt is very good if this proposal, the IPFS protocol is implemented on the Cardano blockchain. We know the journalism industry has many problems, but this proposal reduces negative issues and increases positivity and consumer interest in this field. Therefore, when deployed with the Cardano blockchain, it promises to add value to the Cardano ecosystem. Such is the dramatic impact of this proposal on the Cardano blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem. In addition, the proposal can scale and explain the future challenge of journalism. The opportunity to apply the practice of development in modern society is too great - because the society cannot do without the press at any time, the proposal can completely scale up and solve the problem. challenges - there is plenty of room to continue to grow and expand. I strongly agree with the impact of the proposal, I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I realize that the author has many years of experience working in the media industry, documentaries, software development, etc\u2026 The author has also provided sufficient arguments to explain the problem, and documents related to the proposal. (website, github, videos,...). I am very pleased to see the member's identities disclosed directly on the proposal via the social network link (Twitter), this makes it convenient for the community to look up the members' identities. and verify the feasibility of the proposal and further confirm the author's credibility. The core team member count as I understand it to be 1 person - the same author of the proposal, and the author is looking for more members/contributors?\nThe budget is presented in detail, fully and reasonably with the target. I am very pleased when the author lists in detail how to calculate labor as hourly wages - this calculation is very common in businesses today. By listing the details of the work associated with the budget, the author's professionalism and meticulous attention to the balance sheet can be demonstrated, through which the community can strengthen more confidence in the feasibility of the project. examination of the proposal. The fact that the author presents the budget as it is, makes it easy for everyone from the community (who are very new - they don't know anything about the author and this proposal) to easily. That's my take on the budget. If Fund 9 has not been funded by Catalyst, does the author intend to implement the proposal? Does the author have any other funding sources to implement this proposal? (can be mobilized from other organizations)\nThe plan and implementation method have been stated by the author step by step in a certain order, meticulous and detailed for each small job. Through this, the feasibility of the proposal can be assessed to some extent. It may indicate enthusiasm in the presentation of the author's proposal. I am very pleased with the meticulousness and detail because it is a way for the community to increase confidence in the feasibility of the proposal.\nHere, I consider the necessary resources for implementation, I divide them into two main resources, which are financial resources (mentioned in the above budget) and human resources. Regarding human resources, the author is professional and experienced. As shared, the author does not make another proposal in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9. This ensures that human resources are not dispersed, and the author is completely focused on implementing this proposal. This is also one of the factors contributing to confirming the feasibility of the proposal. I understand the author is looking for other members/contributors to work together. In the unlikely event, that the author has to deal with a personal matter, will this proposal be delayed? Therefore, I think the author should demonstrate to the community that even though there are currently members implementing other proposals, human resources are still fully guaranteed for the successful implementation of this proposal. It is the best way to create more trust in the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal. If you can do so, then the author has made sure that there are abundant human resources to implement this proposal and affirms the author's belief and most importantly, the feasibility of the proposal to the community. For this proposal to be implemented successfully, in my opinion, it needs the participation of many members, not just one person. In terms of technique, technology and language used when implementing the proposal. This is a collection of high-tech technologies: Blockchain Cardano, smart contracts, cloud, IPNS, DAO, etc\u2026 I think the author is very professional and good at listing technical jobs. so. If the author intends to release NFT, then I strongly support it. NFT is not only a representation of the professional meaning of the proposal but also a way to promote the event and the author's brand to the community. It represents the application of the world's cutting-edge technology to the author's work. In addition, my advice is that the author quickly finds a few partners to work with while mobilizing external support to propose the best possible way. Support here is understood not only in terms of money but also in terms of human resources, and technology\u2026 from experts\u2026 I believe that the author will do a great job when implementing the technical and technological aspects into the project. implementation of the proposal.\nIn terms of risks when implementing the proposal, the author also states quite clearly the risks that may be encountered when implementing this proposal: (1) Failing to build the large team needed for the entire scope of work. vi of this project; (2) Not enough traction to have a large user base - accompanied by adequate solutions to hedging risks. I am satisfied with the risk and remedy that the author offers. Here, I add a third risk: Ada slippage - will affect the budget of the proposal. We know that the digital currency market is in hibernation (devaluation of digital currencies), so Ada may depreciate when I receive from Catalyst fund, then I will face the problem of lack of budget to implement the proposal. So my advice would be for the author to take a close look at Ada's budget related to slippage to make the budget requirements in the proposal appropriate.\nThose are my positive comments, the author can consider and adjust for this proposal. I agree with the feasibility of the proposal. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The roadmap of the proposal is presented in quite detail, lasting for 4 months with important milestones divided by month. This is a reasonable roadmap and milestone for a proposal that takes time to implement. The work steps to be performed in each stage are very specific and in a step-by-step sequence - containing all the necessary information. However, I still advise the author to attach the milestone roadmap to specific months of the year (January, February,... - this is just an example). If so, it will make it easier for the community to evaluate the transparency and auditability of the proposal. As a PA, I have evaluated several proposals and have found that not many teams do this.\nI don't feel satisfied without the presence of job performance indicators (KPIs) and key metrics. The author needs to look more carefully and specifically to come up with KPI criteria and key metrics. We all know the role of KPIs and key metrics in auditing. I consider KPIs to play a specific role in demonstrating the transparency and auditability of the proposal. So my advice is to quickly add KPIs and key metrics to the proposal. By doing that, this proposal will have higher transparency and auditability.\nI think the author defines \"what the success of this project looks like\" in a way that is clear, very real, and easy to understand: Creating a world that trusts more journalism; Information disseminated on the internet will be standardized; Link decay will be reduced to near zero; The fact-checking and review process is more in line with the scientific process. I agree with the author's definition of such success.\nThroughout the proposal, problems and solutions were clearly described.

There's nothing interesting or new or special about that. Arguably, it's painfully redundant. Honestly, it's made me a little jaded about these proposals and so I've been a tough critic in assessing them in previous funds.\n\nBut I have to give this proposer credit, in that at least he's trying to use the tech Cardano is based on to innovate, and leverage the power of innovation to enhance the quality of information people receive through media. That's a real new product, something unique that the Cardano community could sell. And that makes it something special.

But since, again, the proposer is upfront that this is the phase in which he will be seeking business/engineering expertise and using budget funds to do so, this should not be a huge problem *so long as the proposer engages very proactively with the community while progress is being made on these fronts*.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It's good that progress on this will be open to the public.

Less? \n\nForcing oneself to fit a schedule can be an intimidating prospect, but it does much for your proposal because it shows a willingness to work toward meeting commitments.

The product behind the proposal supports the open source character of Cardano and can have a positive impact on the product portfolio of the blockchain. \nCompetitor:\nNo Competitors are mentioned in the proposal.

Consulting cost could be calculated with more costs especially for expert jobs like engeneering. My experience as a consultant is that we usually start with 800$ a day but this can easily double with more experience. Therefore the proposer should calculate more conservative. An open point with the budget would be the 10% margin that is mentioned. If this is meant as a profit margin I would doubt that this should be founded. The proposer should think about taking this part out of the calculation to give the community the feeling to not fund somebodies wealth but to fund their work. Nevertheless all costs are transparent and this can be seen as a positive point over all.  \nMotivation/drivers:\nThe proposer shows a lot of passion in his idea and sets out reasons why this product is important for him and the world. This can be seen as a motivation and driver of the project next to building a sustainable product that will give the proposer the chance to live of (as fuure transactions will incentivise the development team). This profit thinking can also be seen as a motivation.\nTeammembers and experience:\nAs there is only one person in the team right now there is also only limited experience.
