The space demands easier ways for blockchain enthusisasts to own NFTs", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 3.611111111111111, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1653, "q0": "The proposal theoretically aligns with the objectives of the challenge. I say this because a game based on NFTs would be developed, which would increase the number of active tokens being minted on our blockchain - which corresponds to one of the specific objectives of the challenge. A Dapp would be developed, in this case a game (it is not very clear whether it would be for web or mobile devices), and in addition to increasing the number of NFTs, new digital wallets would also be created, so that users could trade the active tokens and carry out payments, as I understand it (it is also not so clear if the tokens would be paid in Ada, but I believe so). Naturally, the game would attract new members to our community, we know that the gamer community is very extensive and active, and by bringing interesting projects, we would be attracting new people who were not necessarily interested in the blockchain universe, but in games. Regarding the game itself, what is understood is that it would be a battle game, inspired by games like Clash of Clans, Age of Empire and Diablo, according to the proponents. The game would be play-to-win, which is quite interesting, as people are quite attracted to the idea of \u200b\u200bprofiting through fun. It would be a world (Kingdom of Pangea) in which players would build fortresses, buildings and training units, and from what is understood the objective would be to venture through different kingdoms, battle and conquer new territories, with each territory having the name \u201cLord Protector\u201d, which would be the strongest commander, and players could, through diplomacy, become Lords of different units. Although the idea is in theory perfect, I have some observations to make. Firstly regarding the following excerpt: \u201cPangea Kingdom will educate traditional integration players about non-fungible tokens and decentralized exchanges until it becomes common knowledge in all traditional games. The method will increase transactions within the Cardano Ecosystem.\u201d How would this education be done, as new players, who have never had contact with the blockchain universe before, would learn about these technologies? This point would need to be made clearer. Would there be any tutorials in video form, or for example, would there be any professional users who would be available to help beginners, perhaps? As some sort of team member who gets delegated to that specific role? Another point that worries me is when the proponent states that \u201cwe are mainly affected by 3 reasons, as we are an initial team, lack of adequate funds for marketing and general misunderstandings about NFT technology\u201d. It is quite worrying when they say that they have no domain over NFT technology. When reading the descriptions of the team members, in the topic of feasibility, I conclude that no one has experience with this, in fact. So how will this problem be mitigated? The proponent already points to a resolution to the marketing issue, but the difficulty in dealing with NFT technology is still open, generating concern. Therefore, I think that the proposal can generate a good impact for Cardano, but some points should be better clarified.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The viability of the project has strengths and weaknesses, and some issues should be reviewed, so that the safety in the development of the project is better guaranteed. Starting with the script analysis, the main problem observed here is the lack of a better determined temporal notion. We know that the project development time is divided into quarters of the year 2022, and each of them has a list of activities that would be developed. It would be important for these activities to be better situated in time. For example, in Q2, many things will happen (landpack sale, team expansion, v2 site, seed and private sale, market development, source development and etc). It would be necessary for us to understand in which months each one of them is planned to occur, so that we have a more solid understanding of the organization of this process. In addition, some activities deserved to be better explained, with a more intense level of detail. For example, in the first quarter of the year, the announcement of the project would be made: where? With which strategies would the target audience be reached? In terms of organic community growth, how would that goal be achieved? On \u201cpartnerships\u201d: with whom do they intend to establish these partnerships, how would the partners be selected and how would this bridge be built? In the third quarter, a \u201cfree land merger event for event winners\u201d would be held. Would this event be online, in person? How would event attendees be encouraged to be a part of this moment, in what month of the year would it take place, exactly? The fourth quarter is the one that needed improvement the most, as all that is said is that a \u201cmerge feature\u201d would be done; but it is not clear, at least to me, what this is and how it would happen. Talking about the budget, a similar thing happens: we know in a basic way how the 25 thousand dollars would be spent, but each part could be better justified. How would the marketing campaign be executed and why would it cost $4,000? What would be the works of art that cost 6 thousand dollars? It would be interesting for them to better detail how the work to develop 3D game assets would be, since this is the most expensive part of the project, as well as the work routines (how much time these professionals would dedicate to the project) of the developers. Finally, speaking of the team, a certain trust is passed because we know many details about each person involved, such as their resumes, what they have done so far in their professional lives and so on. However, it is worrying (as I already commented on the impact) that we do not have any members experienced with NFT technology or Cardano. In my opinion, it would be necessary for at least one person to be more knowledgeable about these matters, so that we could be sure that the work would be done correctly and as planned.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From the information that is provided, I believe that progress monitoring will be done properly. It is said that the Agile methodology would be used (it would be very positive for the proponent to better understand how this methodology works, I have heard about it in other proposals, but perhaps some CAs or voters do not have any prior knowledge about it). It is also said that the tasks would be organized by the Gantz chart (again, explanations about this chart would be welcome). Proponents claim that many tools would be used to track the steps, such as GitBook, GitHub, Titan Email and Trello; and that progress reports would be made weekly. The question that remains is: how would all this information, so diverse, reach our community? From what I understand, the tools would be accessible to all members of the Cardano community, but it would be interesting if a summary was made monthly and posted on one of these communication channels (for example, on Trello, a session could be created with \u201csummaries monthly\u201d to summarize the main updates). I say this because there are many projects in progress in the ecosystem, so it would be very positive if we had a general picture that showed what is most important at the end of each month. However, it is very well assured that the Cardano community would have several ways to monitor the progress of the phases, so this part is very satisfying. Talking about the final success, on the other hand, I thought this part was pretty abstract. We know what the ideal scenario is (\u201ccreating a safe community where players can socialize, play and store value in NFT assets / celebrate diversity and create a melting pot where people from different cultures can interact and understand each other\u201d). But how could we measure the success of this game, specifically, and the consequences of the project for Cardano? Speaking first of all about the game: it would be necessary for the bidder to suggest tangible metrics and KPIs, such as the number of CNFTs generated and minted, amount of Ada that would be circulating from the purchase and sale of these tokens, number of active users, amount of created meetings, etc. In addition, it would be interesting to study some more qualitative aspects, such as the satisfaction of these users, how much time they spend playing per day and how they have evolved within their missions, that is, if the engagement is being as expected. And, in order to understand how all this impacted Cardano, I believe the main question to be analyzed would be whether these players started to get involved with other community activities, that is: now that they know and understand what blockchain is and its ramifications, are they participating in other Cardano projects, whether games or not? Are they participating in Catalyst? How did the game contribute to the popularization of Cardano, specifically? I think the auditability was very good in the first part, but in the second part, it deserves a reformulation to make it more adequate.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 2535, "q0": "The game presented in this project is an example of a play-to-earn game incorporating Cardano NFTs as a basis of proof of ownership of different assets on the game. The game is inspired by multiple popular games like Battle Royal and Diablo. There is a real potential for this game to be a great added value for our ecosystem. The project also aligns with the challenge's guidelines since the product is integrated natively with the Cardano blockchain.  Furthermore, the team makes it clear that they aim to make this game a global one where everyone can participate and express themselves and take social impact to the core of the project. Finally, the ability to scale for such projects is definitely significant since such games are starting to gain worldwide reactions, especially with the latest hard fork coming such transaction-heavy projects will be working smoother than ever. On the other hand, I would have appreciated seeing more planning or structured details on ways to increase the game's impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team as described seems balanced and suitable as a bootstrap for such project, but I was unable to confirm the information given about the team members since no relevant links were given and nothing popped up on the internet. Furthermore, no Github repos were shared which would have been useful to at least showcase the team's expertise in relevant areas. The team presents a quarterly roadmap with different goals to achieve, but again these goals are often than not broad and doesn't showcase what exactly be worked on in terms of infrastructure and development. The budget seems fair for what needs to be done and is divided between multiple needs of the project i.e Website refinement, development,...\nThe risks mentioned remain a bit scarse, I appreciate the mentioning of guerilla tactics in marketing which would be useful for an underfunded nascent team that is yet to prove its value and perhaps bring an MVP to the market that will help investors feel more comfortable with onboarding.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "While the team mentioned being involved in Discord and being accountable to the community every single step of the way, it remains ambiguous how can the community really audit the development of the project, especially since the nature of the project is sensitive to leaks and code can not just be shared openly with the community. Furthermore, The quarterly milestones in the roadmap are significant, but what would have been better is to specify exactly what one can expect in every milestone by mentioning forecast numbers. This would have helped the community manage expectations and judge the project's development more fairly. At this stage, I believe the project might need more time to refine its proposal and work a bit more on its roadmap and accountability data points. Also, sharing more links to the team members and past projects would help us have more confidence in the project and recommend it for funding.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2317", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4463, "q0": "Creating a game with Cardano NFTs that is made by experienced Unreal game engine developers and has appealing looks and great gameplay on a budget would be an incredible and very worthwhile undertaking. I am sure that this would create some publicity and attract new users to Cardano. Showcasing that Project Catalyst can be used to bootstrap an ambitious game development project outside the big studios by a team of proposers from Nigeria would be something I would love to see, and consider highly impactful and aligned with the challenge's goal of boosting user adoption, user experience and integration of blockchain and real world use such as gaming.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The sample work and Youtube teasers are promising and the team have extensive experience with the Unity game engine, and have worked on similar (off-chain) projects before.\nIt is great to learn that the team \"collaborate(s) using tools such as GitBook, GitHub, Titan Email, and Trello\" but it would have been nice to see links, screenshots of examples to underpin this claim. The Gitbook link works well and shows some promising video examples and a lot of background about world building and player experience (\"Lore and Storytelling\").\nI personally find it hard to believe that the budget (which could have been broken down into more granularity) and the game launch in the third quarter of this year are realistic targets, so it would have helped me better if this would have been framed as a \"pre-alpha\" or community-project or some wording like this, or some more explanation about the size and quality at launch. \nIn general, this project is presented with fairly good detail, but given how difficult it is to make quality games, I would have liked to see this question answered in more depth.\nThe likelihood of this project being launched successfully is quite high given that the teasers and gitbook are already there and quite promising, but given the timeline and budget may not be called a full game.
