Based on ADAO's existing experience working with the Fracada smart contracts they will create a web interface for the simple use of the contracts and charge a fee to the end user that will be send to the treasury for ADAO to sustain their open source development. The value of this application is that it will make the fractionalising of NFTs accessible to the average user in Cardano and give them more options on how to hold or sell their existing NFTs using this service. The team mention the risks of smart contracts for this proposal. The proposers could have added more details on some example use cases for this application apart from a more obvious example of splitting up a high value NFT to share ownership. A few examples would have given more confidence in how this may be used by different groups of users and then also the risk of adoption could also be mentioned on whether these use cases have much demand. Overall there is definitely value making these smart contracts and functionality more accessible to the wider community to see how it gets used.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In terms of the roadmap for this project there are already a number of items already completed. The team is now completing off-chain development work that leverages Lucid before then doing a test-net and main-net release planned for August completion. The progress list is sufficient however could have added more depth on what is involved in these steps. The budget breakdown gives hourly time estimates for each of tasks involved which then is used to create the final total cost. The values seem to be fair. No mention of UI/UX and design work is mentioned which would have been good to see as this is focussed for the average end user. Three team members are listed on the proposal that are involved with ADAO, no professional links were provided which would have been useful.

Success for this proposal is defined as the effective implementation with sustained use in the community. The proposers mention other community members who have been interested in this application. It would have been good to mention these in some more detail in the impact section to cover their use cases as mentioned before - this would have added clarity to the assessor and voter.

It\u2019s almost flawless from the first section to the third one. The manner you describe your proposed project is explicit with enough information, including what products your dApps will launch, their main characteristics/functions, target audience and what benefits they will gain. Students are exactly a wise choice! Moreover, this proposal deserves to be commended because of its clarity in key metrics. Your given key metrics are completely \u201csynchronized\u201d with the challenge. Your description of how the project will address the Challenge is very convincing. More reliably, the risks accompanied with methods to mitigate are presented clearly and appropriately. I don\u2019t find any errors in this section.

These three people who work on your project appear to have seasoned experience in their field which is relevant to your project, and I believe these members are capable of pushing the project\u2019s progress easily thanks to their good talents.

Finally, what the success of your project will look like is comprehensible and promising. Admittedly, a low cost browser app (under 5ADA) which is open source and easily accessible is never a bad idea since everyone loves this.
