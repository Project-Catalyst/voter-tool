However, the proposers have failed to provide a budget that reflects the detailed plan. This is unfortunate since the team is credible and proposes a very feasible project in all other aspects. The team is experienced and they seem to have a clear path to success, therefore it should not be a complex task to provide a detailed budget and more explicitly stated tasks related to each phase.\nThe proposal is feasible but the lack of a budget must be considered, as a result, the score will be neutral. 3 points.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers state that they will deliver KPIs with measurables when the project has started.

There are 3 layers: app layer, social layer and data layers. This network effect of all digital experiences under one roof where data access is controlled by each user is although visionary and scalable, it is still relatively hard to imagine in term of execution as it has many moving components and might be more suitable to focus on either one use case (that the proposer sense the most impact) to work on before scaling to other app areas.
