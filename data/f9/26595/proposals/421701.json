This is an essential component of DeFi on a smart contract platform and will hugely increase TVL in DeFi dApps. Smart contract risk is identified as a key threat, however, the NETA community fund helps to offset this risk. They haven't received any funding from VCs and there has been no ICO. As far as I know the only funding they have received is from NFT sells, their stake pool and, I expect, market sells of the token. There have been many generous airdrops to the community with a effort at wide distribution. All of these things make this a great community project. As a user of DeFi on Ergo and Cardano, I hope this proposal gets funded. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The teams seems solid. They have proven to be competent with the successful launch of their Aneta Angels NFTs on Cardano and Ergo.

AnetaBTC\u2019s product design therefore checks all of the boxes for this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team bios are strong and imply ability to deliver.\n\nThe team has already established a strong track record of success:  1) a vibrant community with decentralized ownership of the protocol and a growing treasury of community owned funds to backstop the project 2) success in building toolkits which will support the cross-chain nature of the project.  3) A almost year long track record of openness on progress, development and transparency when things didn\u2019t turn out as expected.\n\nThis track record implies that they are very likely to be able to get to completion.  The biggest risk factor is funding through an extended bear market.  Enabling BTC to migrate to and from Cardano is clearly in the ecosystem\u2019s interest, thus using a portion of Catalyst Community funds to support this project to completion by backstopping their funding makes sense, and makes completion highly likely.

These steps, both short and long term look to be easily auditable as well as value created can be assessed both in amount of BTC trade facilitated, as well as amount of treasury and fee value accrued which will be majority owned by the Cardano Community.\n\nAn additional note here on auditing value accrued is this project decided not to take VC funds, and instead has focused on grass roots ownership.  Thus using Catalyst community funds, primarily will benefit the Cardano Community as a whole, and not VCs.

Looking across the entire cryptocurrency space, BTC has the highest liquidity locked into it. By liquidity, I mean funds locked/invested into a particular asset. Blockchain are designed to accommodate Interoperability between themselves thereby allowing movement of assets from one blockchain to another without necessarily liquidating/losing hold of that particular asset. By so doing, liquidity can be safely utilized across chains without necessarily liquidating the main asset (Just unlock value of same asset on another blockchain). Currently, Cardano has the limitations of unlocking BTC liquidity for users in Cardano. However, AnetaBTC objectively seeks to solve these bottleneck by building a wrapped BTC product protocol that allow users to seamlessly unlock BTC value on Cardano in a fully decentralised way and onchain without the need of a third party custodian. These will allow BTC holders to participate in multiple DEFI options available in Cardano, bring BTC holders into Cardano and increase overall tvl for Cardano itself as a blockchain.

The budget is in my understanding centered around offsetting the teams running cost (salaries, paying developers) for the next 5months (seems fair) but I'm still a bit concerned as team mentioned at the end that the budget is so that they can launch the protocol on Ergo mainnet and not on Cardano (My question is why we (Cardano community) should fund a development on Ergo and not Cardano).
