Currently no such NFT marketplace exists. Artist will be able select which causes they wish to support with their art and buyers can invest in NFTs (art, music, poetry, etc...) knowing that with each purchase they are also contributing to a charitable cause.\n\nSocial, environmental and charitable organizations will receive a designated revenue on every transaction. They can also feature their favorite content creators on their own sites to encourage donations to their cause through NFT purchases and even launch their own NFT collections. Because of blockchain technology, the NFT marketplace offers a way to establish transparency and trackability to donations towards any social service project.\n\nThe proposal lists the benefits to the artists/content creators, the buyers and charitable organizations. It is in line with this particular challenge by bringing more adoption in a creative way to the Cardano ecosystem. It will provide incentive and added sentiment to NFT purchasers, create cooperation between artists and charitable organizations, and onboard these organizations who may not have heard or seen a need for blockchain technology before.\n\nThe proposers will also partner with Block Carbon (previously funded proposer) to calculate carbon offsets for each project and sell the resulting Carbon Credits.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The presenter has laid down a detail plan to implement the project in three phases of 3 months each. The first phase is the creation and testing of the NFT marketplace. The second phase is marketing, and the third phase is dedicated to administration and client services. \n\nA comprehensive budget is given and broken down for the different phases and work needed for the completion of the project. It seems reasonable but I do have a question regarding the $8,000 dedicated to creating a video documentary on how the entire process was done. Although it would be informative to have a video progress report, I do not however think it is necessary for the project's success. It is almost like a separate project in itself, and uses a large chunk of the budget, this is why I am giving 4 stars for feasibility. I would also suggest the team consider talking with existing Cardano NFT marketplaces and see if any of them are willing to create a whitelabeled marketplace.\n \nThe team consist of experienced members that can undoubtedly see this project through with backgrounds in Cardano, AI, blockchain, software development, logistics, team leadership, business, marketing, content creation, project management, social service, philanthropy, volunteering, amongst much more.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Once the NFT marketplace has been created, then the KPIs can easily be audited and measured by the number of causes, content creators and clients onboarded. Statistics like number of NFTs created per month and number of NFTs per cause will also be available.\nHowever I am giving 4 stars for the auditability of this project as there is nothing in place to follow the progress of the project before it becomes active. Perhaps the presenters could create a page that will provide updates on the progression of the project during the first phase and the marketing phase (for example, where and when it was advertised).\n\nAs an artist myself, and having volunteered my time for many charitable projects,I would love to see this proposal manifest. It has a lot of potential to help artists and altruistic organizations alike.

It creates a marketplace for creators who want to share their creations with the ones who need and help their social, environmental, and charitable causes. Therefore, it could be seen that in terms of the field of this project, this project is totally aligned with the types of proposals that this challenge is looking for. That are solutions that help to solve environmental issues. It listed the problem now is that NFTs are mainly based on artwork and there is a whole lot of creativity that is still not fully exploited to bring into NFT space. And this solution suggested a solution that can improve that point. The proposal clearly mentioned how the system works. One good point about this proposal is that it explained the benefit that all related parties will receive and especially how it will benefit the blockchain community as well. Because this project is related to the environment, people will be encouraged to possess meaningful NFTs and ultimately increase the number of people joining the blockchain ecosystem. Especially, it explained how this project will have a certain impact specifically on the whole development of the Cardano ecosystem as well. Thanks to the huge publicity for the Cardano blockchain on social media, more people will know about the Cardano ecosystem and raise awareness of how beneficial this ecosystem is. From that, more people may get involved. It also listed the criteria to measure the impact of this project, but it should add specific figures so that it could be clearer and more measureable. It listed two main challenges when it comes to executing this project. The first one is related to Covid making it impossible for content creators to go to their studios and do the content creation. The second one is related to the volatility of ADA may lead to a shortage of budget due to the rapid decrease of ADA value and also the time to convert ADA into local currencies is long leading to the late implementation of the project.

Having said that, this plan was supported by some requirements needed and some requirements that are not compulsory to have in terms of functions of the system when executing this plan. This is a good point to see just like the result for the plan that it should achieve. Another good point is here that it also included a marketing plan for this project.
