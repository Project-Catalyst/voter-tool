It is therefore falling under the direction of the challenge setting for \"Nation governance systems\" and makes good use of the funding category as there is currently no dedicated DID/SSI category in this Fund. The neighborhood of Uzupis in downtown Vilnius has a population of only about 7000 and is 60 hectares in size, but anyone can declare themselves a \"citizen\", making it therefore an interesting and also challenging place for DID that can benefit easily from an online blockchain solution. \nWhat started as an April Fool's joke in 1997 has become a somewhat serious project in a free-spirited commune and a source of local pride as well as a tourist attraction. How does this address the challenge setting? I think that it may provide a useful testbed for digital identity where serious cryptographic and governance trade-offs in identity management on the blockchain can be experimented with free of potentially serious unintended consequences that could occur in more serious real world use cases like providing the undocumented or unrecognized states in conflict with more powerful \"neighbors\" with DID. The project may even make some publicity waves and draw more attention to the strengths of Cardano and the Atala PRISM product suite in identity issuance and management. Thereby, this relatively humble project could indeed improve on existing off-chain solutions (currently the \"city hall\" of Uzupis is in a pub) and create a blueprint for more serious and critical applications later on. The ecosystem would be enriched with an interesting use case, and we will be better prepared for positive and negative outcomes or publicity this may entail without taking any serious risk of capital or lives.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer is a Stake Pool Operator, Software Developer, Veteran Proposal Assessor and Atala PRISM Pioneer, and will mostly work alone on this project but hire (I assume part-time) development support in Kotlin and UX design. It would have made this proposal even stronger to see either a resume or LinkedIn profile of the proposer, or see some homework or project maybe a work sample Github link from the Atala PRISM Pioneer program or link to previous DID work to assure the voter that the skillsets necessary to carry this task successfully indeed exist. The timeline of the proposal is detailed and clear, with initial research and communication tasks later giving way to implementation via issuance of credentials, but maybe the proposer could have added some more information about how the website will come together over time and how exactly would-be-citizens of Uzupis can learn about and join this project. Overall, the information provided gives me confidence that the project can be implemented successfully and that the time and budget will be sufficient.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The Auditability of this project should have received more attention when sharing the details about this proposal, as it remains unclear to voters or auditors of this project how a potentially very exciting project will be carried out towards the end result of a hopefully working website that implements DID in the real world. That the proposal states as its main goal the \"hosting of workshops about SSI/DID/Atala PRISM in 6 months\" is disappointing to me, as I was hoping that the DID for Uzupis are serious enough to take that role. When proposing more light-hearted proposals that could provide useful lessons for bigger, more serious use cases later on, it is in my opinion important to \"pretend\" that the trial use case is as real as any successive large scale implementation to get the feedback and learn the lessons applicable to such. Otherwise the \"sandbox\" character as a powerful tool for experimentation could be blunted. I recommend that when communicating the progress and outcome of this proposal back to the community, sufficient attention will be given to the actual collection of applications and customer care for the credential recipients served.\nThe proposer presents a few quantifiable performance metrics or KPIs under Feasibility, such as 200+ credentials issued after 6 months, and I have assessed this 3 out of 5 stars rating taking into account those numbers, which should work well in that regard. Do not hesitate to put this kind of information in twice, as it makes it easier for both proposal assessors and voters to easily gain the insights they are looking for in the appropriate places.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 4, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 3645, "q0": "The proposal seeks to implement self-sovereign identities (SSI) using Cardano PRISM in the micro-nation of Uzupis, a neighborhood in Lithuania. The author explains that to become a citizen of this micro-nation a person just has to declare that they are, therefore is a good opportunity to introduce Cardano DID to a small population for experimentation. The proposal is not an exact fit to the challenge it has been presented since it\u2019s not developing a new product or service but one could argue they are integrating an existing technology into the real world. The risk mentioned in the proposal is related to people not warming up to the idea of using decentralized identification or self-sovereign identities. I agree that this is a risk and it should be mitigated by first holding meetings and workshops about blockchain technology and their different applications.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The author of the proposal is John Kasimba Omolo, who claims to be Atala PRISM Pioneer and Software developer although no backing information is provided to verify these claims. He is also a stake pool operator and a veteran community advisor of project catalyst. My main concern here is that from his twitter profile it appears to be based in Kenya, while the project\u2019s location is a neighborhood in Lithuania. It would be valuable to know if John is based in Uzupis at the moment or has plans to stay there for the duration of the project (12 months). Since in my opinion the success of this project will largely depend on being on-site. The timeline and key milestones described provide a reasonable roadmap for the the execution of the project. While the budged breakdown provides the necessary detail of how the funds will be spent.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately the information provided regarding the auditability of the project is very lacking. No KPIs or methedology for tracking and assessing the progress of the project were detailed in the proposal. It only states that every successful milestone can be tracked via the project\u2019s website, although it\u2019s not clear which website this is.

However, I think this proposal should still be written in more detail if possible and specifically summarize what DID is, the benefits and weaknesses of DID, the operating structure of the website, , the project's target audience, and how it will help the development of Cardano.\nAbout the risk, I have a small suggestion that this idea is quite new so users may not trust it much so the proposer can provide more solutions to solve this problem.\n\"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"The project plan is well described with timelines along with proposed tasks.

These values should be verified. Also, the number of hours/month used for the Pilot Project indicates the project will not be the main activity of the team, being a risk for the proposal implementation.\nAbout the team, it is composed of only one person who has software developing experience, however it is not actually a team. Some tasks will be made by third parties, being it another risk to be addressed. I would like to see more people involved on the proposal and with different backgrounds in order to have a more robust team.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "From the auditability perspective, the proposal aims to give publicity on the milestones performed, which is good. They also mention a success would be the hostage of a workshop when their product is a web portal to implement DID for Republic of Uzupis which does not seem appropriate to measure the success of this proposal. They also mention the increase in the adoption of DID would be a measure of success (agree, but they should mention how to measure it).\nOverall, the team needs to improve the auditability plan for the project as it does not sound adequate. I would suggest the inclusion of indicators like number of access to the web portal, number of DIDs issued, number of places accepting the DID from the web portal, and so on.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3872", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 0, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14356, "q0": "The proposer wants to introduce Verifiable Credentials in a district of Vilnius (Lithuania). In my opinion, this is more a marketing idea than a concrete application purpose, as the VC have no deeper use here - except \"Use the membership credentials [...] to enter local community events or purchase art\".\nSpecifically, the purpose is to create educational materials and hold workshops to ultimately issue over 200 VC.\nFrom a pure marketing perspective, I find the idea interesting. However, without a real-world application, it is doubtful that this will be of great benefit to Cardano or the Prism ecosystem.\nFurthermore, the proposer would like to create a \"Verifier mobile app\" for event hosts. This is about half of the budget. I don't see the need for this, as there is already a wallet available (RootsWallet). Since the proposer would also need to commission this app and cannot or will not implement it themselves, I would advise the proposer to focus on training and marketing. I don\u2019t see the need just for a app for events in Vilnius.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The schedule seems realistic, both in terms of providing training and developing the app. The hourly rate was calculated relatively inexpensively at 25 USD/h. Even the external development of the \"Verifier-Mobile\" app can be considered inexpensive at just under 10,000 USD. Somewhat unclear in my view is the other large item \"Fund for creating DID & issuing VC (pilot project)\". What is covered by this? Seemingly neither the marketing, nor the workshops, nor the app, nor project coordination. That could be broken down a bit more clearly.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The milestones of the project are to be published on a project website. Through the workshops that take place, the project can probably be tracked relatively well. However, considering the budget, I would like to see even more transparency here.

The effect this plan will have on the larger environment is where I have trouble with it. The Republic of Uzupis is the main focus of this initiative as it stands, hence it is unclear how the efforts might be applied to other locations or regions. However, this link is not made obvious in the proposal, which instead keeps its focus relatively narrow. One could argue that approval of Cardano DIDs via any type of government authority would be a solid step towards pushing towards mainstream usage. Given that the proposer does not appear to suggest that this is the intention, voters may lack confidence in making this leap. To help voters comprehend the intended effect, I would advise the proposer to make these links clearer across the entire proposal. I am unsure if the project would have an impact because they are now excluded, but it does address the problem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Given the experience and strategy provided, there is a good chance that this suggestion will be carried out successfully. First of all, the proposer does a fantastic job of outlining the major elements of the proposal and offering a thorough road map for how to accomplish them. Voters can readily follow the progress and development milestones by breaking down the strategy in a palatable way. The proposal's main objectives are to create the website gateway for issuing DIDS and to inform potential users. From the creation of the training materials to the hiring of additional staff to aid in the achievement of the end goals, the proposer lays out specific tasks to be performed over the ensuing twelve months. I would have preferred a detailed discussion on the proposal's strategy for recruiting additional team members. Voters may feel confident in the viability of this idea because of the proposer's credentials. The proposer has completed the Atala Prism cohort through IOG in addition to participating in Catalyst as a PA and vPA. As a result, the proposer can get started right away and voters do not have to wait for them to understand these components.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "To assess the status of this proposal, the information supplied is neither sufficient nor insufficient. Both the project website and the proposer's stakepool website will be used to log each milestone, but neither site is made available for voters to verify. There are some measures stated, but the proposer doesn't clearly explain how and to what extent they would be measured. Does holding all six sessions within a year guarantee their success? How many attendees are required? Before you could call the DID a success, how many people would have to embrace it?
