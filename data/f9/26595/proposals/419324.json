The first one is probably the most difficult : identify impact projects (! requires due diligence) and data/oracles that will drive the dynamic of the NFT.

The proposer notes that the first step will require a high level of engagement by the project manager. Overall, the budget is well proven and seems suitable for the development of a PoC.\nWhile the budget breakdown identifies  two people involved, 5 different profiles are listed that will work on the project.

According to the proposer, impact SPOs struggle to attract delegators and keep them engaged and, therefore, offering these dynamic NFTs would be a way to mitigate this problem.\n\nThis aligns with the challenge proposed first because it is a solution to a real problem within the ADA ecosystem and therefore would add a \u201cfunctionality\u201d to it, which improves its competitiveness against other blockchains. Second, because it has the potential to increase the volume of transactions within the environment; and third, if there is a real engagement on the part of the delegators, the social and environmental impact of the SPO will increase and, consequently, the ADA will become more and more the eco and social friendly blockchain.\n\nThe metrics are good, correlated with the success of the PoC \u2013 which creates value for the ADA. As a suggestion, it would be interesting to include project development metrics, so that you can look at it and change the strategy if it is going wrong. As an example, we can talk about the effectiveness of SPO accepted by SPO contacted, or # SPO accepted /# SPO seen. These numbers will reflect whether you are being effective in the engagement discourse and, the second, it can show how rigorous you are in the selection criteria \u2013 is it better to refuse or try to adjust?\n\nSince it's a PoC, there's still plenty of room to review all the decisions made and strategies to improve on the final project. And, as such, there is a lot of room for scalability when running the project. It should be mentioned that for the project step there are no more resource needs. Yes, it would be necessary for the next step.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In order to verify its feasibility, we need to verify the following aspects:\n1 \u2013 roadmap: The roadmap here was delivered divided into 4 major acts and, these, subdivided into scope/task intentions. I missed the tasks being more exploded into smaller tasks, this would make it easier to implement a PDCA, for example. For example, in act 1, the first task is to identify and engage with SPO \u2013 what are the strategies for this, what steps to take, what are your search criteria, etc. Anyway, having some tasks more divided so that it can run easier, without surprises, would be very interesting. Even when talking about the development of the platform there are not many explanations about it.\n\n2 \u2013 budget: The budget requested here cannot be uncorrelated with the tasks, so I understand the divisions made, but, as in the roadmap, I feel that more detail is lacking \u2013 strategies, software, etc. Or are you just going to use working hours?\n\n3 \u2013 team: The entire team is very competent and is made up of all the key areas of development and, in addition, evidence of knowledge and experience has been given. It might be interesting to add a marketing specialist to help with engagement strategies, as it is listed in the tasks.\t\n\n4 \u2013 risk management: Some risks and some actions to mitigate the risks were pointed out. In the first risk, referring to projects without high quality in the data, one can add as a mitigation action (of course it would delay the project) is to give feedback on what is bad and how it should be collected so that the SPO could be accepted. . That way, as much as they might think, they can't wait, but they might be able to.\n\n5 \u2013 self-funding/scalability: Like, the project is still in the PoC reference phase and therefore the funding will come from Catalyst. If there is and is part of the project running, it should be developed for the final and then start to support itself.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "In order to audit, we need:\n1 \u2013 roadmap w/ milestones: Cross-task checkpoints on the roadmap are missing. However, they will provide reports and results as you go through each task, which is very positive.\n\n2 \u2013 Metrics and KPI: Their success metrics are excellent; with them you can even get an idea of the impact they will generate at Cardano. However, partial, developmental metrics are missing, such as: # SPO contacted, # SPO accepted, # SPO that did not have high quality data, etc. This data will reveal some facts of the strategy being used and, in addition, will show the community the team's engagement towards the final development.\n\n3 \u2013 Channel: They will create a channel, however, there is none until now.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2298", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 1, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2842, "q0": "the Dynamic Impact NFT team outlines the reasons and issues for which this proposal is needed, as there is currently active competition to attract the ADA pool of trustees to their share pool, for So the Dynamic Impact NFT team came up with the idea of \u200b\u200bcombining with the owners of the SPO stake, and the authorized people to accept some of their profits to transfer to projects that impact the social environment, along with that issue NFTs as an attractive reward for the trust community,\nhowever the arguments and logic for the proposed solutions are not really convincing, to ensure that this topic will have a great impact on the target direction and the trustee community,\n- the first is about the direction of the group's objectives, in which areas it will have an impact on the environment and society, where management and monitoring are most effective, for example planting trees.

Moreover, as it is still a PoC, the objective would be as well to test such assumptions (e.g.  intererest for Proof of Impact NFT among users of SPO's)"}, {"id": 3359, "q0": "Based on the information provided in the proposal, I think that it addresses the environmental aspect of the DApps, Products, and Integrations challenge setting. The proposal puts a new spin on addressing social and environmental issues by creating dynamic proof of impact NFTs. These NFTs are an incentive for delegators who are already staking in a pool that use a percentage of rewards for projects that create positive social or environmental impact. The NFTs will regularly update as impact metrics are updated, such as number of trees planted or amount of CO2 sequestered. Data oracles would pull information with an API that updates the NFTs.\n\nAccording to the proposers, the NFT creation will lead to more interest in mission-driven stake pools, which will result in more participation in those stake pools. Eventually, Cardano may be able to reach a net-zero emissions and address other concerns through its stake pool ecosystem. Cardano is already a top choice for environmentally friendly users, and having this proposal contribute to more participation in the mission-driven stake pools can make Cardano the top choice out of all blockchains. Also, the secondary market created for the dynamic impact NFTs could be another incentive for people to participate in the stake pools. \n\nThe proposers addressed two big challenges that they may face during the implementation of this proposal. First, there may be a lack of projects with high-integrity data points. This issue will be mitigated by the team members of this proposal who all have past experience in the relevant fields to select the right projects and vet them. Secondly, the dynamic NFTs require accurate data oracles that are fed accurate information. Since there will be some human-entered data, effective monitoring, verification, and reporting (MRV) tools will need to be built by the team. They have the necessary skills to do so, which should mitigate this challenge.\n\nSince I did not have any issue with impact for this proposal, I can give it a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Based on the information provided in this proposal, I think that it can be implemented successfully by the proposers. First, the timeline has been broken down into a 2 month period and a 3 month period. Within the first two months, the proposers will engage with the SPOs to determine the projects selected, the data to be collected by the oracle, and identifying the potential impact stakers. The proposers will also identify the technical requirements for the NFTs, such as how frequently they will update and what platform they will be on. Within the next two months, the NFT infrastructure will be created, the landing page will be created to show stakers the opportunity to earn the NFTs, and the proof-of-concept will be tested and deployed. Within five months of the project being funded, the official NFT system will launch and the proposers plan to do a two-month retrospective using a survey. This timeline seems pretty reasonable since all the tasks are not too difficult. The proposers may need more time for the development of the NFTs, but if they are diligent, then they should be able to complete all tasks on time. \n\nAs for the budget, the proposers provided a very well-broken down budget. There are two main team members for this proposal: a project manager/sustainability analyst and a developer \u2013 the NFT artist is also included, but as a smaller part of the budget that is a one time payment. The project manager has the pay rate of 65 USD/hr and the developer has the rate of 85 USD/hr. The first two phases of the project (engagement with impact SPOs and identification of requirements for the dynamic NFTs) will be more of the project manager\u2019s work, while the last two phases (deployment of infrastructure and launch, monitoring, and future steps) will rely more on the developer. The pay rates were all broken down based on estimated hour workload for each phase (like phase-2 project manager: 25 hours*65 USD =1625 USD), and the total budget for this proposal came out to $18,950. Since everything has been broken down by the hour, except for the NFT artist (who gets $900), I think the budget is reasonable. The number of hours make sense and the pay rates are fair for the work being done.\n\nThe project team has already been working together for over a year, so they understand each other\u2019s work flow. The project designer, Michele Soavi, has 14 years of experience with finance, requirements analysis, blockchain and sustainability. The sustainability metrics lead, Mehul Derodra, has 15 years of experience with traditional investing and fintech. The NFT architect, Damian CardanoTrees, has experience using NFTs and art to generate social change. The developer, Bencze Levente, has a lot of experience with smart contracts, backend development, frontend development, and databases. Lastly, the project auditor, Sean Murphy, has 15 years of experience with emerging technologies and impact investing management. He was also the former LP in East Africa\u2019s first seed stage tech investment fund. Given all of this information, I think that the proposers working as a team have all the necessary skills for the proposal. They have the sustainability knowledge, the impact investment background, development skills, and NFT knowledge to make this project successful.\n\nThe proposers also mentioned that this proposal is simply a proof-of-concept for Dynamic Proof of Impact NFTs, and their long term goal is to scale up the project. Thus, they will return to Catalyst to seek more funding if they are successful with this initial stage.\n\nSince I did not have any critiques for feasibility, I can give this proposal a score of 5. (score given: 5)\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Given the information provided in the proposal, I think that it should be easy for the Cardano community to audit the progress and success of this proposal. The proposers said that they will have reports and deliverables for each of the 4 phases. In the first two phases, reports will be published on the SPOs chosen as partners and the requirements for the implementation of the NFTs. The third phase will have the deliverable of the working proof-of-concept, which will allow impact stakers to test the whole experience and learn more about how the NFTs work. Lastly, the fourth phase will result in an aggregated report from a survey of the participants of the proof-of-concept that should reveal the engagement of the impact stakers. The proposers threw in the last sentence that \u201cfinal audit output will be a performance review of the oracles.\u201d What exactly does that entail? What kinds of information can be gleaned from that review? Just a little more clarification about that would have been helpful for auditability. \n\nSome other KPIs listed include, at least 2 SPOs participating with at least 30% of each SPO stakers participating in the proof-of-concept, smooth communication between oracles and the NFTs with minimal technical difficulties, and more than 500 mentions on social media for the dynamic proof of impact NFTs and a discussion of impact metrics. One of the KPIs listed by the proposers (\u201cMeasurable contributions to the objective of Cardano becoming both a carbon neutral blockchain and the blockchain of reference for users who care about social impact issues\u201d) seems a bit vague. How can this be measured? What kinds of tangible outcomes can be determined and linked to this proposal? Is it the increase in the number of participants in the impact-driven stake pools after partnering with the project? Increase in the amount of carbon sequestered by the stake pools after partnering with the project? A little clarification would have helped me better understand the potential of this KPI.\n\nUnfortunately, the proposers did not explicitly say where they will be publishing their reports and other information. A GitHub page was linked in Ideascale, so I assume this is where documentation will be published. The proposers could have added a statement mentioning where the Cardano community can find the published reports. \n\nOverall, I only had some small critiques for this proposal with regards to auditability. Some of the metrics could have been clarified or explained a bit more, and the proposers did not mention where they will be publishing their audit reports.

In other words, delegators who stake for impact feel like they're making the \"right decision\" but - what do they have to show for it?  This proposal offers a solution providing exactly that...   A dynamic NFT that evolves as their impact also evolves, like a pokemon card for sustainably-driven Cardano holders.\n\nThe reason why I did not strongly support this proposal, is because the proposed solution still has weakness in defining exactly what people can do with those NFTs or what value they offer.  OK, they mentioned a secondary market for trading them, of course they can be bought and sold.  While this gamification element may strengthen the interest of delegators to make the right choice, I'm not 100% convinced that the secondary market provides value from a demand side for those NFTs, because the intrinsic value is still undefined other than improvement of repetition for their owners - is it enough?", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal team from Impact Scope has a demonstrated background that promotes projects related to impact within the blockchain space.

The author offers the concept of \"Proof of Impact NFTs\" to the community as a means of resolving this problem. The delegators may feel good about contributing to something beneficial after distributing these NFTs and may be willing to stake additional ADA into the same pool.
