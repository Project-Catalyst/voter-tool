This section doesn\u2019t quantifiably or tangibly demonstrate what the outcome of this proposal would be that appeals to innovation/advancement of the Cardano ecosystem or improvement on real-world lives. Starting with the problem statement, this proposal doesn\u2019t provide a strong enough sense of urgency to make voters feel like this proposal matters (which is important because this is actually the start of a $162k proposal, not a single $30k proposal). I appreciate that the problem statement adds multiple layers to the problems that they\u2019re attempting to approach but the proposal doesn\u2019t spend any time further justifying those problems. This runs the risk of allowing voters to fill in their own opinions about the problem statements, if they\u2019re not well supported by research and data to justify them as legitimate problems. In this case, voters may prefer the Cardano ecosystem be known for DeFi capabilities. It\u2019s also rather risky to claim the \u201cCardano Gaming Ecosystem is weak\u201d if there are voters that have a Cardano-based game that they\u2019re a big fan of. I think the third layer of the problem statement was on to a tangible problem of substance but it wasn\u2019t seen all the way through to the end. If additional information had been provided about the percentage of Collectible Card Games in the overall gaming market cap, this could have provided voters with a sense of high-demand for this type of product which translates well to Cardano ecosystem adoption (with the data providing that tangibility of how much adoption). This section of the proposal spends a lot of time talking about generally theoretical problems with the gaming industry and broad solution mechanics to those problems but it doesn\u2019t spend enough time talking about what this game UNIQUELY does to address these problems and remain competitive. This section of the proposal spends a noticeable amount of time generally criticizing other Cardano-based games and not enough time separating itself from other games. In my experience with the world of competitive YuGiOh (and some exposure to other TCGs as well), successful TCG games appear to have a complex gameplay mechanic, imaginative/creative lore, and a strong community. From this proposal (or the whitepaper), I do not get strong enough indications for foundations in these elements. Additionally, this proposal would have to provide something that isn\u2019t found in any of the larger and more established games in the business. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I rank this section a 2 because the information provided here is a solid starting point but the core team is not developed enough for me to confidently vote positively on feasibility. If voters are evaluating the possibility of seeing success based on the capabilities of the core team, voters are not provided the assurance to confidently vote positively on capabilty. I think there is a strong starting place with two capable computer engineers with experience in core Cardano-based coding languages. While these are essential key components, there are other essential roles that are not yet occupied with demonstrably capable core team members. So voters would not be able to vote positively without information about the capabilities of the people that end up filling those roles. There isn\u2019t any provable experience to show that this project could reliably build a strong community, create a game with complex game mechanics and an interesting lore/story background (which I\u2019m not thoroughly optimistic about given the compensation allocated to the Lore Creator & Social Media role). The roadmap and budget outlines are fantastic. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to change in either of these sections (though I am rather concerned about the risks of such a high-cost/risk to Catalyst funds). If I\u2019m voting strictly on this sections demonstration of feasibility (even with the higher-level quality in the budget and roadmap), I do not think this proposal is quite ready for approval yet. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I think this section almost gets there with a solid starting framework for identified KPIs but with lacking organization and quantification of those goals, so I rank this section a 3. There\u2019s one line that really bothers me about this section of the proposal when it says \u201cif the community deems sufficient progress has been made, then funding is made available every subsequent fund.\u201d As much as I can appreciate value placed on the community (I assume the Catalyst community is what is meant), they are not the experts of the field that the proposers are building out in. The definition of performance needs to be set and defined by the proposers and the community can call out if they feel like this standard is not ambitious enough (or too ambitious). By leaving the standard up to the subjective thoughts of the community, it inappropriately relieves the proposer of having to commit to adhering to an expertly formulated measure of success. The best Catalyst proposals are the ones that set specific target metrics for different timeframes of the future of the project, so that the community knows what the proposer expects to see as a vision for success. This also provides the proposer with a mechanism to course correct if needed, to adjust for greater adherence to the standard of success. I\u2019m neutral here because it\u2019s still a very early stage for this project, so I don\u2019t expect usage metrics to be reasonably projected.

Part of this challenge's funding portfolio goes towards projects that develop games using our blockchain and the various technologies the Cardano ecosystem has to offer because there's no denying the way the industry The gaming industry is extremely relevant and profitable in today's technology sector. Collectible card games currently make up a large portion of the game market capitalization, according to the proponent, but Pay to Win is unfair. So his solution was to create a Digital Collectible Card Game that prioritizes game quality, has decentralized balance changes, and can pay to win by applying a pattern. Game mode to earn money by making free cards. In other words, this game mechanism is to convert from pay to win (common in traditional DCCG) to pay to earn where users are rewarded with admin tokens for playing. These governance tokens grant voting rights that individuals can use to change game balances. As a result, the right to change the balance is out of the hands of the developers and in the hands of the players, and therefore the developers cannot exploit the game for profit. If in traditional DCCGs there is an imbalance and unfairness for players because the developer controls balance changes to maximize profits, this game project will not be possible in that situation. This proposal is a good fit for the challenge as it drives Cardano adoption via Game Streams that directly match the Challenge description. Besides, the proposed solution is also completely convincing as it prioritizes the quality of the game to ensure the adoption and longevity of the game while taking advantage of the blockchain through the use of the decentralized voting middle and replaceable tokens. The goal of this promotion is to provide a game that can compete with the DCCG giants we see in the modern gaming scene. So, I think that if this proposal is successfully implemented, it will attract a large number of people to the game and of course, this is completely beneficial for the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I love the level of detail mentioned in this proposal, it gives me the certainty that the people behind the proposal know what they are doing. The author has identified the long-term development path of the project, showing their vision. The author states that this proposal will seek repeated funding for a period of 4 consecutive funds, starting with Fund 9 and ending Fund 12, and it is commendable here that the author has provided us with all sets of the necessary information from the beginning to the end of this project (see Whitepaper for more information: https://bit.ly/3xHZRHv). The first is about the roadmap, this proposal is very detailed in terms of time frame with all phases, with action to be taken. Milestones were presented, tied to an identifiable period, and we had a very precise view of what tasks needed to be done during that period. The budget is also described in great detail. The amount requested in this 9 fund is $29,915 and is broken down into auditable portions. And finally about the project team, in my objective assessment, this group is capable of implementing the project. We are provided with full member information such as their names, their professional skills as well as their role in this project.

If the community considers sufficient progress has been made, the funding will be provided for each subsequent fund.

(However, this is entirely possible after being funded.) Having several goals with well-defined KPIs provides the community with clear evidence against which to audit and measure the progress of the proposal. The success of the project is also well defined so that we understand the outcome to be expected, giving us a vision of the project: DCCG players will know about the DCCG of the Cardano Ancient Peoples regardless of the Cardano affiliation first. this. They will enjoy playing the game regularly and actively participating in the balance change vote. They will be seamlessly incorporated into the Cardano Ecosystem.
