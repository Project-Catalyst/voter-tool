Well, just from this statement I am slightly unsure if the proposer is aware that the long-term Cardano mission is to focus on Africa \u2013 actually a continent full of poor people. At the same time, there is no supporting evidence or any information that Cardano is focusing on rich people, and just checking the price itself, also NFT market, it is obvious that comparing to other blockchains, I would freely announce that cardano is for everyone. Today, tomorrow, even yesterday. At the same time \u2013 how do you onboard people who are having no to little money? Do we actually feel that bringing people who are having their life financially \u201cruined\u201d is a good starting point? What will happen if you give them donation or a giveaway? Do they somehow become part of the community, or they will just cash out? I think a supporting thesis for \u201cwhat will happen afterward\u201d is required, but if considering the content of the proposal \u2013 I do not think we are able to on board poor by giving them anything for free. At the same time, the proposal is lacking a logical relation \u2013 1. Aim is to bring new poor people into cardano, and introduce/participate in projects they might be not aware of, or were not able to afford the mint 2.

To check the twitch, the last stream was 7 months ago, for 6 minutes with 38 views. So\u2026I do not think credibility is high. The proposer is able to draw some drawings, he can stream on twitch, but I doubt he can deliver the product. There are no other links to support anything he would like to accomplish.

It is unclear what is meant by an event, because the specifications were not provided, except that he plans to approach some artists and rent a venue. Regarding the success of the proposal, the proposer states that there will be inclusion of more people from different walks of life, to host a live musical event and creating unique NFTs, in order to spread the awareness of the Cardano. Unfortunately, success metrics do not really relate to the goal of on boarding the poor people.

I will continue to try and provide further information as required. I appreciate the feedback and have spent the majority of my entertainment career in live events as opposed to online, so it is completely understandable to inquire about the online portion. Thank you for taking the time to assess my proposal. The suggestions are valid and tracking the number of attendees and those who join would be an appropriate way to see success metrics in general. I am aware of the long term ambitions and personally don't limit myself to just focusing on the growth of one place, but the growth of the globe in general. Will happily extend out virtually to where ever I can. With the NFTs and informational portion of things, education and opportunity can create a sustaining impact on those that it resonates with. I understand there are some who will see it as the NFT is the \"opportunity\", but the showcasing of different projects and an entrance piece, allows for a broader perspective beyond a fiscal opportunity. As someone who has experienced a poor life, I know from working and creating on the Cardano network for over a year now, there are many different functional use cases beyond just art. The request for the funding towards the tablet was based around speeding up the process of which I am currently doing, as for the rest of the breakdown, I thought it would be healthier to say what the funding was for, which is the rate I am currently making as an artist on the Cardano network. Similar to saying 3k for wages.  Thank you for taking the time to assess, I appreciate your concern and feedback. I will continue to work and try to better display my accomplishments.

The cost of minting an NFT at the time or writing, is equivalent to 1 transaction fee or 0.17 ADA, or approximately $0.08 USD.  I'm not sure if he is referring to the cost of acquiring NFTs, but the creating cost itself does not seem cost prohibitive for any person anywhere, and is one of the lowest reliable transaction costs in any blockchain environement.\n\nThe proposals stated solution to this problem, plainly, is to host events and give away NFTs to lower financial class people, to build more users.\n\nIt's not clear from the proposal or links provided to twitter or a website where the author is located.  In the problem statement, he comments on a problem related to virtual events, the goes on to talk about \"local\" resources, such as musicians.

I find it hard to relate your idea of art NFT creation and music performance to bring onboard the unfortunate with any of those basic needs. It does not solve any of problems that the poor people are facing. Unless you are talking about creating an NFT with utility that makes their life easier that is free to use by everyone, increase productivity and efficiency, solves food distribution, improving health etc. The expensive art NFT that the proposer mentioned are inflated by speculation, not because of the value it brings. There are thousands of cheap NFT, or they can even mint the art NFT themselves by just paying NFT maker fee. Bring a real world value for the NFT to the table, then you will automatically help the poor and the needy. With the argument above, I find that this proposal does not addresses the challenge.

It is said that the proposer will begin looking for musicians and creating NFT in July, but does not specify when will the event take place nor when will he/she complete the NFT artwork. The plan provided does not include much details other than commencing to look for musician for the event and also producing NFT artwork. On your next proposal, you are advised to present more detailed, structured plan such as what is being done in preparation for the event, what are the backend work that will be done for the NFT ticketing system, the material preparation for distribution to the public since you are aiming to bring onboard people that has not heard of Cardano or even crypto.\nIn the risk section, the proposer notes that there might be a technical problem from the venue owner side regarding the NFT ticket verification, but there is no plan provided on how it will be mitigated. \nWith the plan presented, it is unlikely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

In this case \"Helping the poor come aboard.\" It is important to remember that lots of people don't have access to the Cardano projects and NFTs. The reason for this is because most people have no idea what it is and how they work. The proposal suggests that there will be live events and streamed events that will allow more people from the community to come on board. I think this is a unique idea because it can include more people in the Cardano community. I think it could be difficult finding a large enough community that would be interested in these events. Maybe include more information on how there will be enough people benefitting from these events. Building a community is extremely important because it allows for people to participate in these events and understand exactly what the Cardano blockchain is. The purpose of Project Catalyst is to include more people and to promote education. For these reasons, I give this section of the proposal 3 out of 5 stars.

There is also a budget breakdown that describes where the requested funds would be allocated. This portion of the proposal is written well because it includes specific information.

There is a great use case, a detailed budget breakdown, and determination. However, there are still sections that lack. My main concern is lack of a community that is aware of this project. There are typically 2 different concepts that help me to consider the potential success of a proposal. The first is transparency. This should include a team/individual who are/is completely transparent with their community and will build trusting relationships with them. However, without a community this principle doesn't have much effect because there will be no people to be open with. The second principle is accountability. This also requires a community or group that is interested in a project/idea and is there to support them. When there is a group of animated community members, it helps allow these two principles work. This typically leads to the overall success of a proposal.

Obviously, this will increase the number of people participating in the community as well as provide Cardano with the opportunity to discover hidden talents who lack financial resources by creating a welcoming environment with a low to no entry cost. This, however, does not satisfy the requirements of this section for a proposal. First and foremost, the proposer mentioned lowering the barrier to entry with NFTs in order to help many people who are still struggling financially, but what exactly is a lower barrier? How much will the proposer cut, and will that price apply to all classes or just the poor? In addition to the solutions provided by the author for the two risks, I have a concern for which I hope to receive an answer from the author. What does the proposer intend to do to address the user acquisition problem? It is not enough to simply invite local musicians to promote through concerts. People with low incomes rarely have deep enough knowledge to join as well as pay attention to places that require high input costs, because people prefer the cheaper when it comes to price. So if the number of users does not increase as proposed by the proposal, then the biggest loser here is the Cardano ecosystem.

There are numerous flaws in the plan that the author addresses. Let's move on to the budget breakdown, which includes a total of 7 spending items that clearly state the purpose and the number of expenses that must be spent. It includes an item called miscellaneous, but we have no idea what it contains. If it is not possible to visualize the project's expenses, the proposer should state or provide examples of why the money is needed. This will make the budget plan for the project more straightforward. Finally, the proposer was the sole person to lead all activities on this project, and because he has collaborated with over 100 projects on Cardano alone, I am confident that the author will do a good job of what needs to be done. The author also intends to recruit additional support collaborators, but make sure to specify the selection criteria.
