There is an assertion in the beginning than \u201cThe Cardano community needs a large event for networking, marketing, and education\u201d. IOG has been organising Cardno summits in fact across the globe and large number of developers and stakeholders have taken part in them. I have attended these virtually at least three time in last two years. The entry has been given to people who have contribute in Caralyst and have showcesed their products like WMT. However these event do provice an important networking platform which is very important in the evolving Crypto eco system. Having said that relative importance of organising such events for $250000 at the cost of financing actual dApp development is difficult for me to justify.

The expected revenue in the lower end is  $800000 (if the event is sold out which it will). I feel there should have been justification for bidding catalyst fund with such large revenue source identified. Any clear detail on this whoudl have added tremendous value to the proposal. Overall the proposal is clear and can be audited, if it is assumed that there is absolute need for this fund over and above the revenue resources identified from the rare boom website.

The date for the event is already set and it seems like a big portion of the community has already committed to attending the event in Colorado.

Almost every big defi project building on Cardano is going to be there. Charles Hoskinson is going to be there as well. There has been a need for a large event where projects and people in the Cardano ecosystem can come together and network. This is typically where the greatest ideas and projects come from. Creating relationships and partnerships between projects is extremely important to an ecosystem growing as fast as Cardano. It will be exciting for lots of Cardano community members as well to see some of their favorite projects at an event. The networking factor is going to bring a lot of utility to the ecosystem. This event will have a huge impact on the Cardano blockchain. Many people will benefit from it. For these reasons, I give this section 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Bigpey has been around the ecosystem for a long time.

It is also important to realize that even if no funds were received, they would still make a way to go through with this event. It shows that there is dedication and that the proposal will be executed properly. There is a detailed budget breakdown that articulates where the funds will be allocated and how it will assist in making this community event so incredible. There is also a detailed roadmap that describes exactly what is going to happen at the event and how many people they expect. There will be booths, and speeches, and even community afterparties.

It is centered around the community which helps audit the potential success of this proposal. When looking into this proposal. There are two things that will help it to be completely successful. The first thing is that the team will be held accountable for this proposal. The best piece of information that supports this is that the event is already planned. Even in the worst case, where this proposal won't be funded, they will still go through with it because of how important it will be to the community and the overall wellness of the Cardano community. The community will make sure that bigpey and his team will be held accountable and that this event happens. The second thing is transparency. Big pey has been very open about this event and has included everyone that wants to come. We can imagine that he will continue to be open with the community and will address things if needed. The delivery dates are clearly stated and there is a high likelihood that those dates will remain relevant. For these reasons, I give this section 5 out of 5 stars.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2817", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6732, "q0": "Rare Bloom is a Cardano community event taking place on October 14th-15th in Gaylord Rockies, Colorado (outskirts of Denver). Always warm, always sunny, right? The event promises to bring a long list of special guests, including Ben Goertzel from SingularityNet, dcSpark, IOG, SundaeSwap, Drip Dropz and a bunch of other names. And of course, Charles will be there, since he confirmed it publicly in a video.\n\nThe aim of the event is to enable the interaction between the exhibitors and the retail folks as well as to educate newcomers into Cardano. The venue will have two stages, a main one with over 1500 seats, and a smaller one. \n\nFrom my point of view there is a rather weak connection between the proposal and the challenge, whose role is, I remind you, to boost the development of applications, products and integrations that increase the use cases of the ecosystem in the real world. How likely is it that such an event actually boosts the number of applications? Not very likely in my opinion, especially since the event will be focused on the interaction between existing Cardano teams and retail folks. There might be some limited opportunities to gather feedback, do a bit of direct marketing and educate the (already interested) community, but other than this, I don\u2019t see any other big impact. On top of this, the cost to access the event is rather steep, starting from 400 USD for a Tier 3 ticket, so it is unlikely to see significant demand from the general audience to attend. \n\nGiven the rather weak connection between the proposal and the challenge, I can only rate it at three stars in terms of potential impact. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Peyton is the founder of bigpey, a Cardano YouTube channel with 26k followers, and co-founder of Bloom pool (along with Anthony). He is the main name behind the event, along with Wes, Rand and Ben, for whom not much else is known other than they have 10+ years of experience in tech sales, hosting live events and design experience, respectively. It is rather disappointing that the team did not put more effort into the team\u2019s presentation. For an excellent proposal should have also included:\n\n- short bios for each team member, complemented by a few social media profiles\n- a track record for the event organizers, demonstrating the capacity of carrying out such a large scale event\n\nThe budget is a rather weak spot of this proposal, and there is definitely a missed opportunity here to shed more light into the intricacies and cost implications of hosting large scale events which are most likely out of sight and mind for the majority of people. About two thirds of the budget will go towards equipment renting, but we don\u2019t really have a detailed list of what that equipment comprises. The rest will mostly be spent on service and setup charges, so labor costs. For me, an excellent proposal would have included: \n\n- a full description of the event\u2019s costs, not just those for which funding is asked\n- an estimation of the attendance and revenues obtained (ticket sales, booths sold)\n- an explanation of where the additional funding comes from, if applicable\n- an explanation whether the event is aimed to be a for profit or a non profit undertaking\n- an explanation of whether tickets will be sold for less is Catalyst funding is secured. Or will the extra proceeds turn into profits? \n\nThe community has a right to know these things.\n\nThe team also states that they have already contracted the venue for those specific dates, as well as made the arrangements necessary with logistic partners, and this is definitely a positive aspect of the proposal, thus minimizing the risks of the event not taking place due to the unavailability of the venue. But again, an excellent proposal would have maybe included at least a rough indication of future tasks, even if we all know that event organizing is a fluid activity, always dynamic and prone to last minute changes outside the organizer\u2019s control \n\nIn conclusion, lacking detailed information about the team and the event\u2019s budget I can only offer three stars and maintain a neutral position towards the feasibility of the proposal. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposers offer some very good indicators to assess the impact of the event: live stream viewers, event attendees, feedback received, booths sold. However, given that the event is already fairly advanced in terms of planning (since arrangements are made, probably deposits are already paid), that should have given the proposers a very good chance of taking ownership of real targets. How many people would you like to attend? How many booths do you intend to sell? How do you intend to collect feedback? So there is definitely lots of room for improvement in terms of increasing the team\u2019s accountability towards the community. \n\nAdditionally, I would have enjoyed very much a pledge from the proposers to offer a full insight into the event\u2019s financials for anyone interested to be able to review whether the money was spent according to the proposal. \n\nIn conclusion, we have a good, but not great, potential for auditability for this proposal.

This is an overall net-benefit for the Cardano product landscape. Product conferences are a standard for any industry. Cardano hosting their own product conference is essentially a no brainer in my assessment. The opportunity for those to meet face-to-face with like-minded individuals is a great way to promote the sharing of ideas and further develop the Cardano ecosystem. It is understandable that pushing for a live-stream can be counter-productive, in that, those who are considering coming to the event may elect to stay home and watch the event for free online. This does result in a loss of potential revenue. This proposal request is not completely unwarranted for this reason alone. Being able to provide those around the world with the information that is presented at this event is very important and also stays true to Cardano's ethos of inclusivity. If there is a schedule already produced for this event (for the two days) I would like to see that in this proposal. This will better help those reading the proposal the types of discussions and presentations that will occur at this event.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The way this proposal reads it appears that there is only one person (big pey) on the team for this project. This is pretty concerning if true. I would like to think that for an event of this size and status that there are many more team members that are contributing to the success of this event. I would like to see these team members (or entities) listed. If this event is truly ran by one person then my confidence in the feasibility of this event will decrease. \n\nThe budget of this event looks well thought out and specific valuations are given for each need. I will assume that these valuations also include the breakdowns of the two stages. From a formatting perspective I would like to see these costs in a list format rather than in paragraph form. Just easier for the reader to consume. \n\nLike I stated earlier, it appears that the funds requested are going to be for stage construction and breakdown. If possible, to add a schedule for the stage talks and presentations can help potential voters.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "I honestly do not have much for this section of the proposal. I believe that the KPI measurement points stated in the proposal will be great indicators for the overall success. Only thing that I may add is explaining a way to publicize this data.

The scale of impact is huge for the entire community that is interested in the blockchain field, and those who are not interested will have the freshest and most accurate view of this disruptive technology. Attract investors and connect the community more. In fact, live events and conferences have had a good and successful effect on the Cardano ecosystem, such as the Consensus 2022 event.\nThe solution to this proposal is to build a community event for Cardano (The Rare Bloom). Rare Bloom would be the perfect place for those interested in entering the industry. There are many Cardano protocols and companies hiring at the event. Additionally, the event will provide exhibitors with retail marketing opportunities, networking with the largest protocols on Cardano, and training Cardano newcomers. Clearly, this proposal met the requirements of the challenge.\nThe author stated that a major risk that could prevent the project's success was the inability to deliver Rare Bloom educational content on a global scale to the Cardano community. The author has also explained this risk.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The project has been prepared with a detailed plan, a clear time and place.

Each ticket purchased comes with one NFT ticket and one random NFT from partner projects.\nIn addition, the author has also provided a list of special guests participating in the event.\nThe author has divided the budget into 2 phases: the primary stage of $139,372.58 and the secondary stage of $59,985.87. Each stage is allocated by the author for the necessary expenses. However, I see that the sum proposed in the summary is $250,000 but the total in the 2 stages of $199,358.45.

The overall \"challenge\" is that the Rare Bloom Cardano Community Event is going to take place, and the team is asking for funding to help with the finances and costs of this. The proposal is excellent in the number of details and provides a well-thought-out answer to the challenge. I feel that a Cardano even is an amazing and very interactive way to allow a place where Cardano lovers and supporters can all meet together to learn, socialize, and share ideas! This would benefit the Cardano community for both those who can attend in person and those who cannot.

There is no doubt that what is being proposed will not be taking place. I feel that it is a great idea, and the funding would be very helpful in the bringing forth of this event. I love how the team explained in much detail exactly where the funds will be going and how they will be spent. This event would be huge, especially seeing how many projects on Cardano have already said they're going to be there.

It is 100% likely that this event is legit and that it will be taking place when the team says it does.
