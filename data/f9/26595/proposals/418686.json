By issuing synchronization licenses via NFTS on Cardano, this proposal could directly drive new use cases, and new users and an increase in onchain transactions. The KPI's of this proposal are linked directly to the challenge, as they are about bringing new users and recording transactions onchain. There is potential for this to capture a large % of the market for music sync licences touching on film, video games, metaverse, marketing, and various other multimedia content. I think this proposal could also have a significant impact towards automating, simplifying, and codifying legal contracts on the blockchain. Having legal experts work on these problems could also provide numerous benefits in the future, as they can set new legal precedents with unique blockchain use cases.

They have mentioned they are looking to hire two additional team members, so it appears they may not yet have the full team required, and therefore there is some additional risk to this proposal. They proposal also includes and explains the perceived legal risks, budget risk and technical risks and mitigation strategies for each. I am not familiar with the legal considerations here, but I find the following statement confusing. \"FML is not a marketplace for music rights, but rather a marketplace for licenses of use for those rights.\" I think other voters may also find this confusing, and this could be improved with further explanation from the proposing team. This sounds like an important point to consider the feasibility of this project, as it will be dependent on these legal considerations, and the technical challenges are secondary. The team has included a reasonable budget with quarterly milestones that are broken down into deliverable tasks. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal includes a budget and timeline. The KPI's are provided with both quantifiable metrics that can be audited easily, and qualitative based metrics like activity, engagement and retention. The team has also provided a way to measure these qualitative metrics. The project will be available for audit on Github, and the team will also complete customer satisfaction surveys. The only recommendation I would make to the team is to include monthly reporting to the catalyst community of a summary of all the audit metrics provided in the proposal, and make it clear how these reports will be shared.

Talking about the implementation roadmap, we know clearly how long the project will be implemented (here, about 1 year). However. , I think the proposer should be more specific about the specific work that will be done in each phase. For example, in Q2/2023 - protocol migration and specification, we'll have quite a bit of work to do. For example: front-end back-end, build security system, check for bugs, run testnet etc. How long does all these work take?\nBudget breakdown: still quite general, making it difficult for me to assess whether this project will cost enough to implement. We only have information that the cost is $25/hour worked. However, because the nature of work is different for each person, the cost will be different. I take for example, for the work to do technical construction for the project requires a higher cost for the programmers, for the marketing and advertising costs there will be a lower salary for the implementer. The other costs related to marketing such as advertising costs, cost of inviting brand ambassadors or costs of organizing discussions with creators need to be added here.

The team made this recommendation because they realized that today's artists have to spend a lot of money to license and synchronize their music with ads, movies, social networks, video games, and more metaverse. The solution is to use Cardano's underlying infrastructure to build a peer-to-peer protocol to decentralize music playlisting, discovery, negotiation, and licensing for Sync. The result is a protocol that will allow artists, builders, and licensors (filmmakers, indie game developers, etc.) to issue and approve sync licenses. This will allow fees to stay low and middlemen to remain minimal. The problem has been identified and a solution is also clearly explained, I think this suggestion is very helpful and definitely achieves the goal of the challenge", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Talking about the implementation roadmap, know how long the project will last (here, about 1 year).

Besides, the group also said that it will hire 2 positions: General Council and Marketing / Community Manager.\nFinally, funding, the proposal needs 128,700 USD, of which 117,000 USD is paid to 5 experts to implement the project, with a salary of 25 USD / hour (I think this salary is quite low compared to the common ground). Besides, they also require 10% hedging, however, I think this part needs explaining because the budget is mainly used to pay the professionals, this 10%, in my opinion, is quite a lot of money to be reviewed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "And finally about auditability, if this proposal is funded I think it is quite easily audited by the indicators provided by the author. The proposal takes care of setting goals and KPIs that will serve as a document for us to analyze the progress of the proposal. It's entirely possible to track results based on the different goals they set. And about project monitoring: this part is easy to follow, as the project will update the report on the Github page.\nThe success of the proposal is also very well defined as sync licensing is a viable revenue stream for casual musicians.

This initial iteration of the project is somewhere between an MVP and PoC:  it is meant to show how a marketplace for any kind of sync licenses would be a valuable hub for peer to peer interaction on Cardano, generating transactions on both sides of the license, and downstream as the license was adopted by further syncing the asset.  But it will also be a valid marketplace for anyone who only wishes to use the existing opensource sync licenses, and in theory this part of the buildout would be fully functional in this first iteration, so that is more along the lines of an MVP.\n\nIn both cases, I think the proposer has presented a solid case for adoption of this protocol to help solve real issues facing creators, and in connecting creators and users in a decentralized way.

They also know what they don't know, and have dedicated budget space to bringing in dedicated legal counsel, which is critical, as anything built will naturally start at the level of copyright law, and then add the sync licensing characteristics.  Because the team is focusing on already available and robust licenses, these two factors mitigate the biggest risk which is the legal risk.\n\nThe budget is extremely small for a team of 5 over the course of 12 months, and I concluded that it was reasonable after looking through their Notions roadmap (kudos on that, btw).  A LOT of work has already been done, and the timeline and milestones show efficient usage of the time available (call it 18 hours per week, and now the budget looks a lot more suitable).  The addition of a 10% risk contingency should both straddle the multiple economic zones they operate in, as well as the long timeline as it relates to ADA price fluctuation.\n\nBecause the team has relevant experience, and has included clear requirements and budget outlays for the positions still to be filled, and because the timeline, budget and milestones all \"sync\" up, I believe this proposal merits a full 5 stars for Feasibility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "They do a good job here of describing their overall approach to the auditing process, starting with the software development in the background.

As a software project, the hit the usual highnotes of Opensource Gits, agile project management, etc.  I expect the monthly auditing beats will be well populated by updates from their Notions board.\n\nFor their success metrics, they divide them up between quality and quantity, which is interesting.  Qualitative auditing is something the Catalyst community is only just getting used to, so I will be keeping an eye on the results here.  \n\nLastly, the team has created a website, that is primarily the PoC for the protocol, however you can reach them though it, and as well the development side and Project Lead both maintain professional profiles which provide another means of connecting up with them.\n\nAll in all I believe the team has been transparent in this proposal, and will be accessible over the course of the work.
