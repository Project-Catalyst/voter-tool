The solution is to develop an application where restaurants, beneficiaries or drivers would meet and at the same time, the app would have AI that would decide the best route, storage of food etc. The impact on Cardano is seen that every restaurant that will join this app, will also join a facebook page \u201cFive Loaves Two Fish\u201d and basically because IOHK/Cardano funded this app, the proposer expect the rise of the community numbers. So to sum it up, the idea is to develop app -> say it was funded by cardano -> delegation/blockchain users will rise. To be honest, even tough it is a noble idea, there is no supporting information to confirm this statement, also, why would the delegation rise since the goal is to help the poor? The proposer states many benefits for the environment, the poor, restarurants or stakeholders, but neither of these is having a direct impact on the challenge goal \u2013 to drive Cardano adoption. There is one mention about NFTs in the impact section which is decreasing the overall clarity of the proposal, and regarding NFTs \u2013 there is no information why would these be interesting for buyers/sellers, and since it appears that these will be minted by the proposer, it would be nice to state where the proceedings from sales would go. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The roadmap is set to three months, whilist the first month is devoted to construct the vehicle for transport, during second month to finish NFT and AI app, and during the month 3 \u2013 testing and data analysis. The requested budget is 44900, whereas 27900 is for app development \u2013 2 devs, FTE, 70 usd/hour, another UI/UX dev and quality assurance dev. These rates and detail is sufficient for app development. Other items on the budget \u2013 social media campaign for 4k and administration and management for 9k \u2013 I am missing the same level of detail e.g. What is the time donation? What will be their activities + hourly rate?  The team is currently consisting from 5 people, and another approx. 10 people to be hired. The current team members seems to have relevant skills, and linked in profiles are also provided, and even tough that there are still many people to be hired, the plan seems logical and reasonable. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal states that the progress of the proposal can be tracked via APP, and number of NFTs generated. I am not sure whether it is not success metrics, because for tracking the progress I would imagine something like \u2013 weekly/bi-weekly posts, blogs whereas hiring was successful, or development of app is proceeding from one stage to another, alpha, beta version of the app, testing and such. The stated progress metrics are already jumping from no-app to tracking-app phase, so the progress is not possible to track with the stated progress KPIs. For the success, the numbers that display adoption are useful \u2013 users, food deliveries, and growth in numbers by time. The stated success metrics such as \u201cability to xxx\u201d is not a reliable trackable metric. I am keeping the score full, because even that the proposal is not containing logical progress/success KPIs, I believe that these can be easily implemented based on suggestions.

Food waste is definetely a problem and trying to devise strategies to solve the problem is something that is definetely impactful and for a good cause. It can also be seen that the proposers have put some efforts in pointing out how to adress Cardanos mission with their proposal. One thing still bothers me: In my opinion the use of resources (namely money, development time and calculation power) is a bit inefficient here. I've been voluntarily working for a anti-foodwaste-organisation called foodsharing for several years now (you can check out the homepage foodsharing.de unfortunately it's in german though) where the collection and distribution of food is managed by thousands of volunteers on an easy-to-use basis and everything works out just fine in a scalable manner (minus the route optimisation, but you could manage a task like this far easier with linear programming/lexicographic optimisation methods/sorting algorithms without the need for programming an entire AI).", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The overall implementation plan is mostly fine expect for the actual development task which could be a lot more fine-grained, otherwise the idea that you only have an idea rather than a concept of how the app should be devised. Apart from that, the team is transparent about themselves and have a lot of information about themselves and their initiative shared that seems credible. The risk-mitigation section is very detailed, which is good. Another grain of salt however is that the budget is not very fine-grained, putting a lot of money in a task that can be done on a fraction of that amount and also, for a welfare-oriented project that depends on funds the rates for the programmers etc. are excessively high while the proposers don't plan to pay any money for the volunteers.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Yes, the proposal is indeed auditable. The deliverable has been described in detail, a roadmap encompasses a lot of auditable items (expect for the actual coding process which is not defined that well unfortunately) and the success metrics/KPIs are appropriate and can be used to audit the success of the project. How about, however, providing some platform link like your github to enable voters and PAs to see a proof of your past work and to also track the progress of your ongoing project?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2257", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\nThis is a good and fair assessment.

The idea is to connect those with excess food (about to be thrown away) to those who lack it and are suffering from hunger. If implemented and appropriately marketed this will create a positive impact for the community and to the Cardano image overall. With the development of the dApp it will be easier to choose the best routes and save time and resources in delivering those foods. Also, the solution will collect a bunch of information such as location and recipients\u2019 characteristics such as age to feed to the AI. In turn it will be able to decide the best way to store the food, when it should be consumed and when it should be delivered for best results. The goals align with the challenge settings and the project has the potential to add value to the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team is composed by Dimitri, Uditha, Rishantha, Chamarie and Saman among others that will be needed to implement the proposal. All of these listed have relevant experiences and are backed by LinkedIn or Facebook links where we can find more information about them. When describing who is participating, they have demonstrated they know in an identifiable manner how many and each type of member that will be needed. For instance, besides those previously mentioned they also state they will need four people to handle food pickup and delivery. The budget is clear and broken down into identifiable items. The development part which accounts for USD 27,900 of the total is further broken down and its estimation is clearly explained. Also, the timetable provided is realistic and the project should last around three months. Finally, the proposer has discussed a lot of potential risks such as covid lockdowns, increasing fuel prices and ADA price volatility. Nevertheless, they have also proposed mitigating solutions such as a contingency funds to prevent problems from prices volatility.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The roadmap provided is detailed and has clear milestones. The team not only states what they will done but also how they will do it. For instance, to put operations in place in the beginning they will hire two to four staff and get in touch with the beneficiary locations as soon as possible. The metrics defined are precise and well-thought. Some of them are number of food packs distributed per day, number of private, household and corporate donors per month, number of NFTs generated upon pickup and number of NFTs generated on sale. All in all, this is a great effective solution to the problem of hunger and it is very rewarding to see this is made easier with the help of Cardano. This creates goodwill that can be leveraged by the community to attract even more users to the network. Sadly, they have not mentioned how they will update the community regarding the plan's progress which is a downside for auditability.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2513", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "\nThis is a good and fair assessment.
