To understand the system the proposal details out the different roles involved in making the loans possible including the loan broker, borrower and backers. A percentage of the backers will come from a senior liquidity pool that is broken down into junior and senior tranches. In terms of how the proposal team intend to make this function they outline how the whole process will use smart contracts. Fund delegates are those that can help with underwriting the loan and backers should have the financial knowledge to provide additional due diligence. \nOnce the backers and funds are in place effort would be placed on finding borrowers to provide loans to after verification. There are a number of fee generating events such as loan Interest, underwriting fee, late interest and principal repayment fee, loan early repayments that would be distributed between junior and senior pools and fund delegates. The demand for uncollataralized loans is clear and the incentive mechanisms to make this work are well outlined in this proposal. The explanations provided are more high level and it would have been good to have a slightly more technical section here to compare with existing solutions on how this will function technically and which parts will be more challenging than others areas and the risks involved. In the risks section they mention talent retention and backers as key risks cover some of the different roles involved in this application and then the senior pool ratio that needs to be at a functional level. Due to there being a number of incentives in this application I believe more details and risks could have been articulated on how the system would be able to handle very challenging market condition and sudden changes. What safety guards would be put in place? Who's funds would be at risk if any? What are the advantages and issues with the approach being taken? Overall the potential impact for this proposal is large for the ecosystem, to give the proposal a better score a more thorough break down of the technical decisions and reasons for those decisions would be needed - especially in respect to how much funding is being requested.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is broken down into three phases. Only the first phase will be funded by the Catalyst proposal that is now submitted which is likely to take around 8 months to complete. The roadmap includes the on-chain pool, investment and loan management, loan lifecycle management, on-chain backer loan assessment, on-chain identities and basic governance token incentivisation. The future phases bring in more functionality such as improving GT incentivisation, auditors, on chain governance and a reputation system. These phases will be funded by VCs. Phase 1 could have had more depth of the break down than what was provided due to the amount of funds being used to complete these steps. This could have given more confidence that the proposers understand the complexity and time requirements of each of those stages. The budget breakdown lists out different roles and the amount of funding allocated to each as well as additional costs such as audits. A number of team members are listed with their backgrounds from different companies. The website and links provided show evidence that this team is highly capable of delivering complex applications to a high standard. Overall it appears very likely that this team will be able to feasibly deliver this proposal. However in future proposals I would kindly request the proposers do a more thorough job of explaining the breakdown of the tasks with how much effort and allocation will go to each with some justification when requesting large sums of Catalyst funding.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "For tracking the progress of the proposal the team lists a number of metrics that are relevant to the application such as total value of loans, % of successful loans, website traffic a number of borrowers, backers or auditors. It would have been good for the proposers to provide details on how they intend to communicate the progress of this proposal to the community and also from this work what aspects will be open source if any and where to find that work. Success for this proposal is outlined as total loans value in excess of $100 million. This could have had more depth in showcasing why they have arrived at certain values like this such as comparing with alternative applications to give more confidence that this is both achievable and a good objective to set. Other objectives around security guarantees or specific focusses on certain borrower groups or loan types would have helped show an increased confidence that the proposal team understand where short and medium term demand would come from for this application. Overall the clarity of this proposal is fairly sufficient however has room for improvement. When considering the amount of funds requested it would have been good for the team to put more effort into stating what they will give back to the community in terms of open source tooling as it is efforts like these that truly help to push the ecosystem as a collective whole in the right direction.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2073", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 3, "ng": 8, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1818, "q0": "This proposal aims to offer an alternative to the control of companies by banks or other centralized institutions, by creating a system of trust based on smart contracts that would allow everyone to lend more easily with confidence. In this way the little ones could also contribute to a global mutual aid.\nThe solution described is very well detailed and its objectives are aligned with the Dapp Products and integrations challenge, which includes DeFi. After a general introduction to uncollateralized loans and lending protocols, the author describes the business model he wishes to implement. The goal is not to provide a financial service directly, but technical solutions entirely based on smart contracts, made available to \"Fund Delegates\". These Fund Delegates will be able to create lending funs oriented towards specific purposes and according to the parameters of their choice. This will be followed by the collection of funds from investors and then the entry into play of borrowers. An auditor role is foreseen at a later stage.\nThe ability of the project to create long-term value for Cardano is well described: after a first phase financed by the Catalyst Fund9 and lasting 8 months, two other phases are explained which show the long-term vision of the project and the potential for development of this DAO.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The technical solution is precisely described in its principles and is supported by a team that has demonstrated its ability to deliver in the related development areas. 2 entities are involved in this project: Vaccuumlabs, which is behind the Adalite wallet or the NuFi platform, and Wincent, which is a major player in digital asset trading.\nThe risks are on the whole well identified, with in the first place the fact of having the key skills to carry out these complex developments. In view of this risk, the support of the Vaccuumlabs holding company and all of its developers is an asset.\nThe budget is broken down into items corresponding to the salaries of the people involved in the project.

Auditability during project development is not where this proposal is best. \nThe plan lacks details to enable progress monitoring, and intermediate milestones along the 8 months of development would be helpful. Based on other developments, I'm sure that this detailed plan exists. I recommend adding it, if not funded this round. Considering communication in NuFi project with at least a Discord Channel to provide the community with regular project updates, I expect this project to have a public channel. This is a fair assumption I make, but it is not clearly stated in the proposal.

This kind of platform is quite common and the main theme in financial technology (fintech) startups especially in emerging markets where the portion of unbanked people are still quite high. Loans offered also varies from consumptive ones (think credit card without the actual card) such as pay-later service providers to productive ones like working capital service providers. This project indeed serves a high-value, high-impact niche which I believe can be beneficial to Cardano ecosystem and stakeholder in the medium and long term by enhancing utility and adoption of Cardano blockchain technology.\n\nThe solution of building DeFi dApps specializing in lending and borrowing applied to small and medium companies/enterprises corresponds with the challenge where the proposal is submitted. It is also in resonance with the critical goal and strategic mission to delivering solution to real world problem by leveraging Cardano technology stack. Lastly, I would like to point out that by giving the Cardano community early seed round/series in funding this brilliant project through Catalyst, it will maximize the return for early backers and investors. I believe this is a more favorable mechanism rather than having venture capitalist (VC) to have it before the members of our community. I hope the teams can realize and understand if this project or proposal does get funded, it is initially a community effort, and they will try our best to honor it.\n\nKudos to the teams with intending to not taking Catalyst fund space for next development phase of the project so other impactful and potential projects wanting to grow in Cardano can be funded and have some rooms. I also like the fact that in comment section proposer confirmed that this project is exclusively Cardano-only and staying true to their roots. However, since I am a big believer of Future is Multichain and fan of interoperability I believe at the more advanced stage they will start to build bridge so maybe wen incorporate other blockchains or port to Layer-2 solutions such as Milkomeda or Mamba, further multiplying the impacts, values, and benefits of this project to wider audience.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Timeframe and key milestones of the planned projects are sufficiently detailed. The first phase will be depending on Catalyst fund and Minimum Valuable Product (MVP) scheduled to be delivered in eight months. Builders involved looks legit and well-known, especially Vacuumlabs who presented us with the WingRiders DEX and AdaLite wallet so I will not worry about the team here since they have proven themselves before building fully working Cardano products. If you have any concern, you can google search their name and the LinkedIn looks okay. I also have tried the WingRiders DEX several times and it is as good as other DEX like MinSwap or SundaeSwap. In fact, I quite like the theme and the UI/UX.\n\nI analyzed the budget and calculated that the hourly rate of the engineers is about USD 60 and USD 90 for the lead. The marketing manager, product manager, UI/UX designer, and CSS engineer earn half (USD 30) of the (non-leads) engineers. CTO, CFO, Legal & Compliance Officer, and Project Manager earn the same (USD 60) as the (non-leads) engineers. These figures are fair and standard when compared to other product and development-themed proposals in this Fund 9. The rationale mentioned in business mechanics is also sound and the design makes good sense to me. The model and plan are proven at least in the Web2 version of these kind of companies or projects. Plausible risks in human resource and interested lenders are well-addressed and elaborated enough, indicating good level of awareness of the proposer team regarding any downsides. Therefore, I have very minimal concern in the feasibility aspect of this proposal.\n\nSince both borrowers and lenders will be KYB\\KYCed, this will allow smooth on or off-ramping to fiat through Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and seamless interconnection to real world utilization. Also, the first Cardano native stablecoin Djed is already on testnet and in final stage of the development. I am sure they are ready to use next year 2023 when this proposal is projected to be delivered. Still, if there is unforeseeable delay in Djed\u2019s development, Circle or Tether-issued stablecoins can be serviceable for the moment.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Roadmap is provided and phased clearly enough. The MVP will be delivered in 8 months though I will not be surprised if there is any delay. In Cardano, we always measure twice or thrice and cut once. The KPI\u2019s are what we want to see in the project and represents growth, effectiveness, and efficiency in borrowing and lending platform. They are centered around the size, quantity, and quality of value involved and user base growth. Since this is a commercial, proprietary project there will not be any GitHub link to track the actual work. I strongly advise that proposer to mention the communications channels where community member can track the progress and development. Usual channel such as Twitter, Discord, Medium, Youtube will entertain the majority needs. Mention of AMAs for direct communication is also appreciable and signifies the openness and transparency from the makers of the project.\n\nOne thing I consider off is no mention of public testnet in any of the phase/milestone/timeline. Please mention the public testnet can be accessed since not even the word \u201ctestnet\u201d mentioned in the proposal which is concerning for a dApp development proposal and project. I believe for any dApps involving the movement of value of significance, their development will be very much benefitted from simulations, trial, and errors by deploying in testnet first before mainnet launch.

To begin, they provide a successful case study of Aave whose TVL once peaked at almost $19b in 2021. Secondly, the proposal has specifically described how their platform will work. There are several actors involved in a lending process such as the loan broker, the borrower, and the backer. As for the backer, I like the way they create more approaches for different kinds of people. For those with small funds, they can contribute their money to the Senior pool and this congregated money will be lent to receive profit in return. The special thing about the Senior pool is that its investors have the highest protection because their tranche in the loan is considered Senior - that means that they are the first to receive the interest rate repayments and any principal repayments from the loan. As for the backers who would like to invest all by themself, they will receive the projit equivalent to the risk investment they accept. However, there will also be a team of Auditors who review the deal and support the Backers with the decision-making process. Another notable thing is that the loan broker can create their own lending fund with a diverse investment thesis. This will give the borrowers a wide range of options. As for the borrowers, they will be carefully reviewed by the brokers, proper due diligence and risk assessment will also be done to ensure that the lending is safe. Speaking of safeness, the proposal also shows a strong emphasis on this aspect in order to avoid Sybil attacks and remain fraud resistant. To be specific, \u201cEach Fund Delegate and each new Fund need to be approved by the DAO\u2026 extensive KYC/KYB procedure will be needed\u201d. With reference to the risks, three have been mentioned and the proposal does provide solutions for the first two. However, for the last one which is Senior pool ratio, they still have not proposed any detailed plan to mitigate the problem. \u201cimplementing processes\u201d is rather a vague word and they should consider this matter carefully since the pool ratio always plays an important role in every crypto lending platform.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan is divided into 3 phrases.

Another thing that the proposal should provide is the key metrics which can help the community to evaluate the project progress and growth. As for the budget breakdown, they list a number of salaries for each position which is quite detailed. A notable thing is that they do ask for a fund of 150k USD for smart contract audit which is really good since an audit is necessary to maintain the high level of platform security. However, little information relating to this has been mentioned in the plan. One of the biggest downsides of this project is the team member list. The team members are mentioned with little details about their experience. All it has is the name and the working position. Worse than that, this is still not the complete team since the execution team is not included till the project is funded and there is no provided reasons for this deficiency.

It established a decentralized trust system for people to lend to deserving companies through smart contracts.\n\nThe proposal realized the potential of the credit industry and provided crypto loans for a part of the world, which led to the success of some pioneers who built uncollateralized crypto loan platforms.\n\n The writer described the mechanics of lending protocol as different, but the high-level business structure is similar and often various factors join in a lending process. To illustrate, a loan broker finds out the borrowers and due diligence, sets the loan term and signs a loan agreement while the borrower has to have a good cash and budget sheet. After making the trade, the backers will check the quality and if they feel suitable, they will support the budget, which will lead to them receiving increased yield of the loan- always sent before default occurs. Meanwhile, the rest of the loan is funded from a crowdfunded senior which any retail investors can contribute and that means that they are the first person to receive repayment. However, if the loan defaults, any proceeds are first paid to senior tranche holders while the funds from the senior pool are usually automatically allocated to loan after loan has enough backer support in some leverage ratio( usually 20:80 junior). At the same time, the proposal provides some lock-ups on investment courses to reach good cash and cash-reserve management and work as DAOs and it has the right to change the business mechanics.\n\nSecondly, the proposal mentioned the solution that they submitted is that all trade runs in smart contracts and the platform should be a technical solution provider. Loan underwriters are platform actors and have the license to offer financial services as well as actors who possess funds and have business and financial service knowledge called the backer. Fund delegates can establish lending funds based on background and investment thesis. For instance, some funds can offer loans for small and medium companies in new markets and set up the lending fund as minimum and minimal loan size, late payments fees,.. After the fund attracts enough funding from the investors, the fund delegate will bring to the borrow and trade, then, they come in to back deal according to the leverage rate of the fund. Following this, the proposal introduces a role of auditors and anyone can become auditor after paying a certain government tokens as collateral. As for loans, a random auditor will do independent work, if they will work a good job, they will be rewarded while they will be slashed if they lose. Some revenue-generating fees to be collected and distributed to the actors in the platform like governance incentivized issuance, Senior, Junior pool, fun delegate and a part of the fees will go to the budget of the project to fund platform operations( loan interest, underwriting fee, late interest and principal repayment fee and loan early repayment). In case of default loans, the fund delegate will respond to debt collection and can oblige to take action if necessary and additional, if it brings bad impact on Junior and Senior pool, the fund delegate need to find additional backers to add funds. Beside, each fund delegate and new fund need to be accepted by DAO and the progress will be less complicated but extensive kYc/ KYB is needed in order to prevent protocols from Sybil attacks and be fraud resistant.\n\nThe team realized the risks that they have to face in the future and have solutions to solve it. The first point is that they have trouble with talent retention and some could find different priorities, but if someone wants to leave, they still haveVacuumlabs- holding company has over 300 developers, PM, designer and data scientists. However, I think that the proposal can provide an adjusted leverage ratio to share profits for talent. Likewise, the backers play an important role in the ecosystem and the team collaboration with Wincent- a leading crypto market marker with over $3B and under 300K trade per day. While, senior pool ratio is slower onboard and they ensure the trust true to diligence is done at the highest point.  At the same time, the team shows the website or GitHub to provide more information about the project, namely Relevant link 1 https://nu.fi, Relevant link 2 https://www.wincent.co, Relevant link 3 https://vacuumlabs.com.\n\nIn conclusion, from the ideas mentioned above, I think that this proposal can contribute to the development of the Cardano blockchain to improve more adoption, feedback, growth and innovations.

They show that each member has a professional background with a deep understanding of specialized knowledge in relevant fields( credit, crypto, law, run business,\u2026). As well, they also have had experience working with The Cardano before and achieved achievements( creating Vacuumlabs, AdaLite wallet, NuFi platform, Wingriders DEX and Jamonbread NFT marketplace).

In contrast, the project success looks like when 1 year after they build our MVP, the platform allows the smart companies loans over 100 million USD in a ratio 1:4( backer pool: senior pool).

With budgetary support, underwriters, small lenders and smart companies will benefit from this project.  This proposal intends to build MVP/an uncollateralized crypto loan platform. Their major purpose is to build trust in every party involved and to allow normal users to have the possibility to lend at institutional rates to good projects, as banks do in the real world. Since KYC/KYB procedures will be needed, blockchain technologies play a crucial role in helping secure their mechanism protocol, and the whole process does require decentralized smart contracts. Therefore, I think this proposal\u2019s solution is necessary. \nRegarding whether this project adds value to Cardano, I am not sure about the answer since it does not clarify relevant metrics that serve to indicate its impacts on the Cardano ecosystem. From my perspective, a discussion should be given to indicate in a more straightforward manner that if succeeded, whether or not this project may attract more Catalyst proposals or create a greater flow of transactions which enhance the impact of the Cardano ecosystem and strengthen the importance of the solution. \nThey propose a business mechanism protocol in which roles of different parties are described, analyze some of the potential risks, and provide steps to mitigate the possible issues. While there was an excellent description of these aspects, I think it would be better to have a brief summary of the main functions of the platform. \"", "q0r": 3, "q1": "\"A roadmap with 3 phases has been provided. It can be seen that it is the 1st phase of 8 months that they are requesting funding. It indicates which activity would be carried out. I consider the plan not very detailed. It does need to specify how long it is expected to occur and which would be the expected outcome in each phase. Also, it does need to indicate in this part of the proposal how many roles would be required. \nRegarding the budget breakdown of the first phase, it has been presented with average costs of a month, including salaries and additional expenses. In terms of salaries, I would expect the proposal to specify the number of working hours in total, and other costs should be split down further, assuming that this would probably make it easier to assess whether the requested budgetary support is reasonable.\nWith regard to the team, there is neither description of each member nor LinkedIn profiles. Despite this, the team with several CEOs has provided some reference links to their companies operating in the crypto market. Interestingly, one of which has been created in Cardano and another one is Wincent, a leading crypto market maker with $3B+ daily volume and 300K+ daily transactions. This is,  without a doubt, a powerful testament to their talent. Still, I would prefer a brief description of each member\u2019s relevant skills, experience and background and what roles they would play in this project could have been indicated.\nAlso, it would be necessary to indicate the number of persons who will work in this project and the number of those in the executive team they intend to hire as well as which profile they are going to hire.  \nConsidering aspects above, I think to assess feasibility correctly, more details should be provided. \n\"", "q1r": 3, "q2": "\"They have defined KPIs clearly. However, it would be nice if these KPIs could be aligned with the 8-month roadmap so we could better understand when and how they would be measured. This would make this project seem to be more auditable. \nI would expect to know who in the team will be in charge of KPIs control and how they plan to communicate these KPIs and other updates on the progress and expenditure to the community which would increase transparency. \nThe success description is brief and does not indicate this project\u2019s goal in the short term. A more detailed description of what success would look like would help evaluate the project\u2019s impacts on the Cardano ecosystem during/after the implementation of the plan. \nConsidering aspects above, I would say this project is easily auditable if some other relevant metrics are given.\n\"", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4113", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 2, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "We are creating a platform where underwriters, small lenders and smart companies will be able to help and trust each other through decentralised smart contracts.", "experience": "Vacuumlabs created in Cardano:\nAdaLite wallet\nNuFi platform\nWingriders DEX\nJamonbread NFT marketplace\nWincent is a leading crypto market maker with $3B+ daily volume and 300K+ daily transactions."}
