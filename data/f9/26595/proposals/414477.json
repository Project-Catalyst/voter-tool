However, I did not find the idea of \u200b\u200bthis proposal so innovative. It is about creating a mobile application, which would operate on Android and IOS, to convert Ada into the local currency of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The proponent claims that many Africans are resistant to receiving payments in cryptocurrencies due to the difficulty in converting them, but I believe that this functionality already exists on Binance, in a very simple way. Instead of suggesting the creation of another Dapp, it might be interesting to educate the local population about the use of the tools that already exist. I believe that in this way the objectives of the challenge would be achieved, that is, more people would start buying/selling/delegating Ada, becoming active members of the Cardano community, as they would better understand how to carry out transactions on the blockchain, which would then expand the popularity of our ecosystem. I believe that the asking price of $44,000 should not be directed towards developing an application that would have functionality that already exists. The proponent cites some advantages of the project he intends to develop, such as being \u201cpossible to receive ADA cryptocurrencies from anywhere, giving the possibility to go through any African telecom operator for conversions into Mobile Money\u201d and optimizing the \u201cconversion structure to maintain rates as low as possible while opening up its API to any developer who wants to integrate it for ADA to Mobile Money conversions.\u201d It would be interesting if these features were better explained; in this way, perhaps we readers of the proposal would understand the differential of this service, if compared to the brokers that already exist. Therefore, unfortunately, my opinion (based on the arguments given) is that the proposal does not have much difference in relation to pre-existing Dapps with the same purpose; despite achieving the objectives of the challenge by facilitating transactions in Ada, the asking cost is high, and I believe that it could be better used in a more focused approach to educate the target audience, such as, for example, holding some events/workshops addressing this theme, teaching people. So, in general, the proposal fits with what we are looking for here, the idea is good, although I think that the same topic could be approached in another way, which maybe can better take advantage of the applications that already exist on this subject.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "In general the proposal is very viable, the topic that I would like a little more detail would be the script. The explanation regarding this is reasonable, but it is not detailed enough so that we can understand well how the process of producing this project would develop. The whole is divided into phases, and these are briefly explained. Some phases last longer than others, but none of them have very detailed activities. It would be important for the phases to be divided more specifically, such as by month, and for the activities to be better detailed, for example in \u201cCreation of the ADA Exchange App wallet with the possibility of sending and receiving ADAs\u201d. This activity is complex, what would need to be done to make it happen? When it comes to the budget, the level of detail is quite choppy. For example, $7,000 is requested for 3 activities: \u201cDetailed Study of the Problem, Implementation of a Basic Architecture, and Grappa Proposal\u201d. How would those 7k be divided? How much would be for each, and why would this value be necessary? In other parts, as in administration development, with the senior web, we know that the work would be 6 hours a day with 10 dollars per hour (quite detail and full understanding of the expense). However, when we get to UI/UX design, $1350 is asked, but we don't know how many hours the designer would work, so our level of understanding has already dropped. Therefore, I think that the explanation should be more balanced, that we know better how the money would be used in all cases. Finally, looking at the team, this part of the proposal looks great. A part of the team is presented on the attached website (I had to dig around a bit to find it); where we see your linkedin and twitter photos, names and profiles. Here in the scope of the proposal, I present a curriculum of them, and we know if they have experience with Cardano or not; for example in:\u201d Vital yengayenga: Community Manager | RS content strategy, Digital Marketing, Graphic Design, User Experience Design (UX), Copywriting, Copywriting, User Experience Writing, Content Strategy, Blog, Languages \u200b\u200b: French | English + linkedin profile; and also: Luccin Masirika: Web and Web 3.0 developer, Software Engineer | Web & Blockchain Developer at Update Developers, Development and design of new relevant web technologies. Design of optimized web applications, Data structure, Productivity and professionalism on adequate solutions,, Specialized in JavaScript d, Backend: NodeJs, Language: French + linkedin profile\u201d. In fact the presentation of the members of this team is very rich and satisfying. Finally, I think the feasibility is good, having some points that can certainly be improved, so that the process is better understood, that we can understand more about the project development process, mainly, which is the part that is less detailed .", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Unfortunately the suggested auditability is quite superficial. Regarding the process, it is defined that updates will be posted on Gitbook and Discord. But what kind of updates, exactly? And how often will they be posted? How will the community be aware when news goes live? I would like these details to be clarified better, so that we have more peace of mind about how this development process would be monitored. The project is complex, creating a Dapp always requires a multidisciplinary team, so it is important that we carefully follow every step, from small advances to problems, and how they were resolved. The information given is the beginning of the right path to be taken, but it is not detailed enough; Will they report on their work routines, the unfolding of the phases, or just the partial results obtained? Talking about the ultimate success, the proponent defines it as the existence of the \u201cFirst tests of the application by beta, to fix the first version of the application that will be published\u201d. However, in my view, this is not enough to understand whether the project actually achieved the desired results. In addition to the launch of Dapp, we would need to understand several things: 1) how was the acceptance of the target audience? 2) has there been an increase in the circulation of Ada in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as a result of this initiative? 3) how are people who have started using Dapp involved with Cardano, become active members of our community, and if so, through which projects? 4) what was the number of transactions reached per month, and of Ada circulating? Finally, we need more data so that we can truly understand whether the specific objectives of the challenge were met. In general, I think that the auditability of this proposal lacked a lot of depth - it is well underway, but it does not correspond to the totality of information that we should know to guarantee that the project would be well monitored and studied, after being launched. Much more detail would be needed for this topic to be adequate, both in terms of the auditability of the process and the final results - the proposal was keeping very good until then, but unfortunately I declined in this last topic of analysis.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2, "reply": "We have read this last part on auditability, and we say thank you for these very crucial remarks for this project, but then let's point out that we have launched anquette with google form on how the population could, 1. understand the project and 2.

But in point of fact, I also need you to answer some of my questions, such as the fact that the current CEX exchanges in the Congo are not even available for you to come up with an idea like that because they are so underdeveloped. The ADA exchange app, which includes integration with personal wallets, is the next step. Another thing to consider is the legality of the situation; in that area, the government has really acknowledged the presence of cryptocurrencies, and people are able to conduct normal business. I hope you guys can answer my questions and provide additional information. to add to your proposal. The team believes that the rollout will take place in the Congo.

When users want to convert ADA cryptocurrency, they must have an account at centralized exchanges to be able to convert it into local currency. The problem with centralized exchanges is that KYC is complicated, security is poor, and users are forced to trust the exchange. those who do not know the technology background will find it more difficult to participate. so the Team proposed Design a mobile application that allows the exchange of ADA cryptocurrency to local currency through the Mobile Money app. If this is done successfully then any user with a smartphone can own and use ADA easily. This proposal was originally designed for use in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They say that the App will work like a Forex exchange allowing users to exchange ADA from their wallet to Local Currency and vice versa. If successful, it could be applied elsewhere as well. They designed a mobile app that converts ADA into local African currency. If this is done, the ADA has the potential to be widespread in Africa. If successful it will also be deployed elsewhere. They presented themselves using Flutter an open-source framework from Google to build apps and using MongoDB as the database. The proposal raised the risk of attracting users and said that with this mobile app it would be easier to exchange ADA in local currency.

However, I think the Proposer should clarify the information \"Research the problem in detail\nImplement a basic architecture, Recommend a graphical model to use\" to me it is quite general, I think it is necessary to clarify specifically what the work to do, how many people each job needs, and how much time it is expected to take to complete.

The last part is internal testing, unfortunately, I don't have this information about the time to finish the proposal. Furthermore, an estimated start date for the project is not given anywhere in the proposal. To continue to develop new features, they said that they will continue to return to the catalyst in the next round to ask for more funding. In this Fund 9, the team only implemented this one project, this is a plus point showing the focus of the proposal.

The proposers claim that this project will function similarly to the well-known Foreign Exchange Market, or Forex in short. But what sets it apart from Forex and other potential competitors out there is that the ADA Exchange App - the name of this project - will be optimizing conversion structure to minimize the amount of transaction fees and the native API will be publicized so that any interested developers could utilize the app. In addition, the team also plans to put in use Flutter, an open source framework by Google, to create the mobile version of the app, available on both Android and iOS. \nSo far, I believe that the proposal is lacking the pivotal key metrics (or KPIs) needed to measure the progress or state of success for the project.

But also, we organize meetups on cardano, after meetup we disburse some amount in ADA, the second time the member asked how to get the amount in local currency, explaining the processse they were discouraged and I'm sure the majority still have more than 50ADA given.

Here the proposer has raised a very big problem and is of concern today, that is: \"Many Africans refuse to receive ADA cryptocurrency because of the difficulties they face in exchanging ADA into a locally used currency\". I found that, in the beginning, the proponent identified the audience they wanted to target and the current state of the problem, helping people understand the information and impact of the problem. Africa is an area that has not developed, and still needs to improve and innovate a lot, many areas are still limited, which leads to Blockchain is an area that is even more difficult to access for people African people. Therefore, it is extremely important to reduce the barrier to entering this community due to people refusing to receive ADA cryptocurrency due to difficulties in exchanging ADA into a currency used in the country. Here, I see that the proposed group has come up with a solution to solve it, it has identified most of the problems of the challenge. As we all know, now all over the world people can easily access technology regularly through tools such as phones, computers, etc., so designing a mobile application allowing the exchange of ADA cryptocurrency to a local currency through Mobile Money is a fast, convenient solution. However, I think the proponent should plan to design and build the interface to ensure it is both attractive and user-friendly, and suitable for everyone, from all walks of life, to improve usability and familiarity for users. To successfully implement the project, the proponents have foreseen the risk they face that is attracting users to use this application in the DRC because there are many Africans who do not know about cryptocurrencies. In this part, the group has raised the risks but has not given specific disarmament to overcome this difficulty. In my opinion, the proponent should add this part to the project to increase the persuasion and prepare solutions to solve arising problems, which will help the team be more proactive, and handle quickly and accurately more precisely. As mentioned above, my suggestion in this part is to design an attractive interface but still ensure the familiarity to excite users is also a solution, I think that it helps a bit for the team to propose in planning the implementation of this project.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This proposal presented full information and layout in 3 parts: timeline, development roadmap; budget, and project participants to make it easy for everyone to follow.

Currently, the information presented with the main stages is stage 0: Proof of Concept (up to 1 month of development), stage 1: Active development (up to 3 months): Create ADA Exchange application wallet with the ability to send and receive ADA, and there will be 3 months to implement this phase, stage 2 Conversion solutions (up to 1 months of development), stage 3 Testing with internal users, but it will be clearer and easier to control if the proponent continues to break down the roadmap into milestones, periods smaller, such as by month, by week, and at the same time determine the main tasks and tasks of each month, each week, what is the target result to be achieved, who will be responsible for monitoring and checking the entire implementation process and the results of those jobs. In addition, these jobs will be done in sequence or can be done in parallel to save time and costs, then I see that the proponent has detailed how to allocate capital and explain how they use that capital For example: developing administrative software with 2 developers premium web (6 hours per day due to $10 per hour) x 2: 6240 USD; or Develop the user part with 5 Senior Mobile developers (IOS and Android sheet forms at the same time) (6 hours per day due to $8 per hour) x5: 18720 USD; Integrated mobile money Aggregators 250 USD,\u2026. With a detailed budget plan like this, I believe it will be easy for everyone to track and control the capital, which makes the proposal more convincing. However, if possible, I think that the proposed team should deduct a small part of the budget to set up a reserve fund in case of unexpected occurrences or a reward fund for individuals and groups that work well to encourage them. Creative and effective working spirit. Regarding the project participants, the proposed team has also detailed 10 participants, information about the full name and title of each person along with the addition of LinkedIn to help the community easily follow, check more information. However, I think it would be more clear and convincing if the proponent could mention the members' previous working experience, qualifications, and suitability for the particular project.

In addition, the proponent has not stated that for each phase of this proposal, the results will be published. Where, what is the result, for example, for phase 1, is the result to be produced as a demo, a video or a presentation, or a specific website? I think, in this section, the proponent should give more specific KPIs or metrics to easily measure the progress and results of the project. As to what the success of the project looks like, the publisher also said that the first tests of the application by beta testers to fix the first version of the application will be published. Although it can be seen that this product is related to the challenge, there is not enough information to confirm the success of the project.

The solution to the problem is fairly explained - the application is available for both IOS and Androids. The example of Forex helps users to imagine how the application will work. The proposer mentions a clear approach to designing the application (using Flutter for the framework, Mongodb as a database). While the reason for choosing Flutter is clearly delivered, the proposer could also demonstrate how Mongodb is an optimal choice for database for this particular app. The main risk is the lack of cryptocurrency users in Africa. However, the proposer fails to come up with an effective way to mitigate this risk. The proposer should bring forward research that shows the reasons why African people don\u2019t use cryptocurrency widely. The possible reasons could vary from the lack of awareness about cryptocurrency, financial problems, ignorance, no transactions - many of which won\u2019t improve even with the presence of ADA to Mobile Money application. Therefore, to mitigate this risk, the proposer should focus on promoting the adoption of cryptocurrency alongside with developing a conversion application, since if people don\u2019t know about cryptocurrency in the first place, there will be no chance for them to use the application, not vice versa.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The timeline is clear and detailed enough, although some milestones, specific dates could be included to increase feasibility.

It is worth considering how these users give feedback and if these feedback will be open to external viewing for transparency. In the budget breakdown, funds needed in stage 1 and 2 are detailed and sufficient. However, in stage 0, the proposer should account more specifically for the fund of 7000 USD. How will this amount of money be allocated to each of the steps listed? If provided with an explanation, the feasibility will be increased. A point is that the budget does not account for marketing expenses. I understand that maybe the commercialization of the application belongs to further stages while this stage of funding only focuses on application development. If so, I think the proposer should brief through their future plan regarding the marketing aspects to show feasibility and careful consideration for further stages.

In total, more than 36 billion transactions were processed on platforms providing mobile services on the continent. the success of mobile money in africa is due to its accessibility and ease of use, banks are losing the market because of intermediary procedures, but the mobile money market is not efficient for two reasons, firstly, the limits of regional transactions, secondly, the limits of transactions per day and/or month. Cryptocurrency is a solution to two problems of mobile money, but it is not very popular (few people accept it and use it). It is acceptable in a region if and only if it can be used, exchanged, etc... Third reason, international payments, we can accept in Africa to be paid in Euro or $ because we can exchange in local currency and use it, if this is not possible, we will be forced to refuse the use of the currency even with its advantages, There are of course several problems with the adoption of crypto in Africa but that's the goal of the catalyst, with several information and meetup and promotion of Dapps in Africa, we will be able to make the adoption of ADA in Africa.

They introduce a little about ADA but still don't mention the customers they target, so for example, add customers in the field of business, foreign transactions or online shoppers.

Accordingly, a mobile application is proposed to be developed, providing the service of exchanging ADA, and initially deployed in the area of Democratic Republic of Congo. Technically, the platform is described to integrate different ADA wallets, yet, I suggest that the author describe more about what specific wallets they are aiming for collaboration for a better vision about its impact. Besides, in my opinion, the exchange fees are mentioned to be kept as low as possible, though some clear expected figures should be given for better assessment on how it attracts potential users and how possible it is for maintaining the long-term operation. Moreover, the risk stated in this part is appropriate, but not mitigated properly. I believe that the team should reconsider to develop some strategy such as promotions, advertisements, crypto workshops to get more users. In general, I think that this is a possible idea that may popularize the use of cryptos, especially ADA. However, the popularity of cryptos is also based on many different criterias such as the adoption of technology, the knowledge standard of the local population, the development and living standard of the country,... As a result, from my personal point of view, developing such a platform would not generate too much impact on increasing the number of ADA users. I highly recommend that the team conduct a survey, collecting the community\u2019s attitude towards the mentioned application (what other criterias should the team focus on developing, what functions are favored by the majority, how the application generates impact towards their intention to adopt ADA,...) to determine the necessity of the mentioned application.

The information that can be obtained in this part is very obvious, describing the salary per working hour, total working hours and total fund requested for each sector, the number of staff needed as well as the tasks for each phase.

In total, more than 36 billion transactions were processed on platforms providing mobile services on the continent. the success of mobile money in africa is due to its accessibility and ease of use, banks are losing the market because of intermediary procedures, but the mobile money market is not efficient for two reasons, firstly, the limits of regional transactions, secondly, the limits of transactions per day and/or month. Cryptocurrency is a solution to two problems of mobile money, but it is not very popular (few people accept it and use it). It is acceptable in a region if and only if it can be used, exchanged, etc... Third reason, international payments, we can accept in Africa to be paid in Euro or $ because we can exchange in local currency and use it, if this is not possible, we will be forced to refuse the use of the currency even with its advantages, There are of course several problems with the adoption of crypto in Africa but that's the goal of the catalyst, with several information and meetup and promotion of Dapps in Africa, we will be able to make the adoption of ADA in Africa.
