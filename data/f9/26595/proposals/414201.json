The proposer would like to build the most trusted, user-friendly NFT ecosystem on Cardano. I think, this is a very good idea and it belongs to the challenge. If this platform is available, it will help improve user experience and increase NFT liquidity as more NFTs are discoverable by potential purchasers, and enhance market efficiency. In short, this is a very promising project and I fully support them. ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This feasibility part is quite detailed. Every member is mentioned clearly. The proposer introduces their name, position, experience in the related field and attached Github or Linkedin link for more information. I think, this is a very good team who are capable of implementing the project. Besides, the plan is made quite well. I know their targeted goal, main task for each month, and each task listed clearly with timeline for completion, but I would like the proposer to clearly tell who will execute for each job. For the budget required, I think this amount is reasonable for each type of position, and the proposer clearly shows how long this task will last, but a little more explannation is needed for how this cost calculated. After all, this part is okay for me.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It is possible to check the development of this project. As mentioned by the proposer, monthly reports will be published, adherence to the work plan, so community could base on this for checking. Moreover, after the launching of this products, there will be product survey of users and recordings of meetings of NFT marketplaces that be conducted and published for community. Therefore, it is not hard for community to keep up with the progress of the project. However, I think, more communication channels between the community and the team should be needed for product feedback such as via social media Twitter, Telegram, Discord,..", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3246", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 0, "ng": 5, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Overall, this is a relatively solid assessment. However, the assessor seems to state that the proposal is very strong in terms of it's potential impact/alignment with the challenge objectives, and doesn't give any reasoning for why the proposal did not receive five stars in this section.\n\nAlso, there are a few areas where the assessor is asking for such granular detail that I don't know if it would improve the feasibility or auditability of the proposal:\n\nFor example, the assessor suggests \"the proposer should include exact information about who will be in charge of which task, how many people will do that task.\" But given that our team is made up of two full-stack engineers, and one backend engineer, it's hard to provide information on who will be handling each individual task. And we hoped that it was evident that Giovanni, who we listed as the co-founder of the project, would be leading its technical aspects.\n\nAnd with regards to the ability of an engineer to work full-time on the project, two members of our team are currently working part-time on ArgusNFT with the desire to work full-time. So even if we get all our proposals funded this funding round, we should have sufficient development capacity for one engineer working on the proposal full-time.  \n\nLast, with regard to the auditability section, the assessor's main issue is that the proposal does not specify the platform on which we'll publish our progress. Of course, we mentioned there will be monthly progress reports made to Project Catalyst which will be made public. But we also typically announce significant milestones on our Medium and Twitter accounts. We're also trying to go above and beyond in the proposal's auditability by coducting a product survey and making the results public - AND anonymizing and publishing feedback from meetings with three NFT marketplaces about our search engine API, so the Catalyst community can gauge the overall success and impact of their investment in our efforts. So while not mentioning that we'd be doing this on Medium and pointing to the Medium entries on Twitter, we feel we're taking extraordinary measures and putting extra effort into ensuring this proposal is both feasible and auditable. \n\nFor these reasons, I ask that you please exclude this assessment from those that are taken into consideration."}, {"id": 12592, "q0": "I was impressed when you analyzed the aspects and growth of the NFT market and the potential of the Cardano ecosystem, how you analyzed the weaknesses and shortcomings of the search engines, and the researches of If you are talking about the extremely powerful search engines of Amazon or major platforms, although these are not professional research articles, it shows that you have invested a lot in research.\nThe information about your search engine features and facilities provided is complete and detailed, to the point where I find it very satisfying. That's right, sometimes I have trouble seeing interesting NFTs on someone profile picture or articles without knowing how to find it on the market, it frustrates me and I can't buy it. If this problem is solved, I guarantee the liquidity of the NFT market will increase tremendously. This is what I like best about your tool.\nI suggest you add to this tool the ability to recognize a user's preferences for certain NFT categories, which can be gathered through searches, clicks on NFT that the tool recommends. Then recommend NFTs to more users across multiple social networks, this is like Facebook's advertising AI, but it's much more accurate and effective, it stimulates people to buy, increases liquidity for the market sales.\nYou have presented your views on some of the project's difficulties and I find you quite confident that you will solve this problem. That's good. It is quite simple to understand the project has 2 main goals, but the process or strategy is very complicated, Thank you very much for taking the time to help me understand the project as well as possible.

Details are provided regarding the qualifications and experience of team members and their roles. I have no opinion on this part, because I think the information provided is satisfactory.
