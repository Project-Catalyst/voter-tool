It is often paper based making it subject to damages, hardly distributable and restrained access.\u00a0", "f6_no_assessments": 6, "f6_rating": 4.555555555555555, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1622, "q0": "In terms of impact, this proposal is undoubtedly of high value and is very well aligned with the objectives of the challenge. The idea is to create a decentralized platform to gather information about the health of the population of Cameroon. This initiative is necessary since the management of this data is still done in a very archaic way in the country, the proponents claim that, for example, the information is sometimes still recorded on paper, which makes it much more fragile, subject to damage, restricted access and even being poorly managed (eg patients themselves do not have easy access to them, but other people may see this, depending on access to the material). The proposal aligns perfectly with the specific objective in the challenge summary of \u201cincreasing the number of dapps and products available for community use that help enrich the ecosystem with new use cases\u201d. Proponents explain well what would be the advantages of building the Dapp for various audiences. For patients, it would be a way to have more guaranteed access to their health information, they could trade this data for research purposes, they could select some data to show in consultations, without having to expose their entire history, they could control much better everything I did about their health conditions, contributing for example to a better diagnosis and treatment of their illnesses. As well as for the local population, health professionals would also benefit a lot, for example, for doctors, there would be the possibility of knowing the entire history of the patient without necessarily having a face-to-face consultation, and the information would be passed on with more accuracy and security than for example if patients only report what they feel in online consultations; for pharmacists it would also facilitate access to information, as it is said that sometimes in the country people do not have access to hospitals and medical appointments, so they go directly to pharmacies in search of treatment, and often do not know how to explain the problem well or give wrong information (due to lack of knowledge, unfortunately). Anyway, Dapp would make life easier for different audiences, without a doubt. And it is very positive as the proponents are already aware that, as it is something very new and different from the usual, the project would need strong marketing, which would be done through \u201cvarious marketing and informational campaigns about the existence and usefulness of the project\u201d. of our platform. Our campaigns will be designed to target specific audiences (doctors, patients, insurers...etc) and we will use social media, local radio and local TV\u201d. It is also very important that they explain a little about the technical aspects and that involve the blockchain, as in the parts that talk about \u201csmart contract in the cardano blockchain that will help to maintain references (document hashes)\nA file-oriented blockchain on which the generated medical records (text document, images, audio files\u2026 etc) will be saved.\u201d However, I would like to make a few observations: first and foremost, how would local people, who are not familiar with blockchain, be educated to use Dapp? What would that user experience look like? How would the interface be built, in terms of design? Would it be a dApp for mobile or computer? I believe the idea is very good and will probably bring many benefits to Cardano, with the increase of active members in our community, more smart contracts being minted on the network etc; still, these more practical details about using the dApp would be important in the proposal.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is viable as all 3 main parts (script, use of funding and team presentation) are well defined, but I would like to make some suggestions to improve this topic further. Regarding the roadmap, the way the proponents present us with the project development process is very positive: they break the whole thing down into steps and explain what actions would be necessary for each. But two things could be improved here. First, it would be important for us to have a temporal notion of how long the activities would last and for when certain partial results are expected. It would also be interesting if some activities were better detailed. For example in step 1, partnerships would be established with health institutions and also with domain experts to produce the MVP; How would these contacts be made? How would local hospitals, labs and clinics understand the project well since they are not well versed in blockchain technology? It would be positive if we knew how the technology would be presented to these partners, how the project would be explained in an accessible way for everyone, and how these institutions would perceive the advantages for them as well. In step 2 it is said that a study of the state of records management would be done: who would be responsible for this part, and how would it be performed? Overall, past information allows us to have some understanding of what will be done, but this understanding could be made even stronger by providing more detail. The same I say for the division of funding. They are asking for 27 thousand dollars, which in my view is a very fair amount for the complexity of the development of this dApp and for all the phases of work that involve it, but I believe that the parties also asked to be better explained. What would the work routine of the professional who would be responsible for design and architecture look like? What would his hourly rate be, how long would he work for the $6,000 to be paid? Regarding travel and accommodation, who would be traveling and for what purpose, how much money would be allocated for this? What would the commercialization step be, exactly, and why would it cost $3,000? I agree that the amount requested makes sense with the project, but if it were better argued, we would understand even more the need for such an investment. Now, speaking of the team involved, Megan is part of the Wada group, which in my view makes us feel at ease that the project is in good hands, as this group is already well known in Catalyst for its work and for your funded proposals. But it would be beneficial if the team members were presented in a more extensive and detailed way. For example, about Nkalla and Mango, we know that they will be the lead software architect of the platform and lead software developer, respectively. But it would be important to have some examples of work that they have developed previously, so that we have a better understanding of their curriculum. For these reasons, feasibility is good, but not yet perfect.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "As with the previous topic, the bidders provide us with good information here, but some adjustments would still be needed for the bid's auditability to be optimal. Talking about progress, they define what partial results are expected for each step. For example for step 1, the KPIs would be \u201chow many healthcare institutions have we hired to work with us as domain experts + how many of them will be testing the MVP at its launch?\u201d. In the case of the second step, information such as \u201cwhat information did we refine + what did we learn from the domain expert that we didn't know before + what specification documentation did we produce\u201d would have to be considered. My suggestions for this part of the proposal are: 1) it would be necessary for these questions that were raised to be properly studied and answered by the team, and then some member of the team should make these answers public and accessible to members of the Cardano community. It would be interesting if at the end of each month a report was prepared with such partial results, and that this was disseminated to all of us through some pre-defined communication channel, such as youtube, telegram, discord, etc. 2) in addition to knowing what was generated in the month, we need to understand the work of professionals in that period of time, if their routines were being carried out the way they were planned; for example, if those responsible for contacting the partner institutions made this bridge, how it was done, etc.; if the developers responsible for thinking about the dApp's architecture would have actually dedicated the time that was agreed to the work, achieving the expected partial results, etc. Talking about the final results, the auditability here is well underway as the proponents suggest guiding questions that would make us understand if the desired success would have been achieved. For example, we know that the objective is to create a dApp that contributes to the improvement of the health data records of the population of Cameroon, and that dApp should generate improvements such as \u201cavailability of health record information, consistency of health record information, health, more ownership and control of patients, less and less errors in diagnosis due to the absence of health records\u201d and so on. So, in my view, two things should be done with this data: as with the auditability of progress, all these issues must be researched and understood by the project team, it is necessary to have practical proof that these changes are being noticed in Cameroon. . It is also necessary to know if the general population would have adapted and understood the technology, and would be using the dApp in the best possible way, which would directly generate greater adoption of Cardano's technologies in the country, and this would meet the objectives of the challenge of expanding our ecosystem and nurture our community. It is essential that all this is studied and properly presented to our community. Therefore, in my view, the auditability is good, but it could be a little more in-depth in some aspects.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 5, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 788, "q0": "Distributed and decentralized Health Information Exchange Platform has the potential to boost medical care and help the population to leverage their medical information in a safe environment. This platform is required in almost all parts of the world and is not specific to Cameroon. There are few projects in the past rounds of Catalyst which had similar deliverables. However, there is a need to satisfy local requirements which are quite unique and adapted to the local situations. With these considerations, I see this project as unique and in alignment with the challenge. The scope of the project is quite vast. The project involves a local clinic, local Hospital, local medical laboratory, and local health insurance company. There are too many stakeholders and as appreciated in the proposal it is always prudent to involve the stakeholders in the design itself. There is risk in this but it is a required risk. Any sucessfull system which could provide a health record system for Cameroon even at a county level will be a major success for Cardano's mission.

The work being done by WADA and the number of Catalyst proposals that are successfully being handled are well known in the Catalyst community.

The proposal is to use a file-oriented blockchain on which generated medical records (text documents, imagery, audio files ..etc) will be saved. This needs careful handling of encryption. IPFS-like systems require running costs and there is a need to find the source of revenue for sustained operations. The team that has proposed the project has a strong mix of technical expertise and local knowledge.

However, with such local knowledge and commitment, it must be possible for the team to successfully complete the project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal aims to finish the project in four steps at the cost of 27K USD. this includes administrative charges like accommodation charges while travelling for research. The amount is very reasonable. In fact, the development cost is only 14K USD and the reset is for the supporting and research activities. The proposal does not mention the time period required for the completion. With the scope involved in the project and the number of tasks, I feel the funding is very reasonable. The steps mentioned are generic and if the proposal had identified the much clear checkpoints it would have been great. The output expected from the proposal is clear and the deliverables can be easily identified. Therefore the proposal is highly auditable.

Many countries haven't reached this state because the individual healthcare entities don't interoperate between each other so the data remains segregated and partial. Using the blockchain for health individual data is an exceptional idea and is a  great fit for the challenge settings. This proposal, if implemented will surely bring value to the cardano ecosystem. As an underdeveloped country africa has a better chance to integrate this, because there are less obsticles and legacy digital systems in the way. I trully belive a precedent could be set there, realizing this proposal.\nI really liked the prospect of selling your medical information if you choose to do so, because that's something big organizations are interested in and would pay to have. So since it's your medical information, might as well trade with it if you so choose. A detailed and more accurate health information and tests and exams are welcome as well.\nThis would bring a really nice KPI to follow. And from the side of the health organization, there will be one centralized place that could be the single source of truth. I don't see anything missing from the proposal and it's surely something to keep in mind with a great value to cost ratio.\nOverall this would be an impactfull solution and I'd definitely vote for it.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Securing partnerships with existing health organization is a great first step for the project, starting locally and growing to a national level.

The standard is usually hours multiplied by hourly rate so different proposals can be compared between each other. Hourly rates are really good for that. Even so the implemetation and testing part seems decent budget wise. I can verify the budget for development isn't overprices, more like underpriced from the looks of it.\nAll the necessary credentials and links are provided so I was able to vefify the skills listed in the proposal.

Having a public list of partners will always be a good marketing move and each new partner will bring credibility.

The benefits offered for each target group are clearly presented, allowing the community to get an overview of the project\u2019s impact. The team also mentioned the technical features of the platform and provided other materials for reference. Building on the Cardano blockchain, the project will contribute to the mass adoption of Cardano and expand the network, which is well-aligned with the challenge. However, the team can add more details on how users can access the platform and use its functions (e.g. do they have to create an account and upload their health information by themselves or all the information is updated from the existing data from the health organizations? How can patients accept the medical organizations\u2019 accessibility to their record history?)\nThe main challenge is well foreseen and the team also offers risk mitigation approaches.
