Daedalus runs a full node in the background and requires substantial processing power to run smoothly. The recommended hardware for Daedalus is now a 64-bit Dual-core processor, RAM: 16GB, Drive space: 100 - 200GB and Broadband Internet connection. The large number of mini computers like Intel NUK with can run i7 processor support running of Danelus in a smooth manner. The proposal is to identify low-power, reliable, and cheap hardware which can host cardano full node. This part of the proposal is clear but the capability and the compatibility of available commercial off-the-shelf hardware are well known and the need for identification is just personal research, The second part is to fully open-source project that has a web-UI to manage, connect to, and run a Cardano node. This again is a duplication of effort since there are tools available to run the Cardano node using web UI even if it is difficult to install it as a matter of configuration. Therefore I could not see any critical issue that is being address in this proposal.

Out of the twelve months, the proposal has earmarked 2 months for researching the best frontend framework or tool to build the web application. The experienced person is expected to select the framework based on his experience and allotting 2 months and 26K USD for this seems unreasonable.

A very weak point of this proposal is that he wishes to do the entire project himself, over the course of a year. That is an approach that comes with many downsides and risks, out of which I mention: loss of motivation over the course of the project, chance in personal circumstances, or other situations outside his control. So while I applaud his good intentions I draw a very significant red flag in this area, and would appreciate it if the next iterations of the project, if any, try to gather at least a small team around the idea.\n\nTimewise, the project would take roughly one year to complete, since Zachary would devote full time to this project if the proposal were to be funded. He would start with researching suitable machines for running the system, build a nix derivation of the cardano node and test it, then move on to an API solution, then building the front end application and finally test the solution during the last month. \n\nThe budget is very simple to understand. 20k USD would go towards acquiring single board computers for testing, but there is no additional split of this caption to understand exactly which devices he would purchase (besides the mac mini which is offered as an example). The rest of the budget, 160k USD, would go towards paying himself during this one year period. Even if it were a single person project, I would have appreciated seeing a more detailed split of the budget, including an estimation of the hours necessary to build the solution as well as an hourly rate applicable for it.  \n\nConsidering the higher risks than normal given that we do not have a fully fledged team behind this proposal, as well as the very brief budget details, I think two stars are appropriate.

This means the code will be open source for anyone to use, as long as you include bsd copyright and license in your new code, which will be useful for developers in the ecosystem.  The proposer also plans to build documentation for connecting each major wallet to a self hosted Cardano node using his application. This would help end users make full use of their self-hosted Cardano node.\n\nAnother reason this proposal is highly impactful to Cardano in the future is hydra heads will need to be run on full nodes and this solution will help make hydra even more scalable for Cardano by providing an easy way to run a dedicated full node.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer states they have experience as Java software developer, Linux Systems Administrator, and a cybersecurity engineer.

In the comment section of this proposal, they provide links to their Github and Linkedin profiles to back up their claims and show they do have a significant amount of development experience. Also, their use of technical language like \u201cnix derivaton\u201d and \u201csingle board computers\u201d which is like a raspberry pi, indicates they do likely know what they\u2019re talking about in this field.\n\nIt appears that $20,000 of the requested funds are going towards resources needed to develop this product while the rest of the $180,000 goes toward his salary so that he can work on this full time for a year. I understand why they would request this much, because this is similar to the salary of software engineers that work at FAANG companies. However, I feel this is a lot for one person to ask for upfront for a year\u2019s worth of work.  I also understand that Catalyst only allows money to be asked for upfront, but I think this proposal would feel less risky if it was broken up over multiple catalyst funds.  Then more funding could be requested once some work has been proven.  I also would\u2019ve liked to have seen a more detailed breakdown of how the amount of $20,000 was decided on, to help readers evaluate if it seems reasonable.\n\nThe proposer does provide a timeline that outlines the milestones they would like to achieve over the next year along with the number of months they expect each one to take.  This shows they have thought about the steps needed to be taken to be successful.\n\nGiven the experience of the proposer and the long timeline allocated for this proposal, I believe it is likely to be implemented successfully.
