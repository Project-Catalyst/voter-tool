From royalties & live streaming to minting music NFTs on the Cardano blockchain. Artists also need a guide into web3 adoption.", "f6_no_assessments": 20, "f6_rating": 3.25, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1605, "q0": "The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is very good, and theoretically it aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge, because it will create a platform aimed at the music industry, in which artists would have more control over their art, and would also increase the contact between them and their fans, through various technologies pertinent to blockchain. This would achieve the specific objectives of the challenge in terms of adding new active members to the community, increasing the number of active digital wallets, circulating Ada and CNFTs, etc. However, I have some observations to make. I have no doubts about the impact and revolution that this project could create, as artists would create profiles, sell goods, music, NFTs, etc., keeping control of most transactions (which would be smart contracts). From what I understand, it would also be possible to perform some virtual shows, which already happen from the project presented on the jazzisdead website. The great idea here, in my opinion, would be to reduce bureaucracy and the profits that recorded companies have with the commercialization of content generated in the music industry; once these become active tokens, they can be handled much more easily by both artists and fans/end users. However, a big challenge that I believe needs to be taken into account would be: how would fans and artists get to know about Cardano's development tools, needed to run the functionality? This obstacle is mentioned directly by the proponents as well, that is, it is positive as they are aware of this possible difficulty to be faced during the practical development of the project. I would like this question to be more widely debated and thought about. Would there be some kind of practical manual on the website itself, instructions? How will people who have no contact with the cryptographic universe safely use and handle the tools and functionalities mentioned here? If this problem is resolved and circumvented properly, I believe that this proposal has a lot of potential and could bring great gains to the Cardano ecosystem, since it is dealing with a giant industry that moves a lot of money, involves many people. However, the barrier of technical knowledge must be broken, people must be educated in a clear and assertive way, we know that blockchain technology is increasingly popular and widespread, but not all people have such knowledge, and music is universal, so it's important that we make this platform accessible to all audiences. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, if this problem is solved I believe the impact will be maximum.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal script is very specific in the sense of telling us what needs to be done and in what order, however, the temporal notion is a little confusing. As I understand it, everything said is pertinent to phase 2, but how long, in months, for example, would this phase last? And these little activities, how long would each last? Which professionals would work in them, and what would their work routines be like? Only if we can have a good understanding of the process, mainly because the proponents also provide us with observations, this could be even better if a time division was more specific and also if the explanation of each activity itself was more detailed. Unfortunately, when it comes to budgeting, the total asking amount of 100k is split quite broadly, meaning we know that 30k would go to project management and 15k to marketing for example. But what would the project manager's activities be, how many hours per month would he work on this project? We do not, therefore, know what the value of your working hour is, thus making it more difficult to understand whether the amount requested is fair and compatible with current market values. When it comes to marketing, I would like the publicity campaign to be better explained. I believe that advertising is a crucial part of the success of this project, as the intention here is to bring those involved with an already well-established industry to blockchain technologies. So how can we be sure that the maximum number of people would be reached, coerced into adopting this platform? How could artists and fans understand the advantages of the project, in relation to what is already traditional in the music industry? That is, if the marketing campaign were better explained, we would understand how this crucial part for the project would develop and also if the asking value makes sense. Finally, analyzing the team, unfortunately this part leaves a lot to be desired since we don't know much information about each of those involved. We are only told their names and professional roles, but we don't know their resumes, we don't have their linkedin profiles, we don't know how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. If such information were passed on, certainly our security in relation to the team's preparation for the project would benefit. With that, I think that all 3 main parts of feasibility provide us with information that is useful, but lacks detail to understand if the proposal is safely viable. So I'll give it 4 stars because I believe the information given is valid, but it can be better detailed.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Talking about how this project could be monitored, I think we can divide the analysis into two main parts: the monitoring of the process, that is, the unfolding of the phases, and also the measurement of success. Talking first about the last part, the measurement of success, the proponents tell us what the desired scenario would be in general - that a new wave of users would be attracted to Cardano, through the platform that offers various services related to the music business. We also know of more specific factors that could prove whether this happened, such as: the creation of the 3 types of profile on the platform (artist, record label or fan), the interactions between them, subscription to offers, participation in live broadcasts, creation and commercialization of CNFTs and so on. In other words, we have many palpable ways of understanding whether the project got where it wanted to go. However, I think it would also be important to think about two more things when it comes to this. First, I would like a qualitative analysis of the project to be done as well, in addition to quantitative data. That is, to understand the satisfaction of different types of users towards this project, as well as whether they have become active members of the Cardano community in other ways, for example, getting involved in other types of projects, in games, delegating Ada, minting active tokens that are not necessarily involved in the music field, etc. It would be very interesting for the proponents to carry out this general study and bring this information to the Cardano community in a summarized way, which could be done through, for example, a written report and disseminated through the communication channels of our community. Or, also, there could be a page on the website specially dedicated to understanding the impact of all this for Cardano, a place where the users themselves could express themselves, for example. Now, focusing on monitoring the process: it is super important for us to understand how the activities are being developed, how the phases are unfolding, etc., and not just what was generated from them. Proponents claim that the project will be managed with some tools like JIRA, slack and github commits. Besides github, I'm not familiar with the other tools, so for me it would be important to clarify how they work and the feedback they could give to our community, in relation to being always updated with the progress of this project. Thus, I agree that it is a proposal for a possible audit, but some points can still be improved.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 7, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 4245, "q0": "DecentralizeMusic.com is a live streaming music platform that aims to become a viable alternative to current centralized providers like Spotify, allowing artists to create profiles, sell their products, music and NFT using the Cardano blockchain, this should bring fans closer and artists and allow them to continue to receive royalties on their musical productions in the future and forever. All this should lead a large number of users to approach Cardano. Bringing even 0.1% of the quarterly subscribers of a company like Spotify would mean chaining 180,000 users to Cardano. Not to mention that spotify is not the only leading company in the sector.\n(https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/)\nConsequently, I believe that this proposal meets the objectives set by the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge, however similar solutions are already being developed on the Cardano blockchain and another project has been financed in the fund8, I suggest to the proposer to evaluate possible collaborations:\n- https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396558", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent reports that the live streaming, music streaming / physical merchandise and social aspects components are already completed and defines precisely how the CNFT market will be implemented during phase 2 but there is no defined time horizon. Unfortunately I have tried several times to register on the platform but without success and since there are no channels to ask or a support service I had to give up, I suggest the team to work on this aspect. As for the social components; Twitter and instagram are practically empty while the youtube channel seems quite active even if with a low number of subscribers.\nThe project launch has reportedly been aligned with over 30 events and tours organized by Jazzisdead.co (see current events jazzisdead.co/EVENTS).\nI was able to find the following team members online (Links and references of past experiences were missing in the proposal, I suggest adding them):\n-Marcus Gray (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-gray-90a59947/) who demonstrates years of experience in Project menaging and system engineering\n-Andrew Lojero (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-lojero-17462432/) Event Producer / Artist Management / Record Label Co-owner\nHowever, I was unable to identify the other team members and unfortunately the team reports that being an overseas team, they have no reference links or links on the pages\nAbhi - Head of the development project\nDevendra - Python developer\nFizanul - Frontend Developer / React\nAgain I suggest adding references / evidence / links to past experiences.\n \nThe proposal shows a royalty cost of $ 0.01 per stream. However, the team is aware of the lack of knowledge of the Cardano development tools needed to execute the features, so there is no evidence of the sustainability of such a royalty cost paid to artists.\nAccording to data reported by GlobalWebIndex (https://www.gwi.com/reports/music-streaming-around-the-world), the average North American user listens to an average of 140 minutes of music per day.\nTaking into account an average of 3 minutes per song we are talking about 47 songs per day for a value of 47 * 0.01 $ = 0.47 $ (per day to be paid as Royalties), per month the calculation becomes 0.47 $ * 30 = 14.1 $.\nThis is therefore a higher cost than that incurred for a monthly subscription on Spotify (9.99 $).\nFurthermore, microtransitions are not currently available on cardan, so a solution is needed on this front as well to avoid further raising costs for the consumer and lowering earnings for the artist. You could consider an idea such as grouping transitions until a threshold agreed with the rights holder is reached, once this is reached the payment will be sent.\nAt the same time, it should be borne in mind that Spotyifi pays an average of $ 0.003 per stream to the artist, so there is a good margin for maneuver.\n(https://magicviral.com/marketing-news/194-come-guadagnare-con-itunes-and-altri-servizi-di-streaming-musicale.html#strongguadagnareconlamusicasuitunesstrong)\n \nI suggest the team to hire experienced staff in the Cardano development tools necessary for the implementation of the features in order to define more precise and sustainable costs.\nThe required budget is divided into identifiable items, however it lacks specificity in defining the number of hours of work and the hourly cost required for front-end and backed development, I also suggest adding evidence / estimate of the legal cost ($ 35,000)\nAccording to what has been reported, it is likely that the proposal will need additional funds to be carried out, however there is no defined plan in this regard.\nIt is possible the proposal can be implemented, counting a beta and a record label to support it, however a more precise plan of timing and technical aspects is needed, moreover the music sector is a very competitive sector in which it could be useful to forge collaborations with other houses. record companies, I suggest to the team to consider also in this sense", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The roadmap, currently in phase 2, includes identifiable milestones but lacks defined timelines.

Having a music streaming platform for product distribution and monetization is not an uncommon idea nowadays, as there are such big names currently dominating the market, for instance, Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal or Soundcloud, etc. However, integrating NFTs and a blockchain into the platform, I believe, has yet to be mainstream and well-received. Therefore, DM could become a fresh change of pace for the wide variety of users out there, especially those interested in cryptocurrency and blockchains. And not only will DM be a marketplace for NFT-based sales and purchase between parties, but it will also be somewhat a social media platform as well, boasting social elements to create a community where artists and producers can interact with their followers, and followers can express their support and admiration by purchasing their favorite works. \nI\u2019m excited to see that DM will welcome all kinds of art creators, from independent artists to even firms and labels, all of which seem to be suitable target audiences. And for those who have just discovered their newfound interest in NFTs and the Cardano blockchain, the team has also hosted events and tours where there will be demonstrations of the project and Cardano itself, and created a series of educational Youtube videos introducing Cardano for new audiences. A very thoughtful move in my opinion. And the fact that the team\u2019s previous CNFT project Jazz Is Dead and the proposal for this project have recently been featured on Cardano Ecosystem News is a promising sign of things to come, at the same time further spreading DM to potential users. \nI\u2019m delighted to know that DM has reached a 70% rate of completion before this proposal to Catalyst, meaning all the fundamental elements have been made readily up and running with the team\u2019s very own budget and only the implementation of CNFT and blockchain features is needed. Personally, I would prefer that the team had included that 70% development process and what took place at each stage, since that would better demonstrate the features DM has and offer more clarity as well. \nConsidering that the team has finished 70% of the project on their own, getting the funding for the remaining 30%, which is to integrate the blockchain-based functionalities into the platform, is undoubtedly a main concern for the proposers. Though I am not the one with the final verdict, I\u2019m confident that the team should be able to seal this funding.\nHowever, as for the other challenges of lacking the knowledge of Cardano and its development tools to perfectly execute said functionalities and not possessing a strong enough server to host various artists at the same time, the team has not offered up any viable resolutions. I suggest that the proposers should quickly include those solutions, since these brought up challenges seem quite critical to the foundation of the final product.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "As mentioned above, 70% of the project has been completed, so It\u2019s natural that the completed features be experimented in the BETA test. \nFor the roadmap to deliver the CNFT marketplace implementation, the proposal has managed to enumerate all the elements of its marketplace website, each page comes with respective functions and errands, though not too detailed. Personally, I would love to see a timeline for this phase to determine how long it would take from start to finish and when a serviceable MVP could be released to the public.  \nFor the requested budget, It will be divided amongst 4 different sectors of the project and also one portion will be assigned to the payment of the blockchain dev team. I think that this section could use a bit more information regarding what would take shape in each sector and how much it would cost for each installment to better clarify the requested funding.\n\nAs for the participating members of the project, though the proposal does give me the names and respective positions, there\u2019s still a lot to be desired for this section, as I believe that the community would love to know more about the relevance of the team, for example, applicable expertise, educational backgrounds and past experiences. It would be even more convenient to verify them if there were some sorts of visual evidence or dedicated profiles. Another noticeable detail is that apparently there is no individual whose specialty is Cardano and its development tools, as specified in the Impact section that the team still lacks, however, the team has not made any announcements about the recruitment of such a crucial position.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "As far as auditability is concerned, I believe that by using project tracking tools like JIRA, Github and Slack to keep tabs on progress and milestones, there is some level of clarity achieved here.

Or perhaps how long periodically will they post the progress, updates or changes of the project?\nThe envisioned success of the project for the team includes the adoption of artists and music lovers to Cardano and multiple transactions being made on a fully functional music streaming platform where users can not only enjoy music but also interact with one another. This is undoubtedly what the proposers set out to achieve, which aligns well with the required scope of success of this Challenge.
