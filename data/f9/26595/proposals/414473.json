The teaming unemployed youth continue to add to social vices.", "f6_no_assessments": 5, "f6_rating": 4.333333333333333, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 1612, "q0": "The proposal in theory is a good idea, however it is not given enough detail to understand how this theory would be put into practice and I also do not believe that the proposal is so well suited to the challenge in which it was proposed. Firstly, I believe that the proposal fits the African challenge much better than the Dapps one, as the idea is to create a training center in Ghana, and not necessarily to develop some Dapp or integration that represents high value for Cardano. It is about the creation of a physical space, in Ghana, to promote various activities related to the Cardano ecosystem, in order to benefit our blockchain and provide its growth. The idea is to use a space that was conquered with a previous project (Planting Roots in Africa). The problem raised here is that, despite the rapid growth of blockchain technology and being adopted as a solution for several companies, it is still difficult to access knowledge in relation to it and especially in places where blockchain is not yet as well consolidated, as it is. the case of Ghana. Therefore, the proponents intend to carry out several actions that could change this reality, however they are only informed and it is not clear how they would be put into practice, we do not have a good knowledge on how they could be performed. For example, the proponents claim that the center will improve the reach, involvement and dissemination of knowledge in relation to blockchain technology - but how would this work of involving the population be done, through what practical actions the topic would be taught to the target Audience? It is also said that the center is expected to acquire resources and technologies that make learning easier, but it is not clear which technological resources these would be and also how they would adapt to the context. Could it be computers, Ipad, in which way the target audience that may not have access to this type of material could make good use of such technologies, making the best possible use of them? It is also said that \u201cother opportunities may include the organization of mini-exhibitions and workshops to showcase the application of blockchain technologies in various sectors in Ghana\u201d. This idea is very good, it would be positive if the proponents had given us more details about this part of the project - how the classes would be organised, how the workshops would be set up and presented to the local population, how the target audience would be engaged to participate in the initiative and etc. A very positive point of the proposal, however, is that they are aware of how much the general public may be distrustful of cryptocurrencies and working with blockchain, so they propose to present successful examples for the use of coins and this technology, in order to mitigate prejudice. However, in general, I think that several answers were missing here, reading the proposal raises a series of doubts that are not well established, so it would be important that more explanations were available.\n", "q0r": 3, "q1": "About the script, the process is divided into a few months and a summary of what would happen in each of them is given. From the way the information is passed, we can have a general understanding of what would be done, but we could understand better as if more details had been provided. In the first month, I believe that it is not necessary that any more information be given because it is a more \u201cmanual\u201d work, of setting up the physical space. But from the second month onwards, further detailing would be welcome. What would the process of developing informational materials look like (simple leaflets, pamphlets, banners, pull ups and brochures, among others)? What information exactly would be included in them, how would they be distributed? Where would they be spread, how to make people who have never heard of blockchain become interested in these materials and not discard or ignore them? There is talk about the dissemination of the Center on social media, but it could have been specified through which strategies these contents would be disseminated. In the following months, it is said that there would be \u201ctraining and mentoring of young professionals, start-ups and entrepreneurs and these people will be entered into a database where their services will be classified\u201d. A lot of information could have been given here: it would be necessary for us to understand, mainly, which subjects would be addressed, which themes within the blockchain universe (I believe that more basic knowledge would be passed on first, such as the initial concepts of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, etc., for only later a more in-depth content to be worked). But it would be important to be clear about these issues, so that we could understand well what would be addressed and how (what teaching strategy would be used to make these contents accessible to those who have never come into contact with blockchain?). Regarding costs, it is possible to understand how the money would be divided, although some expenses could have been better explained. When we talk about translation, 1500 dollars are asked, but how much content would be translated? How long would the translators work, how much would they be charged for their working hours? $4000 is requested for training/mentoring sessions, but it is not clear how many sessions would be, or even how they would take place (whether they would be individual, in a group, how many professionals would be working on these sessions, etc). It is not clear whether it would be the 5 people involved in the team or, for example, 1 professional per mentorship. I would also like to understand what the transport would be and what the possible overheads would be (which cost 10% of the funding); if they are not needed, how the bidders would redistribute the money. In terms of the team, the proposal is very well supported, as the people involved are well presented and have a lot of experience working actively in our community. That said, the proposal is viable, but more detail would be needed both for the roadmap and for the use of funding.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proponents provide us with a lot of information on how to monitor the project, however some improvements would still be needed to make this topic ideal. Talking about progress, in addition to the partial results suggested, it would be necessary for the development of activities to be monitored, that is, the process of creating physical materials and also training people on blockchain. Thinking one step at a time, it would be necessary to understand how the professionals responsible for making the materials would create them, both in more practical questions about their work routines, the selection of which materials would be used and how, even questions about the information that would be included in these materials the way it would be passed on, its language. It would also be necessary for us to audit the process of disseminating the materials, how they would be distributed, whether this was being done in the most effective way possible, and so on. Proponents claim that qualitative feedback would be collected from those who participated in mentoring sessions, but how would this be done? Would it be a question and answer quiz? What, exactly, would we be trying to understand here, and how would these people be approached? How would the partial results be made known to members of the Cardano community? It would be essential for the team to establish a bridge with our community, periodically reporting all the issues raised here, what is being done behind such results and the products that are being progressively generated. Speaking of success, an ideal scenario is suggested, which can be summarized through the existence of a center that contributes to \u201cstore, process and retrieve information for dissemination at regular intervals, on demand or selectively, according to the needs of end users\u201d; and also that the local public has solidly learned about blockchain, using this knowledge in practice through their own businesses. The Center is also expected to become a point of reference when thinking about blockchain, Cardano and Catalyst information in Ghana. But how could this whole scenario become verifiable and tangible for the Cardano community? How might we see these claims in real life? In my view, two things are necessary here: that after some time of full operation, the team makes an analysis of how the Center is doing, which activities are actually being carried out and how the daily work there would be, so that we could understand better about the place itself and how it would be developing. In addition, it would be positive to keep in touch with those people who benefited from the mentorships - did they develop Dapps, did the objectives of the challenge be achieved, how could we prove this scenario? So, here we have the beginning of a good auditability, but in my view, it still needs to be worked on.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 6, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 12057, "q0": "The proposal outlines solutions that addresses the Fund\u2019s goal of preparing a group of people that are willing and able to make contribution to the blockchain ecosystem, the Cardano Community and the upscaling of Africa\u2019s adoption of blockchain technology. The project when implanted will provide an information and learning hub which will help bridge the knowledge gap on blockchain technology in Africa.  It will also provide a permanent location as well as various online platforms where students, non-students, professionals and the youth can access information on the activities of the Cardano Community, the Catalyst group Wada. The promoters of this project have provided detailed outline on the various persons who will benefit from this center. Though the promoters have envisage two main risk that are likely to impact on the successful implementation of this project. That is the fear of unrealistic schemes that have connections with cryptocurrency; misconception and disinformation of blockchain related activities that would affect adoption and patronage. It is also important for the proposers to look at regulatory bodies that speak against the future of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. To proposers should also look at targeting prominent and influential persons who have interest in blockchain technology to help propagate the activities of the Catalyst Community.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of this project is embedded in the fact that the promoters of this project have already secured an office space which is currently being used to promote Cardano/Catalyst program. The timelines and the project roadmap details the various activities to be done to get this center an information hub for the promotion of blockchain education, Cardano\u2019s activities. The three (3) to four (4) months period to get the place ready is achievable and also the fact that the project is being promoted by seasoned Cardano Members with significant experience in Cardano/Catalyst activities. The proposed budget of USD33000 looks adequate to get this center operational. However, the promoters should provide detailed outline on how they hope to get this project self-sustaining in the future. That is, how they hope to create a business out of this center to provide sustainability for the project. This could be achieved through consulting activities blockchain technology and mentorship programs that could generate revenue to sustain the running of the center. Finally, the center could also be used to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of Cardano\u2019s sponsored projects across Ghana.

This includes the number of people they anticipate would be patronizing the center, the number of youth, professionals and entrepreneurs signing on to Cardano/Catalyst activities. They also hope to measure the progress of this project based on the number of educational materials on blockchain technology and Cardano/Catalyst activities that will be printed and distributed through the center. In addition to these deliverables, the proposers hope to measure success of this project based on the number of people presenting proposals for funding as well as the amount of revenue to be generated from the public for using this space. These are laudable auditable KPS. However, It is important the promoters of this project also provide quantifiable numbers to back these KPIs. For instance how many persons they hope to sign on through this center when the project is implemented. Also, they should estimate how much they hope to generate from the center as revenue. These estimates would help to benchmark the success of the project when implemented.

I think the team has the ability to open this centre. Still, I'm not sure about their capability in terms of time because opening a physical centre is a long time project, not only for the period of fund 10 only.
