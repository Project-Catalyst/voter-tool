This one focuses on the creation of a checkout page connected to existing fiat payments to purchase NFTs. It\u2019s only fair to say that adoption of the NFT technology is proportional to the level of ease with which customers can interact with NFT products, including the purchasing stage, and therefore there is a good connection between this proposal and the challenge. \n\nThe team states that they will use Circle and Stripe for integrating fiat payments to their infrastructure, so it\u2019s great news that they have decided to partner with large, recognized service providers in this sector. Let\u2019s remember that in this challenge the aim should be to foster the development of dapps, products and integrations that can foster adoption, and this use case is definitely a step in the right direction, if it will enable more users to interact with NFTs through direct fiat purchases. \n\nGiven the technical solution chosen, the strong partnership envisaged and the off-the-shelf solution considered, I am offering five stars for its potential impact.

They have folks with deep mathematical and engineering backgrounds as well as marketing / business development competencies. They went to great lengths to ensure that this proposal is well understood, since they even created a short video explaining the entire concept behind. \n\nThe team also makes budgeting look easy, with the main expense being hiring additional development resources. Main costs will involve employing a senior engineer, a developer and a QA engineer for 12 weeks, at hourly rates of 135, 73 and respectively 65 USD. Another significant cost is project management, for roughly 30k USD. I do have my slight worries regarding the effectiveness of the solution versus the resources consumed for implementation. Since the checkout page should only be applicable to fiat payments, payment processors usually already have off-the-shelf solutions ready, and integrations should be rather easy, or moderately complex at best - since a multitude of merchants are already going down this route. While recognizing the peculiar challenges of the NFT niche, I can\u2019t really see such an extensive development need as we are being proposed here. The project should take six months and the work will be divided in 12 sprints, with a very logical and reasonable split of activities for each. \n\nOverall we have a solid team, a reasonable timeline and a budget slightly worrisome from a reasonableness perspective, and hence only four stars I deem as appropriate for this proposal\u2019s feasibility.

So while creating this tool they have definitely positioned themselves as an excellent reference point in terms of how Catalyst reporting should look like. \n\nDiving down into this proposal\u2019s details, we observe that the team offers excellent success targets: six unique teams using the payment gateway, 200 transactions per project and combined revenues of 250k USD between the six teams  - which are highly relevant and comprehensive items that serve very well for the purpose of measuring the success of this proposal.

The solution to this problem is creating an on site gateway for users to purchase the NFTs directly with a credit or debit card, creating an easier entry point for purchasing without the need of crypto exchanges or other wallets. The proposer hopes to implement a dashboard profile on their site (https://www.revelar.co) which will allow new buyers a friendly and secure process of payment. This could positively impact the Cardano ecosystem by having new Projects on their Launchpad present their collections to investors not bound by exchange rates or deposit delays, while having an available form of payment for instant buying power. If the proposal is successfully implemented and becomes more mainstream on other NFT sites and marketplaces, the impact on root of entry into the Cardano ecosystem could see an influx of new users.

The proposer states additional funds not acquired from earlier proposals is included within this idea's budget to expand the existing team, adding a Lead Engineer during a 12 week timeline. No further information regarding if this is a contracted position but the founders of Revelar can all be found within the proposal with their respected LinkedIn profiles for further credentials and expertise.

This evaluation seems a bit optimistic without additional information on what these unique teams or projects in particular are offering to the Cardano ecosystem themselves or what type of NFT utility they may have, which is a major selling point within the NFT community, so it's difficult to assume these numbers are realistic or inconceivable. Though with the Revelar team providing full transparency through their semi-live open sourced Catalyst updates mentioned above (https://catalyst.revelar.co) the Auditability of this proposal must be given a 5, as all aforementioned solutions being worked on and any deviation from the proposed timeline or allocation of funds can be viewable by Project Catalyst members at any time.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2883", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8137, "q0": "As the crypto-economy and Web3 grow, there is a greater need to build improved fiat-to-crypto currency ramps to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the economy's electronic money.

The team chose the Blockchain technology of the Cardano ecosystem to build their Dapp. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal is to create a simple payment page connected to existing fiat payments to buy NFT. While the current issue, as the author said, is that buying Cardano NFT requires some steps to get ADA before potential buyers can buy. This limits access beyond those with ADA. As such, the purpose of this idea is to simplify the NFT buying process, shorten the time, and drive new user action.\nThe author described the solution in a clear, logical manner. Besides, the author also mentioned the risks the team may face when implementing this project. Three main risks included are: attracting too many customers to initially participate in the trial, so the infrastructure is often deficient; regulatory changes (Fiat Custody Management and Processing to NFT is a very gray space; unregulated with different jurisdictions around the world) and software delays. By anticipating these risks, the team has devised appropriate solutions to minimize those risks. \nIf possible, the team should expand the payment range to buy NFT and other crypto purchases. That will attract more users as the number of users willing to accept crypto is growing.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author has planned an essential roadmap and timeline. The team made a sprint plan, the time being within six months with 12 x 2 weeks of sprints. Each timeline has a specific goal. The team should detail each Sprint's process and particular tasks to a better plan with readers.\nThe budget of this proposal represents only 2.07% of the total budget for Challenge. I find that the amount is reasonable. This funding is intended to expand their engineering team; the rest of the core minting and distribution will be available in Revelar core services. The engineering team includes a chief engineer, Full Stack developer, QA engineer, and project manager. These people are not described in the proposal. The author has detailed their hourly wages and total working hours, but to make it easier to evaluate, the author should add a quote explanation to come up with this salary.

The proposer presented an important and popular issue these days: \"Buying a Cardano NFT requires several steps to acquire ADA before a potential buyer can buy. This limits accessibility beyond ADA holders.\" I found this to be a recommendation from an experienced team, through my research I learned that Revelar is a known contributor and has received funding for some of the projects in the Catalyst Funds project in the past. They want to build on the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating a simple payment page that is connected to existing fiat payments (Credit/Debit Card, Bank Account,\u2026) to buy NFT. Meaning they want to build a FIAT payment gateway for NFT on Cardano. As usual with Revelar proposals, they always go through the process with a plan, describing how they implemented and how their work has impacted the Cardano community (here with the implementation of the proposal). This initiative will make it easier for everyone, especially newcomers to find and access NFT projects, and encourage developers to continue being creative in ideation and construction build better products, more useful for society, especially for the Cardano community). The solution proposed by the proponent solved most of the problems of challenge and rigorous argument. They give evidence about this current situation to see the impact of the problem, and the impact of the solutions they offer. The proponent has described the solutions very clearly and specifically, and the main problems are presented quite fully and to the point. To successfully implement the project, they also anticipated the risks they needed to face. The risks mentioned are regulatory changes and software delays. In addition to pointing out these difficulties, the proponent also offered accompanying remedies such as for regulatory changes they are working with entities approved by the US and FINCEN to facilitate core banking integration. Either for software delays, which is the biggest risk with any Dapp project due to these decentralized frontier unknowns and the new technology that will be available along the way, here's the subject. Exporters are also taking advantage of more and more different things like (API, KYC,...). I find that the identification and anticipation of risks as well as careful preparation in providing this remedy will help the proponent to stay in the proactive position, increasing the success of the project, while increasing the community's credibility for this project.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal presented full information related to the implementation schedule, budget as well as members of the project. The proposed roadmap has shown that the main product is the production MVP payment page and account management that does specific jobs. The route is broken down into 6 timelines and spans 12x2 weeks of sprints. Breaking down the plan by week like this will make it easier for them to capture and track the process and results. However, if possible I think the proponent should elaborate more on the specific work in each of those milestones, what the results should be, and who is responsible for managing and controlling the process progress and quality of each of those timelines. These jobs must be done in sequence or can be done in parallel, can the resources of the previous stage be used for the next stage to save time and resources? As for the budget, this proposal asks for $162,400 which sounds like a lot but it is only 6.5% of the full challenge budget, the way it is allocated and used is quite detailed and reasonable. However, if possible, I think the group should deduct a part of the budget to set up a reserve fund to use in unexpected situations. And here I have a small question that is why the budget, the cost part only being calculated for 12 weeks (only half the time it takes to finalize the proposal). Regarding the participating team, the proponent also provided complete information about the 3 members related to their names, professional qualifications, and previous work experience. Besides, the proposer also provides LinkedIn so that everyone can easily check the information.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For the community to measure the progress and success of the project, the proponent has made their website https://catalyst.revelar.co available for anyone to easily access and check on progress degrees, history, and revisions in real-time until they make the final reports and closings of each proposal. The proponent explains how to measure through reports, which include things like: recorded videos, written versions of updates on a dedicated website, demos, and more. The export also shows project success measured in 2 ways with metrics like at least 6 unique teams using the payment gateway during the Launchpad with at least 200 transactions per project or a total of USD 250,000 in transactions across all 6 teams. Citing specific data as above contributes to making it easier for the community to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness. I think the auditability of this proposal is relatively good. As far as I know, Revelar has a list of recommendations so far and has been specifically archived. And this proposal is a completely new idea, not a continuation of any previous proposal.

This is completely in line with the requirements of the challenge. Creating a page to buy ADA from a website will make it very easy for users to buy ADA instead of today's payment sites. This is really helpful for expanding the community of users of the Cardano ecosystem. Imagine, having a transaction that only takes a few clicks, users can get ADA, this makes it easy for many users of different levels to buy ADA. Users always need convenience.
