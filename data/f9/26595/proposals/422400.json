The proposal will create open standard for creating world with on chain tilemaps bringing indie game developers to the ecosystem. The team has already applied their standard on Adagotchi project and want to extend it to Disco Solaris community and open up a new tilemap NFT market. The biggest challenge would be to get tile maps on chain without using ipfs but the team will mitigate by starting at the single pixel level and scaling up from there. The proposal addresses the Dapps, Products, Integration challenge very well as it will allow game world to be onchain without the use of ipfs. The proposal will accommodate indie game developers with this solution and also the on-chain storage doesn't have the capacity to house game world. Tilemap solution would allow this to be possible.

The team might want to clarify why the rate is high and what is involved in the plutus development and also explain what is their miscellaneous fee. The proposer gives link to Adagotchi. It would be good for the team to explain how this solution will feed into AdaGotchi game. It is likely that the team which is comprised of Cardano enthusiasts with graphic design and plutus development skillset should be able to complete the project successfully if they would give more transparency to their budget and perhaps share how basic game world on mainnet for adagotchi can be built using this solution.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The success for this proposal is to have on chain world that native assets can explore with a standard for building and scaling these worlds.

However, specific metrics are missing to reflect a concise impact and clearer plan of future sustainability.\nIt clearly states the problem by informing on the actual storage limitations that the \u201cchain\u201d has and how this is a constrain for games that use vast worlds.\nThe solution proposed of Tilemaps is a workaround to that limitation by creating a storage solution on-chain (not decentralized file system).\nFrom my perspective it aligns clearly with one of the goals of the challenge which is open world games. \nTile based games bring the attention of indie devs as these work on small budgets and 2D(tiles) cost a lot less to develop than 3D.\nWhile there are two goals clear, bringing more Indi games devs and tile-based games, some specific metrics, such a number of potential users, using some volumes examples from the use cases in the Adagotchi project, could throw additional clarity on the impact.\nThe scalability and future proof are stated referencing to future Cardano scaling solutions and future plans for the solution expansion are referred as well as a future hydra head. This addresses the increased number of integrations for this challenge\nWhile the solution is stating the foundation with the creation of single pixel level and the creation of 16x16 sprites, etc, it does not state a clear size comparison between an existing map and the resulting size difference using their solution, and such, to make a clear picture of what is being tried to be achieved could definitely benefit from a practical example.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposer is providing background on success cases from previous project, reference links to it and the skills for each member of the team.

A timeline is missing. \nLooking at the most costly activity, which is Plutus development, I find a bit high a remuneration of 125$/hour for a developer with 5 months of experience with Plutus, and such this cost does not justify a quality work based on experience, so the developing could extent due to unforeseen developing challenges.\nNo additional funding is needed, as for now, but it implies that it depends on what the team learns during the first phase which could result in adding more tools and, also, future scaling solutions on the Cardano ecosystem.

Currently blockchain space obviously does not allow for storage of large pieces of external information for instance entire games. The value proposition here is to create an open source IPFS solution that standardizes tile maps and allow them to run on-chain due to this optimization. \n\nIn a bit more detail, the solution would comprise initially a simple 16x16 world, highly stylized, with just a few layers and key values attributable to each tile to enable at least basic game functionality. \n\nBy no means will this be a remarkable technical feature or an excellent potential for future development of new, innovative games, but offering small scale and simple games a possibility to play on-chain is a rather interesting proposition, worthy at least of the very modest budget behind this proposal.

The project is rather simple, and would start with an initial discussion with game developers to gauge their interest in a said standard, and then they would proceed to the standardization process and testnet launch. We are however not offered a real timeline but given the small scale scope and budget that shouldn\u2019t take too long, right? Well, the budget section tells us more - that 150 hours would be necessary, with hourly rates between 40 and 150 USD, depending on task complexity. \n\nSmall but transparent team, small budget, clear idea, highly feasible!", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Of course, the standard will be open source, how else?

I find the auditability good, not perfect, since they could have taken the effort of setting a few clear targets: number of worlds created, number of developers using their standard after x month, etcetera.
