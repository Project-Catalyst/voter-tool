They strive to lead the change towards a more open employment model and to help their members map their skills while discovering opportunities and making new connections. Goodwall has over 2 million users and is active in over 150 countries. I have actually joined the platform to understand it better - and there is definitely an interesting blend of job board / social media / course directory, focused on students and young professionals (16 to 24 years old). Goodwall have had one proposal funded in Fund 8 and have now come back in Fund 9 with six proposals totalling over 650k USD.  \n\nTheir value proposition is for Goodwall to use Cardano to develop a community endorsement mechanism which is traceable and immutable, thus solving the fake account / information problem currently plaguing traditional social media platforms (think about the recent Must - Twitter debate on whether the platform has 5% or 20% fake accounts). Building on top of this statement we only have a 7-step flow description, but it\u2019s not an actual flow since some of the steps are just plain statements, not actions, with steps 2 and 6 being obvious: \u201c2 - Self-regulated and smart ecosystem\u201d  and \u201c6 - The required upvoting number can vary depending on the skill level\u201d. To understand this better I think it\u2019s useful to go through an question and answer process: \n\nQ: will every Goodwall user need a wallet to interact with the on-chain endorsement mechanism? \nA: Yes, but that part of the implementation is another proposal from this funding round, which needs to be voted for, funded and then implemented. So it\u2019s definitely not a very timely exercise to seek funding for this proposal until the wallet / payment mechanisms have been implemented. \n\nQ: If the mechanism is on-chain, there will be a need for a token - where are the plans for that? \nA: Well, another proposal from this round seeks to implement a tokenized in-app economy. So it\u2019s definitely not a very timely exercise to seek funding for this proposal at this time until the token economy is already existing. \n \nQ: Will you ask every user to submit a DID through Atala Prism to join the endorsement mechanism? \nA: Yes, but that is yet another proposal from this round (already the third) that needs to be implemented prior to this proposal making sense. So yet again another hard truth about this project\u2019s untimeliness. \n\nQ: Will Goodwall subsidy this and pay for all the network transaction fees? \nA: Goodwall interacts with its users in a variety of ways, including paying them certain monetary incentives. The aim, at some point, is to pay these incentives via ADA (or a Cardano token) but right now this is not possible. \nLet\u2019s wrap things up. Goodwall has 2m users, they are targeting an excellent cohort (young, educated, worldwide audience), so the community should definitely support them in building their solution on Cardano! But, on top of the fact that this proposal is very un-timely (for all the reasons stated above) here are other things needed to turn this proposal into an excellent one: \n\n- a much better description of the technical solution. When asking 250k USD we expect at least to see some wireframing in place and an easy to understand solution that makes sense. \n- a proof that all the other ingredients are in place for this proposal to function (wallet integration, Atala Prism live and running, tokenomics set-up and live). This proposal clearly demonstrates that many prerequisites are not in place for this proposal to have an impact right now.\n\nUntil all the prerequisites are in place and a more detailed flow conceptualized, I have to offer a neutral rating for this proposal\u2019s impact. Three stars.   ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Goodwall seems to have a fully fledged team, and they are super transparent about it. Their CEO is Taha Bawa, a Forbes 30 under 30 and Global Shaper (and that means a lot). Their website shows 65+ employees (all with Goodwall accounts of course, so easy to interact directly), and Linkedin shows 80+. I think their HQ is in Madrid, but they seem to be geographically distributed throughout Spain, Philippines, Switzerland and many other locations.  In the proposal itself they have included a list of management team and also three team members who will be leading this project as well as taking the Atala Prism pioneer course. So you can\u2019t really ask for anything more in terms of team transparency.  \n\nWhat is their plan? A 48 weeks timeline, divided in three main parts: preparation (requirements, user stories, architecture), execution (smart contracts, front end, back end, QA) and results (track users and voting activity, marketing plan execution). Budgetwise, the project will necessitate 2.500+ hours, with hourly rates between 50 for QA and 100 development. Although not bad at all, a 250k USD proposal should have definitely come before the voters with a much better problem definition scope of necessary work. Without additional details I have to revert again to some questions from the previous section: who will need wallets to vote? Who will bear the transaction costs? Will users need DIDs to join the platform in the first place? Will the vote be exclusively for those that have a DID?\n\nWith an excellent team but a rather unimpressive plan considering the hefty 250k USD proposal, I think four stars are appropriate for this proposal\u2019s feasibility. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team promises to implement dashboards to show all relevant data, and to do a presentation to show the results of their work, with use case tests and success stories. There are few unclear points. They claim that when the project is implemented the number of fake accounts will decrease using the ledger system. What ledger system they are talking about is not really sure. If Cardano, the wording is rather unfortunate. They also claim the project to help them in their ability to act as a fake news blocker, but I think the term is user rather unfortunately here - since fake news definitely has a \u201cmedia\u201d connotation attached to it, when actually the team must be referring to fake information existing exclusively on their platform (information about actual users in this case - which can hardly be categorized as news, let alone fake one). \n\nIn conclusion, the team delivers a fair case for auditability, so four stars. An excellent proposal would have included: \n\n- a demonstrated capacity to interact with the Cardano community (already set-up Telegram / Discord / Twitter social media accounts) and why not, a few video blogs explaining in detail how they want to interact with the ecosystem\n- a much better explanation of what success will mean for the project and some clear set targets.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 0, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1418, "q0": "This proposal wishes to apply blockchain to convert the traditional employment model to an open work model in order to make this model popular globally.

In case there are cost overruns, what will be the impacts on the execution process and what will the team do? (e.g. cut the cost of other parts, reduce the scale of the project,...).
