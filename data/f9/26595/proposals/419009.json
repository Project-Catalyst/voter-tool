They have been funded in Fund 7 and Fund 8, and in Fund 9 they are back with two fresh proposals. This one focuses on building a gateway that can control access to NFT content when needed. They are aware that this functionality is not immediately applicable to all stakeholders, but the philosophy behind it is that the more functionalities NFTs can have, the better it will be for the ecosystem\u2019s long term health and development potential. \n\nSo let\u2019s see what benefits can gated NFTs bring: subscription based models, allowing for logic layers that can distribute content differently between multiple parties, private NFTs. The privacy / gated feature will be obtained via private IPFS clusters, basically their own infrastructure. \n\nLet\u2019s remember that in this challenge the aim should be to foster the development of dapps, products and integrations that can foster adoption, and this use case is definitely a step in the right direction, if it will enable additional use cases for NFTs. A slight question mark should be raised regarding the developers\u2019 appetite for such features which is still untested, but given the wide array of possible applications it\u2019s only fair to infer that there are minimal downsides to the ecosystem for having an extra feature on the table.\n\nGiven the still unclear potential of such a feature development, and more importantly, the fact that the technology will not be developed open source (this is confirmed in the proposal itself) and thus of limited use for the wider community at the beginning, I am only offering four stars for its potential impact.

They went to great lengths to ensure that this proposal is well understood, since they even created a short video explaining the entire concept behind. \n\nThe team also makes budgeting look easy, with the main expense being hiring additional development resources. Main costs will involve employing a senior engineer and a developer for 12 weeks, at hourly rates of 135 and respectively 73 USD. Minor other costs will fund cloud infrastructure. A strength of the proposal is that the team argues that a few features necessary for this project are already existing within the company so there will be less development needed, minimizing time and money spent. \n\nTimeline the project should take six months (don\u2019t be confused with the 12 weeks above) and the work will be divided in 12 sprints, with a very logical and reasonable split of activities for each. \n\nOverall we have a solid team, a very reasonable timeline and budget, and five stars are definitely appropriate for this proposal\u2019s feasibility.

So while creating this tool they have definitely positioned themselves as an excellent reference point in terms of how Catalyst reporting should look like. \n\nDiving down into this proposal\u2019s details, we observe that the team offers excellent success targets: 35 unique gates being created and a 60% retention at the end of the timeline - which are highly relevant and comprehensive items that serve very well their purpose.
