Many people are involved in 3d printing and manufacturing who may not be involved with blockchain, and this is a great way to bring new people into Cardano. This concept could scale up to have a much larger impact in the future. Funding this early stage startup would be a great way to kickstart a global Decentralized Manufacturing Marketplace on Cardano.

They have delivered various successful projects on Cardano and are highly likely to be successful with this endeavour. The budget is broken down into 5 specific deliverables. No additional funding will be required from Catalyst to complete this proposal. The timetable includes specific deliverables (additional features)  to be completed in a 4 month timeframe.

This proposal is a continuation of a series of proposals submitted in previous funds that have been selected for funding allocation. In order to enhance the end user experience, the team is adding key features to the solution under construction, which is expected to enhance the possibility of exponential market adoption. It is an excellent use case within the ecosystem, allowing commercialization through a 3D printable NFT marketplace, while maintaining the designer's copyright. In the proposal description, it is possible to see the existing relationship to the challenge setting and it is relevant in terms of explaining what the problem is and how the proposed solution solves it. While it is understood that the successful implementation of this solution would positively impact Cardano's NFT market transactions, I would have liked to find information about the market they expect to capture when this solution is released.  \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is the result of a team that brings together people with experience in all relevant areas. Additionally, many of them are part of teams that have delivered products or services to the Cardano and SPOs ecosystem. It was structured based on the features they wish to add to the solution, which can be viewed as work packages to which a percentage of the total amount requested was assigned. While in this manner it is possible to understand in a simple manner what the company intends to build, in order for a deeper evaluation to be conducted it is necessary to provide detailed information.

However, It would have been more helpful if the roadmap had provided a more detailed description. Despite the fact that these features are only expected to be completed within four months, given that Adosia has proposals that were allocated budgets in previous funds, as well as an additional one in this fund, I would have expected a greater level of transparency in that area. Regarding reporting and communications with the community, although the monthly report to Catalyst is mentioned, there is no mention of communication channels with the community. For success metrics, they can be summarized as \"all features will be available in the solution in 4 months\"; however, for a project of this size, I would have expected an estimation of the impact goals they expect to reach as a business, such as earning XX$ in XX months or achieving XX sales per month.  \n\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6254, "q0": "This proposal seeks funding for the building of additional features for the Adosia Decentralized Manufacturing Marketplace where.

Technically there is no doubt that they know what they are doing and this project won\u2019t be something new for them.\nBy the detail in which the plan of the proposal is laid out is clear, that the detailed plan step by step is already created and just waits for the funding.\nIf funded, the proposal states that it will bring six new features to the Adosia marketplace. However in the plan there are only five features listed.\nThe team does not provide a detailed timeline. For which I have to subtract half a point.\nThe work experience of the team members is presented and it is obvious that the skill is present.

In the Proposal Assesor Guide is clearly stated that: \u201cProposers are now being prompted to give info on how they are working out their pay rates.\u201d Which the proposers miss. For the lack of detail in the budget I have to take half a point also.\nIn my personal opinion, it is a certainty that this project will be completed, however as a PA I have to obey the principles outlined in the Proposal Assessor Guide F9, and therefore, I agree the proposed plans and budget seem feasible to deliver the project.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The auditability section of this proposal does not have milestones and a timeline attached.

Currently, print-on-demand services are quite expensive while Peer-to-peer production platforms are not yet available. The team's proposal is to launch an open p2p marketplace (Uber of 3D printing) to enable monetization of 3d designs and print jobs. I think this project is quite nice and has the potential to be applied in practical, adding significant value to the Cardano ecosystem, because 3D printing technology is a global trend, and widely used in recent years. The additional functions in the marketplace are associated with scientific and technological developments in popular and prominent fields. I am impressed with the solution that combines the SmartContract feature with the NFT marketplace on a Decentralized platform, the team is aiming to build a pretty perfect system on the Cardano ecosystem.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Unfortunately, the project has not mentioned the risks that may be encountered when conducting. For example, a user wants to print a copyrighted 3D image but the owner has not signed a contract with METAIN, or it is difficult to contact the owner. So it will take a lot of time to process 1 order. In addition, there is no concern about the legal issue when authorized printers may disclose or leak copyrighted images, there should be a strict management mechanism for this.\nThe project's product is 3D printing done quickly by purchasing NFT and then choosing to print through a registered space printer, the users here are the customers who have the demand for 3D printing at will. I think the project's product has great potential to reach the community because 3D printing technology is becoming more and more popular.\nThe proposed project has a total budget of 175000 USD, which is a huge budget for Dapps projects. However, the explanation of expenditure items is still very sketchy, it needs to re-account the budget in more detailed items to ensure transparency and audit, the positive point is that the project has issued Tokens.\nThe project has a direct source of income from users. In addition, if in the future there is a large number of users, the project can completely generate revenue from advertising for similar 3D printed products.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team has not built a detailed and methodical plan and implementation roadmap, the work items need to be listed and explained in connection with the results of each phase. Since you don't publish KPIs, it's a bit difficult for the community, even though additional features are added to the final platform.\nI think, using Github and trello to manage project progress is a very transparent method so that the community can easily check project execution.

One thing we can be sure of is that the team of the \"Adosia Marketplace Updates\" project is very good and experienced. To update the Adosia marketplace, the team will add six new features. The roadmap will last 4 months with an estimated cost of $ 175000. However, the project team should be clear about these six new features. What are they?
