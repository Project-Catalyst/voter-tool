They aim to create a DAO to provide legal and financial support, including the potential to convert ADA and other tokens to fiat. As managing this process can create significant headaches for many funded projects, this proposal could provide significant impact to the Cardano ecosystem. The only factors that led me to a score this as \u201c4\u201d on impact rather than \u201c5\u201d relate to future sustainability and scalability. While the proposal mentions creating smart contracts and utilizing other technical solutions, the nature of the financial and legal services that they describe require significant amounts of human effort. It would have been interested to understand how the proposers intend to scale their services. Another feature to strengthen the proposal would be the inclusion of a business model describing how the DAO will sustain itself financially in the future.

Additionally, the LinkedIn profiles provided substantiate the claim to significant expertise in legal and financial matters. The budget is broken into a number of different line items, and the items seem to broadly encompass the work envisioned in the project. In the risk section, the proposers indicate that they will maintain a registry KYC of all members and participants on the blockchain. Given my personal experience working with customer KYC information, I have witnessed the importance of data privacy in this area. Putting KYC information on the blockchain creates a significant risk. The proposal would be strengthened if the team had acknowledged this risk and explained how they would mitigate those risks. A different approach might involve exploring how self-sovereign identity could provide similar functionality, without the need to store large amounts of personal data. Additionally, the proposal seems to indicate that the DAO will transact in both crypto and fiat on behalf of its clients/partners. This activity would categorize the DAO as a Financial Intermediary in many jurisdictions, including those that are friendly to cryptocurrency. A business seeking to act as a Financial Intermediary usually needs to be licensed by its local financial regulator. Additionally, banks will have a more thorough due diligence process for any company acting as a Financial Intermediary, most especially when cryptocurrency is also involved. It would improve the proposal to describe the team\u2019s approach to the licensing process, and incorporate into the budget the costs of getting a license and opening the required bank accounts. The team indicates that they have other proposals in this fund as well as in previous funds. Looking through Ideascale reveals many other proposals from this team, spread across many different challenges. It would strengthen the proposal for the team to list all their various proposals and explain the approach to managing them, should they all be successfully funded.

Creating the framework will help us go through the self-experiment and also engage more experts/college fresh minds to explore options and document the same from a legal/financial perspective. We at KONMA want to create an impact not only on CARDANO Ecosystem but also be a bridge for cross-chain collaboration and integration. KYC records will be maintained keeping in mind data privacy norms, blockchain will be used for minimum KYC data fetching for the smart contract to establish the genuineness of the transaction and person. Future sustainability and scalability will be handled by ever-growing members from different parts of the globe who will handle the operations in their local country thus giving confidence to people availing the service that the person they are working with is from the local country but the organization is global, thus giving ease of business, connections, work and thus becomes scalable and as it will get a foothold it will become sustainable with the growth of CARDANO ecosystem.

This proposal really overwhelmed me because of its global scale, through greatness. But apart from the secure management of large reserves of participants, different treasury management in the world, the biggest risk is still allowing mainstream recognition of cryptocurrencies.

As we progress we will engage also other cryptos, as this is a generic challenge for all. And project needs existing expertise as well as new solutions and hence the total budget is high. Trials within the Konma team will be shared as frameworks between crypto-friendly/cryptosanctioned countries. India like the USA allows crypto but taxes it at a higher bracket. The PA has few observations regarding the legality of cryptocurrency in different parts of the world which we partially agree with but with evolving day-to-day scenarios in the world economics and cryptocurrency, the tides are changing towards acceptance, with countries coming forward and accepting them as legal tender and that is where this whole challenge starts. We at KONMA aim to take this challenge head-on and lead the tide for the proposer by creating an infrastructure for ready advisory for them, advising them on where to operate from, what are the laws of their respective nation, and what all are the alternative. It is a proposal that involves hand holding to the new startup in the Cardano system to adapt to the legal and financial framework in their countries and worldwide through professional members with years of expertise in law, finance, management, and consultancy.

However most projects (especially startups) lacks proper legal guidance that will oversea their development in such a way that it is legally compliant on a global landscape. These problem have lead to the dead/discontinuation of numerous promising project in the market. The proposer decisively intends to provide a solution to these problem by constituting a group of legal experts (From different parts of the world) in financial law and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe said group will form a DAO (LawFinDAO) consisting of legal expert, law students and other concerned persons in the legal field for the sole aim of providing specialized legal and financial guidance and implementation procedure for projects building on Cardano based on a crypto friendly jurisdiction and thereby providing a bridge for projects to seed themselves beyond boarders and benefit off of the friendly regulation thereof.

I consider this a large project, with a diversity of laws, industries and cultures . Indeed, most countries currently support blockchain technology, but a specific law to protect users and developers is not available, especially with respect to cryptocurrencies. The law is recognized by a government, with the legal profession being a strong fulcrum for development. So does the proposal have a possible solution for that? Please present for the community to understand. With countries that are neutral or open about cryptocurrencies, we can be more lenient.

The solution proposed by the proponent is that members from the legal and financial sectors of specific countries will come together to provide legal advice and assistance in any legal and financial matter that may arise developers have to face. project team members are willing to collaborate with grants to support all successfully funded projects to use these funds efficiently and securely. actively engages law students and lawyers by providing them with a first-hand experience of the fusion of law, finance, and blockchain. This proposal will integrate the best of both worlds through networking and community management, thus benefiting the larger Cardano community and the scale of the project is fully scalable. I completely agree that this proposal solves the challenge effectively", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent stated that their internal governance team has a combined total of more than 50 years of experience and expertise in law, finance, and management, which was essential to the implementation of this proposal, and that they provided information Details of the experiences of those who will be working on the project are verifiable with links attached. The proponent requested a reasonable amount of funding to implement the specific project $51,500. where the funding is clearly outlined and broken down into identifiable categories including the Technical budget for 3 Haskell and Plutus developers: $15000; the Legal budget $30000, Marketing & Misc $6500. The proposal provided a reasonable and convenient plan to get the job done however I would like the proponent to provide a realistic timetable for implementation The work helps voters look at the project and can easily determine the progress of the project. The proponent has identified a number of risks when implementing the project, and for each risk, the proponent has come up with a specific solution for each of those risks. from the above information, I agree that it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. I give 4* for the feasibility of this project.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides a detailed plan, including progress and milestones, and specific timelines for achievement. As the project is successfully implemented more and more members join and more projects use the platform from all over the world and between multiple chains. a seamless cross-border bridge is conceived to facilitate an integrated environment of legal, financial, and technology verticals. The proposal selected 4 indicators: Membership Warehouse, Execution of Smart Contracts, Integrated and Deployed Projects, and Internal Controls to determine the success of the proposal. I think these indicators are suitable to measure the success of the proposal. The proposal also clearly described the problem that the implementation of legal and financial frameworks prevented the project from moving forward and that new proponents did not have a support system in place and could provide Clear, easy-to-understand solutions to problems.
