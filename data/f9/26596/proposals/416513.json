The project\u2019s value proposition is simple and very easy to understand. Michael, the proposer, brings forth an idea to create a service wrapped as a think tank that will also be part of the wider DLT360 project, with the function of answering the day to day legal questions that proposers might have, and basically devote a significant portion of his time for this endeavor. \n\nThere will be a growing need for legal advice within the crypto space, and there are opportunities for any kind of projects, no matter how big or small. While other proposers come up with large, scalable solutions (marketplaces, workshops, etc) which are absolutely fantastic proposals, there is also room for smaller projects, like this one, but much more targeted and ready to assist proposers with minimal set-up fees. I am definitely in favor of this smaller type of proposals at this point in time (\u201clet a thousand flowers bloom\u201d philosophy) before increasing our common efforts towards extensive undertakings that need a solid base of practitioners around all the geographical areas where proposers activate - and right now there aren\u2019t many statistics diving into these matters. \n\nSo this would be a very hands-on approach, a grass-root project that can activate very close to where proposers feel the majority of their pain points, and with a great possibility of offering sound advice quickly and effectively. Excellent impact therefore. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Michael, the proposer, has an excellent background and this for me is a very strong indication that the project sits on solid grounds and can be implemented successfully. He is a lawyer and entrepreneur, but most importantly a long time contributor to the Cardano ecosystem and especially active within Catalyst. I will provide two examples that showcase his extensive involvement: within the DLT360 team and within Profila.\n\nProfila is a marketing platform with extensive privacy features that allows its users to interact with companies while controlling their own data. The platform is live and the project has already received  funding from as far back as Fund6. DLT360 is a scalable team of regulatory experts focused on delivering value within the Cardano ecosystem. They have strong academia, industry and EU institutions connections and are well positioned to tackle most projects within the legal / risk management space. They already have a multitude of projects in the pipeline and are a constant presence during town halls. \n\nThe timeline looks very solid as well. Over the three months of the project, the first would be devoted to the set-up and would see the first two office days with \u201copen doors\u201d for any proposer, which will of course continue in the following months. In addition, the second month would bring to light a roadmap with important legal topics to work on - perfect opportunity for the wider community to look into the project and perhaps provide insight. The last month would see the creation of a blog and Swarm sessions devoted to legal questions. \n\nOne uncertainty, which was highlighted by the proposer as well (extra points here) is that without introducing any economic incentives (payment vs service) there is a risk that his service might be overwhelmed with too many questions and a prioritization will have to be put in place (who should get priority, can one pay to jump the queue, who gets to judge, based on what criteria?). While this is of course a valid point of concern, given the multitude of legal / regulatory projects to be funded, I feel that reaching such a bottleneck, although painful in the short term, can be a great booster for one\u2019s activity over the long term and a very good selling point when asking for additional Catalyst funding. \n\nIn conclusion, the project is very strong across the board from a feasibility standpoint. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "We have fairly good auditability possibilities here, but with some room for improvement. The proposer argues that the office days will be accounted for with timesheets, and also the reports / findings / Q&A will be made available, in addition to the usual Catalyst weekly updates. Of course, participating in the swarm sessions can only increase his level of accountability towards the community.  \n\nSince the proposer is well connected with existing projects funded under Catalyst as far back as Fund 6, with many of the projects being also dependent - he is most definitely already familiar with the standard operating procedures and all the processes set-up by IOG / the community to ensure consistent reporting. I therefore see low risks of the community not being able to properly monitor this proposal. \n\nI do have one suggestion though. Since any legal advice is exclusively qualitative by its nature, and highly dependent on the practitioner offering it, it is very difficult for the community to judge the quality offered. So in this respect any kind of additional mechanism that would create a feedback loop between proposer (Michael) - proposers (customers) - community (stakeholders) would be of great value. Perhaps setting up an anonymous feedback mechanism after each office day or at the end of the project for each of the proposers with which it has interacted during the three months. Anything on this point would be extremely valuable in order to build the case that the service is actually benefiting the community.

Therefore, the proponent \u2013 \u200b\u200bwith long experience in the related field, will provide legal services for the benefit of the Cardano community. The main activities of the proposal are presented clearly and specifically. Results will be made anonymously available to the Cardano community, where blogs on topics of interest to the community are also written monthly. This will be a knowledge resource for the community to actively refer to in the future, improving the community's understanding of the legal issues that exist in the Cardano ecosystem. This legal consulting service is highly adaptable because the proponent has a large network of lawyers around the world. So this service can grow to be widely used in many countries. Besides, the challenges are also clearly identified by the proponent \u2013 \u200b\u200balong with it is a very reasonable solution. Since the proposed team's working time is limited to 1 day/week, they will have to select the most pressing and/or frequently asked questions and deal with them. So I have a question for the proponent, is it possible to increase the execution time in the future? Because the Cardano community is growing in number, 1 day a week probably won't be enough to meet the community's consulting needs.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team member himself has experience in cryptocurrency, law, and information about him is also detailed in the related LinkedIn lines. Not only that, but to increase the quality of service, the proponent also provides information about the people who will support him in the project. The proponent has given a fairly detailed roadmap including the tasks and the timeline for performing those tasks. In general, the two main jobs that this project does is to set up a blog to post legal topics and answer the most frequently asked questions of the community and directly provide legal advice for other proposals. So the roadmap will revolve around blog development, research on the most frequently asked questions, and consulting services. In addition, a combined legal smart contract and smart contract product will be announced to the community. However, the information about this product has not been presented in detail, all that is related to this project that I can refer to is through the link that provides an introduction to the team collaborating with the proponent. : https://www.dlt360consults.com/about. At the same time, I have not seen the proponent have a specific marketing plan to promote his service. How do people know about your legal service?\n  Another thing that makes me confused here is that earlier the proponent said he would have one \"\"working day\"\" per week. However, in the roadmap, the time to perform the work is shortened to 2 days/per month. I hope the proponent will explain this problem.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Again, the proponent listed specific tasks and outlined quantitative indicators to track project progress, all of which will be periodically updated and made public. The community can rely on KPI reports verifying project effectiveness. The only reason I didn't give this section a perfect score is that the proponent hasn't made a specific commitment to how many proposals he and the team can take in in a specific timeframe. For example, I would love to know how many proposals his 1 day/per 2-week office day will be targeted to answer questions for? And how many \u201cCardano Projects\u201d newsletters will be updated every 2 weeks on the blog?", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_4075", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 1, "ng": 6, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14243, "q0": "This is not a good proposition. The proposal will become a SPOC, providing knowledge and legal advice for Cardano projects. This proposal raises the issue of matching challenges. The proposal will solve one question of the challenge, which is: \"How to come up with solutions and provide legal consulting services for funded projects,\" and propose to solve the question. this question. To answer the question \"Can this proposal expand in the future?\", then the answer is possible. Their solution will answer the legal questions sponsored proponents may face in cases like: building a DEX; offering tokens; financial services; offering NFTs or even meme tokens; crypto and blockchain legislation around regulatory compliance, taxes, AML/KYC, payment services, and more. As described, their way of doing things is to work with the DLT 360 blockchain, covering the European market and European legislation regarding stakeholders in the crypto industry, and handling the legal questions of the Cardano community. Their idea was to have a \"business day\" each week where people could call or write to the attorney who developed the proposal, setting up a video conference to ask questions. The attorney will keep timesheets to let the community know about the type of work he does. For legal questions and answers, all company information or personal data will be made anonymous and made available to the Cardano community for their own benefit. Attorneys will blog monthly to highlight topics of interest to the community. In addition, he also has a large network of attorneys around the world that he can help project developers contact if they have a specific legal question in a jurisdiction outside the Union. European Union. I am not really convinced by his arguments and ways of doing things. I wonder why he doesn't gather more lawyers in Europe and other continents to work together. Or link to another proposal to ensure the number of lawyers and teamwork will be more objective instead of subjective. His reputation only affects a few projects and does not guarantee all funded European projects will use his services. I noted that he has provisions for risks and offers solutions to solve them. However, that solution didn't really convince me. In my opinion, the immediate issue he needs to be concerned with is to gather a group of qualified and experienced lawyers in the law of digital currency and blockchain to provide legal support for the proposals funded in Europe, then expand the scale of development. In addition, lawyers can use their relationships with bar associations and governments to quickly grasp changing regulations and ensure the objectivity and legality of advice. In this challenge, there are many proposals submitted, with the goal of providing a solution to legal support for funded projects, so the community will have to consider the scale, quality, and impact. projects with high dynamics.

The plan is quite detailed. His goal is to provide 2 business days per month for legal advice on funded proposals. I am interested in work efficiency, how many projects do you aim to consult? Advice on what issues? How's the quality? As described, he will: Update every 2 weeks to other Cardano proponents via Catalyst coordinator call; Updated every 2 weeks in the \"Cardano Projects\" newsletter; Monthly project process and KPI reports sent to Catalyst team and made public for verification; and the quarterly Swarm Session during office hours (at the end of town) for a Q&A session on legally funded projects. Regarding the budget, the fundraising budget accounted for less than 5% of the total Challenge. The fundraising budget only charged him with expenses, up to 900 EUR/day. This is not a small number, but the service he provides will only be limited to 2 days / month meaning there will be a limit on the number of projects that will be legally supported. As far as I know, some other proposals also provide attorney lists for projects, but their prices are not too high, only from $20 - $60 / attorney / hour and have a target number of proposals. specific legal support will be provided. I agree that good lawyers deserve a high salary when they advise, but he has not been right and convinced me. In addition, this project also needs expenses for project management, audit, communication, compilation of consulting materials, partners, ... but he did not mention. Fundraising budget is not too high, but recalculating the costs as I suggested above, the budget will be much larger. About the group, there is only one member, Mr. Michiel Van Roey and he consulted his wife who is an expert in the tax field. He has experience and qualifications as a Lawyer, the community can verify through Linkedin. With these arguments, I still hold the above opinion, he should finalize his proposal and maybe combine with experts / lawyers in the area or join work networking platforms to keep attorneys and proponents funded.

We have the main target audience mentioned above, in addition to the way the project is conducted in a relatively detailed manner. In particular, to avoid exposing customer information to the outside, the author decided to anonymize the company name as well as the individual. This not only ensures that the client's weakness is not caught by a competitor but also makes the help from the project fairer and more transparent. In addition, to ensure that when receiving unresolved legal or tax-related questions from outside Europe, the author will seek the help of a large network of lawyers around the world. This not only increases the number of projects supported but is also a way to promote the ecosystem to a wide range of lawyers. In addition, the way to solve the problem of overloading is also reasonably used by the author, yet in my opinion, it has not been able to completely solve this problem. Imagine, you only work one day a week, but the number of projects that need help comes from many different fields, no one is the same, so how can you solve it in 24 hours. In this case, I recommend, that the author should extend the number of questions or after how many days will no longer accept questions, along with that, take an extra day to select the questions related to others so that it only needs to be explained once instead of for each company.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Overall, this is a good plan, full of timelines and things to do in each stage.

However, there is one concern that I hope the author can give a satisfactory answer to. It can be seen that the proposer intends to work together with DLT 360 team (Heinz, Jonas, Mauro), as well as receive help from his wife - an expert tax lawyer when receiving questions in relation to taxation, but In the budget section, we don't see the author mentioning paying these people. Then, will they only join the project as volunteers or will there be a payment for them, I hope the author can clarify this issue.

The solution offered is that Cardano hires the author as a tech lawyer, who provides answers to those who are in need through mails, calls or video-conferences. Moreover, he commits to share the questions and answers made between the customers and the lawyer to the Cardano community anonymously. Monthly blogs to highlight the topics of interest are also available. Personally, I believe this would help the Cardano community understand more about legal obligations they have to obey before and after writing for a funding proposal. Furthermore, the more knowledge they acquire, the more confident they become. This eventually incentivizes them to write a funding proposal, make a startup and actualize their innovative ideas to develop a better Cardano ecosystem. However, there are some omission points that I would like to mention. Firstly, the writer has specifically stated his experience, profession as well as determined why he is suitable for the position, yet I think that 1 person and 2 \u201coffice days\u201d a month would not be enough. As stated in the risk section, if there are 100 or more requests received within 1 day, which might be true concerning the highly growing speed of the Cardano community, some of the questions would remain unclarified and cause dissatisfaction among the community. In my opinion, the mitigation of picking the most concerned topic would not be effective. Accordingly, there are a few options that I would like to suggest from a personal point of view: gather more people and work as a team, increase the number of \u201coffice day\u201d days or answer simple questionnaire mails daily and only approve calls and video-conferences for complicated problems. Secondly, the author did mention that FAQs and hot topics would be kept highlighted on his blogs, as well as regular informative cases would be public to the Cardano community, though, he did not describe how he is going to keep the information within the community only. From my point of view, making such intelligence accessible by Cardano users only would bring about more users towards the system and greatly benefit it. Additionally, it seems like giving away this project\u2019s funds for charity if that knowledge is public for everyone. As regards, I suggest the project developer describe more about this problem.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In this section, a clear plan was provided with 3 different milestones settled.

Also, the proposer gives specific required salary per day, along with a total amount of money needed for a whole year. Nevertheless, $22,700 is not a small figure, which I believe would need a thorough consideration. I believe that the writer is a mindful and professional individual through careful notations and additional information given. Besides, in the part describing people who will work on the project, the author mentioned working with 3 other partners, yet, there are no explanations about what roles or tasks they have in this project. One small suggestion of mine is that he should clarify this part.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Very particular and reasonable KPIs were given in order to deliver the best result possible. Nevertheless, I suggest that the team should use some proper tools such as JIRA to help them easily keep track of the progress. Moreover, they should also describe how they are going to post regular reports ( social media platforms or any relevances) so that the community as well as the Catalyst keep up with what phrase they are in. One point that I appreciate from this section is that they divide the KPIs into 2 different periods: the short-mid-term and the mid-long-term. This is very helpful for evaluating the process.
