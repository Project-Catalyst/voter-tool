Because here our goal is to provide direct access to solutions that provide financial and legal services, support, and guidance to emerging Projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem. This proposal is about \u201cdeveloping a framework for a KYC token - not dedicated to one wallet - that can be used to get verified automatically to ensure safe and fast crypto transactions\u201d. But how will this especially help many emerging projects in Catalyst which are facing legal and financial issues which block them from moving forward? Because in my opinion, the objectives of this challenge are aiming for Cardano projects could broaden their horizons and increase their impact on the Ecosystem once legal and financial frameworks are explored and established. I can\u2019t see what the direct benefits would be for these majors, so I think the proponent should make it clearer why he chose to launch this proposal in this challenge. It doesn\u2019t seem in line with the metrics here, maybe this project will fit better with the Dapps challenge, for example. Therefore, as much as the application is useful for Cardano, it would be meeting only one of the facets necessary for the challenge to be adequately addressed. So unfortunately, I will give a low note for the impact.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The script provided is shallow. We know what was going to happen very superficially. My suggestion is for the proponent to go further into explaining each of the activities \u2013 we know what would happen and when, but not how.

It\u2019s given a good breakdown, but we don\u2019t know within those parts how much each thing would cost. If this had been defined, we would certainly understand the monetary use better.

I think we should have some way of auditing the tasks of professionals, tasks that would generate the goals to be analyzed. Both parties are required to be evaluated. It is necessary for the team to prepare monthly reports, for example, on how their work routines have been, and make them available to the entire Cardano community. Regarding the final results, in my honest opinion, the goal is ambitious: \u201cA framework for creating KYC tokens, that is accepted from many customers, partners and companies and which can actually decrease the time of verification for a transaction.\u201d We will continue to achieve this: \u201cHow can we more accurately and objectively measure whether the project is actually being adopted by stores? It would be interesting for the team to do some research gathering information about which stores are using the technology and in what way. It also essential that the team analyze the direct impacts of all this for our blockchain and also for legal and finance? And how has this impacted the\u2026 of the \u2026?

And that is, how to actually get the token widely accepted? Would Binance, for example, be accepting this token? They would have to be willing to trust it 100%, as it would put their business in jeopardy if there were even a minor problem with it. I do not see that happening, and I do not see it happening for any bigger company in the upcoming future. If that token were to be issued by Binance? Well, then, that would probably change a lot, since they are a very big company, with a large reputation to uphold and with a lot of influence in the space. Please, do not get me wrong, I have been following NMKR since the beginning and I love their product, it\u2019s just that I do not see how this token would be implemented on a larger scale, at least, not yet.

Having said this, I find the implementation plan to be sufficiently detailed and clear, however, what is not mentioned anywhere in the proposal, is the duration period for the entire project and for each step individually. Neither do I find any time-related metrics in the budget section, that in my opinion, is really too light on details. It contains only a number associated with each of the 4 steps, without any additional information. I understand the NMKR team has a very busy schedule, but if they do decide to ask the community to fund their projects, they need to find the time to put in a minimal effort, otherwise, it could lead to a precedent, where if they get voted anyway, they wouldn\u2019t bother to complete any of their proposals in the future, because they get voted anyway, and I am sure, that is not how they envision the process. I would say the same applies to the team description that contains only 1 name and a bullet list of jobs needed to finalise the project.

A very scanty provision made by the proposer is unacceptable in the view of the catalyst community. The summary of the relevant experience was a total deviation from the requirement.

There seem to be little in this project to help achieve the KPI needed to ensure the success of the project.

Exploring ways to use Web 3 technologies to increase the efficiency of KYC processes is a worthwhile endeavor. KYC is clearly related to the goal of this challenge to seek legal and financial implementations.\n\nThe challenge for this project is that the issuing of a token as a record of KYC is only the final step of a very complex KYC process, involving the actual assessment of KYC and the acceptance of it by a particular entity. For example, I am an investor in a Web 2 KYC/AML business called NorthRow (https://www.northrow.com/) \u2013 it has taken this company many years to develop a platform that performs these essential KYC tasks effectively. The proposers seem to recognize this challenge in one of their auditability responses (\u201cThen we need to start a use case with a partner who accepts our token to measure real-life transactions where KYC is required.\u201d), but the proposal focuses almost entirely on the token issuance process.\n\nFor these reasons, I agree but do not strongly agree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge.

This would make sense in a more limited exploratory proposal, but a $90K project should have more detail about the plan. In particular, it should show a better understanding of how the proposal fits into the overall KYC process, as described under Impact above. In particular, $60K of the budget is designated to \u201cset-up a prototype App including KYC verification and token generation\u201d \u2013 this will be difficult to do without a plan on how the app fits into the KYC process. Finally, no basis is given for the calculation of the proposed budget, such as hourly or daily rates.\n\nFor these reasons, I disagree that the experience and plan presented indicates a high likelihood that the project will be implemented successfully.
