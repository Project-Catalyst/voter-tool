For example, the idea here is \u201cdelegating some team to do a quick research and make a division and also a collaborate with many universities, many startups, and also fintech under BAPPEPTI (the regulator of Indonesia) and KOMINFO (the watcher of the Indonesian government for investment companies)\u201d. This seems to be great, but I don\u2019t think it has been explained in a sufficient way for us to be convinced that the objectives of the challenge will be achieved. Because the objective of the project is to \u201cdrive many people can be seen through financial implementation to provide more transparency, clarity, and no ambiguity among each debtor, and robust lending fintech will be trusted\u201d. It\u2019s quite ambitious, but unfortunately, the proposal makes the information about the content very abstract. I think it would be important for the proponent to better contextualize the problem. How could it drive many people to take advantage of the main use of Cardano through financial implementation? And I don\u2019t think \u201cdelegate some team to do a quick research and make a division\u201d and \u201ccollaborate with many universities, many startups, and also fintech\u201d are good ways enough to solve two points that the proponent has been raised: \u201cno ambiguity among each debtor\u201d and \u201crobust lending fintech will be trusted\u201d. Besides that, what worries me is whether this proposal aligns exactly with the objectives of the challenge in which it was launched. In this challenge, we are looking to fund projects that provide financial and legal services, support, and guidance to emerging projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem. In this case, however, the proposal as a whole is very abstract. We know that the content would be created, but what kind of content will be covered? What issues would be addressed exactly? Who would do that? How would the local public in Indonesia be motivated to participate? How often would these activities happen? etc. I think the proponent should have provided this basic information to us, we were unable to understand what the works are currently being carried out and that they intend to evolve through this proposal. Due to the lack of these explanations, we do not know if the objectives of the challenge will be achieved. For these reasons, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that interesting for us to fund this project, it is not cheap, it would be 45 thousand dollars invested for something that will facilitate access to information that would be not clearly. Besides that, in my opinion, it is already quite simple to have such information.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "In the matter of the roadmap, we are presented with what would happen each year (from Q4 2021), and some activities are listed. However, the period of a year is such a very long time. it would be better if they divided these tasks into months or quarters, for example. What would happen in months 1, 2, 3, and so on. It would also be necessary to better explain each activity since all we are told would be what will happen, but not how. Individual details are not explained. For example, in Q1 to Q4, the following activities would be carried out: Grassroot penetration to education foundations and NGOs, grassroots penetration to Political parties and community, creating a template or even platform (Cardano x fintech), planning to create a platform that is integrated between Accounting System and Blockchain. Who would do that? How would they penetrate the grassroots? Who would create the template or platform? What\u2019s the plan in detail for creating a platform that is integrated between Accounting System and Blockchain? How they are going to get the attention of target audiences and attract them, especially to our Cardano ecosystem? etc. As well as these, the other activities also should have been better explained. Now moving on to the budget explanation, we are informed in a very basic way about expenses. In my opinion, this part also needed to be more carefully detailed. For example, the bidder explains how the total money requested (45 thousand dollars, which is quite high) would be divided into the salaries of the professionals involved, but I would like to know how much time they would dedicate to this project so that we can know the value of their work hour? In 24 months, would they work every week, every month, or every quarter? If we had this information, we would be able to ascertain whether the amount asked was fair or not. About the building platform, why would that cost 4.800 dollars? How would this amount be distributed over 24 months of work? Therefore, I think all parts should be better explained, the way this feasibility of the proposal is presented, we don\u2019t have a good visualization of how the money would be spent. Finally, talking about the team, we know each of those involved very well, individually and in detail. We know their names, their professional areas, previous work, LinkedIn and which of them have some kind of connection with Cardano, which are active members of our community in Indonesia. So, about the team, I have no criticism to make as I think that part is already ideal. General, my opinion on the feasibility of the project is as follows: the roadmap could be better detailed, as well as the budget; the description of the team members is excellent.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability of the project is good but it is not ideal either. We can monitor whether the development process was done properly through the rich detail in this part. This work for us to understand how big the project is becoming, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough for us to measure the human impact of the thing. It is possible to verify that the tasks that were promised for each month (or quarter) were actually being done at the right time and in the right way. It would be necessary for the proponents to keep the Cardano community always up to date on the progress made in the phases, on the small goals achieved, as well as how their work routines were being carried out. Regarding the final result, I think they indicate the clear ways to see if the project was successful, which would be the impact of this project on Cardano ecosystem in Indonesia, by the excerpt \u201cCommunities in each city (Java, Bali, Kalimantan) actively offer the system to be applied on Fintech and startups, also branding it on University as curriculum or event guest topic to be engaged on Students and lecturer.\u201d In general, I believe that auditability would be better explored and ensured and that we would have more control over project monitoring.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 4, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6666, "q0": "We have a very weak value proposition. The first sign of this is that by reading the proposal\u2019s summary, which should be the elevator pitch, giving you an instant view of what you are about to dive into, it is rather unclear what the project\u2019s aim is. But moving past this point, in the hope of finding more clarity in other sections, this is not the case. Looking at the budget section and the detailed project plan we manage to bring more clarity into the subject, since the team wishes to develop an integrated system between accounting and blockchain, but we are not being told which accounting system, and which blockchain. The key deliverables also mention accounting systems, and reporting tools, but again, not something you can readily translate into a concrete, short sentence. \n\nGiven the total lack of clarity, I am rather forced to offer one star for this project\u2019s impact, since it is not clear what we are being proposed. ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "Fanny and Randy are the two persons behind this proposal. Fanny has been a Cardano community advisor until now, while Randy\u2019s background is in futures exchange and securities companies in Indonesia. They also offer a two year roadmap, sprinkled with grassroot penetration to NGOs, political parties, and fintech (don\u2019t forget about the accounting deliverables okay?) \n\nFor the budget section, 17k USD would go to project management activities, while operational costs would eat up around 10k USD, and promotion activities another 10k. Building the platform would merely cost 5k USD. From my point of view there is a clear lack of feasibility since the figures thrown there are not realistic at all, considering the complexities of building a classical accounting platform, let alone one which integrates with a blockchain. \n\nAgain, a rather short assessment from my side, and only two stars, given the budget\u2019s complete detachment from the complexities of the blockchain ecosystem. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The team promises an increased awareness regarding accounting systems and blockchain (so there must have been an educational component I missed somewhere) and reporting processes and tools available for the community. We would also have a final report presented to us. \n\nThey are also proposing 3-5 performance indicators to support their reporting process and ten companies using their services. In the closing statements we find out that the project would be focused on a few Indonesian cities (Java, Bali, Kalimantan) and the system would be actively promoted to existing fintechs. \n\nIt is rather difficult not to connect the information available in this section with the rest of the proposal, and given the lack of overall clarity as to what the project intends to do, I can only offer three stars in the auditability section. My advice for future iterations is to really work on their value proposition and make it much, much more clear.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9004, "q0": "Typically, I try to look past language issues in proposals and give people the benefit of the doubt. I know how difficult it is to translate to other languages as someone who pretty much is only capable of speaking English. However, this proposal is pretty difficult to follow. Best I can tell the team plans to interact with societal organizations within Indonesia to promote blockchain as a way of moving society forward, legally, educationally, and financially. I am not sure how they attempt to do this, but the goal is admirable and impactful. Ideally, this proposal would be revised and resubmitted with a clearer statement of impact. Additionally, the challenge goals are to see legal and financial impact as a result of funding in this round. But this proposal appears to be working on education and problem sensing within the next two years prior to bringing any solutions to market. It would be ideal to move this to a future fund that might have a research and education challenge. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "This proposal lays out a two+ year roadmap, but is really light on details. There are less than ten steps on the roadmap which consists of a full two years. The budget is less unclear, which is good. They have presented a more than reasonable budget for what will be two years of work. This makes it really difficult to determine what is going to take place or what the team plans to do with their time and funding. This does not mean that the project is not feasible, however. As stated previously, for me, there is an understanding gap that makes it difficult to fully assess. With the lack of details it is even harder. The team is involved in Catalyst, which is a huge benefit, but unfortunately, I cannot rate this any higher due to the above stated issues. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This team is planning on presenting multiple reports on multiple metrics as part of their proposal. They are committed to transparency and auditability. They have sufficient detail to determine whether they are making progress toward their goals. I have not found their proposal sufficiently clear however to really be able to assess what they will be planning to do, but the team is clearly a contributing part of the catalyst, which should help them rework this proposal and bring it back in the next Fund.

Whereas the intention is to disseminate knowledge about the Cardano ecosystem to more specific audiences, respecting its characteristics and particularly to more people outside the circle of community like Businessman, Media, and also universities. The idea is to provide more transparency, clarity, and no ambiguity among each debtor, and robust lending fintech will be trusted in a way that is more adapted to their learning process, as certainly the explanations provided for people across professionals and also student who is already familiar with technology and yet not aware of the blockchain concept.\nit extremely positive how the Proposer, in addition to explaining what they would do, gives a lot of details about how it would be done. How can we present knowledge about Cardano to the targeted audience? A whole scheme is outlined, in which some steps would be taken: \n- first, through collaboration with universities, the goal is for students to have an impact who can pass this information on to the wider community. \n- Second, the content itself would be developed, for collaboration with political parties to be able to convey this blockchain information\n- Afterwards, such contents would be disseminated, I think it would be interesting if, in addition to social networks and institutions that target the political parties, companies and financial professionals. \nAlso, as the alternative communication to be adopted, such as: a survey and research could be carried out on the main radio stations that the elderly listen, and during the programmes, something about Cardano could also be included. But this is just a suggestion, as the Proposer already demonstrates that it has several options on how to disseminate the contents generated here. It is also very good that the Proposer has already provided the KPIs since the impact analysis, as it demonstrates that they have detail goals, knows where they want to go and that all the work will be based on those objectives. \n\nI believe in the great potential of this proposal, on which it was described in a very rich way in detail, that the intention of building a platform which is integrated between Accounting System and Blockchain, through which activities this will be developed and also what particular goals we seek to meet. I also think that the targeted people are a very relevant audience, because the Proposer understand how unique market in Indonesia is. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the proposal is good. In relation to the key milestones, we are shown which activities would be developed in accordance to passage of time. The way this is done, we have a good general understanding of processes. We can understand what to expect and when. However, the activities themselves could have been better detailed. In the \"2021 Q4 \", I believe it is typo and referring to 2022 instead, because it passed already if it is not. Allow me to put it as first quarter for example, \"segmenting the market which needed this Financial implementation\", this activity would be better to put detail of the segmentation method along with the detail of the targeted market and the criteria, so I think more details should have been provided on this.\n\nAbout the budget, its quiet fair where we can generally understand how the requested money would be used, I don\u2019t have much concern for this part. However, for \"Build platform $ 4.800\" I wish there was more detail on this part where this numbers come from. So, we know the value of the developer work hours or if it is purchased platform, we may need to put detail of it.\nAs far as the team is concerned, we are introduced to the team (Fanny Wijaya and Randy). Their areas of expertise are explained, it is clear how they relate to Cardano. Their linkedin profiles are also attached, where we could have more practical examples of their past experiences. Therefore, I think the project's feasibility is good.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the project is good, as we know in what ways we could monitor both the process and the final results of this proposal. Regarding the target of the process, I believe that this part is perfect, as the proponent states that a reporting process and tools (i.e. excel, miro) which will be available for the community; this tool is very interesting because it is the useful information for member community and in other company as well. It is also positive how the proponent places Cardano in relation to the frequency in which this report would be updated. However, the proponent should determine the frequency of the report. Therefore, in order for the progress of the stages to be audited, it will be enough for us members of the Cardano community check on clear period of report to check the available updates. Also the proponent states that they will measure how many people are using the platform they developed, regarding this, the proponent should determine the targetted numbers as they already have population market as the research being done before during the impact and feasibity analysis. Regarding the auditability of the final scenario, I think that the audit quality will be good as we will know what is wanted to achieve (to increase this proposal's impact on the Ecosystem on financial frameworks that are explored and established,to ho helping members of the community Cardano & Catalyst to apply financial framework to their activities) as it will also measured thru their KPIs. In this way, I think we would be monitoring the end scenario as well as the gradual progress. \n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_3366", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12213, "q0": "This proposal sets out problem statement that Indonesian are not yet aware the existence of Blockchain function and the benefits of use it.

Furthermore, the team will collaborate with the university, start-up and FinTech company and the government of Indonesia to increase the awareness of Blockchain. By collaborating with those external parties, the project will implement properly. Thus, I agree with this idea. However, some risks that mentioned by team, are focusing on the education.
