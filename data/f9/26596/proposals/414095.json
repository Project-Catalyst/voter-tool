I foresee this legal hub being widely used by funded Catalyst proposals and even early-stage projects planning Catalyst proposals. The solution seems quite scalable over the long term. And while this first proposal seeks to address US law (which many projects must navigate with regard to securities law and SaaS, among other areas of US law), I like that the proposers are considering  extending the hub's support to other jurisdictions in future proposals.\n\nAnd the true brilliance of this proposal is the incorporation of CLE credits for US attorneys, because catalyzing the growth of more legal expertise in web 3 projects is just as important as providing a resource like this hub to funded proposers and others building on Cardano.\n\nI hope this hub will pay special attention to addressing questions that are somewhat special to Cardano - e.g. ISPO and stake pool based fundraising, and taxation of Project Catalyst.\n\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team appears to be very well qualified to implement the project successfully. Combined, they appear to have all the skills and core competencies required to build the legal hub, complete it's CLE accreditation and facilitate its CLE courses.

By creating a webinar series and directory of \u201cweb3\u201d(or crypto-) friendly lawyers, resources will be built to help funded proposers with thorny legal issues such as Know-Your-Customer requirements, taxes and copyrights. In addition, an overview of risk-mitigation measures and blockchain knowledge, for example covering stablecoins and smart contracts, will be provided. These resources could potentially also benefit participants outside the Catalyst system and present a welcome resource to anyone trying to build on Cardano, benefitting our ecosystem overall. By making the content available on Youtube, barriers of entry will be lowered and access to legal advice democratized. \n\nGiven that the proposer has been trained as a lawyer and practices in the United States increases the impact of this proposal in a Challenge that is targeted at a quite niche audience (funded proposers) as access to US investors, customers and compliance professionals will benefit a large share of funded proposers (compared to smaller markets) and should also be applicable to many non-US-based early-stage companies or individual entrepreneurs. The proposal could be made stronger by providing more details about the content up-front, to help the voters gauge the return on intent and possible directions beyond buzzwords. \n\nThe proposer has an impressive social media reach and seems to be well-connected but could have demonstrated these qualities better by providing more information about the team of educators / guest speakers and resources that will be used to create an impactful platform and valuable content.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The main proposer has a background that seems highly qualified to successfully address the challenge and carry out the proposal. With training and experience in both legal services and film-making, creating a webinar series about legal obstacles and requirements on funded proposers is likely to be of high quality and provide useful and well-presented content. The team further consists of an experienced web developer and a designer. Linkedin profiles and references are provided, giving me high confidence that the project can be delivered to a high quality standard. The proposal may have provided more details in some aspects of feasibility metrics. For the budget, hourly rates and item breakdowns would have been nice to see, and the timeline could consist of more than repetitions of each webinar as a deliverable - for example check-ins with the community, timeline for marketing and audit tasks, evolution of content etc. I agree that it is likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Although it is in my opinion highly feasible that this proposal can be implemented successfully given its potential (skills, experiences, track record), the team could have put more effort into linking the project's milestones with a timeline and audit deliverables to allow the community to check on the progress of the implementation. The proposal plans to communicate through Project Catalyst channels the progress over the eight months implementation period. It would have been great to learn exactly which channels these are, and I also would have liked a more granular breakdown of the goals to allow early tracking of project success. For example, instead of 50 lawyers listed in the directory or 8 webinars held at the end of eight months, partial targets after three or five months would have been helpful.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2554", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact:  The PA states that the proposal could be made stronger by providing more details about the content up-front not buzzwords, yet those \"buzzwords\" listed are the actual subjects of the webinars and each one will be addressed by a legal expert in a detailed fashion within a given webinar.\nAuditability:  The project's progress is clearly auditable on the website as to whether monthly deliverables are being met.

It is a scalable project with a clear marketing program so that they attract as many lawyers as possible. The risk management arrangement is accurate since they take into account aspects like content obsolescence which is crucial in subjects like the one treated because of the variability of legal frameworks in emergent technologies.

Regarding the road map, it could be said that it is balanced. This is because it is limited in time but at the same time provides the team with enough flexibility to solve any kind of problem that may occur. At the same time, the proposer presents a plan for future funds requests so that they could expand themselves to more countries than just the U.S. The budget is also clear, but it would be preferred to bring more details related to where the calculation come from and how the team got to these values, for transparency reasons.

The number of attendees and the results of in-webinar surveys are actually very useful to measure engagement and commitment to the project.

This is why it shows that the team proposes a clear and understandable solution to address the problem (Rating given: 5)\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2822", "no_vca": 12, "ne": 0, "ng": 8, "nfo": 4, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Feasibility:  The PA states that the budget is clear yet bases score wanting more details in the budget without noting any details that are lacking."}, {"id": 6641, "q0": "This proposal fits well with the challenge. To recall, its purpose is to offer legal and / or financial solutions that can support funded proposers, especially in the context where their backgrounds are more often than not more technical, and less focused on legal / financial / tax / accounting aspects. \n\nThis proposal specifically seeks to achieve this through two paths: firstly, raise awareness on blockchain topics through a series of webinars tailored for the legal industry (focused towards US lawyers). This is what I would call capacity building within the legal industry in order to be ready to provide services to funded proposers domiciled in important US jurisdictions (California, Delaware, New York, etcetera). Secondly, the proposer wishes to create a directory of lawyers that are ready to support Web3 business and obviously who have the capacity to drill down on complex issues and offer the targeted support on a case by case basis.  Another excellent point is that non-US lawyers can attend the webinars, should they wish to offer their services to US-based proposers, so there is some potential for scalability. \n\nHowever, the project misses a \u201cnative\u201d capacity and initial strategy towards having a wider geographical outreach which would make it extremely easy for legal practitioners from other countries / regions to benefit from these webinars in a more direct way, for instance to be ready to offer their services within their geographical locations after attending the webinars. In my view, in order to have an excellent scalability potential, the project could be focused (or maybe this can be a future development line) more towards a \u201cglobal hub\u201d that offers country-agnostic legal advice.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "We have a very clear roadmap ahead of us. The proposer divides the activities into monthly lists, with a very good density of webinars per each month. In the beginning the roadmap also accounts for a partnership outreach - a very important activity in order to reach a wider audience for the following webinars. Legal experts will be conducting each webinar, with different focuses, for instance business organization, tax, AML, copyright, smart contracts, etcetera. \n\nA great strength of the proposal is that the proposers will seek to obtain CLE (continuous learning education) accreditation for their webinars. In the US each state requires CLE credits to retain a license to practice law, and I think this will be a major plus when marketing the webinars to legal practitioners since their time invested can be put to good use towards reaching their annual CLE quotas. \n\nA minus point in my view is the fact that we do not have a very clear understanding of how these legal experts are onboarded into the project initially. We do know that the main proposer (Shirah) is a legal expert but we also know that she will take care of the project management. So many questions arise: will she also be part of the legal experts delivering the webinars or will she be in charge of selecting those experts externally? If the former is true, how will the workload be divided between the two activities? If the latter, is there a plan in place to select those experts, and how do we gain comfort that a proper due diligence procedure will be used in the selection? \n\n\nThe budget section offers a good enough split for each activity undertaken. Almost 9k USD are reserved for the legal experts taking part in the webinars. Project management covers an additional 7.5k USD, and website development another 4.5k USD. The CLE accreditation process will cover (under two different headings) over 5k USD, but my feeling is that this item is lowballed given the target US states in which the proposers will seek accreditation.  \n\nAs points of improvement I can definitely mention the lack of hourly rates across the board - the entire budget, and most of the individual captions, would have benefited from a more granular estimation of hours involved and hourly rates. The second point is the CLE accreditation process which in my view should have been covered more extensively and with a breakdown per each individual state in order to better capture the costs involved.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This part of the proposal is very good across the board. Firstly, since the webinars are designed to be \u201cmarketed\u201d towards legal practitioners and since the project has set aside a hefty budget for their own web portal, it will be very easy to make the webinars available for the general audience and to raise awareness about them through the already known Catalyst channels (discord, Telegram proposers channel, etcetera). \n\nSo it will be very easy for anyone to check not also the delivery of the webinars, but also go through the recordings and make its own assessment of their quality (provided they have the legal background to do so) and also assess their impact by observing the number of participants for each, and the level of engagement during them ( number and quality of questions asked, general level of debate, etcetera). \n\nThe proposers also take good care of choosing appropriate goals. We know from the very beginning that there will be eight seminars in total, and the team sets its own challenge of on-boarding 50 lawyers onto the platform in the first eight months of the project.  \n\nA suggestion if I may, Is to ask the proposer to consider including additional KPIs that can measure the success of each webinar, through for instance: measuring attendance and implementing feedback surveys at the end of each webinar. This way, the team can gauge extremely well not only the popularity of each topic, but also the way in which their legal experts selected have performed and whether they should be employed in future sessions.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 2, "vca_o": 1, "reply": "Impact:  The PA states that they are rating the proposal lower based beacuse a country-agnostic global hub wasn't proposed, instead of on this proposal's impact.\nFeasibility: The proposal doesn't list legal experts because it states that the legal experts will need to be recruited for the project, and that proposer has the requisite credentials to do so. The proposer also asks for other details, yet agrees the budget is reasonable and clear. "}, {"id": 7086, "q0": "The proposer proposed hosting eight webinars, creating a directory of Web3-knowledge-equipped lawyers based in the United States and laying out their foundation for a Web3 legal hub. Finding lawyers and legal guidance for a cryptocurrency project is challenging. The current regulatory framework is incompatible with the evolving rate of blockchain technologies, including Web3. Also, most of the terminology in this domain is vague to many lawyers, creating confusion. The proposer plans to tackle this problem by managing webinars that bring domain experts to talk about legal concerns such as token sales, tax, KYC and many more. At the end of the series, the proposer would follow up with the attendees to put them on a directory where they could get contacted to support Web3 projects, including funded proposals from Project Catalyst. This benefits the lawyers and the Cardano ecosystem because they could now collaborate. By providing the webinars free of charge, uploading them to Youtube, and having plans on expanding to other countries, I strongly believe this proposal would be a significant contributor to solving regulatory issues of blockchain technologies.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I tend to agree the proposer could carry out the proposal. The proposer\u2019s profile is verifiable, and their experience suits the proposed implementation items. The end product they promised is also realistic, considering they have eight months to manage the webinars from start to finish, averaging two webinars each month. The proposer has regarded the problem of finding knowledgeable speakers and planned to tackle it using their network to find legal experts in each subject. Likewise, the issue of finding an audience is tackled by using LinkedIn event ads and offering webinars free of charge to garner interest. However, I would like a more detailed breakdown of the budget, for example, how many work hours are for developing the website. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to provide those details because the proposer already has a developer who would be directly involved in those matters. That being said, I will still support this proposal because even though the budget items haven\u2019t been broken down, the amount for each is reasonable.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer targets to successfully run eight webinars and list 50 lawyers in the directory. The proposer would also provide recordings of those webinars to the public through their website, which would scale the proposal's reach. I appreciate that the proposert already plans to publish the \u201ctranscripts of any in-webinar surveys or discussions,\u201d which would help us see how the transfer of information went. I want to suggest the proposer list the attendee's questions and concerns so we could also improve and reiterate based on what lawyers usually don\u2019t understand with the current Web3 topics.

Also, the PA seems to want a day-by-day detailed breakdown for the roadmap, which is unreasonable for purposes of this proposal."}, {"id": 7150, "q0": "The proposal is great and corresponds very well to the objectives of this challenge, as the proponent herself states, it is legal hub housing a Web3 legal webinar series and a directory of Web3 lawyers. The contextualized problem is that current new technology is exciting for its developers, and the legal field is often left playing catch up. This makes it difficult for projects to find adequate legal support because not enough lawyers have been trained to support Web3 organizations. Also, it may be difficult to locate Web3-friendly lawyers that already exist, and even if they are located, these lawyers may be unwilling to take on projects because they lack the capacity to take on additional clients. Meanwhile, many Project Catalyst funded projects, and Web3 projects in general, need legal support and guidance. So the solution is to create a webinar series that would provide an overview of relevant legal issues facing Web3 projects. With that, each webinar would feature lawyers who are experts in their field. The proponent would offer multi-state, participatory 2-hour/unit continuing legal education (\u201cCLE\u201d) courses. I found that this initiative would provide free valuable content to lawyers and the Catalyst Community and also a directory where people can look up Web3 friendly lawyers. Besides that, I think that is a great way to educate and onboard more people into this space. In my opinion, the tool is needed in the Web3 community. Moreover, I found the whole to be very well explained and very straight forward. The process would be divided into 3 topics - Web3 education for lawyers, legal issues covered by the webinar series, and legal webinars benefit funded proposers. Each part is very detailed. Despite being a legal-technical proposal, it is possible to understand what will be done, as the content is explained in an accessible way. Therefore, I believe that the impact can be maximum if everything is done in the planned way. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is very good. Starting with the script, we exactly which webinars would be launched each month. In this way, we have a very solid and secure understanding of the construction process of this idea. I have no criticisms to make about this part of the proposal because the script already has the short time allocations and a chronological listing of the webinars to be launched. The only point that could be even better would be, in my view, that the activities in 3-first-months could be broken down. For example, the \u201cWebsite design and launch\u201d will take place in months 1-3, how would this be done? How long of the month would it take? And who would work here? etc. Now speaking of the budget, it\u2019s broken down into a few parts and I can say that our understanding of how it would be used is solid, but not perfect. Some parts should be better sorted out. For example, there are the basically salaries of those activities involved. I think it would be better to measure this price based on the hour of work, how many legal experts would work on this project, who would receive how much, and also the value of the working hours of each of the professionals involved. Besides that, the \u201csponsored LinkedIn events advertisement\u201d part would take 1,200USD, I think it deserves to be more detailed, what would happen, how, when and by whom. Regarding the team, I think the level of detail is satisfactory, but it could be better. We know who they are and their roles in the project, but a small curriculum of each could have been provided, and how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. Overall, I will give it four stars because I strongly believe that this project will work, but I missed those details. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is fully auditable, the topic is almost perfect. The proponent gives many metrics for measuring both progress and final results. As for progress, they suggest many ways that we could track 3 milestones of the project. I think they are really good indicators to see how this project is developing in practice, but it is not clear how this information would be accessible to the Cardano community. Besides that, I also suggest that at the end of each month, a final report is made available that contains links to the videos that were launched, the list of attendees, etc\u2026 and also a summary of how the team worked in that period of time. I think that this way, we would have a more complete understanding of the process. And in terms of the final results, I would like more qualitative data to be analyzed in addition to the numerical statistics provided by the proponent. We must know the number of legal webinars, the number of lawyers listed in the directory by Month 8, number of the legal webinar recordings communicated through Project Catalyst channels, etc\u2026 because these quantities will objectively demonstrate the scope of this project. But beyond that, we would need to understand if the people who watched those legal webinars were understanding well, or if they became active members of the community\u2026 In summary, I think the auditability is good, but it can improve in some points, mainly due to a more humane approach to the final results. Other than that, everything is ideal, the proposal is excellent, all the topics are very good works and in my opinion, it certainly deserves funding.

This can be accomplished by indicating how much interest exists for this type of resource, what this resource will enable lawyers to do (or rather what precisely they will help the cryptocurrency be able to do LEGALLY), and how this program bridges the gap between Web3 trained lawyers on LinkedIn to a direct impact on Project Catalyst Funded proposals.

The roadmap is repetitive and leaves out what one might think is necessary to produce this type of event. The roadmap does not indicate development of the webinar curriculum/content, timeline expectation for CLE accreditation application, or any other developments as an organization beyond just the webinars for a potential greater impact. The roadmap is also rather repetitive, which might turn off voters if it seems unsubstantial or copy/pasted. The budget is a nice breakdown of each category where the money is being spent but each of the categories could use more detail. The best budgets I\u2019ve seen are one\u2019s that breakdown hours of labor, costs of each individual advertisement, and references to roadmap timeframes. I do get a little confused in the section about project workers and the first point of the budget. The budget says \u201cspeaker fees\u201d paid to legal experts but there\u2019s only one legal expert listed on the team (and we could use some detail on that individuals legal experience, not just her education).

Also, they in accurately state that there is no curriculum stated for the web content, when the proposal details each webinar topic that will be covered by a legal expert to be put up on the website. Also inaccurately states the timeline expectation for the CLE accreditiation, which is accounted for in the roadmap. They also state that all of the legal expertise is left to one person, although the roadmap clearly outlines recruiting legal experts. Thus I believe that the PA didn't carefully read the proposal.\nAuditability:  The PA rates this section lower because the metrics do not meet his wish list; though the wish list would actually be more problematic in terms of the community\u2019s ability to audit said metrics. Also, the number of video views will be able to be ascertained via standard YouTube metrics, and the progress is clearly auditable on the website whether monthly deliverables are being met.

The problem the proposal focuses on addressing is the lack of Web3-friendly attorneys in the blockchain industry and of the Catalyst projects. The solution is, to establish an online legal center to support and guide lawyers in the blockchain industry with legal knowledge related to Web3. The purpose of the proposal is, through providing this knowledge will help increase the number of attorneys knowledgeable about Web3 and provide direct legal guidance to Web3 projects slated to operate in the United States. Personally, I think the proposed information is concise, direct, and clear. The authors have very solidly explained how the legal center and legal advice service for Web3 will work. According to the team's description, this center will operate in the form of organizing Web3 legal webinars, free online legal training courses lasting 2 hours (for lawyers), accompanied by one-on-one consulting services and a Web3-friendly attorney directory (for Cardano project owners who can easily access profiles of Web3 attorneys and connect with them). A potential marketing plan is also put forward by the authors to connect with law firms and legal associations, as well as promote live webinars, Youtube, and LinkedIn. I believe that these comprehensive, synchronous solutions will make it possible for Catalyst Web3 projects to have the perfect legal support to legally build and operate in the United States. Regarding the project's risk factor assessment, the team pointed out four main risks they could face: difficulty recruiting legal experts with Web3 knowledge, difficulty inviting them to participate, content Outdated documentation due to changes in the law, and ultimately a web maintenance risk. However, I personally think that another risk that the team needs to consider is that the devaluation of cryptocurrencies in the bear market can affect the project's funding and viability. This has an even greater impact when the project implementation period is 8 months long. I suggest the team consider setting aside 10-15% of the contingency budget for this. Overall, I rate 5 points because of the impact and interesting solutions that the project offers. As we know, Web3 is the next generation of the Internet but is also controversial about privacy and related legal issues. Solving the problem of the legal basis for Web3 projects operating on the Cardano platform is, therefore, more meaningful and important to our ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the feasibility of the proposal, I think I have a lot of confidence in the team because the process and implementation plan are described in detail. There will be 8 webinars conducted in 8 months, with a detailed schedule for each month. However, there are some points I suggest the team needs to add and clarify. Specifically, I did not find a plan to put the conference recordings on channels like Youtube, and LinkedIn as the original project mentioned. In addition, the content related to access to legal experts has not been included in the roadmap of the proposal. The community will not be able to understand at what time period this work will be done during the 8 months of the project. So I suggest the team add to the implementation progress. The estimated budget is broken down by category. However, I suggest the team should clarify the unit cost of each item. For example, the total speaker fees paid to legal experts recommended by the team $8,800 should be broken down: how many experts are expected? What is the speaker fee/presentation hour? Similarly, how much should a webinar moderator cost per person per webinar? Regarding the cost of web development, I myself have 5 years of experience in web development, I understand the cost of the domain, hosting, and interface design should be divided in detail for each item. I also suggest that the team pay attention to the expected amount of web traffic so that they can calculate the rental of a server with an appropriate capacity, ensuring the quality of the connection at each webinar. Regarding the team, I believe that they have the expertise, skills, and relevant experience to carry out this project successfully. Through the links provided, I learned that project manager Shirah Dedman is a licensed US attorney with experience working as a former blockchain and cryptocurrency legal officer for 4 months (April 1, 2022) at Elizabeth L. Carter, Esq., LLC, a Securities law firm (2-10 employees), established in 2020, headquartered in the United States. This information may not say much.

Specific timelines for preparing and organizing seminars have also been detailed on a monthly basis.

"}, {"id": 11789, "q0": "I found the Web3 Legal Hub proposal to be a good one, meeting the requirements of the Legal & Financial Implementations challenge. This proposal comes in a very timely manner as many funds and emerging projects in Catalyst face legal and financial problems that prevent them from going any further to develop the project. As I know the element of the legal corridor is a very important factor creating the success of each project, so the Web3 Legal Hub project will have direct access to service delivery solutions in terms of services, legal, support and guidance for new projects in the growing Cardano ecosystem.\nI found this to be the perfect project, and its uniqueness is that it is geared toward a community project, one that provides lawyers with a free webinar series to engage them in the center the legal is not only for projects within the United States but also extends beyond the region.\n\nIn the problem and solution part, I see that the author group has provided quite a lot of information about the proposal to the community. The content of legal issues covered in the webinar series is presented clearly and coherently towards solving the basic issues needed for a development project such as business organization, taxes, legal documents, etc. rights, AML/KYC, smart contracts, stablecoins\u2026\nWith the Web3 Legal Hub recommendation, I will give 5 points because I see the importance of this proposal, this is an issue of great concern to the Cardano community. For example, in my country Vietnam, legality is a very important issue for each project. Every day, new projects are born and the lack of understanding of the law by project owners has somewhat inhibited the development of these projects themselves, and more importantly, created legal loopholes, unintentionally creating conditions for organizations and individuals with bad intentions to profit by forging, circumventing the law, greatly affecting the community.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "With this proposal, the work of the group of authors to do is very large. In the project implementation roadmap, I see a clear, detailed and coherent timeline of the tasks that need to be implemented for each month. From my personal experience for many years working at a leading corporation in Vietnam, in order to complete this workload, in addition to the investment of time and effort, the author team needs to work diligently very seriously, there is a specific division of work among team members to achieve high efficiency and ensure the set schedule.\nThe project budget is $35740, which is 7.1% of the challenge's budget and has been divided by the author team by large tasks with corresponding amounts. For me, this division is necessary and reasonable, but if the authors explain how they use this cost in more detail for each job, the community will monitor and have a way to evaluate the funding source of this budget is better. I take the first example \"Total speaker fee to be paid to legal experts is 8800 USD\" please add information such as rental unit price, number of experts hired, unit per session/hour, is there any reference information about the speakers for hire (are they famous and reputable in this field)\u2026\nFor each proposal, there will be risks that govern the results, the authors have also identified the most important risk that is most concerned with calling and recruiting legal experts with background knowledge web3 knowledge \u2013 a knowledge base is very new and not all lawyers can update this amount of knowledge, moreover, they must be willing to participate in the project. The solution to overcome this risk of the author's group I find is completely reasonable.\nBesides, I see another risk issue: the legal experts involved in the legal center are from many states in the United States, which will lead to time zone differences, about different schedules of activities and work. When the project team has gathered a sufficient number of personnel, creating a timetable and working schedule for each legal expert is also a matter of concern for the web 3 legal center to operate effectively.\nProposers of the project are all people with good professional knowledge, rich in practical experience. In terms of education, qualifications\u2026 I believe they have the capacity to complete this proposal well. When I click on the link to LinkedIn, I see the transparency of the identity and personal information of each member of the proposed group.\nI give 4 points for project feasibility because -1 points for project budget I feel needs more detail explanation.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "From an audit perspective, I see that the community can completely base on the project implementation plan and progress to monitor and evaluate the success of the project.

In addition, 03 KPIs are provided by the author team such as the success of live legal webinars, the videos of the seminars are pushed to the website and the list of participating lawyers web 3 are also very important evaluation criteria for the success of this proposal.\nI found that the criteria to evaluate the success of this proposal were written very clearly by the author team telling the community that 04 indicators to measure and score this proposal was successful or not, out of these 04 indicators I'm very interested in 02 indicators which are the availability of legal webinar recordings communicated through Project Catalyst channels and the availability of a Web3 friendly attorney directory communicated through Project Catalyst channels.\nI am also quite interested in the section where the authors describe the long-term roadmap of the proposal in the near future, which helps me to assess that this is a passionate project of the authors.
