The aim is to create a compliance as a service tool that allows proposers to access a decentralized identity solution for performing the KYC onboarding process. When implemented, such a tool would be an excellent off-the-shelf solution for other projects activating in the niches of marketplaces or any other products including fiat on-ramps or exchanges of value with its users, since there will be a necessity to perform KYC procedures for each user, the extent of which being dependent on the location of the business and the location of the end user. \n\nA great challenge here is the fact that the KYC regulatory requirements vary from country to country, and it will be extremely challenging for any solution to cater to an audience wider than a single country without extensive resources dedicated to the research of each particular jurisdiction\u2019s particularities. We are not being explicitly told, but judging by the jargon used in this proposal, it will cater for US-based proposers / businesses. And it is rather understandable to see that the excellent marketing pitch behind the \u201c200+\u201d title is not backed up by a real world-wide value proposition.\n\nGiven the above context, I would judge the scalability potential of such a tool as average, since I can\u2019t think of extensive economies of scale when jumping from servicing one country to another, given the very diverse regulatory background. In conclusion, there is a good fit between the proposal and the challenge, whose role is, as a reminder, to develop legal and financial tools that can make the life easier for other proposers in these respective areas. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The three person team makes a very good job at presenting their credentials, track record and history within the Cardano ecosystem. Deryck is a financial services industry expert, present in the blockchain space ever since 2017. Rodolfo is a highly visible Cardano community member, and he has been involved extensively in the previous funding rounds, both from a proposer and an assessor role. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about the timeline. The project has two main parts: a business one and a technical one. The business side would take four weeks to complete, and will include identifying a compliance service provider and signing a contract. What is rather unclear is who will be the beneficiary of this service rendered and how exactly will the proposal incorporate any legal entity for this end. The technical side would take ten weeks to complete, and will include the development of a module for receiving requests, connecting to the service provider\u2019s dashboard and deploying the system on cloud. \n\nThe budget is rather lightly sketched, with the majority of the funds being used for the development and business parts, of course. Hourly rates are fairly reasonable, 80-100 USD/h, and we also have minor captions set aside for cloud storage and purchases of licenses. An important part which is definitely lacking is the project\u2019s financial sustainability. It would have been a great addition to the proposal the inclusion of details regarding what kind of pricing mechanism would be used (if any) to sell the service to future proposers or to companies developing dapps. \n\nAnother important aspect which is not mentioned, and can have a very detrimental effect on the project if not being taken into account properly, is data privacy. Perhaps in the EU more than in the US this is the case, but definitely given the importance of the topic especially for a business model relying on a third party to collect and handle very sensitive personal information, it would have been a great addition for the proposal to at least deliver an assessment of the risks stemming from this direction. \n\nKYC is definitely a very challenging topic, and given the lack of details for the project\u2019s financial viability, data protection and business model, I think four stars are sufficient for the feasibility section. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The team is making a solid case for auditability. On top of using an agile methodology, the team promises progress reports and tracking via github, Kanban boards and commits. Agile-specific reports will also be used: sprint burndown for example. \n\nAs a side note, before embarking on the project, I also suggest that the team enters into a discussion with a specialized lawyer regarding potential liability issues with regards to asking / rendering KYC services to third parties, since these liabilities can be significant and a huge risk is not taken into account. \n\nSuccess of the project would imply a viable proof of concept system that can accommodate for all the US-specific compliance regulatory requirements and sanctions verifications. An excellent addition would have been a more detailed overview into how the selection of the business provider would take place, as well as offering us comfort that the team has the internal competence to deploy a good due diligence process during the selection process. This item is paramount again, given the very sensitive personal information in the scope of the service provided. From my point of view this issue alone is a good enough reason to offer only four stars to the feasibility\u2019s proposal.

Furthermore, as far as progress reports, they have adopted Agile methodology based on the tools provided by github, and the advancement will be tracked by github issues, project views and commits, while intermediate progress will be reported as Sprint Burndown, a KPI metric that shows the progress as percentage of each development sprint.

The idea here is to deliver a compliance-as-a-service model that helps users to mitigate risks as much as possible while complying with regulations. Users may go through the KYC verification process and receive a credential that can be shown to other parties as a proof of having passed the KYC process. Once approved, there is a list of compliance and monitoring services that are available. Besides that, this scenario is a real use case of a using RegTech and risk management to prevent or mitigate the concerns around regulation, usability, and adoption. I think this fits in a lot of ways with that we are aiming for, as it will help integrate reliable AML/BSA FinCEN compliance and monitoring services into existing KYC services for funded projects to use.

", "q0r": 5, "q1": "We have a script that is not bad, but not ideal either. We know what happens in the project development process, but at the same time, such actions are not well situated in time. We can make the order they would happen but not exactly how long each of them would last, which creates an obstacle in the total understanding of the process. For example, in the first 4 weeks, 4 activities would be carried out. Does that mean 1 per week? Or would some take longer because they would be more complex than others? Who would on them, and what would their routines be like? I think it would have been better if the activities in two phases had been divided into time intervals, such as every week. The proponent should also have detailed each of the actions in greater detail. About the budget, it is possible to understand the basics of how the money would be used, but again there could be more details. Why would the \u201cpurchase of initial licenses for trials and demos\u201d part cost 3,500 dollars? What would be the working hours of the professionals? If we know what their routines would be like and the value of their working hours, surely the understanding would be deeper.

In general, the topic is average, as there are good parts but also many others to improve.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Unfortunately, I found several problems to be solved in this part of the proposal. The proposal does not have a roadmap here. Without a detailed schedule, the Cardano community would not have the means to properly audit the project process, as we would not know what has to be done, when and by whom. We don\u2019t have small goals to continually achieve, nor deadlines to meet. Therefore, this must be resolved. I think this could be done, first of all, by establishing a detailed roadmap, and a budget that involves dates and deadlines. Besides that, in my view, the proposal is satisfactorily auditable based on the data provided, which are mostly numerical. Regarding the final results, the proponent claims that success would be seen through \u201cthe release of the Proof of Concept system that will allow us to showcase demos and trials of AML/BSA, FINCEN Reporting, OFAC/PEP/Sanctions along with transaction monitoring, case management, and UDAAP alerts\u201d. We know what your goals are, but they are quite broad, it would be more appropriate if the team set some more specific and objective goals, easier to verify.
