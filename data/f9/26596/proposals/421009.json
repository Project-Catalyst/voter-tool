Finding a legal framework applicable across the European Union would be beneficial for future businesses with incentive schemes.\nIt is probably safe to say that the NMKR team has been trying to find a solution for a while now. They have also had their own token ICO and due to this, I see them as being motivated enough to find a better solution. https://www.nmkr.io/token \nAdditionally, what makes me consider this proposal as having a truly positive impact on the ecosystem, is the fact that it's aiming to prepare a document detailing the solution they will have achieved and make it available for the entire community, thus ensuring the success of the entire ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I find the detailed plan section to be comprehensively prepared and helpful. The team has provided information on the timeline for completing their project, which includes details that range from the month of July to September. They have identified six steps for completing this process, and the details given for each step seem to be in a logical order.\nHowever, when assessing the budget, I found it lacks an in-depth calculation to allow me to accurately gauge its feasibility. The team has given us a lump sum of money for a combination of the described steps, but no more information overall. For the first two steps of the proposal, meetings with tax and legal consultants to find legal frameworks regarding the token offering, the amount asked is of $25000. I would have liked to know more about how it will be used, for instance, a clear specification of an hourly rate and a total number of hours would have helped us, the community in judging whether the consultant is asking for a too large amount or whether the time allocated for this specific task is sufficient. I find it important to calculate the total number of hours that will be dedicated to this problem alongside the hourly rate per individual. \nThe same requirements apply to the other 2 sums for the remaining 4 steps of the proposal. Why are $45000 needed for a token distribution plan that has to comply with Swiss and EU regulations? Are there any fixed amounts to be paid? Who will be the receiver of this amount and why?\nAnd finally, the team description is very thin described. It\u2019s mentioned that the 3 consultants have been identified, the tax consultant, the financial accountant and the blockchain lawyer. However, only their names have been provided, with no descriptions of their skills and links to their professional profiles.\nOverall, I don\u2019t feel that the information specified provides me with enough confidence that the team can address the issue and that the allocated budget is adequate.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I agree that the KPIs outlined in this proposal are appropriate to the problem stated at hand. If the costs related to taxes, social security, registration and accounting will be lowered to an acceptable level as a result of efforts undertaken by the proposal towards better legal frameworks, then the proposal can definitely be considered a success. \nI\u2019m not sure if these metrics can be applied to the proposal\u2019s progress as well. There, the team could have provided us with more details, especially where it would make it clear how the community would be able to independently assess them. A page on the NMKR website, a discord channel, a GitHub link or anything that would have been a public and open place would have been sufficient for it. The scope of this question is to empower the entire Cardano community in assessing a proposal\u2019s advancement, without relying on the proposer to interpret and make its own conclusions. \nI'm not sure that this proposal is clear enough to make a judgement on. I think the metrics are a good start but there needs to be more information included. I have to give it a score of 3 because I\u2019m also not in disagreement with it.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 6, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 6714, "q0": "There is a very tricky and risky value proposition behind this proposal, and I honestly don\u2019t see it with very good eyes for a number of reasons. Let\u2019s dive right in. \n\nStarting with the problem, the proposer informs us that when offering employees a token as part of the remuneration, this causes high tax costs on the company\u2019s side. The proposed solution is to look for a smart token distribution option which is not considered a salary component and will not result in an increase for the company\u2019s tax rate. There are a number of serious flaw here: \n\n- tax laws are exclusively a matter for each individual country. Even if finding a solution for a given country (Switzerland in this case) there is no guarantee that the solution will be applicable at all under another country\u2019s tax laws\n- depending on how far this solution goes, how \u201cinventive\u201d it is, and how \u201csmart\u201d that token distribution is, there will be a fine line between considering the service as a tax optimisation service, which is of course legal and a legitimate purpose, and tax evasion, which of course it is not. There will be some murky waters down the line for that project. Would you really like that Catalyst finances this?\n- even considering that an excellent tax solution emerges for the token distribution, the taxman is not sleeping, and there will be a cat vs. mouse game, with the tax framework eventually catching up with the inventive solution. Should we redo the analysis then, and come up again with another innovative solution?\n\nI end here, but there could be many more holes to be poked into this proposal\u2019s value proposition. I humbly offer an alternative way around this: \n\n- use the budget (which is plenty) to secure a serious global tax / auditing company to perform a limited scope review of tax brackets applicable for token distributions within select jurisdictions and use that as a helping tool for all companies looking to set-up shop in a certain location in case they want to heavily incentivise employees through token distributions. \n\nI strongly urge the Cardano community to not go down this dangerous path of supporting such proposals that look into tax optimisation solutions. Only one star from me, which is one too many.  ", "q0r": 1, "q1": "There is too much obscurity for the entire team. We only know that the tax consultant is called Marc (no last name, no social media profile, no background), the financial accountant Rebekka (same story) and the blockchain Lawyer is Reto (same story). Ann-Kristin, the main proposer, is currently working for NFT Maker and prior to this was a senior investment manager and managed several spin-offs and seed investments, but we don\u2019t know where, for how long, and with what success. So a definite lack of transparency here. \n\nTimewise, this proposal would be split into six stages. In stage 1 existing solutions would be assessed and risk defined. In stage 2 there would be an evaluation with a tax consultant the possible solutions. Step 3 would set-up a plan in line with the Swiss tax law. Step four would engage in discussions with the tax department to get approval for implementation. Step 5 would evaluate how the solution would work under EU law. Step 6 would write a summary and probably share it within the community. For my view on the detailed plan, take another good look at the Impact section.  \n\nUnfortunately there is almost no detail whatsoever with regards to the budget. Steps 1 and 2 are bundled together for 25k USD, 3 to 5 again for 45k USD and step 6 would consume the remaining 5k USD. I find the level of detail a little bit insulting towards the Cardano community, and I strongly urge the proposer to go back to the drawing board and come up with a detailed plan that includes: \n\n- proposed hourly rates for the services rendered\n- an explanation as to how a due diligence will be performed in order to source a competent tax consultant and whether a competitive process will take place, in which at least 3 offers will be considered before deciding on the consultant\n- how it will assess whether the consultant will offer good value for money\n- how it will deal with the potential liability issues: firstly the consultant\u2019s liability for its services rendered, and second, the proposer\u2019s liability towards the community for the report that shall be made available\n\nGiven all of the above, I think two stars are appropriate. ", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Ann-Kristin actually makes a good case for how to approach the success of the project, by measuring tax costs, social security costs, set-up costs, accounting complexity of the new solution and any other implications, versus the old regime. So of course, such an analysis would end up in a cost-benefit analysis to see if the new tax scheme is better than any of the existing one. And of course, there would be a report at the end of the project to summarize the findings.\n\nNothing else to add here, four stars are likely appropriate.

I think that because the project is about creating, as the authors conceptualize \u201ca smart token distribution option, which is not considered as a salary component and does not result in high tax costs at the time of transferring the token.\u201d In short, it would be a token to carry out financial transactions in crypto-currencies because \u201cToken distribution brings a high financial challenge for the employee\u201d, and this token could \u201cbrings neither party into a financial problematic situation\u201d, as the proponent state, which is a positive point. However, the objective of the present challenge is to promote projects that help the emerging Projects in Catalyst face legal and financial issues which block them from moving forward. In a way, we have to focus on Ada, on Projects in Catalyst, and everything says about Cardano only, and not benefit other cryptos and blockchain. Because of these problems, I think the proposal is not a good option for funding, at least in the way it was presented in the challenge of legal and Financial Implementations.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "The script of the proposal is unfortunately very superficial. All the activities that will be done are explained in a basic way, let\u2019s exemplify. The proponent states that it will consist of 6 steps that last 3 months. It would be necessary for him to explain better what would happen in these time intervals, for example: who would perform what tasks, in the weeks of these months, what are exact plans, and what small goals should be achieved in these period, etc. From the way the roadmap is explained to us, we do not have an exact view of the development process of this proposal. Regarding the financing, 75 thousand dollars are requested, a very high amount. And the budget explanation is superficial, in my opinion, because the total amount is divided into 3 parts that are not explained. For example, \u201cStep 1+2: 25.000 USD\u2026\u201d, why would it cost 25 thousand dollars in just one month? \u201cStep 6: 5.000 USD\u201d for \u201cwriting a summary of the new certified token solution, which helps other Start-ups to adapt the solution to their own company in their respective country\u201d. Who would create that summary? Why would it cost 5 thousand dollars? How many hours are in need? I think all parts of the budget needed a more precise explanation, especially \u201cStep 3-5: 45.000 USD\u201d, which would cost the largest portion of the total amount. I believe here are the rent cost of the tax department, salaries of the professionals involved\u2026 so I think it would be interesting for us to know what their work routines would be like, daily hours dedicated to the project, etc. Speaking of the team, there was very little information about the team members. We only know their first names (even not have their last names), and what professional role they play in the project. It is not explained in detail what they have done so far in their professional live, their LinkedIn resume and how they interact with the Cardano ecosystem. Therefore, I think feasibility also leaves a lot of important information missing. In my view, all parts of the feasibility are inadequate and deserve to be revised.", "q1r": 1, "q2": "We are unable to properly audit a proposal that does not present a roadmap or explain how the requested money would be used. Because we don\u2019t have a roadmap, we don\u2019t know exactly what to expect from the development process for this project. We know the metrics (\u201ctax costs, social security costs, set-up & implications costs, accounting complexity, and costs\u201d), but not what the work process would be for them to be conquered. I can\u2019t see how we would monitor something as uncertain as the daily work of this project. Therefore, my suggestion is that at first this roadmap is built in detail, and after that, the proponent makes an overview of how the activities took place at each step, not only if any problems were faced, etc. speaking now about the success scenario, the proponent claims that \u201cSuccess means that the above mentioned KPIs are lower than for the existing solution today and that the solution can be implemented in many countries.\u201d But what is the existing solution today? And how that solution could be implemented in many countries? In my opinion, I would like the proponent to have outlined more tangible ways to see if the expected final results were obtained. I disagree that it is clear how all this will reflect on Cardano, it would be necessary to measure measurable metrics, both qualitative and quantitiative, that could demonstrate in a proven way what were the benefits of this proposal for Cardano.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 5, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 656, "q0": "The problem statement is very clear and fits the aim of the challenge well. The proposed solution is clear in it's intent, but rather vague in scope. Finding a solution to alleviate the tax burden on startups that wish to provide tokens as incentives to employees would of course be of great benefit to many startups in the community but that is a very broad topic. How exactly is this going to be tackled? For example one solution could be to create a tax case for providing a token as a non taxable benefit similar to an employer providing funds to an employee to buy safety equipment for work and submitting that to a relevant agency for response. That is a specific case to take on rather than just looking for general tax loopholes. The problem with the broad scope of this proposal is that it is very hard to evaluate if any good could come from it. Another criteria that we have to look at is if this is a scalable solution that will help others in the ecosystem. I would respectfully suggest to the proposer that if they wish to maximize impact the proposal should look at what is possible on a larger scale (EU or US rules) and then apply that locally rather than start locally and try to go broad scale after. There is a much better possibility to find solutions that will apply to more people and places by working top down. This comes from my 20+ years working with government regulations although admittedly not in law or taxes so please take with a grain of salt. With that said if this proposal was to find a solution to the problem it wants to solve then the KPIs listed make sense and this would add significant value to the ecosystem.

I would suggest to the proposer to provide more information about her team including links to verify credentials. It was easy enough to find information on the proposer by doing a google search but not enough information was provided about the team to do the same. The budget requested and timeframes are reasonable for this type of project. One of the main obstacles for this project is that since it is not targeted and is basically a research request there is the possibility it will not come up with any solutions. This was addressed as a risk in the proposal but no mitigation of the risk was provided and therefore it is difficult to say if the project will meet it's goals. Another risk which was not mentioned for this type of project is that regulation is currently being widely debated and could change quickly making any potential solutions potentially short lived.

The funding could be better spent in the contracting of such a company, building a partnership with Cardano, and benefit from its experience and worldwide reach as the beneficiaries would be worldwide. A tax guide for each country resulting from this effort for the income coming from vested tokes would benefit a lot of individuals and would make their tax situation more clear.\n\nAlso, any tax scheme that is proposed in order to achieve tax optimisation may transform at any point in time into tax evasion as legislation changes. So regular updates and tax law monitoring is required. There would not be one scheme that remains valid throughout any period. Overall, I rate this proposal 3 stars in terms of feasibility.\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "There is limited information provided to rely on that would show that the project was executed successfully. There are lacking credentials of the team executing the project with the taxation area - which is in fact the value proposition of this project. In fact, as shown above, there can be little reliability in the deliverable (the scheme) to be assessed as effective (reducing the tax burden of the company and the individual) unless there is clear reliability on the tax professional/s developing the scheme. Also, an extensive team of tax professionals would be required to develop such a reduced taxation scheme and that is hard to find. A team of 3 would not probably achieve the goal even for one country where only one person is supposedly a tax consultant.\n\nThe proposers mention 4 brief auditability KPIs, however they are specifically just looking at the costs within the project, not success will look like going forward.
