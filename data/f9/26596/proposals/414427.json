Its hard to find domain expert legal or accounting professionals to assist with this process, which create a barrier to entry.", "f6_no_assessments": 11, "f6_rating": 3.7878787878787885, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 6655, "q0": "This proposal fits extremely well with the challenge. To recall, its purpose is to offer legal and / or financial solutions that can support funded proposers. Here, we have a serial entrepreneur, the founder of several web-based solutions, that wishes to develop a legal and financial marketplace for the Catalyst proposers on an existing solution, which to me looks like a perfect match and an excellent setting. \n\nThe problem identification is also very good, since the proposers clearly do not have enough access to legal and accounting professionals (there are many reasons behind it, amongst which are the high legal uncertainties regarding blockchain businesses, the low capacity of existing service providers to service this market niche and also the possibly low budgets that start-ups are ready to allocate to legal and financial topics to the detriment of the core, IT-centered expenses. This is of course a long term problem, and any marketplace solution that can diminish these frictions and provide a suitable place where the demand can meet the offer of such services is more than welcomed into the Web3 space. \n\nBuilding such a marketplace onto an existing platform (Antimo in this case) provides obvious benefits, since one does not have to reinvent the wheel, and can focus on building a few tailored-made modules upon an existing platform, thereby saving time, resources and energy for the most important activities. \n\nLastly, a marketplace, if executed correctly, can be a perfect proposal for a scalable solution that can easily cross borders through a few translations and targeted marketing / development efforts down the road. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The timeline is very straight forward for the entire project, since it will take approximately three months in order to the platform (or rather module) to be built and launched, and the next six months (3 to 9) will be used mainly for onboarding efforts and slowly increasing the number of legal and accounting practitioners present. \n\nThe very laudable aspect is that the proposer recognizes that business development and onboarding efforts will be key, therefore a major part of the budget and efforts will be focused on outreach and marketing efforts towards the legal, tax and accounting community being on boarded onto the platform.  \n\nAnother strong point of the proposal is that it will be built on an already existing platform, Antimo. As stated in the previous section, this in itself is an excellent proposition. But when glancing over the Antimo app itself, it is not rather clear whether the platform has already gained traction just yet. Definitely, there are already a number of projects (many Cardano based - bravo!) and people onboarded, but I did not have the feeling that excellent traction is already there. This worry could have easily been alleviated through perhaps offering some insightful statistics on the past growth of the platform: when did it start, what are onboarding growth rates, how big is the community, how many contracts / deals reached through it, what are future prospects for growth following this module for legal and accounting marketplace? In a nutshell a lot of questions that can only be answered by the founders themselves, since they are the ones with access to this internal information about organic growth. \n\nIn conclusion, we have a good case for a feasible project here, so five stars are appropriate even after considering the possible insufficient traction of Antimo.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The auditability of the project is good, but it is not perfect. After the first six months the proposer sets upon a very nice target of 50 professionals onboarded (25 legal + 25 accounting) and a doubling of that number after the first nine months - which is very laudable, and a smart objective overall. \n\nAnother strong point is that the proposer is very well grounded in the Cardano community and it will be extremely easy for him / his team to reach out to existing members and tap onto their expertise when needed, either through finding very quickly (already stated in the project) a knowledgeable community manager to handle communications and help with expanding the user base but also through (my thoughts) having an ear already focused on community feedback and correcting the minor aspects on the go, while at the same time being knowledgeable of the usual communication methods in order to keep the community informed, when necessary, on the project\u2019s development. \n\nThe proposer also explains rather briefly his vision on how the project can be audited: by using pure metrics of the professionals on-boarded and their advertising results within the community. For me this explanation is good, but it also takes a bit of effort in order to think about what actually lies behind the words. I would have really enjoyed it if the proposer spent a bit more time detailing the entire auditability part. What are those actual metrics? How will they be measured, via the platform, is Antimo already built with that in mind? Are the solutions used open source, and will these metrics be available to the community? There are many questions unanswered.\n\nThe same argument can be made for success KPIs. The proposer states that a successful project can be defined as a place in which proposers can ensure they are setting out on a safe endeavor legally and financially, and where the stress of compliance doesn't stop the growth potential. While these are definitely nice words and an extremely powerful \u201cmission\u201d for a project, I would have liked to see this mission operationalized down to more concrete levels. For instance, to discuss ways to measure what a \u201csafe endeavor\u201d is from a financial or legal point of view, or how we can measure compliance or noncompliance for companies utilizing the services of the platform. \n\nIn conclusion a good enough base for auditability, but with a few points of improvement regarding setting KPIs and measuring satisfaction.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2824", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 6, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 13998, "q0": "Overall, this is a quite intriguing proposal and closely similar to the initial requirements from the challenge that is set by the \u201cLegal and Financial Implementations\u201d. This proposal aims to provide a legal services market relating to accounting and legal issues. Thereby accessing and interacting with many legal experts and accountants all over the world. For those new start-up projects in Catalyst, they sometimes or even often seem to struggle with obstacles related to commercial/business law and the accounting requirements. Those problems are extremely hard to deal with for not only those newbies but also for most multinational enterprises whose size is not really large. Since our community\u2019s activity scale is global, we also welcome as many as possible foreign projects to spread Cardano\u2019s reputation all over the world and extend our popularity. However, each country will have regulations about audit and law separately, and there would be some restrictions that are not much beneficial for those multinational enterprises. Most enterprises will tend to minimize as much as the cost for each performed services or guarantee about their profit and keep the costs at the as much lower level as possible. However, the legal issues and accounting regulations would be barriers and if the proposal is approved, it would assist a lot in providing solutions or give explanations about accounting as well as legal barriers for those in need. Thus, there is no doubt about my support for this proposal as the impact of it is really essential as I analyzed above.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "For the feasibility, I do give a positive hope for this proposal since it has the name \u201cOliver Ross' ' as one of the team members. His experience is really terrific with no doubt, definitely. However, when looking in-depth at the description of the proposal, it raised some suspicious opinions in my mind and is necessary to discuss. The strategy in the proposal description has been just written in general rather than in detail. Thus, it\u2019s hard for us to follow up the process and compare whether this proposal is on progress or not as well as successful or not. There are also some items which pretend to be on progress for such a long-term duration that I do not really know which part of it is important for the whole process. The \u201cprofessionals outreach program underway\u201d can be taken as an example when every essential detail and component inside it are not described in-depth. I do not give any disagreement toward this proposal since I still think this is such a creative idea for most related to law and accounting obstacles as mentioned in the impact section. Literally, I did hope to see more about this idea and how truthful it is. As law is created and edited carefully by the legislative department or in some countries that would be the National Assembly, and force all residents of that country to obey it then absolutely, it is never seen as an easy problem for a group of people can figure out the solution for MNEs to avoid those troubles related to law. Moreover, to ensure that there is no misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about legal issues, this group would need to find an expert lawyer council as a legal advisor in each cluster/state. This would cost a lot of time as well as money in order to pursue the main purpose of the proposal. I saw the items of work related to this but it seems like an outside coat rather than the inside \u201cT-shirt\u201d. In other words, it would be better if the proposer can visualize the workload of the proposal by providing description in more detail so that those supporters of this creative idea can have a more sustainable foundation that they place their vote in the right destination. Moreover, as I analyzed about the necessity of finding an expert lawyer council will cost a lot, it is understandable there may be some high rates exposed in the budgeted sheet. But it would be more persuasive when those numbers are described specifically. We need a specific and visualized frame rather than the final total numbers but didn't show anything to prove the importance or the reliability of the proposal. At least, you should let us know why those costs are necessary. For example, you mention the Community outreach / management as $30ph but I wonder which scale or criterion for your group to take this number as the base cost for total $3,900. There should be more explanation at least showing where the basic information is. One more thing, when your group decided to use the outsource human, which base condition whether renting that person or that lawyer as their capacity meets the requirement? And how much would you pay for them? I would prefer a specific profile that is able to be accessed from Linkedin or Twitter or similar platform to make sure the quality of your teammates is truthful. Although I know Oliver Ross is a founder of plentiful potential websites like onchainuniversity.com, or web development or sealsociety, it is not enough for the base evaluation for the whole team because everyone is different. In case, the proposal and the team members all rely on only Oliver Ross, and it becomes a single person with a single deal, your teammates have to show us your past achievements to show us you have ability and we can trust you. It would be a big pity if this proposal is not passed because of lacking that information.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "In auditability, the proposal seems lacking a lot of vital information (timeline, measurement approach, etc.) that is useful to indicate at which stage of the process, the proposal can be evaluated as succeeding or failing to convince people to vote for this proposal. A statement like creating a world that guarantees the legal and financial safety for the users and no more confirmation or evidence to prove it and forecast how much percentage of successful proposals there are. Therefore, I suggest the addition of some measurement criterions like providing the visualized number of how many lawyers are willing to join the proposal, or the number to measure the proposal is well-known or not, etc.  The description is not provided in the answer so that all the relating to auditability is really ambiguous and if just evaluating for the overall, I cannot rate a much higher score point than the average level.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_3870", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 5, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1159, "q0": "The proposal meets the challenge as it aims to enhance an already existing platform http://antimo.io to create a meeting point for legal and accounting professionists who are looking for clients within small to medium size businesses operating in Cardano and/or other blockchain envrironments.\nThe platform has already a consensus score for the accredited professionists, which would build trust in the people approaching the above mentioned professionists.\nPoint for improvement:It would be great to see the logic to assign this consensus score written also in the proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer claims to have dealt with different projects within Cardano, such as being the editor of Cardano journal. \nThe proposer provided relevant links to the websites is working/active on. \nThe proposal aims to collect 50 lawyers and 50 accountants within 9 months, which is a duable objective given the fact the platform for them to enroll is already built.\nThe budget required is aroun 18000 usd, of which 80% dedicated to the marketing. \nBased on my experience, 10000 usd could bring effectively at least 100 people to the space.\nThe rest of the capital will be deployed to hire writers with experience in legal and informational articles, and build connections by hiring a community manager from the Cardano ecosystem.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The information provided are sufficient to evaluate the proposal, as explained above, the budget and timeline are outlined in a concise and clear manner.

As the cost is only confined to getting the experts the budget requested is USD17900, the bulk of it is to be spent on advertisement on social and mainstream media.

The necessity of this idea is indisputable.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of feasibility, I assess that the project is just average. There are a few issues we need to discuss here:\n- Implementation roadmap: I think that the information provided by the proponent here is sketchy and general. For example, when it comes to \"Professionals outreach program underway\" to be done within 3 months, I still can't imagine what needs to be done that takes so long. Here I suggest that the proposer should be more detailed. For example, i) proactively contacting the bar (or financial advisor) council in East Asia (first month), ii) reaching out to the African and European community (next month), iii) outreach to the American community (third month). This is just an example for us to visualize the work to be done and the community will easily visualize the implementation roadmap.\n- budget breakdown: as well as the implementation roadmap, I think a lot of information is still general. I think the proposed team should be more detailed about the costs to use. For example: \"combined social media and real world advertising budget: $10,000\", I still can't figure out why so much money is needed. In addition, the proposer stated that he will hire community managers, hire writers with experience in legal news articles, but this rental cost is not included in the budget breakdown.\n- Team member: I appreciate Oliver Ross's experience, but honestly I don't know what their experience is like for the other members.

I suppose the proposer should add here references to personal profiles such as Twitter or LinkedIn so that Oliver Ross can be identified by the community. Also when it comes to milestones to measure project progress, it seems to quite a bit of information missing to show that the project is progressing successfully, for example, adding metrics like #number of proposals connected to legal and financial experts, #number of experts are willing to cooperate.\nTherefore, overall, the auditability of the proposal is average in my opinion.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2771", "no_vca": 14, "ne": 0, "ng": 13, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8384, "q0": "Coming to round 9, many projects are concerned more about legal issues and this solution is born to help them satisfy these needs. The author brings out the idea to solve the problems, in particular he will create the marketplace of legal and accounting services which can help other projects to go further.

For the risks, I do not agree with them that the main obstacle is to persuade legal and financial experts to trust the blockchain value as it is now very well-known in the world with many benefits proved to both blockchain and non-blockchain community so the issue here is how to give them enough benefits to make them join with us, also the chosen ones must have experience in web3 as well.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The activity plan is quite short and not enough information to evaluate, it can be seen there one outreach expert program is being built and some milestones to recruit specific number of lawyers and accountants.

In addition, there is no set time for the service to officially go live. The positions targeted for operating this project are still vacant, the proponent is planning to outsource those positions, I am wondering if this outsourcing will incur any additional costs for it or not.

This proposal builds a marketplace providing accounting and legal services for web3 projects. It can be seen that the proposal poses a suitable problem for Challenge. The problem that they will solve seems to be broader than what Challenge requires. Do not limit the provision of accounting and legal services to sponsored proposals. The proposal solved two questions of the challenge, namely: \"How can effective solutions be built to discover and provide legal and accounting services (an aspect of finance)?\" and \"Support for Sponsored Proposers.\" This proposal is fully scalable in the future. If the problem posed is resolved, this proposal will provide a large pool of qualified legal professionals and accountants who can assist and advise the sponsored proposers. The broader goal is to scale the Cardano community and improve the quality of the community with legal and accounting expertise. To solve the problem, they offer outreach and project marketing to legal professionals and accountants worldwide. At the same time, they continue to consult projects from the Cardano ecosystem according to the needs of legal and accounting services. This is a platform to connect Cardano projects with potential legal professionals and accountants. To ensure that the process of starting and operating Cardano projects is guaranteed in terms of legal, tax, accounting, etc. However, it should be noted that: they have not given specific evidence, such as: what will they do to approach and attract legal experts and accountants? What do they do to ensure the quality of consulting services? Blockchain is a new market; not just any legal expert or accountant can handle legal and accounting issues that arise for a project or startup. This proposal is not really clear and thorough in planning the implementation. However, it should be emphasized that I appreciate their ideas. The proposal puts at risk the quantity and quality of legal professionals and accountants. I agree with this; it's completely risky. It's commendable that they have a solution, which proposes to include outreach programs, video and audio educational media, and other content aimed directly at professionals. Unfortunately, they have not specified what they will do. What is the content, knowledge of the programs or documents? It's not just a matter of explaining to legal professionals and accountants what Blockchain is. They need to have legal and financial knowledge that Cardano projects may encounter, such as: Business Organization, Token Sale, Tax, AML/KYC, SAAS, Copyright, Stablecoin, Smart Contract, Auditing, Disputes, etc. This will be an obstacle to providing services to Cardano projects if financial professionals and accountants do not have sufficient qualifications, knowledge of this field, and practical experience. In addition, the proposal may face a number of risks: 1/Legal danger: In the legal framework of many countries, blockchain is not currently recognized by many countries, so the proposal should only be provided, introduce yourself, introduce career opportunities ... do not call for investment or investment advice. 2/ Risks about the quality of legal consulting services and auditors. The question here is: in the case of a legal expert or an auditor intentionally giving wrong advice, affecting the rights, interests, and reputation of the project, more seriously it may be related to illegality. law. So, is there any proposal to control this risk? In my opinion, it is possible to build 2 consulting rounds with a professional team that consists of top experts who will control the consulting content of the staff. I acknowledge their idea, but to be honest, this idea is quite sketchy, has not been described in detail, and has not convinced me yet. It would be a good project if more invested, but there is no denying its impact on the Cardano community. So the score for impact is 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Regarding the implementation roadmap, the proposal provides a target timeline for the project. However, the timeline and operational plan of the proposal are not really reasonable. Specifically, in the first three months, it is recommended to add outreach work to funded projects to examine the legal and financial issues they have or are currently facing. This is an opportunity to approach potential clients and prepare documents, provide data, and knowledge for legal professionals and accountants. In addition, expert outreach programs should be more specific and detailed. Like, in those three months, what organizations will they connect with? With law offices, financial firms, or associations? What is the target quantity set? We need action plans and specific goals. In addition, for the next six and nine months, the proposal does not yet plan to connect and provide services to funded projects. I think this is a pretty big omission. They have set a goal that after 6 months there will be a list of 25 lawyers and 25 accountants ready to work, and after 9 months, 50 lawyers and 50 accountants. Acknowledge the goals they have set. But, I suggest adding a target \"How much amount of projects to be serviced?\" anh \"Is the quality of the consulting service good or not?\". This is an important goal that the proposal and the challenge are aiming for. Everyone can fully check the progress and results of the project through Antimo. In terms of budget, the proposal's fundraising budget represents about 3.6% of the Challenge's total. The fundraising budget is not too high; however, if the issues I suggested above are improved, it may incur costs and need to increase the funding budget. The proposal's fundraising budget has a specific spending plan. However, there are no additional plans. In the event that the price of ADA decreases, an additional 5% of the fundraising budget can be budgeted. About the team, can only one member make the proposal? Oliver Ross__overall project manager with experience in enterprise IT, team and project management (unfortunately they do not provide a link or website to verify identity). It is worth noting that Oliver Ross does not have legal or financial experience. Is it possible to guarantee the quality of consulting services and reputation in the market? Because as far as I know, there are many similar proposals today, but because their team are experts in the fields of law and finance, they can control the legal and financial issues that arise. Besides, legal consulting work is very important, requiring high qualifications, qualifications, experience, and reputation. In many countries, the field of legal advice is a conditional profession. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the ability of the team to ensure the operating conditions and quality of services in the future. With the above arguments and suggestions, I think the score for feasibility is not high.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I do not appreciate the transparency of the proposal. The project has a measure of success, reflected in the number of lawyers and accountants it provides. These indicators are easy to check and compare. However, you can only check the quantity, not the quality of the service they provide. Therefore, I propose an index to measure the quality of legal and accounting consulting services by having them conduct tests to assess their professional qualifications and consulting skills and conduct a survey of the projects they have collaborated on to get the most unbiased reviews. An important goal is to prioritize service quality. Therefore, the project's transparency score is 2. Hopefully, the team will improve to have the most complete proposals.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3950", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14821, "q0": "Currently, the Cardano ecosystem has grown significantly, becoming more varied in terms of themes and fields. As a result, many projects face a variety of challenges, including legal and accounting issues. According to the author, this proposal would help small to medium-sized initiatives as well as worldwide outreach and marketing for legal and tax professionals. This not only guarantees that no ideas are rejected solely because of such difficulties, but also encourages additional professionals to join the Cardano ecosystem. And this attribute is exactly what the Challenge is looking for. In addition, I feel that employing media such as videos and audio instructive material to promote will help to tackle the problem of earning user trust, but this is not enough. My opinion is that the proposer should strive to impress the client by presenting examples that the staff has solved. Nonetheless, what is described in this part satisfies the standards well.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I was really impressed with the project's team members. Normally, a team of many bright people with incredibly amazing abilities and expertise would lead the project, however, this project will be led by only one person - the proposer. As can be seen, the author has built a number of websites in various sectors and has worked on a number of other projects inside the Cardano ecosystem, assisting with web construction, project management, and technical assistance. This surely helps this project a lot in terms of establishing solid foundations and locating the best legal and tax consultants for the business. What's more, although working alone, what is mentioned here absolutely satisfies the standards. The project will be broken into three major parts and will take about 270 days to complete. The author clearly states each milestone, and the activities will take place in a logical and understandable manner. However, it would be preferable if, in addition to the data and number of on-boarded attorneys and accountants, the author could explain how many projects are supported, and whether one person will support each project or work will be divided into groups. The budget shows that the initiative was developed on top of an existing project, hence the investment money is largely spent on advertising. And I like that the author specifies how and for how long the promotion will take place - something that many proposals fail to do.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this section, I only rate 3 out of 5 points since the author failed to offer the relevant information. First and foremost, projects will establish an environment in which projects can easily guarantee they are embarking on legal and financially sound ventures. Just stick to the idea that the proposer outlined above, and I am confident that the project will be a huge success. However, the deadlines for achieving each of the milestones were not discovered. The proposal proposes using the pure metrics of the professional on-boarded and their advertising outcomes to measure project development, but this only benefits the insiders, not the voters. In order for a project to be authorized by the Cardano voter board, the critical phases of the project must be precisely captured in order to accurately judge if their money is being invested wisely.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_4104", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 0, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "I will build out a legal and accounting services marketplace, attract professionals to it, and help grow the accessibility these services for web3 projects.
