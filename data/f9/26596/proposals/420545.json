However, there is lacking of financial and legal experts who have knowledge and practical experience on blockchain.", "f6_no_assessments": 13, "f6_rating": 4.3589743589743595, "videos": [], "media": [], "f6_assessments": [{"id": 7170, "q0": "I think the idea is very good and necessary, and theoretically fits well with the objectives of this challenge. The proponents intend to create online courses attracting legal and financial employees of Funded Proposals as well as the financial and legal experts who are interested in blockchain. The course contents will cover the basis of blockchain technology and Cardano Blockchain, the overall financial and legal framework for blockchain, challenges, and issues faced by blockchain start-ups as well as the solutions for such challenges and issues. The proposal is very beneficial for Vietnam, as it will act in the blockchain education in that country. I think the proposal has everything to work out, because it\u2019s an ongoing project, and the team has already shown preparation and determination to fulfill the mission of teaching Cardano to others. Therefore, I think that the impact of this proposal has the potential to be maximum, deserving 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is quite simple to understand and very detailed. The proponents provide us with all information we need to know what would happen, when, how, for how much money and who would be involved in it. First, regarding the script, the month in which the project would be developing are informed: October, November, and December. We know exactly what online courses were going to take place in each of these periods, so we have a great understanding of the process to come. So the script part is fine. Now speaking of the budget, the requested money ($42336) would be divided into 5 parts in very detail: 3 content courses, marketing activities, and financial & legal retainer services. Besides that, they also add 5% on top of the proposed budget for the reserve fund to avoid the price fluctuation risk. That already allows us to have a very good understanding of how the requested funding would be used. Even in terms of working hours, we know how much each small part of the whole would cost, and how much time to perform each task would cost, that is, I think this part of the budget is very well explained as well. Finally, the team presents its members in a very complete and detailed way. For example, we know their names, and main functions, attached a series of profiles of the social network, including LinkedIn and Telegram, that is, we have a way to prove what is being said, and finally a small (but satisfactory) explanation of what they have been doing. Apparently, it is a very well team that is fully capable of carrying out this project successfully. in summary, the feasibility of the project is very good.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I think this project is highly auditable because the proposers clearly explain how the monitoring of both success and partial results would be done, but there is room for improvement. All data presented as process auditability are about numbers. This works for us to understand how big the project is becoming, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough for us to measure the human impact of the thing. It would be interesting to promote those online courses in the selected areas to understand: did the project have a positive impact on the Cardano community in Vietnam? Has people\u2019s project been changed for the good? Did it help needy communities to support themselves better? etc\u2026 I believe the analysis here needs to be more human than numerical. Now speaking of the final results, we have many direct indicators: course video uploaded on youtube channel, Youtube channel reaches 500 subscribers after 6 months; uplevel fanpage reach 1.000 liked after 6 months; Telegram/Zalo channel reach 200 people joining after 6 months; 5 funded proposals were supported and share feedback, the feedback will be shared publicly via our social channel. I think it would be necessary to understand the impact of these cleanings on communities, if they were positively affected, what changes were observed, how people started to improve their proposals, in what way this all benefited the Cardano ecosystem, etc. It would be necessary for all this data to be gathered in a final report and that this is be sent either via any platform already used by the community. Overall, I think the auditability is very good, but it can improve in some points to make it perfect.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 3, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 14250, "q0": "This is a proposal that has a positive impact on the challenge. This proposal provides a course for legal and financial professionals on issues facing blockchain startups and provides legal and financial advisory services. The proposal posed the right problem for Challenge. Specifically, the proposal will address 2 questions of the challenge: training financial and legal professionals to provide legal and financial services to sponsored proposers. It can be seen that their goal is broader than Challenge's requirements, not only providing legal and financial consulting services for funded projects, but this proposal will also provide legal consulting services and financing for all funded and unfunded blockchain startups. This is a proposal that has a positive impact on the Cardano community because it helps to increase the number of communities, the quality of the community with financial legal expertise, and ensure that the projects are funded. Cardano is fully legal and operates legally. I appreciate the proposal that has a specific implementation plan and appropriate arguments. The course content will cover the following: the basis of blockchain technology and Cardano Blockchain; an overview of the financial and legal framework for blockchain; the challenges and problems that blockchain startups face; and the solutions to those challenges and problems. These are the most fundamental issues for a blockchain startup. The proposal presents two risks: 1/The risk of language barrier: they are not really fluent in English, so Fund 9 will focus on advising on Vietnam's Sponsored Proposals and training the Vietnamese legal and financial experts to establish the Vietnam Financial and Legal Advisory Center. 2/The risk of a low ADA price. Solutions to overcome two risks 1/In the next phase (Fund 10), cooperate with colleagues in other countries to create a Global Financial and Legal Advisory Center. 2/Add 5% above the proposed budget for the reserve fund to avoid the risk of ADA price fluctuations. I agree with the risks and solutions proposed. However, in my opinion, the proposal may face some other risks: 1/Risk of shortage of human resources: the proposal has not yet issued a survey report on the list of financial legal staff who are interested in this field. There are no options for communication and marketing to attract legal and financial staff to participate in the courses. It is suggested that there should be seminars, links with law firms, financial companies, Vietnam bar associations, etc., to introduce the blockchain field and job opportunities in order to attract potential employees. At the same time, cooperate with universities to disseminate knowledge and information to students. This is a potential human resource in the future. 2/Risks about the quality of training experts. The proposal did not mention the speakers/experts of the courses. Who are they? It is recommended to publicize the list of speakers/experts at the course to ensure transparency and quality of the course. 3/Risk of course quality. The proposal will provide teaching videos instead of online courses with experts. Will it hinder the interaction between learners and experts? It is recommended to organize online courses and have video recordings posted on the website. Blockchain is a new field that requires more interaction with experts for legal and financial staff to ensure quality. Some additional comments the proposal has not yet provided a plan to control the quality and qualifications of legal and financial staff. Training through creating educational video clips instead of holding an online class makes it impossible to know if an employee is attending or not. And when there are too many proposed employees, what are the best practices for blockchain startups to evaluate qualifications to select the right legal and financial staff? This is a good proposal, there are only a few points for improvement. And this is only a proposal for funded projects in Vietnam, I hope the proposal will expand its scope and reach to other countries.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I appreciate the planned proposal and the clear implementation roadmap. The proposal identifies two project timelines: Following the completion of educational video clips within 3 months of funding, the provision of legal services and financial retention for 5 sponsored proposals over the next 3 months follow. The proposal timeline is pretty good. However, the proposal has not set a target number of legal staff or qualified financial staff with professional qualifications to provide legal and financial services for the five sponsored proposals. People can check the progress of the project. The measure of the success of the project depends on YouTube views, dwell time, engagement rate, and number of subscribers. Every month, these metrics are compared. I believe these figures only reflect a part of the success of the project. Our goal is that the 5 funded proposals will be provided with legal and financial services. The proposal has a solution. Will that problem be solved or not, and how is the quality of the service? In addition, we are also interested in the qualifications of the legal and financial staff after they are trained. Are they really potential employees who can solve legal and financial problems for future projects? About the budget: The fundraising budget of the proposal accounts for more than 8% of the total challenge. Budget proposal: $40,320 for project team and communication, and $2,016 for risk management. The price of ADA may completely decrease in the future or the project will incur some costs. It is recommended to have an additional budget plan of $2,016 (5% of the total funding budget of the proposal). Their group consists of 3 members. Give the team compliments because all members have the members' experiences that match the proposed tasks. We can easily verify the identities of members on LinkedIn and Telegram channels. All members have professional qualifications and work experience relevant to the job. However, unfortunately, the proposal has not assigned specific tasks to each member. As mentioned in section A, providing instructional videos is not really effective and ensures maximum training quality for legal and financial staff. It is suggested that the online teaching option should be considered instead of just using video lectures. In addition, the proposal has not yet provided an option to select five proposals funded in Vietnam to provide legal and financial support services. The question here is, what is the criteria for selecting five sponsored proposals in Vietnam to provide the service? Who will provide legal and financial support for the five funded proposals? Your group or learners? Is there a mechanism to ensure the quality of consulting services? I appreciate the feasibility of the proposal. This could completely become a potential project in the future. Just keep in mind some of the issues above.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The goal of the proposal is clear. This project will be successful when: learners have access to a rich source of video lectures; 5 sponsored proposals have been supported and shared with positive feedback; their feedback will be shared publicly via social media channels. As can be seen, the implementation process and results of the project are easy to check. However, to make the project more prestigious, I suggest that it should have a directory of legal and financial staff taking courses and be able to use quality tests. This directory will be the source of potential future workforce providing efficient financial and legal services to funded proposals and blockchain startups. At the same time, in the next phase, the projects that will be funded in Fund 9 will be surveyed to know that Vietnam's funded projects are having legal and financial problems. Anyway, I believe this will be a very beneficial source of information for the project to develop in the right direction. The project will have a positive impact on the funded projects in particular, the legal and financial staff, and the Cardano Vietnam community in general. It will provide knowledge and job opportunities for legal and financial staff in Vietnam. Build up potential talent connected with funded projects and blockchain startups. The publicly posted course video recordings are a useful resource for Vietnamese and global students, financial legal staff, and project developers. The success of the project is entirely related to the challenge, which will provide human resources to solve legal and financial problems and develop the Cardano ecosystem. This is a new project, and there is no test product yet. To develop blockchain human resources in Vietnam, the project must be expanded and popularized among students at legal and financial training universities. I appreciate the transparency of the project. It would be more perfect if it improved some points.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3950", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1845, "q0": "This proposal addresses the challenge perfectly by providing legal and financial solution via video education including advisory services to the Cardano Catalyst community that are funded.

What I think that could be major risk is the laws & taxes about cryptocurrencies is not enough or solid enough in the Vietnam.

The budget breakdown of some projects is sketchy and general and has not been detailed, so it is difficult to visualize the detailed financial picture for the project in order to raise capital appropriately, optimally, and accurately for the current projects and subsequent rounds. Because money is the blood of the project, finance and accounting need to be focused on. In addition, in some countries like Vietnam, the official legal framework for blockchain and virtual currency projects is not yet in the stage of discussion and completion. I believe it is the same in many other countries as well.
