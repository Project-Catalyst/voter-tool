The problem statement is as follows: users who want to interact with smart contracts must own ADA, and this is an \u201cenormous barrier which stops many users from using a dapp\u201d. I beg to differ slightly, and would argue that it is a minor impediment, since transaction costs are very reasonable, and potential bottlenecks are likely to be more wallet functionalities and perhaps the respective dapps\u2019 UI/UX features. Moving on, the value proposition is to develop an fiat to crypto gateway that can directly interact with a smart contract following a fiat payment. So what we are actually being proposed is a functionality that minimizes the number of steps necessary to interact with an app from two to one, but the user will still have to create an app, however it won\u2019t be necessary to purchase ADA first on an exchange, whereas in this case he can simply purchase it directly from the dapp via the functionality we are being pitched here. \n\nThe one thing that strikes me though, is: if the user pays in fiat, who on the dapp\u2019s end receives that fiat and when? Aren\u2019t dapps supposed to be decentralized and running only online, without taking the shape of a company / business? These things are not clear from reading the proposal. \n\nRegardless of my question above, I think this is an excellent idea and clicks very well with the challenge, and then some! Because not only future proposers will be able to interact with dapps in this way, but any other user. So excellent scalability potential and great connection with the challenge!", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Wert is the team behind this proposal, and they are a small enterprise devising crypto solutions for applications, what we would normally call a B2B solution. They have a friendly website and within the proposal we are being offered links to the social media profile of most team members. Like this we observe that they are based in Estonia. \n\nSadly we are not being offered a breakdown of the budget. We are informed however that development costs would have to cover 3 devs, 2 QA engineers, the design and project management. An excellent proposal would have included hourly rates for the dev tea and an estimation of total hours needed, as a minimum. \n\nTimewise, the proposal contains a long list of milestones and time necessary to complete, however it is rather disorganized and not well put together. Not enough to subtract stars due to this, but perhaps in the next rounds they can be more considerate towards their stakeholders reading the proposal, assessors and voters alike.\n\nA missed opportunity is perhaps the fact the the team does not seem to have in plan to engage a third party audit for their functionality, which might be a costly mistake since security risks might be lurking underneath unless the utmost care is taken during the development phase.  \n\nIn conclusion this is a feasible project from a technical standpoint, however lacking budget details completely, and so three stars I deem as sufficient. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Wert proposes to measure the success of the feature through the amount of transactions being intermediated, by volume and number of transactions. There is definitely room for improvement in terms of what can be measured, for instance the number of applications using their feature could have been easily added into the mix. \n\nIn any case, this is a rather simple proposal, and it should not be very difficult for the community to keep track of its development, if implemented, so four stars for auditability.

The proponent explains very richly what these activities would be, which would be quite varied. We can directly understand the activities that will be developed in the proposal. Through this project, an integration of a checkout flow for dApps, which will accept a credit card payment from the user and will make a smart contract payment to any dApp. Next, the proponent goes on to explain in very detail the way this dApp does, who needs this, and the primary use-cases,\u2026 I love this idea and I think that the proposal has the potential to generate an extreme impact for Cardano, deserving top marks in this regard.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The feasibility of the project is not adequate, having good points and some things to improve. Starting with the roadmap, we know which activities would be necessary for the development of the project, but these activities are not explained in detail. We know the total duration of the activities to be performed (10 weeks), which are divided into 5 phases: research stage, development phase, testing v1, development phase 2, and testing v2. The proponent explains what actions would have to be taken in each of these phases, for example in the testing phase there would have to put the results of the developments to the test, and make sure that Wert can produce transactions first on testnet and then on the mainnet and fix bug if needed. I think that the way the script was presented to us is very logical and simple to understand, my only suggestion is that within these groups the estimated time for each of these tasks of phase was defined. How long would it take to connect libraries to their backend? How would this development phase be made a change to their backend? I think the script is good, being able to be a little more detailed regarding what would be done and also how long each thing would last. Now talking about the budget, 50 thousand dollars is asked, but all we know is the money would go towards \u201cthe work of at least 3 developers, devops, 2 qa engineers, designer, and a project manager\u201d. But we don\u2019t know what their work routines would be like, the value of their monthly salaries, how many hours they would dedicate each week to the project, or whether they work full-time or part-time. The project will not have a form of marketing? From what I understand, this part requires a lot of detail to be included. Finally, speaking of the team, the team involved introduces itself very briefly, we only know the names and LinkedIn profiles of some team members. It is not explained in detail what professional role they play, what they have done so far in their professional lives, and how they interact with the Cardano ecosystem. For these reasons, I think the feasibility of the proposal is not good, and in need of improvement.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "I think auditability is very superficial. The proponent claims that \u201cWe will measure it by the amount of transactions to Cardano smart contracts coming from Wert. We will measure it by the volume of ADA sold by Wert\u201d so that the information that will be mint on the Cardano blockchain can be gathered in the future. That\u2019s a good point, but where exactly would these records be made? Will they use some data-sharing application, such as google docs? How would the Cardano community have access to such information? In the way it is explained to us, auditability is still very abstract, remaining in a promising result. Now, for the final result, I think the author was also a little superficial in building a successful scenario which is represented: \u201ca successful transaction coming from Wert to execute an operation smart contract on Cardano blockchain. High ADA sales volume by Wert\u201d. So we know that this is the main objective of the proposal, but how can we measure, quantitatively and qualitatively, the consequence for our blockchain? In my view, the proponent does not tell us reliable ways to monitor the progress and final results of this project. There also was a lack of depth on how all this data will be collected and presented to the Cardano community. Therefore, I would like the proponent to be more specific about how this big goal could be audited little by little, giving us smaller indications to see the overall success. And, in the same way, such information must reach the members of the Cardano community undoubtedly. In general, I believe that overall the topic should be reviewed and improved.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 3, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 34, "q0": "This proposal addresses the problem that users face when they want to interact with a Cardano app, for example, to purchase a cNFT, but don\u2019t already hold ADA.

However, the challenge brief calls for \u201ceffective solutions to explore and provide legal & financial services and support to funded proposers.\u201d As this proposal doesn\u2019t respond to the challenge, and since they are requesting a significant amount of the total budget (10%) I deducted two points.

The team also references \u201chigh ADA sales volume by Wert\u201d and it would be useful to know what they consider to be a \u201chigh\u201d sales volume.

From my recollection, of all the hundreds of people who chose to mint an NFT, only once did I actually get the question if they could buy it with fiat. I say this, because I am unsure, at least for the short term, if there is high demand for this product. However, I see the possibility that in the near future blockchain adoption will reach a much wider audience, and with its growth, the desire for people to have a faster and smoother experience will increase, and as such, the need for such a product would exponentially grow. \nOtherwise, from what I could find on the Wert website, the process seems to be very smooth and the user would almost feel like he didn\u2019t interact with blockchain technology at all. The KYC process looks to be a lot faster than at any other service I have interacted with, and this trend will probably become the norm as blockchain adoption becomes mainstream.\nThere is one question I could not find an answer for, neither in the proposal text nor on the website: How is the user\u2019s blockchain address created, and at what point in time? I suppose the user would have to first create, in this case, an ADA Cardano address, before and not after interacting with any smart contract or purchase/mint.\nIn conclusion to what I have written, I see the need for such a product in the long-term, so, it would make sense for the Cardano developers to stand prepared for when that time comes.

After that, the development phase can start and will last between 2-4 weeks, in which time they will implement their discoveries and connect them to their existing product. They then plan 2 version release phases, each one with a testing period of about 2 weeks, thus ensuring the product works without any major bugs.\nUnfortunately, the budget breakdown section has remained completely unanswered. And from a team that has built such a seemingly robust product, and has written such an extensive and informative proposal, I feel it\u2019s really a shame that they haven\u2019t administered just a little bit of extra time and effort into putting together a reasonable budget. There are no amounts in the budget, neither of dollars nor of work hours. There is only a short paragraph saying how many people will be needed to implement the project and that is it. \nOn the other hand, for the team description, they have provided names for the entire team and for most of them, corresponding Linkedin links. \nIn summary, the completely missing budget section, unfortunately, put me in the position of subtracting at least one point for the feasibility section, as such, considering that the rest of the segment is comprehensive enough, I will leave it at an end score of 4.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For the first question of the auditability section, the team has not covered the progress of the development part of the proposal, but only the progress after launch.

The first sentence here has attracted my attention \u201cA successful transaction coming from Wert to execute an operation smart contract on Cardano blockchain\u201d. I consider that this metric of success would work better in the testing phase and not after the product launch. Maybe some extra bit of additional information would have clarified this issue, but as it stands, I feel slightly confused by it.\nDue to the missing pieces of information, I find it would be somewhat hard to evaluate the progress and success of this proposal, and because of that, I will give it a score of 3.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2192", "no_vca": 10, "ne": 5, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 9027, "q0": "The aim of this proposal  is to create a Fiat to crypto currency and cryptocurrency to Fiat payment Gateway using smart contracts built on the Cardano Network.
