Algae Token is a project run by an Australian team, whose purpose is to launch algae farms as community run projects with a profit sharing agreement where half of the revenue gets reinvested in future projects. The value proposition of this proposal is to support the project in identifying the best possible legal set-up for their operations, both within Australia, as a first step, but also identifying a friendly location across the globe that can function as their world-wide headquarters. \n\nOf course, the deal is that the entire effort will be well documented and the entire community can benefit from their lessons learned, while the framework that they will select and go for can serve as a template / blueprint / user manual for similar undertakings. \n\nThis is a very enticing proposition, similar in many ways to other proposals within the challenge, like for instance \u201cAccounting reporting France\u201d. This is a good thing, first of all because several teams have similar ideas - that definitely means that there is both a community necessity behind them but also the desire for the community to help each other with opening up new legal / regulatory paths.\n\nFor voters deciding how to vote for these proposals, I believe that judging the value for money for each and every one should be an individual choice, and this proposal is definitely up high from my point of view in this respect. In conclusion, a great idea, with a strong use case for the Cardano community.  ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There is a certain lack of internal competence when judging by the description of the team. Most members are of course very well positioned within their respective fields, mainly microbiology, sustainability challenges, eccetera. It is rather an unwritten message, but this task will definitely be externalized to their legal network, and that is definitely the way to go. However, I would have liked to see the proposal a bit more \u201cbeefed up\u201d in terms of demonstrating the internal competency of launching a tender request for this project as well as demonstrating a very good capacity of going through a selection procedure at the end of which to choose the best positioned outside consultants in order to deliver on this task. And this is sadly not the case for the proposal.\n\nThe budget is lightly sketched, and we have fairly good bullet points with captions explaining where the money will go, as well as a few hourly rates for some of the external jobs. Again, judging by the presence of the hourly rates makes me wonder if the external consultants haven\u2019t been already decided upon (I think they have) but if this is the case, a better presentation of their team / competence would have turned this proposal into an excellent one. \n\nTimewise things are fairly simple - it will take roughly four months to complete the tasks and do all the registrations required by law. I have a hunch that this timeline might be a bit too optimistic especially for the \u201cglobal\u201d portion of the project and that it will not be so easy to research, identify, select and incorporate a business entity, taking into account all the complexities that the crypto / tokens subjects will bring with them. \n\nIn conclusion I judge this proposal as having fairly good chances for a correct implementation, and I offer four stars, with indulgence. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "This is actually the section that worries me the most. A very serious negative aspect of the proposal is that there are very little details offered in terms of how the lessons learned from this task will be passed on to the community. I do have to offer, again, the  \u201cAccounting reporting France\u201d in the same challenge as an excellent example of how to approach auditability for a similar project: offer frequent interactions / reports to the community, organize a few FAQ sessions with other interested parties, and pledge that at the end of the project to draft a really comprehensive report regarding your experience. This is sadly not the case, and I can only hope that the desire to pass on to the community the accumulated knowledge is much stronger than this proposal is indicating. I offer three stars since I am not convinced that the team successfully demonstrates a good case for solid auditability around this project.

The issue of insufficient legal direction for most projects in the ecosystem is a key challenge which has to be addressed. The stated problem statement falls in line with the challenge category which looks at some bottlenecks in the field of legal and financial issues that face already funded projects. As part of the acceleration of development and app eco-systems which help projects to grow and evolve. Included in the problem solution of this project, there will be the legalised framework of a dApp business model providing real-world solutions and physical products over the blockchain. A key metric in this proposal in my view matches the one indicated in the challenge settings and aligns with the use case of this project. The use case is a framework for the legal and financial standards that will be very useful for already funded projects and future projects.

The team's experience skills can be verified with the provided links that show the amazing skills they have.

The cost to be incurred on international legal advice and constituency was broken down into identifiable systems such as accounting fees to establish the local legal entity that administers the physical projects, local registration fees and social impact classification.\nStrongly I believe the provision of a legal financial framework as stated in this proposal will help broaden more horizons in this ecosystem and also increase its impact on the global economy. \nConsidering some risks that are forecasted in the implementation of this project, digital assets and native tokens have no clear pathway to ensure lawful operations.

This is why this proposal's objectives are accurately aligned with the challenge settings.

In summary, the proponent wants to develop the legal and financial framework to allow on-chain purchases of physical products. According to him, with the correct legal and financial implementation, a blockchain-based business can be constructed consisting of an online marketplace that supplies physical products for exchange of ADA or a supported native token. This would certainly be beneficial for Cardano. However, I think there was a lack of detail to better understand the idea, for example, a deeper explanation about the activities that will be developed, how this process would be done, how would people find out about this framework, etc. I think in theory it is a proposal that perfectly fits the objective of establishing the legal and financial framework to operate and comply with local legal obligations on the global Cardano network, mainly because it is about to characterize the legal framework for the DAO business model providing real-world solutions and physical products over the blockchain. However, my opinion is it would be important for us to know more details about how things would happen.

However, I think some activities could be more detailed and the time division could be more exact, for example, phase two would be from months 2-3. What specifically would happen in month two and month three? If this division were more exact, we could understand even better how this process would happen. Regarding the budget, we have detailed explanations of how the total amount would be divided, and the parts into which it is divided are very well explained. We know the value of the work hours, how many hours they would work per week, and the total time in months they would dedicate to the project, so it is fully understood how that money would be used. About this part, I think we have the necessary level of specificity. Now speaking of the team, we know that they are 3 professionals: Dylan Kreis, Skye Thomas Hall, and Swaminathan Detchanamurthy. We know their professional attributions, a small curriculum, and also links to pages such as LinkedIn, where we can see in practice what they have done so far and we have proof as well as the information provided. However, about the cryptocurrency lawyer and chartered accountant, we don\u2019t have details about those involved. We only know the professional roles for the project to become possible, and their brief resumes. It would be essential for us to know who would fill each of these vacancies; we would need to know them individually to convey a certain trust. It would be necessary for their full names to be informed, as well as their professional resumes, including previous jobs (so that we could get an idea of what experiences they have), as well as how these people relate to our blockchain.

The project's progress will also be tracked with regular meetings with legal and accounting professionals to ensure progress and task completion. But how often would these updates be made? I believe that it is necessary for the proponent to better detail what will be done so that we can monitor the construction of the project, which includes monitoring the work routine of all the professionals involved as well as the partial goals achieved. I suggest these meetings should be at least monthly. Regarding the final results, from what I understand, the proponent just repeats what is said in the measure to track the progress part; if this is achieved, the project will be considered successful. I believe that this can indeed be measured from this project, but it is not explained how this analysis would take place. As for our blockchain, how can we measure its impact for it? Did the project meet several specific challenge objectives? I think there would need to be several smaller goals, and measurable data, that would allow our community members to understand if this was achieved and how. As the proponent states that \u201cSuccess is also the Cardano community adopting the project which will be calculated by the number of members onboarded to social media platforms, such as discord and Twitter.\u201d How can we tell if new members have been added to our community if they are active, and if so, what do they do? etc. So, overall, I think this topic deserved a little more attention and depth.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2879", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 7367, "q0": "As a matter of fact, there is not enough regulatory direction for ambitious decentralized, globally distributed sustainable business models on the Cardano blockchain.
