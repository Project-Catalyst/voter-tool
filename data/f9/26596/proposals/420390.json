As described, the proposal would establish a legal mind map of Latin America, starting with the Andean Region at Fund 9. The proposal posed a problem that was only partially relevant to the challenge. Because Challenge aims to build a team of legal professionals who can provide legal solutions and consulting services to sponsored proposers. However, this proposal answers the question, \"How do Latin Americans understand and think logically about the legal system?\" This is a rather broad issue. They do not focus on solving the problem that Challenge aims to be a legal solution for sponsored proposers. Through this proposal, people in Latin America will have a comprehensive legal mind map in all aspects. They will be knowledgeable about the Latin American legal system. However, in response to the question \"What value does this proposal add to Cardano?\" It is very difficult to answer. This may be applicable to some funded proposers in Latin America who can legally use the proposal to initiate and operate the project. This is a proposal that can grow in the future if it is properly oriented and well run. The solution they came up with was to build a legal map that describes the legal structure of a country on any given topic. began in the Andes, then spread to other Latin American countries .. That way, users can look up related concepts based on a topic or key words, which are represented in mind maps. .. They had a perception of the risks that may be encountered when implementing it, which is the complexity and richness of legal provisions. It is not only the law but also the resolutions and directives of the public authorities, which are very difficult to find. However, that risk can be completely overcome by associating with experienced lawyers to limit the risk. This is not a bad idea. Although it is not really suitable for the challenge, I think they can completely fix and edit some points to be more suitable. In order to be able to provide legal solutions to the sponsored proposers, they can create a legal map in the blockchain field with several topics: conditions for establishing a blockchain startup? Tax? Copyright, intellectual property? What legal frameworks apply to a project? Security? Smart contract? What are the legal regulations related to blockchain? So, I have not really appreciated the impact of this proposal.\n", "q0r": 2, "q1": "They have detailed plans for the proposal. The proposal will be completed in 3 months, starting from 10/2022. The first month: researching and compiling content. Next month: building websites and information structures. Last month, we put the website into use, improved the image, and evaluated the impact on users. I appreciate the proposal being divided into 3 certain timelines. However, where possible, more detailed planning is recommended, e.g., what areas of legislation will be studied and documented? Is the document fully updated or just some important text? With a legal issue, what legal documents will the proposal provide? What to do in case some terms are changed, canceled, or expired? How do users approach this mind map? Is there any effective communication and marketing plan? A lot of problems need to be solved. You should make a clearer and more detailed plan to estimate a suitable time. 3 months is actually quite a bit to do all the work. Besides, the goal of the proposal is to build a foundational tool, a legal mind map. However, there aren't any specific metrics about the legal content in it. For example, How many topics are in the mind map? How many users will the proposal reach? The current goal of the proposal is actually quite vague. We can check out their legal mind mapping progress and results right on their platform. In terms of budget, the fundraising budget of this proposal accounts for only 3% of the total challenge. They mentioned a funding budget spending plan, but I wonder what \"Additional cost for countries: $3,000\" means? For how many countries? The fundraising budget does not have additional plans and no marketing communication budget. If the proposal's issues were to be improved, they would have to recalculate the funding budget. The team consists of 2 members: a lawyer and a professional designer. They have the qualifications and experience suitable for the proposed work. The community can verify their identity via Linkedin. However, they do not have a specific task assignment. The idea of the proposal is quite good. But to get good results, the team needs more detailed and clear planning. For example, for a topic, what content will be provided to the user; possibly relevant legal documents; practical examples of application and solutions; duration of the document copies, related documents with the same content, ... can contact the government agency to update the most current information. So the score for feasibility is low.\n", "q1r": 2, "q2": "This proposal is not really easy to control for transparency. The proposal only provides the goal of successfully building the platform; there are no other metrics to measure the success of the project. If one is only building the platform, it is not possible to properly assess the success of the project. We need to add other metrics: quantity and quality of content in legal mind maps; number of users accessing the product; number of visits per day, month, quarter, and year; reviews from platform users. The success of the project is creating a mind mapping tool and synthesizing legal documents, providing the people of Latin America. As mentioned in section A Impact, this project is not really related to the challenge. If it is possible to develop blockchain legally, it will help more funded projects in Latin America, which will be related to the challenge. This is a brand new product and has not been tested. I do not appreciate the transparency of the proposal.\n", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_3950", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 2, "ng": 1, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1168, "q0": "The proposal effecitively addresses the challenge as it aims to deliver a legal mind map (or concept map) for the Latin America legal landscape, allowing users to understand legal concepts in a graphical way.

", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team wants to deliver a web page displaying the above mentioned mind map. There is no indication if this map will be interactive, if the topics will be clustered by keywords and if so how many keywords they are targeting.\nThe budget also does not take in account the marketing expenses needed to advertise the website to help not only the Cardano community but potentially also other blockchain projects operating in Latin America. \nMoreover, I see that this proposal could be easily part of a bigger proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416507, which aims to do the exact same way, by EMBEDDING the map into an AI tool. \n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Although the team accounts a member who is familiar with Catalyst and has already been funded, I don't see the level of precision in the brief to reach a full score.

The legal mind map is opened to help more people access and avoid making unnecessary mistakes. This is a good proposal, if it is more widely spread around the world, the legal issues will be better solved. Creating a legal mind map as a solution to this problem is a very useful implementation for idea proponents and people working in a country, without having to fill them in. .

Therefore, it is very important that the legal framework is offered publicly in an easily understandable way. Especially in the system of a mind-map it makes a lot of sense, because it can be structured better. Unfortunately, only a small part of the world is covered and it remains questionable which regulations are really included. Certainly not all of them are relevant for the Cardano community.

Therefore, this should be the main focus.\nUnfortunately, there is not so much information about the web designer Mateo Parada, but it seems that he is active in graphic/web design.\nI can't give full stars here, because I know from my own experience that it is basically not easy to find the right information and then to present it easily, especially as a single lawyer.
