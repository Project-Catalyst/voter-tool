This proposal tackles the challenge by connecting legal professionals and blockchain projects through their platform, called \u201cTokenlist\u201d.\n\nThe proposal partially fails to mention how it would add value to the Cardano ecosystem. While it mentions that it would create a marketplace for legal workers and entrepreneurs, I would like more specific details on how that would help Cardano, because the voter could think that the solution proposed could also apply to other blockchains.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lack of mention to future scalability. Some information regarding this topic would help the voter be more confident in this proposal\u2019s ability to scale going forward.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Concerning skills and experience necessary to implement the proposal, identification of team members as well as LinkedIn profiles and some general background are provided. Some complementary media articles are also proportioned. Regarding the team, the voter can find evidence through links and professional background information. Looking at this information, one can see that they have the ability to successfully implement their solution, since there\u2019s a legal professional, a full stack developer and a PhD with experience in fintechs.\n\nWhen it comes to the budget, it is divided into 2 sections which describe the tasks that will be worked on. A break-down of the budget is also visible to the voter, and will be divided between the developer\u2019s salary and the legal professional\u2019s wage. Considering the amount being asked, it seems reasonable when compared to the salary a professional in that field of work and same expertise would get.\n\nA criterion that could contain more information is the timeline, which is provided in the same space as the budget. The proposal lists two phases which will last around 1-2 months each, and some general information for each section. Perhaps a bit more detail would make the timeline more understandable, and naming who will work on each task would also make it more transparent (although team members are listed, there\u2019s no mention of what they will focus on). A mention of the resources needed would make the proposal more complete, too.\n\nFinally, the proposal lists 2 potential risks and 2 ways to mitigate them. I consider these risks are possible, however, I see some more obvious ones, such as what to do when a person has a legal query which belongs to another jurisdiction and there\u2019s no lawyer available for that. The proposal states that in that case, a worker of Tokenlist would help the costumer solve the query, however, there are reasonable doubts around the worker\u2019s ability to solve a query concerning an international jurisdiction which he/she potentially has no knowledge of.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Foremost, a roadmap is provided with some general milestones. There will be two phases and three milestones for each respective phase.\n\nRegarding the metrics which will track the project\u2019s progress, the team provides some useful as well as informative ones. For example, the latest code will be published in GitLab and will be available for anyone who\u2019s interested. This is a great initiative because not only does it allow the voters to have a look at the actual code, but also contributes to the broader strategic goals for Fund9, which are to turn Cardano into an open source project, among others.\n\nFinally, the team defines what success looks like in the short and long term. For example, for the short term, the project would be considered to be successful based on the number of legal queries posted and \u201clegal team responding to each query a developer/entrepreneur\u201d. This doesn\u2019t seem too specific, and perhaps the team could define what number of legal queries would they consider enough.

This proposal would solve the problem by building a Cardano-savvy attorney marketplace. At their platform, project developers who need support from the legal and compliance team can post their legal questions and issues for a quick and efficient response. They will use social media such as twitter, reddit, telegram, etc. to reach project developers wishing to use legal consulting services.

And most importantly, the community of interest is the customer's evaluation of the legal consulting service. They do not mention where the community will check the progress of the project. I ask the question: when the system is successfully created, can the community check their operating background? See questions from project developers and the list of attorneys they provide?
