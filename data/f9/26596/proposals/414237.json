Specifically the proposal intends to connect with the relevant companies via Colombia\u2019s several existing Chambers of Commerce. If we recall the purpose of the challenge - to offer legal and / or financial solutions that can support funded proposers - we have to take into account the fact that any implementation has to be mindful of the geographical distribution of proposers amongst the Catalyst funds - and with Colombia being a major tech hub within the LatAm space, and also given IOG\u2019s focus on offering Cardano\u2019s technology as a leap-frogging solution especially towards the mostly unbanked populations (Africa of course but LatAm as well), developing the legal certainty within which blockchain companies can operate within Colombia speaks extremely well with the challenge. \n\nA strength of the proposal is that it will focus on delivering targeted advice to blockchain companies, since the existing chambers of commerce are already delivering free (general) legal  advice to companies, but of course that it is highly unlikely that their expertise can go as far as to know and to navigate well the intricacies of the blockchain / crypto space. \n\nAnother positive aspect is the fact that Colombia has many chambers of commerce that support the local businesses (over 50) and a successful project that will manage to liaison with most of them will be extremely impactful since it has the capacity to reach a great deal of blockchain-oriented new companies during their formation phase, which is critical in terms of offering them the legal certainly with regards to their operating environment and perhaps even help them in shaping their future strategic steps in this industry. \n\nOne minor area of improvement requiring additional attention from the proposer is the way in which the advice will be shaped and how easy it will be in practice for the Chambers to assimilate it, understand it and be capable of delivering it downstream towards the small and medium enterprises. But overall the proposal speaks very well with the challenge and would have a beneficial impact on the LatAm Cardano community if implemented. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The idea is excellent, but I believe that the proposal falls short in a few key areas required by the challenge and the proposers' guide. All of these points below (combined) make me not want to trust so much the feasibility of the project, so I find it fair to subtract two stars overall in this category. But let\u2019s take things one by one so I can better explain my reasoning.\n\nThe roadmap is fairly well described, and the proposers describe very well each of the five monthly deliverables, with each taking the shape of a legal study that will be delivered to the chambers. I am also a legal person by formation and experience, and I have the feeling that certain topics that will be covered by these five legal studies are fairly distant from blockchain technology, and at this point in time it is not necessary to dive so much into some details, for example Colombia\u2019s constitution. I am fully aware of the fact that such a foundational piece of legislation lays the groundwork for the entire legal system, but I feel that more of the resources would be better used on more applied topics, closer to the pain points of up and coming blockchain companies. So I think that the proposal lacks a bit of focus on the most important points that are relevant today: tax implications, accounting issues, but most importantly doing a bit of ground-work first (a survey maybe, or discussion with a few start-ups) to better understand the needs of the emergent industry.  \n\nJhonatan, the main proposer, will single handedly deliver the project through his own strength. He is a Lawyer with a MSc degree experience working in public and private entities. It would have been extremely satisfactory to have a bit more details regarding his experience, previous employment and formation. Unfortunately, the linkedin profile, although present, does not shed too much light onto these topics, so this turns into the second worrisome point with regards to the project\u2019s feasibility - since I am not fully convinced that the proposer has the capacity to fully take the project to fruition on all its fronts at the same time. It would have been extremely satisfactory to see at least a line-up of 3-5 seasoned lawyers active in the Colombian market that can support each other and cover the many (and complex) areas of expertise necessary to deliver a wide-scope blockchain legal survey towards the various chambers of commerce.  \n\nThe budget forms the last, but not least, point of improvement of the project. We are being told that the budget is equally split between the five months of the project (3.8k USD each), equally divided between research and legal advice. I find it very hard to believe that it is actually possible to split the budget so well to fit perfectly in each of the five months and that the necessary time needed to research each individual topic (different by nature) are all the same. ", "q1r": 3, "q2": "It is definitely possible for the community to audit the project, but it will not be ideal in its current shape. The proposer offers a few very good points that have to be taken into consideration: whether each of the legal studies was performed according to the plan (one per month), and whether the document was delivered to the CONFECAMARAS (a body acting as a liaison between the multiple Chambers of Commerce in Colombia). \n\nI ask myself the following questions, which are not clear from my point of view: will it be possible for the community to reach out directly to CONFECAMARAS in order to independently confirm the submission of each study? Will an English translation be provided for non Spanish speaking people within the Cardano community? \n\nThe auditability of the project would have been much much better if the proposer would have pledged publicly, within the project itself, to make the documents available online in a certain manner, and, ideally, translated in order for anyone to be able to go through it and judge not only the binary information of whether the document exists (yes or no) but also to offer the possibility of judging the quality of the research performed and the extent of the legal material being offered.

The aim of the solution is to help Colombian crypto-related companies receive fair treatment when going through procedures at the Chamber of Commerce - where companies in this country go through the registration and legally established. Personally, I think the information of the proposal is not really clear and complete.

I think the group needs to point out the specific regulations of Colombia, the barriers and difficulties that crypto businesses will face when registering new establishment here.

Transactions and revenue need accounting (monthly/quarterly/yearly) so where does the money come from? Who is the entity that appears on the invoice? The requirements for tax declaration and finalization, KYC, payment services... This will lead to the issues the proponent needs to solve to support the business. Specifically, the declaration of a cryptocurrency wallet to serve the reporting of revenue, business operating expenses, related tax obligations, etc. In my opinion, the risks that have not been taken into account include: Firstly, the complex legal system and unspecified regulations related to cryptocurrencies. This is not only in Colombia but also in many countries, because cryptocurrencies are not yet recognized by the laws of many countries. Second, the source of money from cryptocurrency investment is sometimes unclear and difficult to declare before state management agencies and organizations.

Cryptocurrency and blockchain in general still seem to be a legal gray area to some extent and this puts a damper on the development of companies which are founded on these technologies. The proposer could add some more difficulties that crypto businesses in specifically Columbia encounter compared to conventional technology companies. To facilitate the growth of cryptocurrency companies, the proposal will submit a legal document to the Chambers of Commerce (the legal entity where companies are legally registered) to earn more favorable treatment in establishing and growing crypto companies. Receiving support from local authorities and governing bodies is a crucial part that could determine the prosperity of an industry. For instance, Thailand greatly promotes its tourism industry, investing money in building infrastructures and international promotion. Similarly, if the proposer is able to convince Chambers of Commerce about the potential of the cryptocurrency industry, and if special treatment and investments are poured into these companies, the face of cryptocurrency will completely change for the better. The proposer is able to point out how this paves the way for already established and future cryptocurrency companies in Columbia. Growing a stable crypto community in Columbia is a good way to expand the impact of the crypto and blockchain community globally. The Catalyst and Cardano community in Columbia will also benefit from this, which makes the proposal aligned with the challenge. However, the proposer doesn\u2019t really specify the contents of such a legal document they will submit to Chambers of Commerce. This is important because the contents will decide if this legal entity agrees to grant crypto companies favorable treatment and resources for development. The ambiguity in the contents may lessen the impact of this proposal as it is unclear whether the contents are sufficient or well-designed or not. Therefore, some key ideas from these documents should be mentioned. The main risk will be the inability to develop a sufficient deliverable.

However, there should always be mitigating steps for any possible risks, regardless of their likelihood. Such precaution is always useful in the long-run. Another risk that the proposer could mention is the probability of being rejected by the Chambers of Commerce. A contingency plan or better assurance about the deliverables should be given to make sure this risk is mitigated to the lowest.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The timeline will be carried out in 5 months. There are specific activities for each month, all of which will be making legal study for different entities (Political Constitution of Colombia, Chambers of Commerce, CONFECAMARAS,...). The content of the legal study could also be briefed through for more clarity and conviction of how it will be effective in achieving the goal. What process the legal study entails should also be mentioned, if possible. The budget breakdown is not sufficiently presented. During 5 months, research and legal advice will take up 1,900 usd each, meaning 3,800 usd for each month. The total budget would then be 19,000 usd. The proposer should specify what the research will be about (ex: cryptocurrency inner workings, companies operation, chances of success, Columbian people\u2019s opinion about cryptocurrency, governmental policies,...). For legal advice, the proposer should state how they arrive at the price of 1,900 usd. For example, the proposer could break the amount of 1,900 usd into ? usd per hour which is the price for hiring legal advisors/ law firms/legal services. A clear budget breakdown will be positive for feasibility. The team consists of only one member, whose profession is a lawyer. Although the relevant experiences are suitable for the nature of this proposal, it can be brought into question whether one person alone can handle the workload and devise the most efficient legal study. The proposer has been working in the Catalyst project since F4, which somehow gives some credibility for their ability to accomplish this proposal alone. However, some more evidence and explanation should be given to add more conviction. Future funds won\u2019t be needed for this proposal.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The progress will be based on whether the main proponent is able to keep up with the detailed plan and whether the deliverables are delivered within a specific duration of time. These metrics are reasonable, although it is not the most objective way to keep track of progress. This might not be possible for external audit, which is another factor that could increase auditability. The proposer could consider holding meetings or update progress on websites, github, social media. The vision of success and SDG goals are relevant and aligned with the proposal.", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4055", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14601, "q0": "I will highlight 2 main activities:\n- To assist in solving the legal difficulty faced by crypto-related companies in Colombia, a team of the Colombian Chamber of Commerce will provide legal advice and special treatment to the companies. related to cryptocurrencies\n- The proponent will provide a legal support document to the consortium of Colombian Chambers of Commerce so that they can consult and advise crypto companies in Colombia.\nTherefore, this proposal completely aligns with the challenge because when it is implemented, there will be countless companies or crypto projects that will meet the legal advice needs. They chose the Chamber of Commerce as their consulting place because this is where Colombian companies are legally registered and incorporated. This ensures reaching as many companies as possible.\nThe proponent has pointed out the risk this project faces but has not offered a solution for it. One piece of advice I have for proponents is to demonstrate the team's ability to address risk by showcasing the skills that project team members have, and getting feedback from companies that are consulted problem in the future", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project construction plan will take place in 5 months along with the main works that need to be completed. Jonathan will be the person to carry out the tasks set out in those 5 months. References to his LinkedIn profile are provided, however no details are provided regarding the \"CONFECAMARAS\" assigned to this proposal, the community will need to know the number of people assigned to the project, the description of their roles, and the hourly rate assigned to each. Roadmap also lacks details, although the proponent detailed the steps of legal research, he did not mention legal advice for companies carried out by CONFECAMARAS organization. The skills of the main proponent have been recognized, however I have some questions for him: \u201cWill the project progress be affected if during the study period there is a change of 1 directives, codes, constitutions? When will you send legal support documents to the Chamber of Commerce?\"", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proponent has given criteria to check the project progress and these criteria is available to be checked in the future. However, in the project success measurement section there is no mention of any specific success metrics regarding the impact they are seeking. So I have some additional suggestions for this section:\n- The proponent should provide an estimate of the number of companies receiving the advice.\n- Number of companies that find this consulting service useful (proposers can ask for feedback from companies)\n- The time when members of the Colombian Chamber of Commerce can begin providing special treatment and advice to companies related to cryptocurrencies.\n- The reporting structure to ensure the community is able to audit project implementation", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_4075", "no_vca": 6, "ne": 1, "ng": 5, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "legally manage advice and special treatment for companies related to cryptocurrencies by the Colombian Chambers of Commerce (entities where companies are created) through their group \"CONFECAMARAS\".", "experience": "I am a Lawyer with a Master's degree and several years of work experience in Public Entities and in private companies"}
