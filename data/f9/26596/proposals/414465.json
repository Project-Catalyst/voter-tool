I know first hand examples of French blockchain practitioners moving to more forgiving countries (Central America) due to the very burdensome requirements from France, in terms of general financial reporting but also due to the high tax levels there. We can\u2019t unfortunately do anything about the tax levels, but this proposal is the next best thing in terms of offering a helping hand to blockchain professionals working in France. \n\nThis proposal brings an excellent value proposition: to analyze the flow of funds relevant to the Catalyst activities and define an accounting reporting path. Such an effort, when complete, can greatly support and assist a number of projects with a strong presence in France. And there are many of them within the Cardano ecosystem: Cardashift has extremely strong French roots, and so does Cardano4Climate. \n\nWithin this context of a burdensome regulatory framework for blockchain activities in France (both at individual and corporate level) and already existing teams working there for Cardano projects, the project is extremely well positioned to deliver added value within the challenge\u2019s context, since there is a great need for legal and accounting personnel joining ranks within Cardano / Catalyst ecosystem and make proposers\u2019  lives easier. \n\nAnother great strength of the proposal is that the proposer behind it, Yoram, is already a member of several Cardano initiatives, and it will be extremely efficient if somebody with an existing background is in charge of identifying pain points and defining exactly what kind of solutions are necessary in order to mitigate compliance and regulatory risks. Building on this point, imagine that once businesses gain peace of mind from a compliance perspective, they will be much more inclined to expand their business and take on additional projects within the ecosystem - therefore the proposal has not only the capacity of minimizing risks, but also offering a strong nudge to funded proposers to build more solutions and focus on core activities. \n\nProviding funded proposals with solutions and services to operate legally in their residing country will open new possibilities and provide peace of mind to the project owners. Many projects will broaden their horizons and increase their impact on the Ecosystem once legal and financial frameworks are explored and established. This will in turn promote adoption and improve product ownership. There is a need to get accountants and lawyers into the Cardano & Catalyst Ecosystem.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Yoram, the proposer, is a veteran Cardano community member, having been involved in various Catalyst activities, including CA, VCA and proposer since Fund 6. The value proposition of the project is rather straigh-forward: obtain assistance from the France-based accountant in order to define a reporting path for 2022 and onward and navigate the existing (and increasing) complexities of ongoing projects: multi-project staking rewards, multi-wallet approach, recording activities, expenses and revenues scenarios, etcetera and transform this assistance into weekly office hours support for community members in need of advice from (mostly) France. \n\nYoram also does an excellent job of presenting the past efforts in terms of accounting activities, and he makes a very compelling case for why such activities will be increasingly complex in the future for multi-projects - which is actually what we want, right, for an existing team to be more and more involved in the Cardano ecosystem?\n\nIf implemented correctly it will be very easy for Yoram / his team to pass on this knowledge gained towards other France-based teams in order to minimize their pain points when it comes to reporting requirements and choosing the best paths forward when selecting the legal vehicles to be used for their specific activities. \n\nFrom a budget perspective, all the amounts presented are very, very reasonable (and them some) while the timeline is also in line with the reporting timeline for 2022 (excellent timing) therefore I don\u2019t feel the need to expand further on these two topics since the team behind and the way the project is presented already offers sufficient comfort that the project has excellent feasibility prospects. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The prospects for auditability for this project are also top notch. Yoram begins by explaining in great detail that a primary focus of the project will be to document everything meticulously (draft a summary of key sessions with the accountant, design the process and tools with widely adopted tools, like excel or miro and have them available for the community via a google folder, etcetera. Of course, the project will comprise a final report describing the various frameworks and potential pathways for reporting. \n\nWe are also being offered a very strong KPI - that is a number of 10 people / companies that are to receive support during this project - which is an excellent indication that there is a strong desire to pass on the knowledge gained onto other teams active within the Cardano blockchain industry. \n\nJust as a small suggestion, it would be very helpful if the final report mentioned above includes some sort of FAQs section and perhaps even a basic guide for new entrepreneurs / freelancers wishing to enter the space, in helping them select the most appropriate vehicles to conduct their business.

This is the reason, that the proponent of this project wanted to undertake a research project on statistical and financial reporting methods suitable for these cases in his locality in France. At the same time, he wants to make it easier for other members of Catalyst to overcome these problems. I read the proposal and liked the idea. However, the solution he gave was not really clear and enough to convince me. So I can't give a maximum score yet.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The plan of this project is basically built in 6 months.

Although they do not currently work with lawyers in depth, or do not have specific reports related to local legal issues regarding cryptocurrencies. While this problem can be learned in advance. Therefore, the work plan is not detailed enough to convince me.\nThe budget they apply for is not too large, mainly to pay income to members participating in this accounting.

The idea here is develop pathways to report earning in Crypto (ADA) to Governments tax auhtiries (France, in this case), buidling this togethe with an accountant and a lawyer. I see in many Cardano forums (such as Telegram) people having question on this and concerned about not declaring it corretly and being punished with more taxation. if this is is implemented, such concerns can be reduced, at least for those who live in France. It's also nice that solution will include tools and processes for other countries, although it is not very clear on how and to what extent (laws will likely vary a lot). However, if the lessons learned on this are properly collected and documented, I'm sure this work will be much more easily replicable in other nations. As for porposal strucuture, it has a very detailed and sensible problem statement, explaning very well the pain points and a straighfoward solution. Regarding challenge alignment, this proposal addresses it as it may \"Provide funded proposals with solutions and services to operate legally in their residing country will open new possibilities and provide peace of mind to the project owners.\".Risk management is also well done, with 3 good risks identified and properly mitigated.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There's a very good timeline proposed, with frequent meeting between proposer and account to develop a complete report. It's good to see that French authorirtiws will be consulted in order to assess if the pathways taken are correrct and follows the law. In addition, also very nice that support to other community members will be provided in the end of the project, as many people are probably struggling with the same problem. This is a direct way to give value back to community.\nBudget breakdown is well done, matching project scope and timeline. It's nice that it is brokendown by activity, role and amount of hours required, which helps to increase transparency.\nAs for the team, there are 2 people already committed, both with Cardano experience in past funds, that may help to track different pathways of earnings in crypto, and with management capabilities. However, it is not clear if the accountant (and the possible lawyer) are already committed or part of the team as nothing about them is mentioned. It would be good to understand this and, if they are indeed committed already, to see their cretendial to check their experience with this type of problem, including crypto. This is the only reason I'm not rating it 5.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There are good metrics to track project progress, most with targets and it's imporant to highlight the one where it is intended to \"Support 10 other people/companies with their reporting process\".

A final report and a Summary of key sessions with the accountant will also be made available. As suggestion, to make it more consistent, it would be good to see more details on the report strcuture and an example of pathway that is going to be explored. In addition, more information onthe strucutre of how the support to other people will occur could also be stated from start.\nFinally, the \"Summary of key sessions with the accountant\" could be made available right after each session so community can contribuite with it, brining their point of view and possible pathways/approaches not initially considered by accountant and proposers, to be discussed in the future sessions.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2461", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 4618, "q0": "The impetus for this proposal stems from a difficulty that the proponent found when working with Cardano/Catalyst. When engaging in many projects, full-time Catalyst/Cardano participants have significant hurdles in declaring income and handling the reporting procedure. This is clearly a challenge for the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems, which are aligned with the Challenge.\nThe proposal addresses two issues raised by the challenge: offering solutions and services to enable sponsored ideas to function lawfully in the jurisdictions in which they are located, and emphasizing the necessity for accounting and legal engagement. The proponent has no plans to grow further in the future.\nCatalyst and Cardano are continually looking for methods to address financial and legal concerns in order to offer peace of mind and increase the effect of the project while participating in the ecosystem. The proposal addressed this issue by contacting working groups in various countries as well as platform groups IOG and Cardano to coordinate methods for billing catalyst/cardano members on a full-time basis.\nAccounting and legal processes are created for individuals and businesses in France by proponents. This approach may be used to different nations by modifying the fundamental concept. The proposal addresses the stated issue by building effective methods to investigate and provide legal, financial, and support services to sponsored Proponents. Provide them with solutions and services to propose lawful activity in their own nation. The proponent collaborates with accounting and legal authorities in France to determine how to disclose revenues and costs for individuals and businesses. They also collaborate with IOG and other teams to coordinate and determine the optimal manner of invoicing. These are the proper arguments advanced by the proponent.\nWith actual experience, the proponent recognized the risks of implementing this proposal, which is the French crypto regulation. The proposed group's second risk is that the project's uncertain source of cash is funded, and the proposal's last risk is that the French legal system is complex and may not cover all situations. The proposed team has offered answers to the foregoing risks, including working with accountants on a roadmap and terminology that satisfies probable procedures in practice. The solution to the second risk is to collaborate with CF and IO, as well as other recommendations for other nations dealing with the same issue. The proposed group defines the status for various scenarios so that it may be checked in any case where the solution to the third risk is not indicated. Finance and legality are complex issues that concern all parties participating in the Cardano ecosystem, including the proposed projects.\nAs a result, the proposal's evidence, value, solution, and risk are all fully acceptable. This section has a score of 5. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposed implementation timeframe of four quarters, including Q3-4/2022 and Q1-2/2/2023, is realistic. This time is based on the termination date of each fund, allowing for simple accounting monitoring. In particular, the third quarter of 2022 plans to continue recording ledgers and developing income recording procedures based on various revenue and expense scenarios. The proposed team's specific objectives are to hold two 2-hour meetings per week with accountants in the fourth quarter of 2022 to map and coordinate the best ledger recording methods based on different situations encountered by the proposing team, such as keeping in the ADA, sending to personal accounts, sending to company accounts, expenses or invoices of partner companies....\nThe time between meetings - accountants verify the appropriate method with authorities and colleagues and prepare papers and information based on the accountant's requirements. There will be two legal consultations throughout this timeframe. The proposed team's particular aim for the first quarter of 2023 is to meet monthly with the accountant to complete the recording of all relevant information for 2022. The proposal team will create with several accounting procedures based on the recorded facts. The final report then shows the research results as well as the tools used to collect the data. The proposed group's special purpose for the first quarter - Q2 2023 is to serve other members of the community who require guidance from France or other countries; office hours will be 8am UTC every Tuesday and will be altered for members in other time zones based on specific needs. Propose identifying and collaborating with other groups/proposals working on similar problems in other countries in order to build best practices for developing reporting processes and tools. These are particular objectives that can be met provided the schedule is maintained.\nThere is no way to track the project's progress. The budget for the proposal is $11,200, which is less than 5% of the Challenge. This concept has a fiscal limitation in terms of governance and legal fees. The proposed initiative is intended to increase governance and legality by $1000. Based on the proposal's stated purpose of having 2 hours of legal and legal counsel, $1000 for extra administrative and legal expenses seems excessive. According to their website, the website https://e-justice.europa.eu/37/EN/costs?FRANCE&member=1 the lowest legal advice and assistance charge in France is EUR 911. So, if the proposed budget of $1000 for governance and legality is insufficient, the proposing team may calculate and increase the cost of this component. The proposed group consists of four people who have been allocated certain responsibilities based on their experience. Members of the recommendation team have complete information that can be verified on LinkedIn, the company website, and Ideascale. P articularly, Yoram Ben Zvi is an Ideascale community member who has submitted dozen proposals that would make this concept believable and realistic. Aside from the minor constraint on estimating the cost of legal assistance, this idea is absolutely deserving of funding. This section gets 4 points from me. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "A description of crucial meetings with accountants is given as a measure of project progress. Recommendations are provided for each essential piece of information/idea represented, and they are simple to comprehend. The proposal also provides a measure for success by making a reporting process design and tools (such as excel and Miro) available to the community - all files will be stored in a Google folder. The final report-making index describes different frameworks as well as potential roadmaps. However, monitoring the project's development is difficult. The proposal, in my opinion, should consider adding a success indicator to provide a manner of collecting data on the income and cost of different accounting styles to apply to developers in different countries.\nWhen the available reporting process design/tool is created, the proposal is considered successful. Create 3-5 reporting paths for different use situations. Make 3-5 forms/tools to aid in the reporting process. Assist 10 additional persons or businesses with their reporting procedure. The community can use an open Google Drive connection to track progress. Collaboration and information sharing with CF, IOG, and community initiatives. These accomplishments also reflect achievement and are linked to Challenge. This is a new proposal, and there is no test product to limit the proposal's transparency. However, if the proponent is committed to doing the right thing with the arguments stated in the proposal, it is capable of implementation and audit.

The solution proposed by the team is to provide accounting services (including the completion of quarterly/annual accounting reports) and legal support for Catalys project owners funded in France. This solution has helped solve a very difficult problem that individuals and businesses related to cryptocurrency are facing today. It is a legal difficulty in the procedure of income tax declaration and financial reporting required by the regulatory authorities of each country. Even in Vietnam and many countries around the world, electronic money has not been recognized by law and is not considered a legal field, so tax and financial procedures do not have specific legal guidelines. However, in terms of civic responsibility, participants in the cryptocurrency sector are still required to follow these procedures. In addition, due to the large price fluctuations of the cryptocurrency market, it is also extremely difficult to record losses/profits, exchange rate differences, conversion costs between blockchain platforms, etc. complex period. With the recommendations made by the authors, the scope of application of the solution in a specific geographical area is France.

The purpose of the solution is to help individuals/businesses find the most suitable way and path to carry out tax, revenue and expense declaration procedures, in accordance with their requirements legal and compliance with French regulations. The content of the solution will therefore focus on finding many different ways to answer questions and problems encountered in the actual process of doing these procedures. The team is also expected to work with accounting-lawyer groups in other countries to coordinate and find best practices for addressing a range of questions and challenges. For example, making and issuing invoices from cryptocurrency investment activities, calculating the company's profit/loss according to cryptocurrency price fluctuations, etc. Regarding the risks that may be encountered, I personally want to add some extra points. Firstly, the risk of devaluation of the ADA coin may affect the project implementation budget. Secondly, it is difficult for the group to support many individuals/enterprises at the same time because each specific case has related arising procedures that need to be handled and evaluated separately. Third, there is a risk that it is difficult to apply the same model to other countries (as the group wants) because each country has different legal characteristics that need to be complied with.

I only suggest that the group deduct 10-15% of the total budget into the reserve fund.

In other words, the move makes France the first major European country to green light Binance.

The content of the tasks that need to be implemented for each quarter is also developed by the author in a very clear, full and easy to understand manner to help the community easily track the progress of the project.\nThe budget of the proposal has been broken down for each item, this division is completely reasonable and appropriate for each item. At $11200, which is 2.2% of the challenge's total budget, it's a number I find perfect for making this recommendation.\nThe author proposes to have foreseen 3 main risks that can prevent the success of the project. I find these risks to be quite adequate and the author's solution to handle the risks is necessary and reasonable.\nI fully believe that the author group is capable of implementing this proposal well. The main person in charge of the project is Yoram Ben Zvi, a person who works full time with Catalyst, has held many positions at previous funds so I trust he has a lot of experience in this field. In addition, the partners participating in the project are all qualified, educated and experienced people. I consulted their information on community sites such as linkedin, the sites linked in this proposal to verify their identity and work.\n4 points is my rating for the feasibility of this proposal.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "For this project, I believe that the project can be fully audited by the community, and the monitoring of implementation progress and success can be continuous and close thanks to the planning and budgeting part of the project. The project has been detailed by the author team, very close to reality. Clearly the planning and budgeting was done very well by the team members. However, because this is a project that has been going on for a long time, in my opinion, the authors need to add a report on the progress of the project, the progress of using the budget on the personal information pages or projects for the community to understand publicly and transparently.\nI see the KPI section of the project that clearly shows the numbers to measure its success as developing 3-5 reporting pathways for multiple use case, 3-5 tools/forms to support the reporting process and support 10 other people/companies with their reporting process. These numbers are detailed and clear, logically achievable by the project.\nThe success of the project is also demonstrated by being able to develop a useful framework that helps individuals as well as companies registered in France, to put the project into practice in the community in order to reduce the risk of business risk for everyone working on Catalyst and Cardano, in the end the project is considered a success as other community members use the document to report their taxes thereby helping to promote and grow Cardano is like Crypto.\n This is a new project that has not been funded at previous funds, however, because it is necessary and important for the development of the Cardano ecosystem in the future, I hope it will be funded at fund 9 this. I will give this review 4 points, which for me is a very high, almost perfect score for this proposal. I have seen demos of the author team working on projects that have been funded at previous funds. I hope for the results of the community and expert evaluation for this project.\n", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_3281", "no_vca": 7, "ne": 3, "ng": 3, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14000, "q0": "Since to expose a financial statement, the accounting and legal requirements are essential to be met and followed up without errors exactly. The proposer has taken advantage of this circumstance and come up with the proposal that analyzes the cash flows for those projects in Catalyst and via cooperating with accounting and legal service providers to ensure the accuracy of that financial statement. This proposal would benefit most companies in France since the group proposer decided to conduct the first trial version in France and would apply this country\u2019s financial regulations in law and consider whether they can ensure the provided financial statement can engage the declaration taxes but still comply with those regulations or not. This group proposer has performed such a tremendous idea via this proposal and this would raise the positive impact on most novel projects in Catalyst at later on. Moreover, it assists to figure out the most reasonable solutions to make sure that all the legal regulations on finance and accounting are complied.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "It would be perfect if the proposer can add more the backup cost due to the ADA price volatility and it is unpredictable. Then, a backup cost in the budgeted plan is really essential whenever this volatility occurs with a large fluctuation. Anyway, all the explanations are in very detail like how they conduct, the duration here is included which time for which item is completed. Moreover, the budgeted plan here is quite reasonable as I think the team has listed every expenditure that appears here really specifically. On the other hand, the human resource in this proposal is really well-qualified. They are skillful advisors for the community and all own a respectful experience in start-up projects from fund 6 till fund 8. Also, they are described as having experience in finance and accounting as well, like Andr\u00e9 Diamond whose experience is in small business operation and accounting, or Miroslav Rajh whose experience is over 20 years in those majors. I wonder whether they are jogging inside my mind and knowing what I am thinking now? How can they come up with a pretty perfect plan description like that? Those rhetorical questions are showing how amazed I am. For all provided information from the answer, I do appreciate this proposal and the success of it.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In auditability, I would use only one word here: perfect! This group proposer is completely different from those I used to evaluate before. They provided all the tools, number that would help to indicate whether that stage is successful or not. They have made all criterions on their proposal become visualizations and easy for us to follow up the progress. By the way, I do strongly believe in the capacity of each member in this group as their profiles are really impressive and amazing.
