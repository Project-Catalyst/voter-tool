Due to this apparent conflict, the value-added to the Cardano ecosystem is too far into the future to measure impact.\n      ...      \nTo aid the proposer, it seems helpful to mention that as it is written, this proposal currently meets the goals of these two Fund9 Challenges: 1. Challenge & Scouted for Students 2. Grow Africa, Grow Cardano. If not funded, consider rewriting to meet the Legal & Financial Implementations Challenge setting, or switch to one of the two Challenges mentioned if they are still available.\n      ...      \nThe key metrics aim at the number of journalists trained.

The budget seems reasonable for prices in this area of the world. The authors include no plans for additional funds.\n...\nThe proposal does not offer a realistic timetable for completing the work.

As a working professional in a related field, this assessor determines that there is a sound plan for training the journalist students, and a competent institution has been selected. \u201cInfluencing policy\u201d seems difficult to plan for and will probably leave voters looking for a more measurable solution.\n...\nIn terms of risks, it brings up only one concern which appears to be solved in the budget under the \u201cParticipant Traveling Grant,\u201d though further details would help voters determine that for themselves.

In such a situation, journalists would be critical to protecting the interest of the community in their reportage and engage authorities by asking the right and hard questions if their analytical skills have been developed to understand the critical role blockchain is playing and why projects of blockchain should be given the liberty to implement. AJEOT is needed to train journalists in Africa to drive the creation of the legal environment for blockchain projects to thrive. The proposal justified the budget with simplified components including the $7K budget to be used as a flight grant to support participating journalists traveling from outside Ghana as incentives.

In my opinion, the training program should be compiled in an open way to be able to continuously update the latest documents and news about Blookchain technology.
