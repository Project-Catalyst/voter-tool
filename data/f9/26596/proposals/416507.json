In contrast to the majority of the other proposals, which extensively utilize the classical \u201clabor\u201d or legal practitioners, this project intends to leverage on the capabilities of artificial intelligence in order to deliver legal services and position them in a much better position in terms of cost / benefit ratio. The entire project is a joint venture of Profila and University of Luzern. Profila is a marketing platform with extensive privacy features that allows its users to interact with companies while controlling their own data. The platform is live and the project has already received  funding from as far back as Fund6, and it is a Cardano-first initiative.\n\nThe unique approach has an excellent scalability potential. Once the set-up is complete and the product gains traction and proves that it can compete with flesh and bones lawyers in terms of competency / unit of cost (whether USD, EUR, ADA or CHF), there is little to stand in its way towards greatly expanding the services provided. The stated desire is to automate the entire advice offering service by matching questions with a database of over one million laws and other legal documentation. \n\nAdditionally, there is already one module built (or at least in a more advanced stage) around privacy rules, where privacy - based questions and use cases are handled by the Profile app. A second module would be built for Cardano / proposers with a more general approach to laws / compliance, moving away from being exclusively focused on privacy (funded via this project). There are also several other modules (or packages as they are called) that the proposers will look into in order to increase integration with the Cardano blockchain (Atala Prism, singularity projects, etcetera). The project is therefore part of a wider undertaking, with excellent prospects of future integration within the Cardano ecosystem, and very good scaling opportunities. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "There are many excellent points in the projects worth mentioning, it\u2019s difficult to even begin. But let\u2019s start with the team behind the proposal. They are composed of technology lawyers, natural language processing and artificial intelligence specialists from a Swiss university backed by a dozen industry experts. The team also benefits from the assistance of lawyers focused on the crypto space and their project is ongoing. One of them, Michael, has an outstanding background (legal articles, involved in many Cardano projects)  and this for me is a very strong indication that the project sits on solid grounds and can be implemented successfully. He is a lawyer and entrepreneur, but most importantly a long time contributor to the Cardano ecosystem and especially active within Catalyst.\n\nAnother excellent selling point of the project is that there are few risks in terms of non-delivery of the project, and I can say that due to the funding already secured from the Swiss university and available sponsorship by the Swiss government for a two year research project. So regardless of the Catalyst funding outcome, the project will indeed carry on.  \n\nThere is an excellent example offered within the proposed solution of how the app will function in practice, and it is therefore extremely easy to look through the broad descriptions and see exactly the use cases. There is a slight uncertainty, however. We do not really have too much information with regards to the status of this first module. Is it already built, did it gain any traction, does the AI function as needed, is it possible to scale it with limited computational resources? Perhaps a deeper dive into these issues would have offered additional comfort with regards to the project\u2019s feasibility, however I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to subtract stars only due to these aspects. \n\nThe project might also be financially sustainable, since it plans on charging a fee for its services. Of course this is a necessary approach, otherwise there would be significant risks of the app being overwhelmed by attack vectors (brute force at least), if lacking any kind of economic gatekeeping mechanism. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "At least within the challenge, the prospects for auditability are second to none. At first, we are being offered an extensive list of progress reports, which will be the responsibility of Profila: bi weekly updates, inclusion in Cardano newsletters, monthly Swarm sessions and also AMA sessions. \n\nThe proposal also includes a very clear and detailed list of deliverables: data entries, divided between training and testing parts, a concept selection approach (not very clear from the text what shape this will take) and a collection of extracted legal concepts. One question mark is whether at any point, the meaningfulness of the work will be validated through a human-led activity to judge the realized outcomes, either in full or at least on a sample basis. \n\nAn added functionality of the application is collecting user feedback on the perceived quality of the advice / information offered - and this is definitely another aspect in which the proposal shines, since having a feedback loop is perhaps the only way in which the functionality can be improved in the future. We are not being told whether this feedback could be made publicly available (at least in a summarized fashion) but at the very least it does exist and it has the potential to increase the project\u2019s auditability should it ever become publicly available.

In order to provide an advanced service, you show a match between the specific request and experts will be provided, in order to give a rapid and low-cost option to clarify the subject with a legal expert.

Here, we are proposing creating a source of legal documentation on Cardano, so that the community could query for brief, concise and useable answers. From what I understand, this proposal is about a platform that could collect additional laws relevant to people and entrepreneurs on Cardano (e.g. taxation, financial laws, corporate laws, etc), and feed them to our smart knowledge base. The advantage here is precisely that it would improve access to legal knowledge for the Cardano community. This can be seen through the excerpt: \u201cIt will be a repository of useful information for the Cardano community about financial and legal documents.\u201d I also think that the project fits well with the objectives of the challenge because the proponents explain that their solution will improve access to actual lawyers for people, without any retainers or large legal fees. They are building up a network of blockchain lawyers that will be able to give us understandable answers to our legal questions (not solved by the knowledge base automatically). We can see that the proponents are very aware of the possible problems that they will face during the project, and have already proposed a solution for this, which demonstrates a lot of maturity and planning. The only negative point I found here is that the proponents do not explain more information about AI technology that would be used in this project. Other than that, I think the idea is very good and deserves to be carefully evaluated for possible funding.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal does not have a roadmap. What we find here is an explanation (quite extensive) of what would need to be done, and what activities would be developed so that together they could compose the project as a whole. However, this is not the form of a timeline, there is no phase division or notion of time here. It would be necessary for the proponent to divide this work package into smaller parts, according to the 3 challenges of the project. Because the work package has already kicked off, as the proponents stated, the project will continue for the coming 3-6 months (July - December). But I think they would need to be associated with some notion of time: Description of work package (challenge 1) would last 2 months, for example, and would take place between July and August 2022. Ideally, these phases would consist of a list of tasks and each task should also be located in a specific month and informed how long it would take to complete. Though the authors promise that they will be able to show the results within as little as two or 3 months after receiving funding. Therefore, I disagree that there is a good visualization of the process here. It is explained what would be done, but not in an organized way, and is associated over time. Regarding the budget, in my opinion, the asking value is too high and not compatible with the project\u2019s needs, I think I could even agree better with this value if the parties had been explained, justifying the need for such an investment. For example, the additional budget required (7 thousand dollars) last 10 days of project management and reporting work would be for various things: coordinator calls, monthly reporting, newsletter updates, AMA sessions, townhall prep presentations, etc. I wonder how much would go for such a thing, and why? How many employees would there be? Likewise, the other parts could be better detailed, such as why the Hochschule Luzern would cost half the money (43.4 thousand dollars)? And finally, speaking of the team involved, I thought this part was good. We know the names, roles, and backgrounds of each team member. However, what worries me here is also the fact that we don\u2019t have any Cardano expert on the team, how do we know that someone knowledgeable about the subject will support the team, that information related to the Cardano ecosystem is real, up to date and reliable? Therefore, I think it would be essential for someone here to play this role, the team could partner with someone who has proven this knowledge.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The KPIs presented by the proponents is a great way to audit the proposal development process, as they are both quantitative (such as 2-weekly updates to other Cardano proposers via the Catalyst coordinator call) and qualitative (such as Quality evaluation - extracted concepts).

As well as the goals achieve so far, I think it is important that we have an idea of what the work routines of the professionals involved were like. Speaking of the final results, the authors claim that the first milestone in this project is the publication of their first paper - titled \"Privacy and Customer\u2019s Education: NLP for Information Resources Suggestions and Expert Finder Systems\". And the main metric used will be the meaningfulness of the proposed terminology, concerning the specificity of the legal domain.

If there is no clear rules and implications for every side people would be more hesitant to come to blockchain communities and implement these new technologies. Even before e-mails became more common, users were getting sick of the physical junk mail in their mail boxes. With the advancement of the technology, these junk mails became much more unbearable for the user. Even after it had been established that brands require user\u2019s consent send them these ads, this did not prevent these brands to send their ads almost as harassment. They are hiding their consent mechanisms from their customers and these customers do not know they are agreeing this; or even worse they have to give their consent to get service.\n\nThe team is already working on to take preventative measures for this problem with the support of the Swiss government. Preventing this spam ads is not a small feat, but informing the users about their rights is fairly easier. I believe that everything starts with the people\u2019s learning their rights. When more and more platforms surface within the blockchain community, these kinds of problems also will start to occur. If users know more about their rights, they can know easily what these companies can or cannot do with their data. However, as many people know that companies hide these consent forms behind a mountain of unnecessary information, it is very hard for users to know their rights. \n\nThis proposal tries to help with that problem. It might seem like it tries to solve a very small and specific problem but it is not the case. Teaching people their rights and advocating them if necessary should not be seen as a trivial matter. With that it definitely answers this challenge\u2019s main question.\n\nAt this point one can say \u2018how does this project help Cardano?\u2019. If this project is implemented properly I believe that it will help many users to know their rights and brands to tweak their legal documents in a good way. Within the Project Catalyst, there will be many start-ups and with their new technologies many new users.

Also since this project is going to be working with a team from a university they can easily get help for peer review. Using a GitHub repository and making it available to everyone can also be helpful. In here, they should have added a part where it says they will collect community feedback. They are planning to collect user feedback but until finding users to use the platform, they will need all the feedback they can get. Community meetings can be a way to collect feedback but they are planned as bi-weekly or monthly. Using a platform that people can come to give feedback on any part of the project can be more useful. Also they are saying that they can show some results just two or three months after funding, and they are planning to hold monthly meetings or updates. For a such short time period using monthly timetables can become a problem. With this logic they might create a product with 2 GitHub update and 2 KPI reporting.
