Establishing a bridge between blockchain projects and legal service providers can help projects gain a better understanding on how to comply with different jurisdictions and act in a more secure way. This proposal tackles a specific problem set in this challenge, however, it doesn\u2019t mention how it would benefit the Cardano ecosystem in a specific way. A brief explanation on the benefits this proposal would have for Cardano would be very helpful and useful. A defined roadmap on scalability would also help voters gain more insight on the future impact of this proposal. Well detailed elements, are the sustainable development goals.

When it comes to the team which would work on the \u201cone-stop shop for legal support\u201d, a more detailed explanation on the number of persons required to carry out different tasks would help the proposal gain more depth. Regarding the budget, this proposal has an in depth explanation on the specific amounts required for each specific task, and as someone who has a degree in Law and is working in a law firm in Europe, it does not seem unreasonable considering the goals it is trying to accomplish. In matters of project duration and time lapse, the proposers provide a defined roadmap and different objectives that will be worked on each month, perhaps stating which part of the team will work on the different areas would make the time lapse clearer, but overall, it is precise and well-structured.

How can you forecast the budget need if you first need to evaluated a headcount ?).\nIntegrate with BlockchaininBusiness.io (part of another proposal, so this is raising the risk of not being delivered if not funded ?).\nThe team also forecasts 2 months for building the dynamic path (conversational forms, reporting modules, app intefrace...) and 2 months for database population, data entry and validation of effectiveness of captured data. \nThis is unclear to me, I believe the presence of a database behind the app/Saas is a must, otherwise how can the app/Saas guide the user through the series of questions ?\nThe budget is quite accurate, although, based on my experience, I believe some of the items are underestimated, for example the creation of user interface will require more than 1000 dollars.\n\nThe team includes at least one experienced legal professionists which is very competent in the field of blockchain regulation.

One of the strongest aspects of this proposal is related to the project leaders, and it is because the team counts on 2 experienced people in taxing and legal frameworks.

From what I understand, the idea is that create an application that could guides entrepreneurs and businesses to internationally compliant legal services and structures relevant to Web3 Crypto Blockchain providers. This initiative also would be benefits Web3 Crypto Blockchain developers globally.

The app-building process involves many things, each of which should have been informed and detail. Talk about the budget, we know how the total amount would be divided into parts, but each of them could have been better explained. To cite the legal services: they ask 10 thousand dollars for this, it is a very high value, it would be important for us to understand exactly how long this process would take place and who would be in the line of forwarding here. Because they are high values, the more detail there is, the better. Without knowing exactly how many hours they will dedicate to the project, we have no idea of the value of their work hours. And finally, talking about the team, this part was great.

These are clear ways to see if the project is successful, but we need to go further. It would be very positive for us to do qualitative analysis, in addition to quantitative ones, so that we could more deeply measure the impact of this project on our blockchain. And about the process, it is not very clear how this information will reach the members of the Cardano community, how will these reports be shared with everyone? Are they posted on Google Drive, or Telegram and community discord channels? The proponent states that such information must be measured, but it is unclear how it would be shared with members of the Cardano community. Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is outlined with quite a specificity, so that we can verify that our goals have been achieved, as we can see from the following excerpt: \u201cthrough a unified seamless web experience, users will be able to gain a clear perspective on the best options for the location and regulatory oversight for their project; and have an understanding of the issues and legal requirements that may govern their ability to operate as planned.\u201d In this way, we can not only see if the goals were achieved but if what was promised to be done is being fulfilled in the right way and by the intended people.
