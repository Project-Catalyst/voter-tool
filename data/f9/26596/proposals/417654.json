I believe there is a poor fit between the proposal and the existing challenge, and I shall bring forth two main arguments. Here they are. \n\nFirst, for me it is not clear what advantages such a system would bring, compared to classical accounting systems. My background includes accounting / financial matters, and I can\u2019t really be accused of not being knowledgeable with the subject. I am however at a loss when trying to imagine the features and benefits of a Cardano - native, or rather any blockchain - native accounting system. What would such an accounting system have on top of a regular one, will it be on-chain, will it provide cryptographic proofs of entries performed, or generally how will it differentiate itself from any other accounting system? The proposal does not shed any light on these topics, it only states that \u201cwe will scope the needs of stakeholders, then architect and deliver an MVP which meets scoped needs\u201d. This is a clear case when the proposers\u2019 level of understanding of stakeholders\u2019s needs is still incipient, and a much better understanding of the needs has to be gained before proposing such an undertaking.\n\nSecond, accounting systems are by definition country / regime specific. Each institution has to obey a certain framework when doing its books, be it US GAAP / IFRS standards for large institutions, or simply the country-specific accounting / tax rules from the place it resides, in case of small and medium enterprises. How would a Cardano native system account for all of this, will it have country-specific modules, will it be fully customisable? Will you be able to change accounting practices, tax brackets, VAT systems, amortization schedules? Again, the proposal stays silent and there is no meaningful information regarding these aspects. \n\nConsidering all of the above, and taking into account the many questions unanswered with regards to the value proposition, I have to maintain a slightly negative stance towards this proposal\u2019s impact. ", "q0r": 2, "q1": "I see a rather poor feasibility for this project. First, there are major red flags with regards to the team\u2019s description. The proposer states that the team members are experienced, and we are being asked to go through the resumes posted on their website in order to have more details. When doing this, I was very surprised, and not in a good way, to see that although there are quite a few resumes posted there (five), their quality is simply very very poor. All the names are anonymised with black markers (so you can\u2019t really know the names of team members!) and the information within all of them is again unclear, ineligible, the formats are all different, they look like they have been scanned with very old equipment, and the information within is likewise. Very bizarre names of companies, awkward backgrounds and universities and little information that you can actually verify. Of course we are not being provided with any linkedin links or other references. I hate to be judgemental, but this is a major red flag for me, that in an open, decentralized system, a team chooses this anonymization path. \n\nIn a similar fashion, we are not offered any kind of information with regards to the timeline or the budget. For the budget we are only informed that the project would require 2.000 hours to complete, at an hourly rate of 50 USD/hour, without any other split between milestones, phases or anything else. Timewise, the scoping document would require one month to complete, the architecture another month, development and testing would end by month five, and in the sixth month we would be delivered the MVP. Again, a very poor level of detail regarding the entire project. \n\nFor an excellent proposal I would have expected to see: \n\n- full names for the team and appropriate resumes\n- a better level of detail with regards to the product. How will the scoping document be performed, who will be the stakeholders interviewed? What will be the split of hours between the phases of the project, and how will quality be measured?\n- a pre-existing github library with past projects\n- a real timeline, with milestones, deadlines", "q1r": 2, "q2": "A similar level of detail is present within all the auditability sections. The proposer states that the product will have four modules; general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable and audit reporting, but not much else. For an excellent proposal I would have expected to see: \n\n- full transparency of the team behind the proposal\n- already opened communication channels: Discord, Telegram, Twitter\n- a commitment to open-source development\n- a commitment to have at least monthly development reports and regular AMA sessions \n- a pledge to participate in weekly town halls and organize break-out rooms\n\nLacking any of these items, I can only be neutral towards the auditability prospects of this proposal.

Only four stars because it is not clear from the proposal [IMPACT] responses how funded projects will be able to access CERP for Catalyst. \n\nWill they just be launching a docker ready open source code that projects will need to deploy? Will they be launching a smart contracts along with parameterized integration code? Will there be a sass product? How exactly will it be \"infinitely scalable?\" Who are these mystery \"stakeholders\" ? The answers to these questions will heavily affect the impact of this project. \n\nThe proposal identifies one main risk and as a sound mitigation strategy.

What are the technical aspects (architecture, software stack, technologies, will you integrating existing apis)? Perhaps \"communicating with stakeholders to scope requirements\" would have been a worthwhile pre-proposal activity. Without more details about the work, the community has no way of gauging its feasibility. What happens if after scoping requirements we learn that 100K is not enough? \n\nSame thing for budget, who are these stake holders and how can the community access the budget if it is \"subject to stakeholder requirements feedback?\" If there is so many unknowns, how did we come up with 2000 hours? \n\nThe proposal has identify a main risk of shortage of funding. The mitigation solution of delivering a MVP and applying for more funding is an unreasonable risk for the community. It would be better to scope out the project to be able to draft a complete proposals that numerates what funded proposal can expect from this solution.  What can we expect from the MVP?\n\nThe proposal has provided profession background information. It also directs people to their website with full CVs of additional team members. Many of the CVs have redacted information like name, and current employer. Seems like a link to linkedIn profile or CVs specifically for this proposal (linked directly in the proposal) would have been less confusing. With current employer redacted how can the community audit those references?", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal does not provide any details about how it plans to measure track progress (project management) internally, nor does it provide any direction of where the Cardano community can go to follow along. Will you be posting weekly or monthly development updates somewhere? Will there be a public kanban or other board? gitbook, notion, medium, or equivalent updates?\n\nThe the proposal has four high level features listed as their definition of success. Would have love to see some more complete sentences with verb to help the community audit the success of the proposal. How does the community test or audit the general ledger? What should they be able to do?\n\nWould have also like to see the proposal's defintion of success be tied directly back to the challenge's definition of success so the community can audit that the thing being delivered is the thing asked for in the challenge.

The proposers have submitted four proposals in Fund 9, one to build the main system (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417652), two to train developers for it in Asia (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/417653) and Africa (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420496), and this one to deliver ERP functions for Catalyst.\n\nThere is little question that the complex tasks of Catalyst will require increasingly sophisticated management tools over time. Indeed, there is widespread dissatisfaction with the capabilities of Ideascale. However, it seems fairly unlikely that a brand new ERP system will be able to take over these functions effectively in a way that existing tools cannot deliver. Notably, the proposal indicates a plan to deliver only General Ledger, Accounts Payable (with COTI Pay integration), Funds/Revenue receipts and Financial/Audit Reporting functions, subject to confirmation with Cardano stakeholders.\n\nOverall, I salute the ambition of this team with this ambitious idea. If successful, it would be an important application in the Cardano ecosystem. It also fits the scope of this challenge to introduce financial and legal implementations to Cardano. However, because of the extremely broad scope, which also produces that very significant implementation challenges discussed below, I agree but do not strongly agree that the proposal effectively addresses the challenge. It would be more appropriate for the proposers to begin with a narrower proposal to scope an ERP system and build focused components of it.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team on this proposal appears to have extensive experience as ERP consultants. However, they do not identify significant experience with software development, and this is a large software development project for which they are seeking over $600K in funding across their four proposals.\n\nNotwithstanding those large funding requests, this funding appears unlikely to be sufficient to build a complete ERP system, even one with the somewhat limited initial scope identified in the proposal. More important, there is virtually no development plan articulated. Among other things, there is no indication what platforms will be used, what programming languages, etc. No specification is provided except the four expected capabilities noted above, with the proposers stating that they will \u201ccommunicate with stakeholders to scope requirements\u201d. Running a development effort of this magnitude requires more than this, as I have learned as a CEO and executive of organizations building software applications.\n\nThere is also no detailed budget breakdown, simply an allocation of 100 hours to scoping and 1900 hours to implementation, at the reasonable rate of $50/hour.\n\nThe main proposal also states that the proposed system will involve the \u201ctokenization of everything\u201d, which would require deep integration with the Cardano blockchain. There is no explanation of how this is planned to occur. There is also no explanation why it would make sense to store all of the data of an enterprise on chain \u2013 much of this will presumably be private information that would not obviously benefit from tokenization (or if there is a benefit, it should be further explained). It should be noted that this proposal will apparently not have adequate resources to succeed unless the main proposal is funded.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I disagree that the information presented indicates that the proposal is highly likely to be delivered effectively. Given the ambition of this project, it would seem more reasonable to me for the proposers to start with a proposal to define a structure for the proposed ERP system based upon technical investigation and stakeholder discussions. The proposers explain that they have refined their proposal based upon input received on a previous proposal in Fund 8. I would encourage them to keep engaged and further refine the proposal in Fund 10.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "The proposers define success in terms of delivery of expected functions for General Ledger, Accounts Payable (with COTI Pay integration), Funds/Revenue receipts and Financial/Audit Reporting. For a development project which is based upon delivery of specific features, it is reasonable to define success in terms of delivery of those features.\n\nHowever, because of the lack of a detailed project plan, it will be difficult to track progress towards these features.

The model of this project fit this challenge, per my analyst of the project. The central idea underpinning the project is to support and help streamline the current auditing structure deployed by the catalyst community for proposals. In view of this, the proposer presents a more inclusive target audience for the project, namely: the Catalyst Fund audit committee, Cardano Community, and Catalyst Fund recipients. But I prefer a more detailed outlooks of the Cardano ERP that highlights the distinctive features of Cardano ERP which gives it an edge over the existing systems. According to scripts,the main objective here \u2014 to ensure that the Cardano system allow for easy and transparent integrated auditing, tracking, and reporting of funded projects. I appreciate that this project offers the opportunity to scale up the adoption of blockchain based solution and also enhance the auditing process within the ecosystem. However, I suggest the proposer provide more perspective on the key features that gives maximum benefit to the Catalyst fund auditing committee, to the community and to the recipient of fund in the auditing processes. The team suggests that by this project, it will address the need to get accountants and lawyers into the Cardano & Catalyst space. But, how would this be achieved? Clearly there is a need for a clarity on how this project would benefit both direct and indirect stakeholders within the ecosystem.

Given the ambitious nature of this project, I am satisfied with the overall profile of the team. More important is the profile of Gopakumar T. Nair, very precise and detailed with attached link that confirms his expertise and his existing projects. In that regard, I would have wish R \u201cJay\u201d Jackson attached links or reference to complement his profile. Apart from that, with the designation of roles to each team member, we know what each team member would be doing. Additionally, the framework designed for the roadmap is not only simplified but also shows a clear scope of work for the team and the expected activities for each specified timeframe along the roadmap. Finally on the budget, the information presented is very generic. There isn\u2019t a detailed breakdown of the budget. For instance, items like develop the ERP, testing of ERP, architect and MVP are all items that has their separate market value. Therefore, for a more transparent, understanding and accurate budget, I suggest the team redesign the budget to reflect a more detailed budget breakdown of each item.

Based on the aforementioned, I think what's presented here are just functionalities that comes with this project but not solid KPIs. Therefore, the aforementioned points shows little alignment with the objective of the projects. For a more concrete and precise parameter to measure the project\u2019s performance, KPIs like the number of proposals that was audited successfully using the Cardano ERP model, the feedback from the Cardano community and proposers on the use of Cardano EPR tool and the number of businesses that adopt the EPR tool.

The project stakeholders will be the Catalyst Fund audit committee, Cardano Community, and Catalyst Fund recipients.

The proposal is a good solution. Catalyst-sponsored projects developed on the Cardano ecosystem will have high transparency, increase credibility, and attract people to join the Cardano community.

Finally, in my opinion, it is recommended to add a module to store smart contract/transaction numbers for comparison and lookup. The score for impact is 3.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "Praise them for having a specific action plan. Proposed implementation period totaling 6 months: Stakeholder consultation on scope requirements (January); Architect (February), develop (May), test (May) and launch MVP (June). The timeline is pretty good. The proposal is successful when its MVP is used by the Cardano community, Catalyst Fund recipients, and the Catalyst Fund audit committee. The question here is \"Is your goal that the proposals funded at Fund 9 will use MVP?\". This is a big number, and it's really not easy to do in 6 months. But if it does, this is a really good proposition. However, I and the community do not know where to check the progress and results of the project because they do not mention it. In terms of budget, the fundraising budget accounted for 20% of the total challenge. A budget has a specific spending plan. There is no budget for communication, marketing, and additional budget estimates. These are two important expenses. Their fundraising budget is quite high, but they have not fully calculated all the costs that need to be paid. This is a minus. Regarding the group, their group consists of 2 members. Praise them for having specific tasks assigned to each member and putting their experience in line with the assigned work. However, there is no affiliated address like LinkedIn so that the community can verify the identity and experience and qualifications of members. The proposal still has a number of issues that need to be clarified and resolved. Therefore, the feasibility is not high.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "They do not provide any metrics to measure the success of the project. For example, how many projects will they attract to use this service? How are the projects evaluated after using the service? How does the community objectively assess the quality of the project? And in particular, the community is not really easy to check the quality of their services. I understand that a successful project will drive adoption and improve product ownership. It will address the need to attract accountants/auditors to the Cardano & Catalyst Ecosystem and provide direct access to financial services provisioning solutions, as well as support and guidance for the emerging projects in the Catalyst Ecosystem. The success of the project is related to the challenge. But they need transparency and publicity for the report to be more convincing. Because the issue of transparency in the use of funds is a matter of concern to the Cardano community. At the same time, this is a new proposal that has not been tested before.", "q2r": 1, "assessor": "z_assessor_3950", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 2, "ng": 2, "nfo": 1, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14628, "q0": "The project was created to solve the problem there is currently no intelligent, open-source Cardano-native accounting/auditing system. CERP will be an intelligent open-source Cardano-native accounting/auditing system for Catalyst, consisting of GL, COTI Pay integration, funds/revenue receipts modules, and financial/audit reports. Cardano ERP for Catalyst will be a Cardano-native open-source accounting/auditing system. A native Cardano system will make integrated auditing, tracking, and reporting of funds projects simple and transparent. The Catalyst Fund audit committee, Cardano Community, and Catalyst Fund recipients will be project stakeholders.\nThe proposer has provided a list to include the expected core modules, but there is no in-depth technical explanation. I recommend the proposer to add other professional content, such as what algorithm the project will be built on, or what kind of programming language will be used, the addition of the above information is very important and critical to the technical success of the project. In addition, the addition of case studies should also be considered because the proposer does not provide a specific example.\nIf the project is successful, it will address the need to bring accountants and lawyers into the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystems, as well as provide direct access to solutions that provide financial and legal services, as well as help and direction to new Catalyst ecosystem enterprises. And the above content is aligned with challenges. However, the proposer does not have specific key metrics including expected numbers and timelines for project implementation.\nProposer describes the only risk as the lack of funds to complete the project. In my opinion, the proposer has confused risk and problem. The funding shortfall was at the heart of the project's original problem, and it could be solved by the requested funds. Listing a detailed budget plan, along with a contingency list can completely solve this problem. In addition, I suggest that the proposer pay attention to other risks such as audit/tax / legal related activities if the project is implemented.", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The project is expected to be completed in 6 months. The proposer provided a to-do list but didn't have a detailed timeline to track the progress of the above tasks. It is difficult to understand how the team will evaluate the work if the proposer does not have a detailed description of this. Therefore, I propose the proposer supplement this section with the following contents: work content, starting time, expected completion time, who will be responsible for the evaluation of that content, etc. The above content is extremely necessary to ensure the quality and progress of the project.\nBesides, the list of budget allocations is not detailed, the proposer only lists generalities, and there is no specific plan to use the budget. In which, the total project time is estimated at 2000 hours, with the amount spent for 1 hour being $50. So the total budget is $100,000. $5000 for scope & document requirements and $95,000 for architect, develop, test & deliver MVP. I found this to be a major shortcoming of the project because of the content in the risk resolution section, the proposer identified that the only risk was the lack of funds to complete the project, but the team did not establish a detailed budget sheet. I recommend that the proposer re-add this content in as much detail as possible.\nI noticed that the two co-founders of this project are both experts in the fields of technology and finance, and they have many years of experience working in the multinational technology world. This will be a good factor to help create a solid foundation for the project. However, some information is still missing regarding the associates who will work with the two founders throughout the project.", "q1r": 2, "q2": "Proposer does not provide key performance indicators for the objects mentioned in the Auditability content such as general ledger, accounts payable, funds/revenue receipts, and financial/audit reporting. Besides, the team also did not specify a specific time to start the project. It is difficult to judge the success indicators of a project based on the information the proposer has provided. I propose that the proposer redesign a roadmap that fully shows the contents such as the job description, specific date/month to be implemented, and required results of that content.\nFinally, the success of the project is considered as Cardano ERP for Catalyst will exist as a minimum viable product of the scoped modules and will be utilized by the Cardano Community, Catalyst Fund recipients, and the Catalyst Fund audit committee.", "q2r": 2, "assessor": "z_assessor_4076", "no_vca": 4, "ne": 1, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 14692, "q0": "Cardano ERP for Catalyst will be an open-source Cardano-native accounting/auditing system after the project. So there are two points focused on the project: the accounting and auditing system is straightforward to the vision of the Cardano development team, and the current Blockchain technology needs to be developed to the next level. Besides that with your deep experience in general development and development for ERP systems I believe the project will be absolutely possible. I agree that this project aligns with the challenge and can promote adoption and improve product ownership. It will address the need to get accountants and lawyers into the Cardano & Catalyst Ecosystem. And also provide direct access to solutions about financial and legal services as well as support and guidance to emerging projects in the Catalyst. Plus, this service Ecosystem Cardano ERP for Catalyst can be infinitely scalable and able to be used anywhere in the world. But as you said because of a shortage of funding we will have additional proposals for a final product. So I would like to know more about funding that is making use of these new solutions and services and how many of these new implementations are mutualistic to the project in the additional proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "During the timeline of 6 months, you have shown exactly the plan for each month. But I think it will make sense with more detailed information for each step and what work needs to complete every month. You divided the budget into 2 parts: Scope and document requirements, Architect, develop, test, and deliver MVP. But I want to know how to calculate the budget for each step actually each month.
