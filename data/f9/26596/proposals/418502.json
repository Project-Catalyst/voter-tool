Each project has a different tool and executes in a different way.

In concrete terms, the proposers wish to create a smart contract dapp designed to automatically disburse ADA following certain conditions.  \n\nThis is definitely a very nice feature to have in the not-so-near future, when the Catalyst system will be fully decentralized. However, as it is now the case, this function is still performed by IOG staff, and it is rather a manual process, for good reasons, probably the most important one being that behind every ADA payment to proposers there is at least a proof of life mechanism in order to weed out potentially bad actors. As well as the general reporting that definitely acts as a checks and balances mechanism to make sure that proposers actually deliver on their promises before receiving all the funds. \n\nAnother point worth mentioning is that this proposal has already been submitted in fund 7, but was unfortunately not funded. One of the excellent assessments of that proposals already mentions in great detail the problem highlighted by me as well - the fact that the function is performed by IOG, and also the fact that it is likely that IOG is already working on a solution, and the team should definitely double-check with them before embarking (again) on this quest. I feel that it is a massive missed opportunity that the team does not mention this topic in this proposal: have they or have they not interacted with IOG between fund 7 and now? If yes, we should have been told. If not, it\u2019s just a sign that they could perhaps do their homework better in the future. \n\nHence, with these two caveats (1 - that there are no near-term plans for decentralizing this treasury function and 2 - that we are still not informed of any collaboration with IOG), there is nevertheless a case to be made by the proposers. But given the expected long term horizon on which this project would become useful, I am only offering three stars in the impact section. ", "q0r": 3, "q1": "The team is in a good position to deliver on this proposal. They are a stake pool operator, are part of the Plutus pioneer program and have received funding from as far as fund 6. They seem to be a two-person team, and they do an excellent job at presenting themselves within the proposal: we are being offered several social media profiles for each and bullet points of their expertise and background. A great addition to this proposal would have been perhaps a listing of all the funding received as well as the status of their ongoing projects or any deliverables already finalized, since we would have been in a much better position to judge the quality of their work done and hence the feasibility of this proposal. \n\nTimewise, the project would take six months to complete, and the proposal offers sufficient intermediary milestones. For example, after two months we would have the research part of the project already established, with the aim to find out and map the current status of Catalyst funding, which most likely would involve an ongoing dialogue with the IOG team, as well as identification of best paths forward to automate the processes. After four months the smart contracts would be ready to be run on the test net and there would be a bug bounty program put in place to identify possible errors. \n\nThe budget is only lightly sketched and is set out on a monthly basis for each of the devs involved (one devops and one dapp architect) with a bit of project management set aside. I think a great addition to this proposal would have been for instance if hourly rates and estimations of the necessary hours were provided for each of the milestones, since I find it unlikely that they will devote their full time exclusively for this project for such a long period of time. And again, this topic had already been highlighted by a previous assessment, and we are not seeing any improvement whatsoever, which is the second indication that the team needs to do their homework a bit better. \n\nGiven all the flags highlighted above, I can only offer three stars for this proposal\u2019s feasibility.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The auditability section of the proposal is very light, and we are rather being offered a detailed roadmap within - which is still good information but perhaps not positioned in the best possible place. There is also no pledge to offer monthly progress reports towards the community - again, a rather standard expectation and approach for most of the excellent Catalyst proposals funded. It is again a missed opportunity to capitalize on already provided feedback from the community from previous rounds and come back with a much stronger value proposition and an increased case for auditability and transparency. Sadly this is not the case, and I have to subtract one star at this chapter due to this situation.

Here they are proposing that the disbursement process to all Cardano members of funded proposals is very manual and time-consuming. It can lead to delays in project development time. The idea is that change this funding using smart contracts. Monthly payment of funded proposal can be released to an address of a smart contract. Based on pre-set conditions these ADAs will be distributed to the member's wallets. This condition usually includes information such as Time, completion schedule, and the number of votes of shareholders. From what I understand, this proposal is about a financial service that helps the proposer, project manager, and accountants in paying project costs to each member. The advantage here is that by sharing the smart-contract template with the community, other project owners can verify each line of code and apply smart-contract to their projects. So I think the project fits well with the objectives of the challenge because the proponent explains that the Dapp, which is designed to send ADA under certain pre-set conditions, will allow easy scaling with the number of projects increasing after each fund. Dapp also enables fast disbursement, easy audit, and enables transparency of decisions. Other than that, I think the impact of the proposal has the potential to be maximum.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proponent explains in a detailed and extensive way what would be done in this project, however, I think the roadmap is not clear in the sense of being able to visualize the activities well. For example, the activities would last 6 months, which are listed in the topics. Ideally, we would know what happens in each month of this time interval. I think we managed to understand very well what would be done and in what way, just this visualization of temporality is not safe, so I would say that the script is good, but it needs to improve. And because there are many activities, it is a little difficult to define where one would start ad another would end. The budget (63,900 dollars) is very well explained, the proponent divides the total amount into several parts so that we can understand clearly the need for this money even though I think that a very high amount is requested. We know what the value of the hour of work would be, but it would be even more interesting if, for example, it determined their working day, that is, how many days a week and for how many hours a day they would work (certainly I also saw the google doc link that was attached but it is not what I concern). The part of Budget for Marketing, in my opinion, could be better detailed. What will the marketing campaign look like? What is the marketing strategy? Finally, speaking of the team, I think this part is very good because all the necessary information is provided so that we can understand who we are dealing with. We know the names of the professionals involved, as well as a summary of their professional assignments and their LinkedIn profile, Github, and email. This gives a lot of confidence in the team. Therefore, I think the feasibility is already good, with only a few points to improve.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Project auditability is good, although not perfect. We can work here on two things: the development process and the final result. Regarding the development process, it is said that progress would be measured based on completed tasks. From what I understand, the objective here is the complete development of the project, in addition to some quantitative goals such as collecting feedback and updating the Bug Bounty program; providing a tool to help the community automatically distribute wages to project team members, which would help fund managers less work, they can focus more on the business. Indeed, we must know the project process, but I also think it is important that we know what these numerical facets and the qualitative impact of the whole thing were.

Projects eligible for funding are not few.\n  and if your provided Dapp can integrate projects to calculate the number of proposals funded in each round to facilitate monitoring and disbursement according to the plan, the team needs to explain more about the problem. This topic is more specific.\n   In addition to the risks proposed by the team, if I would like to advise one possible risk is: what tools will the team use to verify the completed work of difficult-to-identify proposals such as: education, or only based on the conditions of the smart contract, if only using the confirmation of the conditions of the smart contract will be difficult to identify the community development proposals, and there may be fraud in the declaration of the conditions. of smart contracts.

Currently funded projects lack financial support tools for implementation, each project has a different tool and implements it differently. These tools are in a state of being used manually only by project managers. Project Catalyst is a long-term project that with the status of disbursement to all staff of the grant proposal team is very manual and very time-consuming, it affects the development of the project. With these difficulties, the proposed team has come up with a solution to build smart contracts to support smart monthly payments more easily. Therefore, I think the problem raised by the group is completely reasonable and suitable for this challenge.\nBy changing the funding source using this smart contract, the monthly payment of the proposal is transferred to the address of this smart contract, from the pre-set conditions, the money will be poured into the wallets of the members. I think this solution completely solves the problem that the projects are experiencing. It is not only a solution for project owners, proponents, project managers, and accountants to pay project costs for each member. It can also verify each line of code and apply smart contracts to their projects. For the members who receive money from the project it will also be clear and transparent, they can actively monitor it.\nI agree with the team's output that we cannot foresee the risks in building this smart contract, we can only face them when making the transition from the public mechanism current to smart contracts.

However, what I and the community both see is that the budget level that the team is calling for this fund is higher than the previous fund, while the previous fund has also been over-budgeted, which leads to the project not being invested. So if we continue to stay at this fund if the budget is more, will the project be invested or not, should the community put in the effort to support the project?\nThe group of people involved in this project is people with competence and experience in information technology, from LinkedIn references and their information pages, which is enough for us to believe in their ability to work on this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposal team shows us the project's progress as measured by the completed tasks each month, with this doing the work measurement closely.
