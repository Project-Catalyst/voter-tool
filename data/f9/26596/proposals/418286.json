The proponent states that managing money for others without a special license is illegal in many jurisdictions. A legal structure is needed to avoid fines and create conditions for conflict resolution. And the idea here is create a verified blueprint of how to set up an investment fund to manage money for up to 50 individuals in compliance with KYC and AML regulations. Therefore, I think that the idea aligns well with the objectives of the challenge. And, obviously, the other pillar of this proposal, which is setting up an Investment fund, accept money from others via crypto or fiat bank transfers, and manage the investments in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem in compliance with the law and a crypto-friendly jurisdiction, would be fully achieved, since the delivering a tested blueprint with the legal framework of setting up investment funds to invest in Cardano tokens and the DeFi ecosystem. For these reasons, I think the proposal deserves maximum marks in this regard.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "All parts of the feasibility are ideas. Starting with the script, it is well divided into 2 phase with several activities that would take place in certain periods of time are listed. It is possible to understand quite solidly the entire development process from the information given. For example, we know in great detail all the information we would need to know to understand if the proposal is in good hands, how the development process would be done and how the requested money would be used. Speaking of the script, the activities are divided by weeks, and in these time intervals we have very specific notion of what would happen and how. That is, the level of detail is fully satisfactory. Talking about the budget, a value of $ 39,857 is requested, it is not cheap, but this proposal is quite technical and will require a lot of effort and time from highly qualified professionals, so I think it is justifiable because such an amount is necessary. We know what each part would compose. However, we don\u2019t know how many hours per week the professionals would dedicate to the project, so it is not possible to calculate the price of their working hours, nor are the activities they would develop in detail explained. Finally, speaking of the team, I don\u2019t see anything to criticize on the part of the team, the professionals are presented in a complete way, with many details, we know their names, professional resumes and previous experiences, so we can know them very well and trust them. So I think the feasibility is very good, just a few things need to be improve.  ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Like the two previous topics, this one is very good. It provides a lot of information and detailing it in great depth. The proponent points to many KPIs that can serves as ways to measure progress, small advances, partial results. I believe it is totally possible to audit this proposal safely, we have many goals to be achieved KPIs, numbers we want to achieve and all kinds of coverage we need so that monitoring in this part is safe. About success, the degree of detail as rich as the previous part. I think everything is in order, we have enough material to audit the project. Therefore, I think both the auditability of the process and the results are perfectly contemplated, with the maximum score being more than deserved in this part of the proposal.

I think the idea is really good and valuable, but honestly, I feel like this might be slightly too small of a vision for what this challenge has in mind. It will create a legal framework for a financial purpose, but that purpose may not be sufficiently broad to provide meaningful solutions for other projects. Sure, there are people looking to start investing funds, but this does not help any other proposal, or future project.  That is my own thought, but others likely feel differently. The proposal is detailed, and offers a good rationale for its impact.

It\u2019s not uncommon nowadays that listed companies and Sovereign wealth funds have exposure in crypto assets and crypto exchanges. As per proposal, there is clearly a gap for retail investors VS. professional money managers both in term of knowledge and tools at disposal. To avoid legal pitfall of managing fund and invest in DeFi protocols, this proposal will document and test a blueprint to set up the legal structure (investment fund) of up to 50 individuals that comply with KYC and AML regulations. The proposer will go through the whole cycle from setting up a fund to invest in ADA/DJED liquidity pool and then verify with lawyer that this was in line with the regulation. The proposer has narrowed down the jurisdiction of choice (Gibraltar) in the form of private fund (with the possibility of upgrading to Experienced Investor fund (EIF) after a year). The proposal fits the challenge well as the blueprint would explore and provide legal & financial services and support to funded proposers. The reason I give 4 stars is due to the fact that threshold for setting up investment fund (also mentioned in the feasibility part of proposal) is around $40,000 ($30k set up fee and $10k annual)  which is still quite high for individuals who want to manage money for friends and families.) As such, this might not be a viable solution for funded proposers. As for the delay incurred from dealing with various parties, the proposer can mitigate this risk as the preliminary discussion with the contacts has already been established.

His skill in dealing with regulators and lawyers in setting up financial organization would be put into good use at this project.
