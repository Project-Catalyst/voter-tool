Both in commitment, long term impact, value and importance. Let me try to explain. \n\nThe proposal aims to \u2019build a Web3 education DAO with participants from Cardano\u2019s ecosystem in order to develop, modify and test DAO-tools.\u2019\nWada.org is one of the most well-known actors in the Cardano ecosystem, with experience of numerous collaborations with the most influential \u2019forces\u2019 up to date, and has on-boarded more than 10 000 people since inception. As stated in the challenge brief, there are not many developed tools (that are tried and tested) tied to DAOs on Cardano, and this is something that this proposal addresses. As teaching is my active profession, I am slightly biased to this viewpoint but I sincerely agree with the proposer that education is key when building strong foundations, inventions and communities. Web3 is currently in its infancy, but will probably won\u2019t be in this stage for long, and letting students/entrepreneurs in Africa access high quality learning material along with vibrant communities and opportunities for realizing ideas, has the potential of changing a lot of peoples lives. The educational focus will be broad in scope, allowing on-boarded people to choose their path of involvement in Cardano (as proposers in Catalyst or attending the Plutus Pioneer program, for example) as a next step after coming in contact with this project as a first (or second) step.\n\nThe outreach, multi-faceted expertise and established community/collaborations of the proposer has the potential to greatly affect the growth of people participating in the Cardano Ecosystem (positively), and hopefully evolve them into being contributors themselves. As far as I understand, this will be an explorative project to build a strong foundation for DAO-toolkits, while educating people on the complex nature of DAO-related topics. This first stage is focused on educational outreach and onboarding (as stated in the proposal), but the proposal also includes details of a long-term plan with plenty of additional goals (such as funding tools, , curriculum development, content creation, knowledge management, archival tools, tools for identity, records and credentialing, etc). \n\nFrom my experience in research, it is my opinion that one of the strongest aspects of the proposer is the already established network of collaborations, and the intention of continued collaboration with organizations both within and outside of the Cardano Ecosystem. Perspective is imperative when creating basically anything, and it will also mitigate potential risks of failure having lots of different viewpoints of the same object/topic (As the proposer mention under risk management).  \n\u2028In short, I believe that (based on the information contained in the proposal) that this proposal will involve many different communities and collaborations, the potential growth of the project will increase the amount of value connected to the building and usage of this DAO-tooling and structure, it also has the potential of making Cardano-DAOs the most attractive to use (due to its innovative but thorough nature of operations). It is intended to be an integral part of all of Wadas operations, which would provide a quite substantial impact. Overall, I strongly agree that this proposal effectively addresses this challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The core team of this proposal are well known and trusted actors of the Cardano Ecosystem, and their competence, commitment and loyalty has been proven many times over. This is my 4th round as a Proposal assessor, and their names have been present consistently with each fund. From proposal, to collaboration, to completion. Mercy\u2019s (coordination lead) 25+ years of experience in project management alongside having experience as Catalyst Circle representative (CCv3) for funded proposers, AND having ample experience as proposer only speaks a fraction of how much time and energy that has been spent within the Cardano Ecosystem. The technological responsibility of the core team is managed by a person (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric) that is a Haskell and Plutus trainer in Wada and Gimbalabs Education programs, a relatively rare (The number of Plutus devs is still relatively low in comparison to those working with other languages) and thus valuable skill to have when working on Cardano. On the plus side he also has perspective from his experience as a Stakepool operator. \nSteve lockheart (another core team member) has experience of Catalyst since the beginning, part of Gimbalabs and have had proposals funded. And to be fair, every proposal should have a dog owner included. (Made me smile while reading through the proposal). \nWe can find information on team members and their experience on the listed LinkedIn-profiles and Wada.org, the official website. (Included in the proposal)\nWorth mentioning is the impressive list of active collaborations that Wada has, all massive actors in the Catalyst Ecosystem (Gimbalabs, Catalyst Swarm, Catalyst School, Quality assurance DAO, Littlefish Foundation, etc). \n\nThe roadmap provided is set on a timeframe of 6 months, divided in three stages. The first half being focused on research and careful planning of the design and on-boarding new community members (target number to reach, 1000). The second half will focus on development and adaptations of the tools at hand. The proposers address the need to take a thorough and measured approach when creating the foundational design of tokenomics, governance etc, since they want to avoid the risk of being exclusionary to their demographic and create a strong foundation for the platform. In my personal opinion, addressing this fact in this approach rhymes well on the way Cardano usually operates. Slow, steady and thorough wins the race. There is a risk of workload management and projects not being completed, considering that Wada is very involved in numerous projects already. This is addressed by limiting each project manager to 3 funded proposals each, to ensure the completion of the project. In my experience as a recurring PA, not many proposals choose to include this type of workload mitigation, so that lends me to believe that the proposer has a strong commitment in seeing this project through. \n\nThe budget breakdown provided is detailed and covers everything from developer costs, event costs, outreach of DAO members and contributors, coordination, marketing and documentation (for a total cost of 75 000 USD). I consider this to be a relatively small amount (7.5% of the total challenge budget), for developing DAO-tools that might permeate   the whole DAO-ecosystem of Cardano, while on-boarding new members into the ecosystem. If I would make a suggestion in regards to the budget, I would ask for including an estimation of the amount of work hours for each team member and responsibility. In this way it will be easier to measure the workload against their commitments to other projects and commitments. Also adding some clarifications, for example if the developer will be working three months full time or not. Due to the reasons listed above, I strongly agree that it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As mentioned briefly before, the roadmap is clear with milestones included, set on a timeframe of 6 months. It also includes not only what is planned for this proposal, but also for the future add-ons and expansions. The proposer also is transparent in sharing that this proposal is built on previous successes, and is linked to another proposal of this fund (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422031). (Comment: this is currently my 14th assessed proposal for this fund, and no proposer has been transparent with linked or independent proposals so far). \nFor transparency\u2019s sake, I support the idea of involving Edify CoLabs to value the future DAO platform, although the proposer lists the reason for it being to assess funding sustainability. \n\nThe team lists KPIs that are broad in scope and all relevant to act as measurements of success. Number of participants reached, number of participants that choose to involve themselves further (and how/where), using user satisfaction surveys, measuring event attendees, long term attendance (how many are still on the platform after 66 months?)\nAnd number of DAOs that are using the education tools after one year of implementation. I would deem all of these highly relevant to assess the implementation of this proposal. \u2028Considering that the team are part of a very active organization both within and outside Catalyst, it will be no issue of following their updates (and communicating with them) on their official social media platforms, and official website. I might be missing something (and correct me if I\u2019m wrong) but I haven\u2019t got additional ideas on how to improve this proposal. After reading it through multiple times, I can only say I\u2019m excited for the potential development and creation of a good foundation for DAOs on Cardano. I strongly agree that this proposal provides me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining its stated goals.

Based on my understanding, the proposer has a model that is sustainable as it invests in DAO creation tools that allow for network incentives and encourages human behaviors in a way that can accelerate our readiness for the DAO governance phase of public blockchains that the campaign briefing rightly highlights as an important and likely next phase. Incentivizing human behavior and distributing Cardano DAO toolsets to community members in Africa is a critical stepping stone towards achieving the greater goals of Cardano.

The budget is outlined sensibly, and broken down into identifiable terms, with realistic timelines, all of which are reasonable to achieve the set goals. , and evidence of network effects. The proposal clearly explains the technical aspects of the project, and I find those details to be the most exciting. \n\nAlthough the five regional events can be categorized as event planning, I do wonder why the proposer decided to itemize this as an entirely separate category to community outreach efforts. However, this is a small detail that actually makes it easier for the community to assess the feasibility of the proposal. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provides assessors with sufficient elements to measure its progress in attaining its stated goals.

The proposal suggests the construction of a DAO that is totally focused on financing and benefiting the education of young people in relation to Cardano's technologies. Without education, there is no progress, and we know how difficult it is in Africa to have access to basic rights such as education, depending on the location. The project aligns itself with this challenge as well as with \u201cGrow Africa, Grow Cardano\u201d; since, at the same time that it will found a new DAO, it will also promote profit for the inhabitants of the continent. Once they learn and know about the different aspects of our ecosystem, they can generate extra income, either as PAs or working directly in the proposal teams.

In my view, it would have been more appropriate if the proponents had made a shorter time division. A table with the division of values \u200b\u200bis attached to the scope of the proposal, I think it is possible for us to understand well how this money would be divided, but there could be more detail in some parts.
