This DAO would sell art to the Cardano community and allow the community to provide advice on how to ultimately approach city council to argue the merits of legalizing cannabis. Indeed, cannabis is not illegal everywhere. There has been legislation allowing it's use passed in many places. It might be helpful if the proposer compared this approach to what they are proposing and assessing which path might have more of an impact with their regional lawmakers. The proposer hopes that they spark discussion of the legalization of cannabis and supposes that it is a taboo subject, however this is not true as cannabis is legalized in many places and there are quite a few blockchain/NFT projects that embrace that theme.  The proposer also compares the acronym DAO to Tao - of the Taoist spiritual belief meaning \"the way\", a universal principle that underlies everything. Using something in ways other than they were intended is fine; you could use a chair as a table to hold a plant or perhaps as a art piece if you wanted to, but you could argue that it might have a bit more impact if it is used for sitting - the purpose it was created for. Recommend that instead of a DAO of one, the proposer create an actual  DAO that uses methods that have proven to be more reliable in the past to purse their goal of legalizing cannabis in their jurisdiction. While this proposal is very creative and unorthodox, by definition, a DAO of One isn't really a DAO at all and won't have much impact in the challenge", "q0r": 1, "q1": "The proposal brings up some deep philosophical arguments - can someone be in two places at once? This question follows from the definition of decentralization: \"the transfer of control of an activity or organization to several local offices or authorities rather than one single one\". Unfortunately, in order to be a DAO of one, the proposer would have to violate the principle of quantum superposition (perhaps best demonstrated with Schrodinger's Cat). The framework for a DAO will utilize the blockchain for the \"autonomous\" part setting rules in place for the governance of the DAO. The proposer doesn't suggest that they have any experience with this (this might be because the only ledger a DAO of One would need would be a leatherbound one in their pocket.)", "q1r": 1, "q2": "The proposer breaks down how their proposal will be audited into some quantifiable aspects: They hope to measure an increase in the discussion of the topic and obtain a business license. They hope that they can discuss progress at town hall meetings to update the community as well as other channels such as zoom and discord. There is also art that would be produced which is quantifiable aspect.

Overall, the proposer then sets additional goals such as development of a toolkit of community tools for everyone to use, block chain use for cannabis seed sale tracking, or use of DIDs for cannabis  licenses. These goals are definitely a long stretch, because there is no proof or supporting information how would a single-person DAO would aim for these, no plan nor more details of such. \nOverall \u2013 the proposal lacks the clarity and logical relations between problem (create a single person DAO) and solution (engage with city halls, create CNFTs, create DID for cannabis licenses), and at the same time, there is no information to support the problem statement. Currently, there is plenty of DAOs, and if the proposer states that you need to be DAO yourself to be form a working DAO, then, some examples of issues that current DAO are facing could have been outlined. Without this evidence, it is lacking the reasoning. At the same time, most of tasks outlined by proposer are actually being already done (with or without funding), and some successes could have been provided to increase the impact of this proposal.

Reading the resources needed for these tasks, it appears that proposer will be asking community for help, thus, it is largely relying on the community, which makes the success questionable. Regarding the budget, the proposer just sets amount of 1111 dollars per month, without any justification, reasoning or expected time donation. For the proposer himself, and his skills and experience, there is no information provided except the ideascale link, but we can already see that some CNFTs are crated, or from the recording of the public speech from city hall, that he is capable of being engaged community citizen.
