Moreover, the proposal is scalable through its tokenomics system that is described in the solution.

Therefore, \u201coperating, marketing and general expenses will be funded from another source\u201d. This does need to be a problem, but proposers could have explained what are these other sources (is it the other funded and related proposal?) and/or if the project could fail if the other sources fail in providing the complimentary budget.

Implementing this idea to student loans is simply a fantastic idea. There are some countries that put a heavy burden on students with loans, or some countries with a limited opportunities to students. I like to think this project as scholarship actually, since they are trying to make the repayments with minimum burden on loaners; like pushing the payback process until their graduation.\n\nThey are planning to use Voltaire governance protocol to operate as DAO, which is saying they are planning to make a self-sustaining project. They mention that self-sustainability will be their end  goal. Their token holders and contributors will have a voice on how the project will execute its projects. One of the hard parts for this is finding trustworthy users at first. Almost all DAOs have this risk; users with bad intentions trying to rig the new systems. Project is also giving their contributors right to bring more people that they trust. This vouching process is a solid plan.\n\nAn intricate project like this comes with many risks to be honest. For example, they always need to keep their liquidity pool full. It is very easy to end up like Terra project if this is not done. When you read the project, you can safely say that team is aware of the risks and they have planned their mitigation from the get go. It is great to see the project has started working in Uganda.

After seeing such a workload and planning everyone would wait a high budget. However, they are already funded for some part of the project and they kept the pricing for their engineers in a very reasonable price. Actually $44,000 budget is more than reasonable.

Every single person is a perfect choice for the project. ", "q1r": 5, "q2": "As I have mentioned in the previous section, they have laid out their milestones very clearly. To keep track of this they have divided these steps as a percentage, and any time they want to check their progress they can easily say the percentage; with that everyone can be on the same page instantly, For the progress, they have also mentioned the staying on time and not burning down your budget quickly. Both of which are generally overshadowed by other metrics in other projects but this team knows that these are as important as the milestones. One question I have about that is they want to prepare monthly progress reports for Catalyst. They might want to present these reports to their community as well. \n\nLastly, they have identified three different success metrics with three different times.
