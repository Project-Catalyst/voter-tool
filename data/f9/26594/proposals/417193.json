This is necessary because new DAOs find it difficult to become sustainable, so surely an open source tool that generates extra income will help these communities to be better established and develop. The proponent explains well how the created platform would be, for example in the excerpts \u201cThis platform will have an easy way of deployment and clear tutorials for configuration. We want to make configuring the domain and operating the service as simple as possible. To create a better experience, we are going to hire a UI/UX Designer to handle the need to develop something that can be used by any brand. On the configuration side, we will develop a manager for quick configuration and all authentication processes will use Web3 to connect to Nami and Eternal initially.\u201d It is very positive how he thinks about the user experience since the first moneto, being aware of the importance of hiring a designer to create an ergonomic and simple platform. It is also very positive as he already gives an example that could illustrate the use of this solution: \u201cApp Trading Tent, already deployed and used by our Community, but at this moment the team has publicly declared that it has no interest in making it OpenSource\u201d. For these reasons, I believe that the proposal can have a great impact, if developed correctly.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposal is viable, the script is adequate because we know of several activities that will happen each month, as we can see in the example: \u201cFirst month: Back-end development, Authentication module, Database modeling, Administrator\u201d and etc. As much as most of the activities are very technical, some could be better detailed, as is the case with the development of UI/UX design, for example - how would this be created, how would the designer guide his choices both aesthetically and ergonomically? At the end of development, there would be a task of \u201cHow to deploy the tool as a demo\u201d - how would this be done? I notice that in the script there is no focus on carrying out a marketing campaign, I think this would be necessary, after all the project is designed to benefit the DAOs and various communities relevant to the Cardano ecosystem, so I think the explanations on how this would be done are missing . Moving on to the next topic of analysis, which is the budget, the requested money is explained in a very simple and direct, but satisfying way. The total amount is well compatible with the project (25 thousand dollars), and is divided by the salary of the professionals involved - developer, project manager, designer, documentation and also an amount (2900 dollars) for unexpected costs. My suggestions on this topic are twofold: 1) it would be positive if we knew how much time these people would dedicate to this proposal, in order to understand the value of their working hours; 2) if it is not necessary to spend on unexpected expenses, how would this money be distributed? Finally, the presentation of the team is quite adequate. We know who the proponent is (\u201cThiago Nunes - Technologist in Systems Analysis and Development, entrepreneur with experience in creating several companies related to software development, including games, mobile and web systems, etc\u201d); We are provided with his linkedin profile and some of the ways in which he has already engaged with Cardano. We also have good information about Cristian and Paulo. Overall, the proposal is quite viable, although some more details could have been added.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "It would be important for the proponent to better explain these tools that he intends to integrate to perform the auditability of the project: \u201cthe treasure guild to manage transactions and Dework to create a pipeline to follow the different stages of this project\u201d. How can we ensure that they are functioning properly and that they will fulfill the functions of monitoring both processes and partial results? How will the chosen KPI, which is about adoption (\u201cAt least 1-3 DAO or NFT communities using the Platform\u201d) be constantly verified? In addition to the monthly reports sent to the Catalyst, which is a standard process, the bidders will inform the Cardano community about the updates each month, either through any of our means of communication such as discord or telegram, or any platform chosen by them. ? Regarding the final success, it is well defined, as we can see in the excerpts: \u201cDAOs will have an extra option to keep their operation sustainable; users now have a tool they can use to negotiate and benefit a specific organization. All this with the advantage of having it Open Source for our community\u201d. How can this successful scenario be perceived by the Cardano community? It would be necessary for the proponent and his team to carry out a study on how the DAOs would be using the created platform, how they would be benefiting from it, how they would be growing, earning extra income, and how they would be directly achieving the objectives of the challenge. With that, in my view, it's very important that we do a final survey here, which we can make available to the community through a final, more extensive and more detailed report, for example. In my view, this topic is not as ideal as the others, some things are said to be done, but they are not as well detailed and we need to have more security about the communication channels with the Cardano community.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 356, "q0": "The proposal effectively addresses the challenge as it aims to create a revenue generation tool for Cardano based DAOs. It offers a potentially exciting new toolkit that could be picked up by any DAO interested. That being stated the number of metrics being tracked that relate to the challenge is a bit sparse. Offering a few more such as number of DAOs or number of DAO members that utilize the toolset would be helpful.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team seems more than equipped to accomplish the deliverables established in the proposal. They seem to have many years of experience in development especially around Cardano. They have also seen previous success in the Cardano Warriors project. Additionally the digital marketing agency that Thiago runs could do a great job of promoting DAOs on Cardano with the toolset being the big call to action.\n\nThe one thing I would mark down for is the risks stated. Of course the big one is the actual deployment of the project but attracting users to hit their metrics around amount of ADA obtained in transaction fees should be considered as well.\n\nThe detailed plan does give a good sense of how long the project will take (3 months) and what will be completed each month. These deliverables make it easy to understand how and when the project will see success.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I would have liked to see a deeper dive into an explination of how a DAO would collect transaction fees and how the affiliate program works. In what instance does a DAO member create a transaction that should have a fee go back to the DAO? And how will affiliate rewards be paid out based off of transactions? A clear description of the user journey completing a transaction with a platform fee that then has an affiliate payout would be very helpful to clearing up language in this proposal.\n\nAdditionally a brief description of each item under \"System Scope\" would be good to include.

The solution is straightforward in broad strokes--a P2P platform that allows DAOs to collect some funds.\n\nUltimately, however, I think we need more information about how this will work. A use case, for example, could answer a lot of the questions voters might have, especially if they're unfamiliar with App Trading Tent. If you want to go further, a white/lite paper about how the app can create a sustainable DAO ecosystem would cover most of the bases. \n\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The application itself should be well within the team's ability to deliver within the stated timeframe as it's not attempting to reinvent the wheel. One possible concern for timely delivery, however, could be the number of projects Thiago could be juggling assuming multiple projects are voted up in Fund 9. Still, I would lean toward giving him the benefit of the doubt with regard to managing time resources given his ongoing role in the Cardano community. \n\nDid the proposer have any particular DAOs in mind to use as test cases? Are some a better fit than others?\n\nBy my math, the budget presented works out to $25,300 not $25,000, but this is a pretty minor difference either way. ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Adoption will no doubt be an important factor in measuring this project, so it should serve well as a KPI.

They would like the community to participate using an affiliate program to deliver a small commission from trades using their links. They compare the solution to trading tent but their solution is not open source yet. The proposal will address DAO challenge in the way that ADA coming from DAO transaction fee and from the DAO toolset/frameworks. It will provide the additional tool for DAO (not existing yet) and that would give Cardano an advantage. The only risk they see is their front end and UI/UX design are delay but they will plan extra hiring. While their attempt to build P2P trading platform for DAO community is really awesome, I would suggest to link various concepts and show the thought flow. The proposal mentions DAO, peer to peer trading platform, affiliate program, DAO tooling concepts but the team should start to focus in one concept (easy to implement) and branch out from there as it would be easier than implementing all features at once. The technical implementation could have been explained better in this impact section. The risk could be underestimated by the team as building the peer to peer trading platform should have more challenge than front end and UI/UX design. I am satisfied to see that the team aims for this project to be open source which is the goal for fund 9.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The detailed plan looks feasible and it starts to become clearer what the team plans to achieve. From backend development, UI/UX development in the first month to the second month of front end development and affiliate manager. Third month seems to be the implementation of DAO. The team could have supplied info on the pay rate for each person. The team members have skillset which are complementary to each other (with their linkedin and github links) and active in Cardano as the team behind Cardano warrior. Since the team will create additional tooling for DAO, they will return to Catalyst . This will be the first team exposure to get involved with governance and operational tools for DAO. Although the team is inexperienced in DAO, the team has technical ability to make it possible but they will need to go into more technical implementation and to ensure whether they are focusing a P2P platform or tooling for DAO first as the timeline seems to imply that they plan to integrate their platform into DAO or NFT community.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "Since their project will be open source, the DAO community will have access to their trading tool that might need similar features. They raise the example of adding auditability tool like treasury guild and Dework. However, they might need to be careful as their work is DAO tooling whereas the other 2 platforms auditability tools are more like Trello that show the tickets assigned to the target community members (limited numbers). Their project auditability will be much better if they have a particular site that their DAO community member and community in general can check in to see how DAO tool is progressing. Their KPI is to have 1-3 DAOs or NFT community using their platform (community can notice on github). The team has set their sight on open source tooling for DAOs and still have to refine their approach but overall, the community can see their objective and rough plan on what they can deliver.
