This proposal will definitely ensure the onboarding and adoption of the Blockchain as an enabling environment for future and operations of DAOs and relat tools and functionalities in Cardano and thus meet the criteria of the challenge. ", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The mere fact that this proposal is being championed by ADAO and notable projects is testament to the potential success of the project. The proponents being ADAO, are group of active, experience group of talented individuals within the community and the information provided is sufficient to confirm that they have the relevant competence and capacity to deliver the project. The budget estimates are very comprehensive, detailed and reasonable to achieve their goals within the roadmaps specified.

Based on my knowledge, it\u2019s possible to consider the creation of DAO educational content as the creation of platforms to organize community intentions and actions. And it\u2019s important to have a bottom up approach that can complement the top down approaches we typically see with respect to DAO creation initiatives. Afterall, DAOs are only as successful as the ability of the humans that organize around them. \n\nWith that said, I believe that the proposer may have missed an opportunity to integrate some of the campaign measures of success. For instance, it would have been interesting to pursue, as a part of this initiative, partnerships with other DAOs to encourage other communities and the members to become certified in this course as a requisite to participating at certain levels of governance (e.g., to make certain categories of governance proposals in the future). Additionally, a minting of a certification of completion could sustain the project, lead to greater transactions around DAO activities, and be a catalyst in a partionally reputation-based model of governance. \n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Based on what the proposer has communicated it is my belief that the proposal can be successfully implemented. There is a clearly outlined budget broken down into identifiable terms, all of which seem reasonable to achieve the proposal\u2019s goals. Additionally, the proposer carefully explains all of the resources necessary to implement the proposal. With that said, the proposer did not give a timetable to complete the work, nor did they fully describe applicable experience of those working on the proposal, specifically the experiences of graphic designers and other content creators. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal provided me with sufficient information to assess the progress in attaining sufficient goals. The proposal offers appropriate KPIs to define successful outcomes over the five month project period, and even considers ways to incorporate a mechanism to refine their educational content based on exit surveys.  I believe that the modules can offer an effective solution to scaling the human resources that encompass a DAO. With that said, the proposer may have taken some time to address when and how progress updates would be delivered to the community at large.

Target audience will be those with beginner and intermediate level of learning. The resources will be free of charge and can be used by many DAOs within Cardano ecosystem. It helps to promote Cardano to the students as the go-to choice for DAOs which will drive the Cardano adoption. They have addressed the risks of obtaining the feedback from the community members with diverse learning styles, languages and cultures. The proposer team plans to deliver this project in multiple languages and expect them to scale this project over time to have the lasting impact to the community.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The team has laid out the roadmap how they plan to 1. gather resources 2. make a plan with the help of blockchain learning center 3. create the content 4. delivering the course and content. The course will shed light on many important topics on DAO. The example of which are governance structure of DAO VS. human-layer governance structure, custody solutions, voting protocol and the legal forms. All of which are important for forming the successful DAOs and hence I can see the merit from practical perspectives from their educational materials. The budget breakdown is also very reasonable. As I also design and produce content, I know the pay rate of these roles and familiar with the tools they will use. The main parties that will be working on this project are ADAO and the blockchain learning center. I think it will help their score in the feasibility if they would provide the linkedin or any URL link of David Baxter and any team members in ADAO who will involved with the project. The team also has specified the timeline of 5 months in the auditability section instead of the feasibility section. Having said that, I am very confident that the team will implement the project successfully and appreciate their effort in creating content that would help Cardano and blockchain community. Although the team won't seek future funding from this proposal, I would suggest specifying the duration of this project in this section and also breakdown the total period to reflect the time required for each of the 4 steps you mentioned. This will boost the confidence of voters that the project is likely to succeed according to the plan given the budget and the timeline.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposer team has highlighted a few measures of success ie. number of education modules, number of module participants, the number of infographics and video produced, and the post course survey. The team could even provide the specific number instead of saying just the measures as the main purpose of this auditability section is for the community to have concrete measure to track the project progress. The community could track all these measures within these 5 months timeframe. It would also be useful if the proposer team will update how they intend to report back to the community. A few examples are blog, summary or bi-weekly meetings etc. There needs to be a clear channel to ensure that the community is aware of the progress that the team has made on this project. This will improve the proposal's auditability as this proposal is written in detail about problems, solutions and how they plan to tackle the project already but they miss where the community can hear on their updates.

One of the hottest topics in all of Crypto is DAOs.  This is a comprehensive course with videos and infographics. \n Although DAOs date back to the Ethereum ICO in 2016, they are just now getting more best practices applied and there have been quite a few articles published in outlets that reside outside of the Crypto world such as Harvard Buisness Review ( https://hbr.org/2022/04/how-daos-could-change-the-way-we-work) or Forbes( https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2022/05/25/the-best-examples-of-daos-everyone-should-know-about/?sh=53cb030540c3) that speak about DAOS and the future role they will play.  A few of the lines that give a more thorough look into how they are addressing the challenge are that the proposers are looking to create \"approachable and comprehensive course...\" and also \"producing content that is well received by community members of diverse learning styles, language and culture...\"  This proposal will help us to understand decentralization a bit more and the growing use cases for DAOs on Cardano.  There are clear KPIs so I believe that this proposal strongly addresses the challenge.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I took a deeper dive into ADAO to find out about what they were all about.  I used theadao.io plus joined their discord and have spent some time in there.  Of the many working groups they have, and a clearly organized community they have an education working group that meets on a weekly basis to help educate the community.  I also found out that they previously got funded about 70K for Summon which is a DAO launching platform and professional services, and they also have some very active Cardano Community members.  The ADAO contributors also have created a multi sig dApp known as Roundtable, so its encouraging to see that they have already provided DAO tools plus have received funding.  Along with ADAO i have read a bunch about David Baxter and the blockchain learning center and they too have a heavy influence on the cardao community, are active in Catalyst, and in general education.  General education and onboarding new members is one of the main challenges.  Given the experience of the team I do not see any reason to doubt the implementation.\n\nLooking at the comprehensive DAO course, the KPI's and the asking fees they are reasonable in comparison to some other proposals.  It looks like five months is ample time to prepare the educational resources for a comprehensive DAO Course.  \n\nThe compensation breakdown seems fair with the tasks that are receiving the most money require the most skill, example vide editing looks to be the highest rate and research seems to be the lowest.  A reasonable rate of money being asked is also encouraging and leads me to believe that this proposal should be implemented successfully.\n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "It looks like there is an adequate time frame of five months to produce videos and info.  With this in mind I would like to see a bit more clarity on the measures of success a proposal like this can have.  Is it number of hits on a social media platform such as youtube or a read on medium, or a review of twitter analytics?  These are just a few metrics that could be mentioned as measures for success along with the number of people that go through the course of number of communities that utilize this.  \n\nWith five months to complete, and a required monthly check in with Catalyst I believe that there is sufficient information to track the progress of this proposal.
