The solution to this is to create tools and frameworks to enable the construction of DAOs that benefit employed workers. These DAOs will be operated as follows:\n-Payment: Workers can choose to be paid in DAO tokens or even in fiat currency that the customer pays the DAO. Transactions will be instant, fully verifiable, and transparent, and will be fully powered by smart contracts.\n-Collaboration: DAOs can coordinate on any common working platform - Discord, Telegram, etc.\n-Governance: To avoid whales making all the important decisions, the DAO is likely to introduce a voting mechanism based on 'proof of person' - the system will verify that an account corresponds to a single individual who receives one vote\nThese tools and frameworks will broadly target contract workers but will be designed to specifically address the needs of centralized service workers like ride-hailing or car-hailing services. Within the scope of this proposal, the first pilot community will be built together with the car-sharing association in Ethiopia, which currently has 10,000 strong workers and the proponent hopes to have 3,000 in the first phase. The problem raised and the intended solution presented in the proposal in line with the meeting summarize the challenge clearly and logically.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Regarding the roadmap, I think it can be explained better, they set up 2 phases, and we know that each phase will last for 1 quarter i.e. this project will last for 2 quarters 3&4 2022. Although they explain the basic operations to be performed, without placing us in what time and space (and who will do each task), we cannot fully understand the development. development of the project. It would be better if they split these tasks into months. What will happen each month, explain more about each activity, because all we know will be what will happen, not how. The required budget seems reasonable based on my intuition. The $12,500 budget is divided among activities such as R&D, Community Participation, Software & Server Service Fees, and Technical Architecture...all costs are very well calculated, they I know what they will be used for. Finally, as the project team, I think this section needs more information. The group was informed that there were 2 members: Muna Mohammed - Business Consultant and Nebiyu Sultan - Lead, and attached their LinkedIn link. However, I think they need to provide more information about their experience as well as what the roles of the members in this project are because just relying on LinkedIn links is also very difficult to know the capacity whether theirs might be suitable for this project.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Finally referring to the auditability of the project, the proponent lists some KPIs that are very relevant for us to understand whether the project is achieving the expected results such as:\n-Number of workers currently registered to participate in DAO\n-Community interest to operate in a decentralized system\n-Traditional employee-only benefits approved by the DAO\nWhat is missing from this proposal, however, is to provide a means for the community to follow through on the proposal. It would be very helpful if the community could follow the development of the project on several social media channels, websites, GitHub, discord, etc.\nIn terms of success, it is easily verifiable because the proponent clearly stated the goal from the start:\n-Framework and Architecture for DAO and its products will be developed\n-Tokenomics possible and token distribution mechanism developed\n-Decentralized ride-hailing application architecture is developed", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2299", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 2, "ng": 9, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 2550, "q0": "The project is basically a tool for gigworkers to have benefits similar to company workers like parental leaves and health insurrance without having to engage in a centralized system or a certain company. The idea presented in this proposal is very innovative a would bring about a big change in the global economy and more specifically in the third world's economy such as African countries and south Asia. The proposal quotes that 10 percent of the global workforce engages in some sort of gig-work (such as Uber, lyft, condtruction). Hence, the project if implemented correctly can have a global impact. Where small communities of alike workers can create a DAO that is built like a sydicate where they pay money and get benefits just like any working person. Furthermore, the ability to scale of such project only depends on team's ability to built a worerking product and promote it correctly to the right community. This seems to be the plan of the team as they would like to start with the ride-hailing community and build a working product for them before expanding further which is a decent growth strategy. It would be great if the team can give more details about their growth strategy.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team consisting of two poeple seems to have a decent experience related to the underlying field of the project but lacks knowledge in the legal framework of such project. The team also is lacking key details about their development process like a basic architecture of the solution or atleast a functionality explanation of the DAO. Furthermore, it is ambiguous how will the DAO deal with fraud cases which are very common in insurrance and social security like businesses. As an example, how can the project prevent fraud when it comes to individuals that get too many sick leavces or too many parental leaves, is the DAO gonna limit sick leaves or parental leaves or implement a tokonomiks schema that would minimize fraud. I would like to see the project focus more on this side of the project since this is the real challenge facing this innovative solution. Finally, I think the budget is a bit high especially when it comes to hostinng fees and Community engagement there might be a good reason for those quotes but it wasn't specified by the team.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The team specifies a couple of metrics that would help follow through with project and judge its development. For instance, the community can use the the number of users of the  ride-hailing app. The community can also use the Github commits and follow up on the development of the project. On the other hand, no specifics about the development of the DAO is given and the team specifies that they didn't start the architecture of the solution and tyhat they still need to do some research about that which makes followinng up with the team a bit confusing at first. The team will share their tokomomics distribution with the community which will set in stone the DAO's constitution. Other ambiguous metrics are given like the interest of the community. But over all, the roadmap seems to be lacking and I'd recommend the team to give it more work.

I need more information about what the tasks to do, define the results of those tasks, and how much time it takes to complete them. the proponent is dividing the budget by month but I don't know what he does in that month, or how many hours he works.

However, the working principle/implementation of the DAO is what i find confusing. First of all, there's not much discussed about how our blockchain is going to play a major role in the DAO. Also as stated in the proposal, workers could choose to get paid in DAO tokens or fiat (will these be subject to voting? What blockchain will the DAO tokens be built on and why not also have payment option in ADA). I also am curious to know how these platform will ensure \"the everyday employee benefits\" are met (will there be a signed agreement between the employers with the DAO?
