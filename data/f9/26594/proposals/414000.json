The idea comes out of the successful outcome of to the proponent's successfully funded and completed Fund 7 Project (Small SPO Impact Business Program). The idea is that through this learning process, its  DAO organisation will emerge as a way to showcase the quality and resilience of Cardano Network to support DAO based organizations and in addition, provide tools and features that prospective DAO based organizations can leverage in the ecosystem. The proposal acknowledged that there is a possibility of the lack of supportive SPO community but it asserted that the results of its successful Fund 7 project proves to be encouraging to mitigate the risk profile. The idea is actually laudable and it has the potential to promote the enabling environment to attract prospects to build DAOs on the Cardano Blockchain infrastructure.

We disagree with you on the auditability - and you provide no rational as to why the proposal does not fit the challenge?"}, {"id": 4614, "q0": "Because this community receives minimal support, your proposal is to develop a SPO Learning Support Community DAO that is available. In accordance with the Challenge, the proposal raises the problem. Your response to the challenge's two questions is to make Cardano the preferred choice for constructing DAOs while developing tools and infrastructure that outperform the services provided by other blockchains. This is a proposal sponsored by Fund 7 that might be expanded in the future. With DAO support and application, the proposal broadens and qualifies the Cardano community, providing Cardano a particular value. The proposal provides solutions for developing DAO construction platforms in the Cardano ecosystem, developing tools and infrastructure that aid in the development of SPO, and linking them to a broader network in order to attract additional DAO developers. At the same time, the proposal's execution gives Cardano an ideal foundation for the development of DAO. According to a roadmap, the proposal has joined Fund 7, 8, is funded with relevant projects, and manages the execution of earlier proposals. The proposal's arguments are compatible with the Challenge. \nThe proposed team also understands that the risk of executing that project is that SPOs will not appreciate the benefits of being a part of the support community. The team also provided a solution to mitigate this risk: it collaborated with the SPO in the proposal at Fund 7 on the effect of tiny SPO in the business program and continues to work on the project of deploying SPO incubators at Fund 8 to extend the SPO community. Personally, I see an extra risk that the proposal will have difficulties controlling quality and supporting new SPO's. The second risk I've seen is that global economic inflation is growing, along with the price volatility of the ADA, thus the proposal's cost will rise similarly. I also provide a solution to the first risk, which is building an internal procedure to assist new SPOs and planning activities, online or offline meetings so that the SPO can exchange and support information together. Concerning the second risk, I proposed a contingency cost of 7-10% of the overall project budget to prevent ADA price increases and inflation. \nThis is a good proposal; the initiatives supported by the suggested organisation in the past demonstrate that it is a highly impactful idea. This part received 5 points from me. \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "This proposal is a continuation of the group-supported projects at Funds 7 and 8, hence its success relies on the goals of the previously funded projects. Important milestones in implementing specifications include, in particular, commitments to the community of Fund 7 cohort, and commitments to the community of Fund 8 cohort. Publicly acknowledge and accept the community charter. Determine and agree on the community's governance rules. Create the DAO's technical scope. Develop a DAO and launch the community. Publish the tools and processes utilized for the DAO's launching. The proposed team at the app updates these timelines. The proposed team updates these timelines at https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOpxy9M0=/?share link id=443860407334 and on Twitter. The proposed process for implementing the project is fairly sensible. The proposal raises \u00a310,800, wich is more than 5% of Challenge's capital. As I said in the impact part, this budget lacks a contingency, which is around 7-10% of the overall cost of the project. The budget specifies the following spending plans: facilitating the development of community charters - 8 hours; establishing the scope of community charters using organizing learning principles - 8 hours; implementing the writing of DAO SoW - 8 hours; and implementing encryption of DAO tools and methods - 40 hours. A total of 72 hours procedures are indicated. The hourly rate is \u00a3150. This is an acceptable budget. \nThe project team comprises of three persons who have been allocated specialized responsibilities based on their skills in the fields of technology and business. Harry Hellyer has submitted 23 other proposals for the Catalyst community, including those funded under funds 7 and 8. The proposed team consists of individuals with experience and competence in technology, project management, and business. Being able to validate identities on LinkedIn, they are all active users with a large network of contacts. \nThis is a very feasible project, with clear information regarding the project's progress as well as the activities of the members. However, the proposal called for a budget that exceeded 5% of Challenge's requirements. This reduces the project feasibility. This part received 4 points from me. \n", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal also includes a measure for project progress in the form of the number of partners that contribute to programs and qualifications. Another metric is the number of project milestones defined and reported on the project's app. There are criteria, but no quantitative data to assess. The proposed team updates these indications via the @edifycolab Twitter channel and the project's Miro board app. The proposal also describes the project's success as the establishment of the IOG's Institute for Scaling. This is a challenge-related success. The proposal is already in operation and is being sponsored by fund 7.8. This is a continuation of projects that were previously funded. The proposing team also said that it will return to the following funds to do more work on the project. \nThe proposal includes specific metrics that can be examined and updated on the project's Twitter channel, as well as the team's progress in relation to the Challenge. The work done by the team at funds 7 and 8 proved to the project's transparency. I fully agree the audit of this plan.

This proposal is very good if it can be scaled up.\n\n    - Besides, the risks that the proposal may encounter have been raised. it is possible that the SPO community will not realize the benefits of being part of a supportive community. however, the group also has reasonable plans to reduce those risks as stated in the proposal.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "   - For providing a detailed plan, including progress and milestones.

With this, the network for attracting DAOs will be strongly settled and available, as it assures the current support and codifies the experience, which I believe will be a better knowledge-base for incoming DAO developers. The reason I highly recommend this proposal is that it not just solves the challenge\u2019s problem but also broadens it to other aspects - making our community wider (benefits for the whole ecosystem) and more qualified with supporting DAO applications. In the proposed solution, they stated 2 aspects to delve into. They mention the challenge of SPO was that they often work alone in a small team. This affects the solidity and when there\u2019s no support for taking this role it could result in losing independent SPO\u2019s over time. On the other hand, I highly appreciate when the proposer also realized the need for creating tools to attract DAOs builders that Cardano is an ideal platform for it. There is one point in this solution that I think needs to be highlighted: it is the 2-fold solution when it creates a SPO support community, governed as a DAO then the process is codified for the SPOs turn to create their own DAO and spread the availability for the whole Cardano community. Because of that, I believe this is a smart solution with big impact when it can enhance the well-being of the SPO community as DAO. Further than that, I can predict that the value as DAO creators lead to a strong and solid Cardano ecosystem, just like the argument of the proposer  and. Now let\u2019s talk deeper about the solution. They have a small learning SPOs from Fund 7, who are using their related knowledge to execute the SPO activities successfully. They realized that the success was based on mutual support therefore they want to continue enhancing this value experience as an official learning and support community governed as a DAO. How critical this platform\u2019s fundamental growth was growned from Fund 7 and related to the other 2 funded proposals in Fund 8. This impressed me not just because of the commitment of  the proposers but also the way they followed their idea with a typical roadmap. Taking place in parallel with the learning community, the process will be codified and used to develop tools for further use of DAO building. The more I read down, the more I realized how meticulous and detailed this project was. If it had stopped at describing the solution and its affection to Cardano ecosystem, I would have still had a full knowledge of crucial points. However, the proposers were so enthusiastic that they even listed down the stakeholders-who benefits from this and how sustainable the solutions are. Not just so, the underlying risks were thoroughly foreseen and they have already built a solution by the proposal called at Fund 7 & 8. I just suggest one more risk could appear during the progress which is the slippage of ADA leading to a shortage of budget so I recommend ask for a reserve fund to ensure the continuity of the initiative. For such practical arguments mentioned by the proposers, I am 100%  convinced and would give this part the maximum rate.\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "As I have mentioned above, this is a continuous project lasting from Fund 7 under the name of \u201cEdify CoLabs SPO programmes\u201d, and facilitated by the Edify CoLabs team. Therefore the detailed plan has soon been generally set up since Fund 7 and now public in Miro board. Visiting the plan shows me a full board of the projects for 3 months, where the plan is divided into weekly one and has specific tasks for reaching each purpose. With the plan breakdown into weeks like this, I believe it is easy for tracking and assure that no task is missed.  The 7 milestones are also carefully listed down and partly depend on the current Fund 7&8 programme. The budget for this proposal accounts for approximately 1% of the whole challenge, which I consider suitable in terms of scale and impact. Budget is divided for 4 main tasks lasting for a total 72 hours of work, generally estimated by hours and with the tasks and categories mentioned, this budget is transparent. I continue with the members involved in the project. There are 3 experts who are full of experience in technology and business development. Some of them were involved in strategy programmes with organizational skills. All the statements about their experience are fully public and can be confirmed following the LinkedIn profile.Therefore the facilitation and development of the SPOs for further DAO will be ensured and the goals are highly possible to be accomplished since roles and tasks are clearly assigned for each person.

I\u2019m looking forward to seeing full criterias with quantitative data as I believe it tells the auditability transparently. Nevertheless, the proposers showed a twitter username of the Edifycolab programme and assured that people can track it here.  Now talking about the final results, the success scenario is outlined with quite specificity, as we can see from the following excerpt: \u201cthe launch of the Scale-Up Academy by IOG\u201d, which I believe quite clear to evaluate. In conclusion,lack of some specific quantitative data as well as a broken link to research the KPIs are barriers-which I think this is a core to consider about the project, however in general the initiative is still exceptional therefore I would rate 4 for it.
