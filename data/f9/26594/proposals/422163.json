This is directly in line with the challenge brief \"What tools can we provide to enable effective DAO's Creation & Operation\" The solution from the proposal, \"to discover use cases of tokenizing the entrepreneur & mentor engagements in emerging markets and how tokenization of the platform can help the growth of enterprises.\" is also well aligned with the challenge. The tools created by seedstars if this is funded could also provide valuable insights into the Cardano Catalyst process, as much of the work done on Catalyst is around incentivizing collaboration and mentorship. Additionally the Seedstars platform has a large reach globally, and is a great match for collaboration and sharing knowledge with the Cardano community. The Seedstars vision is closely aligned with the Cardano vision. Their website states \"As an international investment and education company headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, our work spans 90+ countries with 15 offices around the globe. We support the world\u2019s most ambitious and dedicated entrepreneurs in growing and scaling their companies to create meaningful and lasting change.\" They also work with many high growth companies in Africa, which is a strategic focus for Cardano https://www.seedstars.com/content-hub/insights/index/. \"Seedstars Africa Ventures is an early-stage venture capital fund investing in high-growth companies active across Sub-Saharan Africa.\"  https://seedstars-africa.vc/\nThe proposal says \"If successful, we will look to implement it across our entire mentorship hub and provide a framework for others who want to decentralize similar communities.\" Therefore this will lead to significant transaction volume, as well as providing open tools for others to use.

The budget is clearly broken down into milestones and tasks and includes a reasonable timeline for completion.

The proposal includes clear risk mitigation strategies for 3 identified risk factors.

It is closely related to DAOs and businesses (it has the impact of helping businesses grow quickly). The proposal also identifies the problem that needs to be addressed that there are currently no proven use cases for DAOs in the startup advisory community. The idea of \u200b\u200bthe team has a big impact when it comes to moving communities from centralized to Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). I think that DAO and tokenization are the right solutions to increase mentoring opportunities for businesses that need to start a business, which can later go even further in terms of impact scale, it doesn't just stop at small businesses. businesses need to start a business and also contribute to a gradual model transformation for larger businesses. DAO is considered the future of decentralized models in the world, so the impact of this proposal is huge if successfully implemented in practice. Just like that, it has huge potential to scale and challenge in the future. This is a proposal with a good idea and very practical and can be applied in life. If it succeeds, there will be massive support for the decentralized platform, especially from businesses. Enterprises have to change the model to move toward a different mechanism than before, then the results will be higher. I set expectations and highly endorse this proposal.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "I am very impressed with what Seedstars has done for the business community, especially the success when the team won 3 projects in Fund 7. These are a huge confirmation of the feasibility of the project. competition of the proposal and the reputation of the team. The core team members are all experienced and good professionals, holding high positions in the organization. In these respects, I have complete confidence in the team. However, I have a small piece of advice that is: The team should publicize the member's identity via the link on social networks - directly on the proposal so that the community can easily monitor and verify it instead of putting it on the website. team's own. It's important to me to make members' identities public, and I believe the community thinks so too. Just now was my advice on strengthening the team's credibility with the community, thereby increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nRegarding the budget, the team has allocated the budget by items and I find it reasonable with the goal. The budget is spread out in specific phases like research, reporting, testing, etc... This further increases the feasibility of the proposal. The community that looks at it will believe more in the team. I just have one question to dig deeper into the budget. That is, does the team have any other funding sources to implement the proposal if it has not been funded by Catalyst in Fund 9?\nAbout the plan and implementation of the proposal. A team has built it in a very good way, logically in a certain order. This demonstrates the professionalism and planning ability of the team. And it made me understand even more why the team was funded by Catalyst for all 3 proposals at Fund 7.\nRegarding the resources needed to implement, I temporarily divided the resources into 2 smaller parts: financial resources and human resources. Of course, there are many other resources, but I typically analyze these two main groups of resources. In terms of financial resources, the team needs Catalyst funding. Regarding human resources, I would guess that the team has a team of collaborators or employees of the company to help implement proposals. The team only makes the identities of its core members public. This is reasonable, but it would be better if the team made some of the members' identities public behind the scenes so that the community could better understand the human resources to implement the proposal. I think this proposal does not need to hire more experts because by nature the team members are already qualified as an expert in their field. I am satisfied with the quality of personnel that the team is having. However, hiring more experts to implement the proposal is also good, in that it puts us in contact with the best people in the world in their field of expertise, from which we can have more opinions. contribute and learn from their knowledge and practices. According to the proposal, team members are working on other proposals in parallel with this proposal at Fund 9. I think this is likely to affect the quality of work. Can the team counter my thinking by demonstrating more clearly about the personnel to ensure good execution of the proposed work? Thereby strengthening the trust of the community more. That is my opinion about the human resources needed to implement the proposal.\nFrom a technical point of view, I think that the team is applying the latest and most advanced techniques in the world related to the Cardano blockchain to implement this proposal. When it is that progress that makes the proposal easy to implement and it meets the performance that the team outlined at the beginning and the expectations of the community. I believe that the feasibility of the proposal is reflected in the technical aspects, technology, and language used.\nIn terms of risks and challenges, the team has mentioned 3 risks that are likely to be faced when implementing the proposal, namely: Lack of interest from mentors and startups, risks of questions, and words research conclusion. I am satisfied with the risks that the team has taken. Hereby, when I would like to add a budget risk that is Ada's slippage, this slippage may occur in a market that is trending downtrend. So my advice is for the team to carefully consider the Ada slippage to come up with more appropriate budget details. Avoid a budget shortfall when it comes to funding. Here are my additional suggestions for planning: The team should develop a verifiable plan if additional funding is needed.\nIn summary, I am quite satisfied with the feasibility of the proposal and I have contributed some more subjective opinions from the personal side for the team to refer to. I vote 5 stars.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I was convinced by the way the team presented the roadmap, and the milestones (I agree with attaching specific months of the year to the goals to be accomplished). I've evaluated several other suggestions, and I've found that not many do this. The team made it easy for the community to determine the transparency and auditability of the proposal through this presentation. The work order is very organized, step by step. This is the professionalism of the team. However, I don't see KPIs and key metrics. Surely the team also knows the importance of these two indicators in the audit in general. In my opinion, the team should add these two indicators as soon as possible to improve transparency and auditability. As for what the definition of success looks like, the team has given reasonable arguments, I think that if there are more specific statistics, it will be more convincing. Anyway, it improves the transparency and auditability of the proposal somewhat. I found the team to have clearly and understandably described the problems with reasonable solutions. I would like the team to carefully consult with me to add numbers to determine the auditability (KPI and key metrics - 2 quite essential factors). I both agree and disagree with the auditability of this proposal.

Today, the center wants to transform itself into a DAO on the Cardano ecosystem, this project is the first step toward that so it is perfectly suitable for this challenge\nSeedstars has startups in emerging markets and mentors on the network as an audience, a valuable resource for conducting this research project. 5 big questions were raised, about tokenomics, incentives for stakeholders, about benefits, based on which the project builds an appropriate roadmap.\nThe project identifies three foreseeable risks and has a plan to reduce them. I appreciate this. With risk 1, mentors & startups are not interested in interviewing for research purposes, let's include the interview as an integral part of finding the right partner, and building benefits long term for them. As for risk 2, interact strongly with all of the Cardano community, and do small reviews, and you will understand what the community is aiming for, thereby creating the most practical set of questions. As for risk 3, there is no clear conclusion from the study, there are many causes. If the cause is data analysis, connect with an analyst, every number has meaning behind it. If the reason for the number of samples is not large enough, incorporate more from previous audiences who have collaborated. In addition to the small comments above, I completely agree with this part of the project, rate 5 points\n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The plan lasts for 6 months with the progress presented in detail, a suitable time for development. In the period of January 2023, after synthesizing to prepare for implementation, in my opinion, it is advisable to spend an additional step surveying the community, testing before application, and helping to promote the project. From there, adjustments help improve the project.\nThe total cost of $65,000 represents 6.5% of the entire Challenge fund, a decent rate. The budget is listed in detail with specific work items, but the project should estimate the number of hours to complete each step, making everything better controlled, and easy for the community to evaluate\nThe team has 6 members, all of whom have many years of experience, diverse in areas such as entrepreneurship, data analysis, information technology, finance, and creativity. All will help the project deploy easily. However, the project should provide specific social networking links for each member, we can only check the data on the web at https://www.seedstars.com, other than that there are no other sources for data comparison. This is something that can easily be added so I rate this section 5 points\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Project progress should be specifically listed in this proposal. For example summary of Y/N questions, self-answered questions, multi-directional data analysis table, specific tokenomics, audience participation, test results, etc. Indicators The above is very easy to quantify, highly intuitive\nProgress reports are shared with the Cardano community through the proof-of-concept field in monthly submissions. In addition, I think a social network should be established, a dedicated link for the project. Helping the project both reported progress and increase interactivity with the community outside of Catalyst, will expand the audience\nThe success of the project is highly anticipated, the project opens up a possible solution to apply DAO to the advisory network, and transparency and relevance are always at the forefront. From there, it is possible to expand to other specialties, helping the Cardano ecosystem to develop sustainably.

Due to Seedstar\u2019s high profile (collaboration with the Financial Times, existing programs with venture capital backing and international startups), this is a potentially high impact undertaking. It does not fit the challenge setting perfectly, as it is not providing tooling for DAOs or any new tech or new concepts for general use cases, but it is still a good match. The fact that no provided direction of the challenge setting is followed is sufficiently mitigated by the potential of contributing to KPIs. Amount ADA coming from DAO transaction fees and Number of Communities may receive a meaningful boost from a proven VC/Accelerator use case, especially as this is focused on emerging markets. The budget seems relatively high for the risk-reward, with minor budget items like report writing consuming $5k for a total of 65k. I wish more emphasis had been put on Testing and more explanation of Cardano Advisory Services (budgeted at 15k) and Cardano relevance provided.

They have several programs like Seedspaces, Seedstars World Competition and Seedstars Life ranging from accelerator and mentorships programs to storytelling hub and co-working spaces in what you could call emerging markets like Malaysia and Mexico. The expertise of the team is solid, and although no links are directly given with the profiles, internet research is easy enough, and valuable collaborators like Smart Chain (https://smart-chain.fr/en/) and Stim/Cardashift should add muscle on the DAO expertise. The budget should have been detailed into much more detail, and seems excessive. This is a negative for Impact (see above) but should if anything help the ability to finish the research successfully with good incentives and high-caliber researchers.

Where the negatives of this proposal mentioned before come back to affect the scoring is Auditability. The KPIs that will be part of the KPI tracker are not presented inside the proposal. A lack of budget granularity and further Cardano DAO use explanation make verifying success during the implementation phase very difficult.

Here we want to create projects that are beneficial and profitable for DAOs, and this will be done with a research project that will focus on discovering use cases of tokenization of entrepreneur/mentor commitments to DAOs. This is very interesting and could help several groups and startups to adopt decentralized blockchain technologies in their actions; as the proponents claim, there are few initiatives that seek to migrate a centralized and traditional model to decentralized models in the various startups. It is positive that the idea is launched by the Seedstars group, already known on Catalyst for launching other proposals. A summary of the idea is \u201cstartups and mentors interact on our platform without our interference in confirming that sessions have taken place\u201d. Promoting this exchange and greater reliability will certainly be beneficial to Cardano as more organizations adopt our technologies on their business fronts.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The explanation of the script is great, we know what would happen and how with a good wealth of details. In my view it would have been even more appropriate if the proponents had divided the temporality into months rather than bimesters, but still our understanding of the development process is quite secure. The budget explanation is also satisfactory, but I would like to suggest one thing. The parts are quite expensive, for example the test part alone would cost 25 thousand dollars. This part is broken down into smaller actions such as \u201ccreate test cohort, perform testing/mentoring fees, support 1 for, mentoring 30 minutes per support session\u201d and so on. Would it be positive if each of these parts were further broken down, that is, how much would each smaller piece cost? There is no doubt that the team is very qualified, as I mentioned even in the script, the Seedstars group is already known in the community and in addition there are individualized and very detailed explanations about the team members.

How would meetings be held with the community, via Zoom? How often? Success, in turn, encompasses \u201cwe will answer all research questions and conduct a conclusive experiment with the cohort selected for tokenization\u201d.
