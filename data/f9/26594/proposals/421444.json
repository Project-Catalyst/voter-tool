I see it as a crucial information for assessing the proposal chances to be successful. \n\nA DAO is first and foremost a community, and only on top of that a technology framework. By aiming to a specific geographic region community the proposers are actually put a potential limit on the DAO grows potential. On the other hand this could be also an advantage, as the DAO can start from existing group that have already working together and knowing each other, but if that is the case I would expect to see some information about the exiting community in the proposal.

With that in mind, I think it would be helpful to enumerate some of these pain points (we can sort of derive these from the goals as stated, but it's good to err on the side of clarity).\n\nIf we assume the initial establishment of the DAO will be successful, it would be useful to hear more about how the proposers would go about scaling. Is a category like \"Brazilian community\" too broad to address the complexity of the challenges that might arise long-term?

The proposal's risk assessment even acknowledges that it will take time to build the DAO's vision with community members.\n\nThat said, I am confident Thiago and Cristian are up to the task of building a DAO, and the $35/hour initial operating budget is more than reasonable.

It will increase community engagement as they use Cardano DAO tools and ADA flow (DAO transaction fee). It fits the challenge of DAO love cardano as it will showcase how DAO would work for the community. The proposer also expects the DAO tools would be increased as he implements his DAO concept. The proposer mentions a few key risks for this project which are low engagement and the software implementation delay and lack of challenges specifically for DAOs. However, he has identified the potential mitigation ways.

The team would explain this better by raise example of bounty tasks - in which way these bounty tasks would benefit the Brazilian community.

This way the decentralized community can be maintained as an entryway for future adoptions in the region.  As it stands, the demand for building cardano based DAO infrastructure is a driving factor in the cardano ecosystem currently, due to its likely future progressions in the world of blockchain. What better way to be prepared for a new wave of decentralized systems, if not to propel for effective DAO developed under cardano governance and the future of community innovations.

The budget ask is reasonable, as it mostly will go into the administration of the business and salaries.
