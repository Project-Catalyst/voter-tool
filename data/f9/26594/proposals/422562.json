DAOs are conceptually new and the existing knowledge base is minimal.  Consequently, the challenge is exploratory in nature. Development in this space is at an ideation and experimentation stage. Like other organizations, there are a number of functions that will be necessary to sustain the operation.  Treasury management and decision making are two key capacities. Tools to facilitate creation and collaboration are also important.   \nProposal Clarity & Fit (4): This proposal tackles the problem of treasury management by constraining the allocation of funding for founders. Instead, the team proposes a participate to earn model that incentivizes individuals to contribute to the DAO.  The initiative, \"DAO-NET: Participate to Earn,\" serves as a innovation incubators, somewhat like Catalyst. It is part of a larger suite of projects under the DAO-NET brand.  Ideal projects would use between $1000 and $10,000. When a proposal gets funded, the sponsor, the voters supporting it, and the treasury all received minted DAO tokens. Unfunded proposals generate no tokens. The DAO tokens operate as an internal currency and pay transaction fees. The minting is proposed as an alterative to founders reserves. The proposal fits within the challenge category. The proposal lays out its structure well, but it is not clear how the DAO is actually capitalized with value.  \nCardano Impact (3): DAOs are an integral component of the vision for the Cardano ecosystem. Developing functional DAO systems is on-brand for Cardano.  The proposers suggest this project would draw DAOs to Cardano. Questions about capitalization need to be clarified before impact can be certain.    \nScalability (3): The mechanism for how DAO-NET works is not discussed. Assuming each DOA created acts as an instance, the tokenized DAO system should be replicable and scalable. However, alternate architectures might have constraints. Scaling is not presented in the proposal.  The score reflects a cautious inference about how it is functioning.     \nThe challenge provides for 4 key metrics: 1) Number of Communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO creation tools, 2) Amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees after the solutions on this challenge get implemented (> than the challenge's allocated fund amount), 3) Number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months, and 4) Number of DAO toolset/frameworks available for DAO Ops (>1).\nKPI Alignment (4): The proposed KPIs for the project are consistent with challenge metric #1.  The project will also track the number of people engaging with the DAO.  \nAverage Impact Score (3.5).\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "Experience Required and Fit of Team (5): This project is proposed by DAO Coders Inc and includes a team of four members, including a product manager, a development lead and two Plutus developers.  Additionally, the project will utilize a third party smart contract auditor. The product manager and lead developer have been designated.  They will be working on other projects simultaneously; there roles are to provide direction and oversight to development teams. Managers have been involved in 7 previously funded Catalyst projects (Funds 7 and 8) and have multiple proposal submitted for Fund 9. Two full-time developers will be hired from a pool of Plutus developers accumulated by DAO-NET.  \nImplementation Plan & Budget (5): The project has a timeline ending in February 2023 and a budget of $70,000.  These appear reasonable for the project.  \nTechnically Sound (3): It seems that development of the smart contracts governing the DAO voting and funding mechanisms will be the principal challenge, and this is where most of the resources are allocated.  I have a concern about how value is loaded into token.  Given its stated purpose in funding proposals in the $1k-10k range, the DAO tokens must be capitalized with comparable value.  Presumably, initiatives funded through the DAO platform would require conversion to currencies that support the project.  The proposal raises the prospect that value comes from utility provided by a sidechain developed to enable transactions at a lower cost than the Cardano/ADA layer 1. In the success section, the proposal indicates at 6 months, DAO-NET would be processing 2000 ADA per day in transactions and accumulating 4000 ADA per day in the DAO-NET Treasury. This raises a question: who's treasury is the project aimed at?  The DAOs created and operated or the DAO-NET treasury? The proposal would benefit from a whitepaper with diagrams or an explainer video showing how value accrues in the DAO treasury.  \nRisk Awareness & Mitigation (5): The proposers identify code security as the main risk and intend to mitigate through third-party auditing of the smart contracts. Another risk is the DAO tokens may have too little value to provide effective incentive for participation. Two mitigations of value are offered: utility in paying for lower-cost transactions on a side-chain and making tokens available for exchange on DEXes. \nAverage Feasibility Score (4.5).\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Roadmap, Milestones and Time Horizon (5): The roadmap is organized by month with key achievements specified, in order of execution.  \nReasonable and Quantifiable KPIs (4): KPIs are reasonable and measurable.  \nTransparency (5): KPIs will be reported monthly to Catalyst.

Nevertheless, after reading the impact section in detail, it becomes clear that the problem to be solved has three edges. Firstly, low participation or adoption of DAOs in the Cardano ecosystem is argued. Secondly, the problem of Treasury Management for DAOs, specifically the mitigation of the risk of reducing their Treasury. And finally, mitigating the risk to the investor in projects where founders traditionally allocate a large percentage of tokens in their own name. This is intended to be addressed by developing a smart contract robust enough to emulate an alternative innovation cradle to Project Catalyst, with features such as speed of allocation of funds to projects, which will be completely governed by open source code, with participation incentives for the community and with a self-sustainable treasury that allows the continuous allocation of funds to projects decided by the community. The only element that bothered me when reading the proposal, is the question of how the team proposes to give intrinsic value to the DAO token. However, I believe it is addressed in a suitable manner in the \"risks\" section by complementary proposals that were funded in fund 8. From my perspective, the characteristics of this solution are fully aligned with the objectives of this challenge, since if successfully implemented, it is conceivable, like Catalyst, that the incentives built into the business model will most likely be attractive to users inside and outside of the Cardano ecosystem. Likewise, the metrics proposed to measure success can be well understood how they align with what this challenge seeks. For this reason, it was assigned 5 points in the impact section.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The roles and profiles needed for a successful implementation are clearly presented. Although I believe it is critical to have information about the technical profiles of the developers involved in this type of project, it is only mentioned that the work will be done by two plutus developers, who have not yet been selected. This is a point of concern, due to the publicly known current shortage of Haskell/Plutus developers. This team's proposals have been selected for funding on numerous occasions, from fund 7, coordinated by Dwayne Collard (Product Manager assigned to all proposals), and from fund 8, titled \"DAO Coders,\" with Jude Ben (Lead Developer) on board. Both describe relevant skills and experience, as well as links to their linkedin profiles, so from this point of view there is confidence for the community. The budget is mostly composed of the necessary cost for the professional fees of the developers that would be assigned, and partial cost for the Product Manager and Lead Developers. And it is completed with the item destined for external auditing. I cannot comment on the cost of an External Audit for a Plutus contract, and I would understand that it will depend on the complexity or extent of the contract code. However, the rest of the costs seem appropriate. In the risk section, two main risks are identified, which make sense to me, as well as the selected mitigation countermeasures. However, considering the current time, I believe that one of the main risks for any project that wants to build on Cardano is the availability of developers, and, cdevelopers. Given this smart contract, I would have liked to see a mitigation strategy presented for this risk.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The problem at hand, while multivariate, is well described and it is easy to understand how the proposed solution addresses the problem at hand. In the success metrics section the team does an excellent job, describing all the aspects that this proposal is expected to impact, with a clear and contextualized goal over a period of time. Like the roadmap, it is presented in monthly time periods, with a clear description of the milestones in each of the periods. Finally, considering that this \"DAO-NET\" is an ambitious project with many edges, I would recommend the team to include in its website a progress report of all proposals that have been funded to date. This will bring confidence and transparency to the project when seeking budgets in future funds (Although the community can see that reports are still being submitted to IOG, the details of this report are not yet available to the community).\n", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2142", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 15207, "q0": "I have my doubts about the alignment of this proposal with the challenge. The idea is to create a small voting ecosystem, focused on funding cheaper proposals (about a thousand dollars). DAO participants would hold some tokens, and the more votes they cast, the more tokens they will receive. These tokens serve to encourage them to participate more in the process. I disagree that Catalyst is only good for funding larger proposals above $10,000. In fact, I think that the less funding is requested, the greater the chances of getting votes, it all depends a lot on the quality of the proposal and the impact on Cardano's activities and popularization. In other words, I don't agree that this idea is something really indispensable, in my understanding, even reading the entire impact session, I think this voting and funding process already works well with Catalyst; even because voters are also entitled to reward fences.", "q0r": 2, "q1": "Viability is average. I say this because: 1) the script is present, but it is not ideal. We know little about what would happen in each month of the year. For example, in September, how would the prototype proposal be sent and the voting processes started? More detail would be needed for us to have a really good understanding of the process. 2) the requested money is also explained in a very basic way. What would the Plutus developers' work routine be like? How many hours would they dedicate to the project? Why would smart contract auditing need to cost $10,000? 3) The team members who are introduced are certainly competent, but do not demonstrate prior experience with Cardano.
