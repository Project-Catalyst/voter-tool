Furthermore, the timeframe seems to be very optimistic and the budget quite significant (40% of the challenge's budget). Some risks are taken into consideration but not as detailed as one wished to see. On the other hand, the open-source nature of the project and the level of interest it would gather from the community insures many people would be interested in giving a hand to bring it to light.

It would rival anything on any other blockchain all in a single tool. The power here would be incredible and make setting up a DAO foolproof for anybody. To be clear, this would be primarily a replacement for discord, dework and other DAO communication and collaboration tools. This would not solve the financial setup of DAOs or smart contracts.

The budget breakdown is much less detailed and contains only general dollar amounts for development costs and \u201chardware for experimentation.\u201d This all adds up to almost half of the challenge budget and is not sufficiently detailed to give a higher feasibility score.

He has worked in a variety of tech and engineering-related positions, and has successfully completed a number of similar projects in the blockchain.

Therefore there is definitely demand from the market for this solution. \nIn the optimal scenario this could lead to an easier communication in the DAO and make them more efficient and could bring new people into Cardano because the DAOs are more censorship resilient that the competition. \nTherefore this matches the challenge criterias strongly but I could also stand in the challenge dApps, products and integration because of the inbuild personal assistant for single users.

Apart from that, the proposer fails to associate at least estimates of working hours for the different roles associated with the single tasks, which takes away the foundation for the working hours estimated for the different roles in the budget and thus makes the entire budget kind of taken out of thin air. In addition to that, some of the rates are pretty high, and while I am well aware that some bigger companies sell those job roles to external customers at those rates it is not okay to charge this as a project team operating on community funds. Another issue is that a lot of the positions mentioned in the proposal are not filled yet and the proposer themselve does not post any verifiable credential about projects of this magnitude, have however done some stuff that can be found on github. It can be seen that the proposer has some amount of competency in the topic from the impact section, the project plan is just not sufficiently detailed yet. My advice to the proposer: Try to cluster the proposal in several smaller, more detailed proposals with a better implementation plan. Maybe start with the core functionalities and than extend your franework instead of trying to do it all at once.

On top of that it is simple (yes, that is a relative term, but you can get acquainted here:  https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/) and powerful.\n\nIf successfully implemented, this framework would make it so that any network effect (take Catalyst for example) could spin up nodes as easily as booting from a flash drive (not for everyone, but Catalyst has more than enough people who are capable), which would fix the censorship resistance problem (what happens if telegram or discord went down?  How many communities would be unable to reform because their entire invested existence was on these 3rd party platforms?  How much documentation would be lost if our google docs went down?).  The idea is that these spun up nodes would host everything you think of when you picture the collaborative network experience:  you would have slack/discord like community tools, end to end encrypted productivity suites (docs, sheets, slides, etc), video calls, audio calls, real-time editorial collaboration, etc. etc.  And because this framework is modular, meaning you can have a stripped down essentials version of it or a robust core-node version of it meant to be always online, there could be a future version of it where every member ran some small part of the system, basically joining catalyst as a new node.  Tingles.\n\nThe mentions 2 or 3 research points that would be applicable to scaling (for example looking at MatterMost and seeing if forking it was a feasible way to build a social style front end onto the application), but can I suggest looking into DIDcomm integration?  DIDcomm standards are already looking at XMPP (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0024-didcomm-over-xmpp/README.md) as a way to bridge situation where peers cannot directly connect (Great Firewall, enterprise networks, etc), so researching how to integrate an agent-to-agent protocol (or more accurately, be integrated into an agent-to-agent protocol) would also be preparing these tools for the SSI future.\n\nAs the most robust and comprehensive DAO tooling set that places the decentralized, private and distributed principles of DAOs at its center, with tremendous foresight for the issues that will become worse before they get better (censorship), this proposal earns a 5 star plus rating from me for Impact.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "If you have any questions about the architecture, you probably aren't alone, but the simple way to look at this (once you get XMPP under your belt) is that everything suggested here is specific to overlaying all these tooling options on a messaging protocol.  Anyone who can learn markdown or slash commands in discord would develop quickly alongside these tools, and with communication at the heart of the protocol, everything is designed around basic language, making this extremely accessible.  \n\nI found the above-mentioned architecture explanations to be a powerful form of transitive trust (the proposer was anticipating my questions even as I was formulating them, the sign of a solid grasp of not only the technology involved, but experience with designing that that UX for others).  But if that isn't enough, the proposer has included details of projects he has completed, mostly in the eth space, as well as updating us via the comments that he has added a highly qualified partner to the project to fill one of the open rolls.  While he is still looking for the lead developer he has has budgeted an excellent wage for them, and should have no trouble finding someone.\n\nMentioning Eth brings up the issue of the Chainlink oracle, which the proposer needs to lean heavily into for this project.  Obviously the functionality isn't currently there, but the proposer has added some workaround strategies if this becomes an issue.  One mitigation the proposer may not be aware of are the various other projects in the space that are actively working with, or proposing collaborations with Chainlink, so I would guess that Cardano interoperability is right around the corner.  This is not the only project that is seeking multi-chain interop.\n\nFinally a note on the large budget.  The first thing I look for on such a straightforward development project is how much \"overhang\" there is, i.e how much marketing, project management and miscellaneous expenses have had the fat trimmed to keep the project competitive.  All I see here is development (and high level technical documentation, which frankly is a type of development).  That is it.  the $70-$100 per hour is extremely reasonable for the lead, and that lead has been given 7+ months of full work weeks, and the budget smartly trims by creating two other development roles at lower pay scales with more oversight, so despite the overall size of the budget, given that it is a 9 month project, it actually distributes quite reasonably.\n\nBecause the description of the timeline and budgets are thorough and detailed, the budget is able to come into alignment without any obvious waste.  When combined with the relevant experience for this team, I believe this is a project that has a real shot of being completed.  5 stars for Feasibility", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The milestones list, as mentioned, is quite thorough, and the proposer has referred us to it for evaluating the progress KPIs.  Normally I prefer to see the metrics restated for clarity, but in this instance the milestones are clear enough (this is usually the case for software projects with good architecture descriptions).\n\nThe success metrics make clear a couple of key points that separate this tool from others in this challenge setting.  The first is that it focuses on easy to set up.  This isn't just about UX (although onboarding should never be ignored in UX) it is about being approachable in the first place.  No matter how difficult a mobile game might be, they are all accessible from one button in a familiar interface.  Similarly, focusing on the installation procedure for these multiple, modular protocols via a self-hosted solution could be an absolute gamechanger (and don't get me started on SPO integration and subscription).\n\nSecond, the success metric for Web3 access is critical.  I have seen a number of great solutions to real DAO problems in this challenge setting, but too often they are leaning into the very protocols that web3 is trying to replace.   Every one of the \"built-in\" features that are to be included here are deeply web3, prioritizing privacy via user database and end-to-end encryption, FOSS standards, and distributed instances.\n\nBecause the team has shown to be accessible and transparent (check comments for updates and reasoning for their personal profile contents), and because the metrics provided show clear ways of tracking and measuring progress and success, in a relevant, impactful way, I believe this is a (difficult) project with a realistic plan for staying on track.  5 stars for Auditability.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2436", "no_vca": 0, "ne": 0, "ng": 0, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}], "solution": "Provide a distributed, resilient, community owned framework that provides communication, storage, blockchain access and computing infrastructure,using Instant Messaging as the communication backbone.", "experience": "I have been in the Web3 space for about 2 years.
