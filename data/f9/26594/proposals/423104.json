By Dynamically,  it means it can issue an ID solution for any organisation/community.

In summary, what is proposed here is to create a minting script with a time block, and with that an identity system used in the validation of accounts in DAOs. This can be useful because DAOs often have members who come and go frequently, so we need to have more control over these actions. It is very interesting how the technology is customizable and can be used for different purposes, such as voting tools. But, as I said, this is all still in a very theoretical field.

However, the information in it is extremely vague and difficult to understand. It may be my lack of expertise in this particular area, but it\u2019s not clear at all to me from the solution to the problem (\u201cCreate one time-locked minting script used to create an ID system that can be used for TX validation and account management.\u201d) and the very brief plan below what the concrete work to be done here is. As relevant experience, the proposers listed two LinkedIn profiles, for one Deryck Lance, whose most recent experience seems to be at an organization called \u201cQuasar Risk Advisors\u201d (Quasar is a community member known for creating dozens of proposals every fund, not all of them of the highest quality and he is one of the proposers of this one as well). I tried looking into that organization, but its website is a 90\u2019s era site on HTTP (not HTTPS), so you enter it at your own peril: http://qrains.com/. The other person is Dominick Garey, a person claiming to be a Plutus Pioneer Student, but there is no information on their LinkedIn pointing to any kind of previous development experience. Further on, the proposers make many vague statements about the solution they are proposing (Cat_Id), which are all over the place: \u201cThe Cat_Id can be used as an input in a script, releasing funds to specific users; The Cat_Id can be used to assign roles in a DAO/Server; The Cat_Id can be used as a voting tool, requiring each participant to possess a valid personalized ID with the policy number tied to a corresponding election\u201d etc. I also need to add that they said \u201cthe tokens and idea has already been developed, we can begin with issuing tokens to Community Advisors as a pilot and then follow up with a stronger plan in fund 10.\u201d. I don\u2019t know what token they are referring to, because the Github link they added (https://github.com/QuasarChains/identity-token) contains 2 ReadMe files and nothing else.\nThe proposers have also not been thorough in regards to risks, making the following vague statement here: \u201cThere will be some hesitation in regards to applying \"identity solutions\" to roles as opposed to individuals.\u201d. No elaboration on how they plan to mitigate this.\nTo conclude, I find this proposal extremely all over the place and lacking in a coherent plan, so I do not believe it effectively addresses the DAOs <3 Cardano challenge. Score: 1.", "q0r": 1, "q1": "I overextended a bit in the Impact analysis and included elements of feasibility there as well (analysis of the plan and the team). As a result, what remains to add here is that there is no timeline whatsoever for this project and the budget breakdown for the 32000 USD sum they ask seems to be completely arbitrary. It\u2019s a list of numbers associated with vague tasks without any details on what they entail or who will do them and how much it will take. For example: \u201c$7500 - Research and Training Plutus, Atala; $5000 - Time and Labor etc\u201d.\nI do not believe at all that with this very slapdash plan it is likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully.

These however are not key progress indicators with clear estimates that let us, the community, know what to expect here at what interval. Besides, without a coherent plan telling us what will be implemented, the proposers can simply add almost any task in Github, marking it as complete and claiming that as progress.\nAs a measure of success, the proposers said that the onboarding and adoption of this solution \u201cwithin parts of the community and potentially a couple of DAO\u2019s\u201d will be it. This is again extremely vague as it\u2019s not been described what this solution is concretely, how it will work for users. They then go on to say that \u201cthe real success though will be the opportunity top speak openly and more in depth with the community about SSI and this framework.\u201d. How is that a goal? We have been having conversations about decentralized ID\u2019s for over half an year now, constantly.\nI do not think that the information the proposers added here would help us audit the proposal, even if it had a coherent plan, which it does not.
