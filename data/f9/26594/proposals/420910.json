Metadata connected to NFTs is stored on-chain and content linked in it is stored and accessed via IPFS.\n\n(-) Solution doesn't explain why a DAO is necessary to implement NFT 2.0 tech. It seems added on only to make it fit into the challenge category. Additionally fractionalising and nesting of NFTs is something dcSpark is already working on, also multisig is available via ADAO's Roundtable app (opensource!).\n\n( -+) The expertise to execute is available, however \"locked\" in a proprietary\ncompany. As mentioned before it eludes me why Catalyst should pay a non Cardano related/integrated company for tech that's already being build and published by the community and opensource.\n\n# IMPACT\n\n(-) It's apparent that not a lot of deep research has been done into the Cardano extended UTXO model and the native nature of Cardans NFTs. The proposal mentions NFT 2-0 will be able to change meta data after minting. The fact is that metadata in Cardano NFTs can be changed by allowed keys, for as long as policy ID stays open. And even after that with the help of the token registry process.\n\n(-) the NFT smart contract example flow is not applicable with Cardano NFTs\n\n(+) the basic idea is an NFT-Maker pro on steroids and structured as a DAO, can make sense and is being explored by established\nplayers as well\n\n(-) The voting, asset adding, general incentive and treasury funding mechanisms are not explained in a level of detail that would\nallow to asses the impact on the challenge and DAO space precisely.\n \n(-) The category challenge and especially the intricacies of combining account based (Ethereum) and eUTXO based\nCardano native tokens have not been described properly.\n\n(--) The risk section has been completely ignored?!", "q0r": 2, "q1": "(-) The plan is not detailed at all and the timeline seems unrealistic (building an \"NFT platform\" and a DAO\" both in one month?)\n\n(-) additionally the team submitted 3 other quite large funding requests (totalling over 300k) without being previously funded this raises a yellow flag. \n\n(!) A suggestion would be to focus on one mechanism, tool or MVP first and introduce the team into the Catalyst process.\n\n(-) Budget breakdown is not detailed enough for the level of funding requested.\n\n(+-) Team seems very well equipped for the job, however not a single team member has a social profile linked, not even the CMO,; yellow flag!\n\n(+) Plus points for not returning for additional funding, since the project will be self sustainable after this funding round.\n\n(-) comment posted by community member on 30th June is still unanswered\n", "q1r": 3, "q2": "Auditing this project will be somewhat difficult, as the company is working in a proprietary environment and hasn't given enough information to assess the auditability in detail; swimming through telegram announcement channels is not a feasible way for catalyst coordinators to audit.\n\n(+) some success metrics established that are specific and measurable\n\n(-) However those KPIs are not that meaningful, as they can easily be gamed /artificially\nincreased\n\n(-) No measurable or clear KPls to track the development of the DAO", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2170", "no_vca": 8, "ne": 1, "ng": 7, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 1477, "q0": "Submitted for your consideration is a proposal that seeks to create a DAO governance structure applied to a dynamic NFT, a new technology with significant implications.

The team identified the problem as identifying most NFTs in the market as single-asset NFTs (each NFT represents only one digital asset). As a result, the NFT becomes worthless when the server containing the content's data crashes. Such a team's assessment of NFT is very accurate and building a DAO system that works as mentioned above is essential to help NFTs become more flexible and effective, even moving towards multi-association into the NFT (NFT 2.0). This proposal certainly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem because it is built on top of the Cardano blockchain, not to mention the real value of NFT it brings to Cardano. What I find is that the potential of this proposal, if successfully implemented, will be very large, having an impact on all sectors of society. Therefore, this proposal is fully scalable and solves many challenges in the future. I am very impressed with the impact of the proposal, it is not only valuable in the present but will likely have long-term value in the future for the wider social community if successfully implemented. Of course, this requires a lot of time to research and implement step by step. I vote 5 stars.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "In terms of the team, consists of many experienced members after successfully building the Dare NFT project, providing solutions for launch, market, and IOG services on BSC. In addition, there are 4 companies of experts and enthusiasts of programming. These impressed me with the size of the team. This is the clearest proof of the team's prestige in the community. All documents provided by the team in the proposal (website, videos, ...) are very public and transparent, which confirms the feasibility of the proposal and the publicity of team members. I see the professionalism in the presentation, and that professionalism is real with the DareNFT website. I hope, the team can post the social media links of some key members directly on the proposal, this will be easier for the community to access to find out the public identity of the members than take the hassle out of accessing team-specific documents. It is my contribution to increasing the credibility of the team and increasing the feasibility of the proposal.\nI have seen the budget analysis, but I think it is short and a bit sketchy, not to be called detailed (4 lines only). The team can add more in terms of items that are broken down by items or by the progress of the work to be reasonable with the price and reasonable with the goal. This is important to demonstrate feasibility. I understand that to implement NFT 2.0, there are many stages related to technical and human resources to implement. Therefore, I would like to advise the team to list each work in detail with the cost, as detailed as possible so that the community can base on that to evaluate the feasibility of the proposal. If you can do that, even the newest members of the community, who do not know anything about the team, can understand the budget breakdown and thereby visualize the amount of work that the team has to do. presently. I have a question to clarify the budget situation: If this Fund 9 has not been funded by Catalyst, will the team continue to implement the proposal? Behind the team is the company, is there any other source of money to support the implementation of this proposal (I know the team has a plan to generate cash flow and revenue for the project)? The affirmation not to return to Catalyst in the next round for additional funding impressed me with the team's competence and honesty.\nIn terms of plan and implementation: The team did this in a clear and detailed way, interspersed with technical and professional presentations to create NFT 2.0.\nThe resources needed to make it happen despite the other members implementing other proposals in Fund 9. With 4 proposals - more than 200 developers, I have complete confidence in the outlined plan and full resources. enough for the team to successfully implement the proposal.\nIn terms of technical aspects, technology techniques have been detailed in the diagram. This is the new way of doing technology by members and experts. I feel very excited about this. Applying technology and methods to successfully create a multi-asset NFT for a team is not difficult to do because the team is composed of members who are good at technology or even experts. I have more comments on the media effect: It would be quite good if this proposal is successfully implemented. As far as I know, currently, on the Cardano blockchain platform, there is no NFT that is qualified to be called a multi-asset NFT. Creating a team's multi-asset NFT will mean a lot (in case it succeeds, of course) in terms of communication for the project and the team because it will attract a huge number of interested people. in the community, from which they will know more about the team and each member, and the company.\nIn terms of potential risks: Strangely, I haven't seen the team raise the risks when implementing the proposal. There is also no solution. Did the team make a mistake when the risk presentation overlapped with the blueprint implementation? I suggest that the team review the proposal to clarify the potential risk of creating a multi-asset NFT. This also plays a part in proving the feasibility of the proposal. Hereby I add to the possible risk: The slippage of Ada will affect the budget to implement the proposal. I would like to analyze this risk more closely: We know that the digital currency market is in a downtrend phase, so the price movement in the downward direction of digital currencies takes place from time to time. day. That is also the reason why Ada may depreciate when Catalyst funds are allocated to the team, then the team will face the problem of a lack of budget to implement the proposal. Therefore, my advice is that the team consider the detailed budget related to Ada's slippage to make an appropriate budget request. Even if more funding is needed, the team can come up with a full plan to test.\nJust now are my analyzes of the feasibility of the proposal. The team can review and note the risk-solution presentation. I vote 4 stars.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "I find that the team has come up with a reasonable roadmap and milestone. It seems short but contains all the necessary information. However, I think it's better if you attach this milestone to a specific month in a year (eg January, February,... - this is just an example). If the team can do so, it will be much easier for the community to conduct a review of the proposal's transparency and auditability.\nWhy doesn't the team present key metrics and key metrics? I think the team knows the role of KPIs and key metrics in the audit. This makes it more difficult for the community to evaluate and audit when KPIs and key metrics are not visible. KPIs and key metrics play a certain role in proving the transparency and auditability of the proposal. So my sincere advice to the team is to quickly add KPIs and key metrics. Then this proposal will have much higher transparency and auditability.\nRegarding \"what the success of this project looks like\", the team has given a clear criterion to evaluate the success: Successfully deploying the DAO on the NFT 2.0 platform so that NFT 2.0 owners have the right to decide the assets they want; 100 types of digital assets will be listed on the platform; 1,000 NFT 2.0 will be sold; 70% of NFT 2.0 holders will participate in voting. Thus the definition of success is tied to concrete numbers. I am very pleased with this definition of success and its plausibility. I have no opinion on the clear and understandable description of the problems of the proposal. Recently, I have contributed positive comments.
