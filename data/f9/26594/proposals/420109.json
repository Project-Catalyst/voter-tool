It fits perfectly with the aim of the challenge, but more details could be furnished such as the tools the team is prioritizing right now, would it be community management, treasury management, day to day operations or governance? Some areas to explore are payments on Dework. The team mentioned using Dework for project management too, currently payments on Dework, which is a pretty popular decentralized Kanban board meets LinkedIn, only does payments based on the Ethereum blockchain so integrating Cardano based payments could help a lot plus the Dework team was recently asking for the Dework community to contribute to their product. The team also mentioned having self-paced project based learning to help the community learn how to use DAO tools better which would help accelerate the adoption of Cardano based DAO tools.

Therefore, the author proposed a solution to the problem by providing distributed governance services that support Cardano teams and communities using tools such as dework, Discord, and GitHub. Document and incorporate lessons learned into Project Based Learning. The proposal is consistent with the goal of the challenge and is described in detail and richly. The team is aiming to provide a set of tools and services to diverse groups or groups within the broader Cardano ecosystem. The proposal is to implement the Cardano Governance Service Organization on top of Web3's native dework project management platform and to integrate the tool on the Governance Services Guild, Discord, and Github platforms. Besides, there are 2 risks posed in the project. At the same time, the team outlined positive and specific solutions to minimize risks when the project is implemented. Ensuring the project is well executed and reaching the end goal is the success of the project.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The author has provided a lot of information about the plan to implement the project. This proposal complements the proposal of the Governance Services Association (GSG). In addition, specific activities are clearly analyzed and explained in detail. Specifically: Deploying Cardano Administration Services Association on dework; The work process is documented into a PBL learning document;... At the same time, the author has provided a detailed roadmap table, the tasks to be done are clearly stated and parallel with a clear timetable.  According to what the author has presented, we know that the project will be launched when funded and will be carried out in 4 months. And the tasks to be done are clearly stated in each month. Next is the budget. The proposal requires a budget of $37,600. In my opinion, the required budget range is appropriate given the work and time of the project. The author provides a breakdown of budgets for each specific task. We know what each expense is allotted to, and are estimated at the money/month/person/work ratio in detail. Specifically, the salaries of experts, guild funds, bonuses, etc. Finally, the team of team members. Project members include: Current Guild Members; Guild Treasury; Project consulting. We know the members are all people with the right skills and experience to do the work on the project. At the same time, the author also provides presentation documents about each member, and attaches link files for us to know more about the history and experience of the members that the proposal has presented. Overall, the proposed plan is very good, the budget is transparent and the members are skilled and experienced. Proposal is highly feasible.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The team cares a lot about this part of the project. We are provided with indicators to measure the successful progress of the project. Also provide multiple link profiles, so that we can check continuously and transparently. Specifically: Cardano Administration: in GitBook; Project management: will be tracked via Dework, Github & Discord. Dework is a project that provides tools to support the operation of DAOs in the Web3 world. Discord: is a very interesting piece of software that can communicate by voice calls, video calls, text messages, media and files in private chats or as part of a community; Transactions and payments are tracked and recorded through the Catalyst Swarm Treasury & accounting system on Discord, Github and Gitbook. That means we have multiple ways to track the successful progress of a project. Since we are provided with a lot of information, in my opinion all necessary and satisfactory information is established. We know what to expect, what goals to achieve, and what benefits it will bring to the community and the Cardano ecosystem. Finally, the success of the project is what is expected in this project. Github; Admin Service Guild Discord Server Active before October 2022; Complete PBL module; At least 3 new Guild members etc. Besides, the project's specific plan. members with sufficient skills and experience will complete the project on schedule.

They have identified the purpose of the challenge and they have worked to develop a proposal that meets that purpose. This proposal would result in many new community members being involved in governance across a number of organizations. They're providing training.

This team already has a large number of community outreach efforts where they are very public. They have a strong presence on Discord and on Dework. they will publish code updates to github. And when it comes to funding Community bounties they have a public treasury record available on gitbooks and on Discord.

It is also being support by two social media which is also a direct place to be compiled; Github and Discord. Gather around and discuss the topic based on Project Based Learning would be effective when the surrounding area is come from the experts. The needs to alocate such a high fund request must be address carefully, depends on the factor of what will be explored first, and how to develop each step of project, rather than focusing on one person, the value will be delivered to a group of people where they will initiate the action plan by themself. As it was mention, variety of group, cultural background is essential spot and become an aspect to perceived by wisdom in order to understand community intention and further actions.  While many tools exist to support DAO community collaboration, creation, operation and governance, there is very little training available that is based on real-world implementations. Three things to be hightlight on Impact 1 : proper tools and infrastructure support, migrate and integrate to social media, documented instead of report completed tasks. Yeah indeed, self-paced Project Based Learning will drive the community member to have more than just a passionate heart but also a critical thinking on the ecosystems. For the Impact : propose solution : 3 main reason again,  that this proposal is align with the timeline and duty that they have been doing all the time, tailor the team's needs, for the better efficiency and effectiveness. Supposed to be a clear statements from internal team which need to be colaborate in between. Last thing : Risk mitigation : not being funded.

PBL model structure itself is a compile statement to pull new idea from the opponent, and taking a leap through people's idea. The section of Contribution Node clearly explain and drive the people's mind to get more STP ( segmenting, targeting, positioning of further short term unto medium term plan). Breaking down the task into 4 phase will get them to the result they expect but not the retention of context being echo by community members. Again, takes time and effort continuously.
