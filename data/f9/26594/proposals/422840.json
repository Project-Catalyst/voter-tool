That being said the hourly wage of $62.50 is hard to judge if it is worth it. Some of this will go towards the costs of building but how can one be sure this amount isn't over paying?

The proser has also posted a thorough plan of how he intends to complete this, and the milestones appear realistic and achievable. The proposer however has not included any team member in the project even though the proposer stated he will be main person executing the project but I suggest going forward he should think of adding team members since projects are best completed in time with the right team players. The proposer has provided a budget very simple and broken down into understandable bits. I think its feasible.

This is an encouraging strategy by the proposer and deserves commendation. My suggestion however is that as the project encompasses many different areas, I recommend that there be some sort of communication route between the proposer\u2019s work and the Cardano community during its execution so he is able to directly report progress to the cardano community using their powerful reporting channels in addition to his reporting channels such as the intended discord server among others.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2350", "no_vca": 5, "ne": 1, "ng": 4, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 8963, "q0": "There is lack of interconnectivity in the project development currently, where developers from different will not collaborate and work ,which makes cardano eco system a divided one,hence to develop a system where the proposer wants commoners to connect and work on existing projects is a great deal, this will not help in maintaining the community structured but as well as it makes the commoners to improve the skill set and can even come up with a project of their own idea and complete the project with provided funding by voters hence this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The task of adding community and working has many back lashes , where the proposer hasn't mentioned on how he's going to select the members for the project is it through interview mode or experienced set in resume, the proposer hasn't any mentioned other members that will be working in the project, so it seems the proposer alone wants to complete the entire task which is very difficult to achieve, where finding the skilled community members and assigning the roles has to be done , where there work has to be continuously  monitored for the progress of the work, still the proposer has lot of skillsets involved with him, With given experience and plan presented it is highly likely this proposal will be implemented successfully.", "q1r": 3, "q2": "The proposer could have added other members to the project and could have introduced them because completing the project alone is not easy or even if it is completed the efficiency would be lowered.
