This idea makes strides toward the un-victimization of people that Cardano strives for.  They are starting out on this road conducting interviews with donors and researching the current centralized method of maintaining an NGO.  They key metrics of this proposal align with the challenge setting and the proposal is for short-term research but the team has another proposal to further build out a daApp and scale.  The proposal includes a roadmap and a long-term (2 years) goal to build a tool to verify eligibility of NGOS and record their behavior on the platform.

The budget is broken down into 3 distinct sections: Research Phase, Findings Reportings, and Community Management which all show reasonably allocated funds to reach the goals of the proposal.  There is no plan if funding is not adequate to reach set goals, but the budget seems realistically able to cover the proposed activity on the proposed timetable and also compensate team positions listed on the budget.  Specific tools that will be used in the research such as interviews and standards for NGOs are not included in the proposal, but I would like to see what those look like.  The proposal breaks down 3 risks that may be encountered in the research and ultimately the implementation of the DAO, and addresses each with a realistic method of addressing that risk.

The team has listed 3 measurable and time-specified goals to achieve over 3 months and proposal also states that they will be using a KPI tracker aligned with the project plan.  I would like to see the KPI tracker, or an example of it in the proposal.  The determining criteria for project success is clear and shows how this research and gathering of information will contribute to solving the stated problem. The proposal states that progress reports will be shared with the Cardano community in monthly meetings.  I would like to see where and how these meetings plan to be publicized in the proposal.

There are many times donors wholeheartedly release huge sums of money to be used to support victims of disaster or people in need. But due to the fact that there are no accurate systems in place to check accountability, NGOs or sometimes local community leaders misuse funds, not for the intended purposes. \nThis disrupts trust of donors for NGOs and also affect intended recipients. \nThe proposers intend to do a thorough research and use the findings to create a DAO for NGOs so that they operate on Blockchain. This means that every donation, spending, and all activities including decision making processes are captures on the Blockchain and donors will have access to every information they need to have on their donations. \nThis will increase transparency and effectiveness in delivery. \nIntended beneficiaries of donations will not be affected by inefficiencies in centralized NGO operations. \nDAOs on the Cardano Blockchain will lead to increased participation and adoption of Cardano by many. There will also be possible increase in project catalyst participation.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "There is comprehensive plan presented with stated milestones with time schedule attached. The plan and timelines presented is  a realistic one. For a research phase of this work I think the team presented is an amazing team and they will do well. They have the qualification, experience and necessary skills for this proposal. But I think for only the research phase the funds requested is too huge, because the team intends to apply for refunding for the creation of the DAO as well.

However, in the present day's world of Ponzi schemes and scams, many NGOs are either being defrauded of the intended donations or are unable to achieve their objectives. In order to have a prolonged involvement of NGOs and their volunteers in developing nations, a transparent method to keep this in check is unquestionably required. The right DAO can significantly increase the impact that NGOs may have on society by keeping them on course and overseeing how monies generated are used. The proposer attempts to find the best possible solution to this problem, and this proposal is an auxiliary project that is concentrated on the research portion while another proposal is made by the team from the perspective of implementation. The author also appears to have a solid answer for each danger involved and is well aware of the potential impact his concept could have. If this proposal is funded, together with its other proposal, it might significantly improve the chain. However, just this suggestion might provide a plethora of new options for programmers engaged in NGO tracking.", "q0r": 5, "q1": "Even though they are only briefly addressed, the readers are given an elaborated plan that includes attainable targets that are set at regular intervals when simply the research portion of the larger plan is taken into consideration. Looking at the impact metrics review reveals that two proposals have been made with a significant amount of work already completed and split effectively. This helps to increase the feasibility metrics by a few points. The proposed finances are also extremely reasonable and appear to be necessary to complete the investigation and present the results. The idea of a UI to share these discoveries is also included by the team in the plan. The introduction of the team was masterful, and it provides a range of skills to the ecosystem. The crew also appears to be aware of the outside resources already at their disposal to help them in their endeavor, which demonstrates their passion and tenacity for making this an exciting experience. The team's plan and long-term objectives reveal the shared large vision, thus the community can anticipate that the project will ultimately have an optimistic implementation and outcome.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "The proposal's objectives are clearly stated, quantifiable, and based on the clear road map in front of us. The author mentions that the community can use the monthly reports and regular community meetings (perhaps over Discord) to monitor development. The metrics would play a significant role in ensuring that non-governmental organizations operate under the supervision and without corruption because they are in line with the requirements of the challenge. The team adds that achieving a clear grasp of how to include a DAO with NGOs and how to ensure that both are advantageous would be the ultimate triumph. However, I believe that the team could have done a better job of giving us actionable metrics to track their research progress, through some audio-video proofs rather than waiting for a UI to publish those, and that the author could have taken a much wider scenario into consideration when evaluating the findings while writing the success metrics rather than just the DAO-NGO integration aspect.
