While not strictly a tool in itself, results of this proposal will do heaps of good for way of thinking about innovation funds DAOs and can be used as a base of building actual tools for such DAOs.

Over time, Catalyst has grown quite large and it\u2019s becoming ever more difficult to have a complete picture of who does what and how the entire system functions and Tevo aims to bring clarity to this. An added benefit of this will be that it will help people understand what they can help with, if they want to get involved. Since each role will also have a few requirements defined, it will be easy for people to then figure out where their skills can be applied, or what skills they need to acquire if they want to activate in a certain position in Catalyst.\nAs risks, Tevo identified the fact that in all likelihood, the roles that he identifies and defines now, will change in the future. As a way to mitigate this, he included the projected cost of keeping the information up to date in the future in the requested amount for this proposal. \nI fully agree that this proposal effectively addresses the DAOs <3 Cardano challenge.

As usual, he has a very detailed plan on how to do this, a timeline, milestones, plans on how to manage the Miro board that will be produced after the proposal is completed successfully, etc. It goes without saying that he has the necessary skills to gather this information and host the workshops that he plans to host in order to educate the community, as he has been doing this for more than 4-5 funds now. The budget is not very large at 45000 USD, as the work will span at least 8 months (and probably more). Moreover, the breakdown of the budget is extremely comprehensive, with each and every action that must be taken having a time and cost estimation.\nI fully agree that this proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully. Tevo is very good at this kind of stuff. Score: 5.", "q1r": 5, "q2": "Tevo has added comprehensive and very clear key progress indicators, such as having at least 7 people per each workshop session, 50 views for each youtube video produced here etc. Moreover, there already is some groundwork done from previous funds, which he linked to in the proposal. Finally, he will also gather feedback from the participants of the workshop and publicly keep track of that as well.\nThe measure of success is defined as having mapped out all the roles, their tasks and all other related info, by fund 12 (since this will be an 8 month on-going proposal). Aside from this, Tevo added a lot more info to support the community in tracking the progress and success here. I am fully confident that this proposal is as transparent as possible to Catalyst participants. Congratulations for your work done here and everywhere else in Catalyst Tevo. Cheers!

However, the description of the solution does not explain this well, nor gives much information about how this process will work with external contributors to the proposal (and the miro board also does not explain this much).
