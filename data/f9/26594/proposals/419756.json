To encourage the community to participate more and more, the goal of this proposal is to expand the scale to attract more talented Dao development talent in different ways of governance, diversifying management conditions. The theory of the Dao system later, based on the above reasons, the proposal is completely suitable for the challenge.\n\na lot of the materials recommended by the team to be provided in this presentation, the content of what ADao has done, is developing and the cooperation with organizations for sustainable development on related techniques to Dao, for example: the team mentioned in the past 8 months has been testing a large number of open source bounties, incentivized ADAO community governance tokens. this I verified at the website : https://www.theadao.io/ , of the proposal, in addition there are many mechanisms for each object in the community with different number of reward tokens,\nespecially the mechanism for rewards Groundwork Bounty Program - 18.4% : will reward the referral of new members and partner projects and reward them for their contributions.\n* in general there is a lot of content related to cooperation with other community organizations such as Blockchain Learning, SCAT DAO. and is committed to working with others to continue to create, iterate, and train on sustainable open source business models.\n\nThe immediate risks have all been raised by the proposed team and have taken the initiative for reasonable mitigation solutions.\nwith documents on ADAO activities and objectives as well as evidence for cooperation of the proposed publication are complete and specific examples. However, there is one constructive contribution to this suggestion of mine: if possible the group should cite the claim that the community already has 3,000 members, if so it will add more certainty, since I have access went to the proposal's website and found that the number of dissenting members of 1368 and the ADAO contributors and builders was less than the claimed number.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "this ADAO development team! In my opinion, for the table to announce the group's roadmap and expansion plans for ADAO funds, the team suggested that it be a little more specific so that the community can know that all the goals are planned by you. very meticulous. e.g. the team should state how many more expansion funds will be set up for your DAO, and what is the current membership in the branch facilities and how much the goal is to grow within a given time frame However, if there are specific commitments and timelines, your team will be more appreciated.\n\nthe hours of operation for the goals are stated for each item and the number of hours to perform for that content is included next to it, so it is easy to understand how much time each item will take to complete, however still need an explanation for the salary hierarchy paid for each different development team mentioned by the team, for example: 800 @ 75per., 400 @ 40per, the proposed team needs to add a footnote to the section. announcing this because the community doesn't yet understand what technical jobs 75per hour applies to, and to what jobs 40per also applies,\n\nAll documents related to team information are available on the group's website, but the proposed team is still providing it in this presentation, and in addition is based on developments and contributions to the facilities for the team. The current community, together with the materials provided in the presentation of the proposal and in the group's website, is sufficient and likely to be successful with this proposal,", "q1r": 4, "q2": "There will be 8 metrics to measure the progress of the proposal, and all of them are related to scaling up in terms of workforce and collaboration, plus there will be creative contributions from the new community.

The summary of ongoing and already functioning products clearly demonstrates that the proposer, at the foundational level, is a collaborative management platform that is growing in efficacy and specialized capacities, and that has already been providing tooling that fits within the category. The proposer demonstrates their ability to scale by: 1) referencing the 3,000+ human resources that currently contribute to the creation of DAO tooling; and 2) referencing the growing number of other Cardano developer communities (not individuals, emphasis on \u201ccommunities\u201d)  that would like to collaborate (on the creation of DAO tools) through the proposer\u2019s platform. These are important factors to consider. It is of my opinion that the proposal and all that it entails fully aligns with the campaign objectives in that it pursues the creation of DAO tooling, and in a fully decentralization, permissionless and open-sourced way, with significance given to on-chain solutions. \n\nAlthough the proposal and its ambitions are an ideal fit, there are ways the proposal may have been more compelling: \n1) Demonstrate why the use of RoundTable in the receipt and distribution of Catalyst awards connects to the objectives (e.g., basic treasury management, iteration to RoundTable to provide for enhanced features, etc); 2) Incorporate the use of Agora DAO tooling within the six month project period to organize one or more aspects of proposal implementation, and how the experiment will help grade its performance; and 3) State the additional tools like RoundTable that the proposer believes to be an important next step towards campaign objectives (e.g., hardware wallet integrations for RoundTable, UI/UX redesigns, specify new toolings and why they are important, etc).  \n", "q0r": 5, "q1": "The proposer provides evidence of a leadership team that can properly manage organizational change, alongside relevant technical skills and experience needed to implement the proposal. The proposer has identified the number of core contributors required to implement technical aspects of the proposal. For example, the proposer intends to double the number of technical developers to 36 core contributors, and outlines the budget clearly (broken down into dedicated hours per technical area). The budget seems reasonable to achieve the set goals within the required project timelines. It is my judgment that the budget seems reasonable to achieve the set goals, and the budget is outlined clearly(broken down into dedicated hours per task) . \n\nThe proposer has indicated that their work will continue irrespective of funding awards. This is great news for the community. With that said, because targets are identified in a decentralized and open source nature for this collaborative management platform, the proposer should develop and implement processes to allow organization to  fully vet and commit to project endeavors for a 3/6/9 month timeline independent of project catalyst funding periods. Doing so may allow the proposer to more clearly explain technical aspects, describe the resources necessary, and to show what is being done, how it\u2019s being done and by whom. \n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "I believe that the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal relative to their organizational goals.. The proposer describes understandable measures of what they deem success to entail, and commit to delivering periodic updates to the community for auditing progress via their public Discord channel and GitHub repositories. \n\nHowever, it is my belief that the proposal could have been made stronger had it been more direct in identifying how their milestones connect/correlate to the key measures of success for this campaign briefing. As an example, auditability would have been enhanced had the proposer simultaneously commited to measures of success such as: 1) Number of communities using their DAO treasury management tools in six months; 2) Number of DAOs that use Agora tools in six months; 3) Number of transactions fees facilitated by their solutions (both inside the proposer\u2019s organization and outside) within six months; and perhaps most importantly 4) Number of DAO solutions created or enhanced within six months.\n", "q2r": 3, "assessor": "z_assessor_2358", "no_vca": 3, "ne": 0, "ng": 3, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 6842, "q0": "The challenge is to get more people to have a reason to use DAOs on Cardano.  The blockchains that have peoples attention have some tools developed that most people see as the \"standard\" for DAO tools.  Tools utilized in DAOs such as Constitution DAO(which is now defunct).  With this proposal we are addressing the make better tools solution and innovating.  The tools that ADAO has already provided before this proposal and as well as during this assessment, have clearly addressed the challenges we have.  I'm referring to the Roundtable Dapp and the staking portal.xyz that they just launched.  I strongly believe that this proposal helps us with this challenge.  ", "q0r": 4, "q1": "I would like to give a full disclosure as a first time PA that in my quest for learning I have joined their discord and become an active community member as I believe what they are working on is special.  That being said the facts of the matter are that ADAO is a very open community that develops tools for DAOs, provided education resources, and is constantly innovating.  They have been previously funded in other rounds for tools such as Summon.  They have also released open sourced tools for the community such as Roundtable, and even as this proposal has been live they released two more tools in two days.  A token staking dapp plus a early supporters claim dapp.  As far as the plan, I see well documented hours that are needed to complete the tasks.  The asking price is fair at $40 and $75 per hour.  The team of ADAO has resumes which we as a Cardano Community would be proud of if we read their bios.  I feel very strongly that their is a good team in place and that it is highly likely that this and even more, will be implemented successfully.  ", "q1r": 4, "q2": "One thing I notice about the auditing is that ADAO states that it makes tools that are open sourced, and that the discord is always open to anyone.  Not sure if thats relevant, but could be a sign of good trust.  Another item of note to audit would be that they had about 600 early supporters in discord, January earlier this year and now they are closer to 1500.  This I imagine would keep growing if they continue their success rate.  Additionally, there are some very realistic and measurable KPI's on the proposal that are easy to track.

I think it's very important.\n\n    - Here the proposed group has raised the issues that are. ADAO's community currently has more than 3,000 members and over 20 core contributors have been contributing regularly, what needs to be done now is to encourage contributions for open source development on Cardano. I find the issues raised by the group to be very relevant to the current state of the challenge.\n\n    - The solutions that the group has raised are. ADAO members are working closely with various Cardano community organizations such as Staking DAO, SCAT DAO, Liqwid Labs and many more to develop best practices, sound design and age assurance The longevity and feasibility of the team's approach, Bounty and incentive structure will be explored and implemented to drive new and exciting open source initiatives focused on development and enable decentralized communities to thrive on Cardano. I find the solutions proposed by the group very reasonable, I think these solutions will be suitable to solve the difficulties in the challenge.\n\n    - Besides, the group has also raised the risks that the proposal may face. grants and incentives to developers and non-developer contributors. The next risk is Lack of education about open source profits and business models, but the team has also outlined solutions to reduce those risks very reasonably as stated in the proposal. I find that to be reasonable.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "With section providing a detailed plan, including progress and milestones.

I find the expenses to be broken down and used as above is reasonable. however, it is not known if the group needs more contingency budget in case ADA slips.\n\n    - About providing detailed information about the people who will work on the project. here I see the group has listed 8 members. There were specific tasks assigned to each member. Through research, I found that the experience and capacity of each member is very good.

I find such indicators to be very comprehensive and specific.\n\n    - In the Success section of this project what does it look like? i saw the proposed thread mentioned some specific success indicators like, the number of ADAO open source projects in the ADAO GitHub community increased at least 2 times and the amount of bounty paid to ADAO increased at least 10 times, In addition, other successes will show up on-chain operating on Cardano using open-source applications to secure and regulate treasury, protocol parameters, and on-chain coordination. I find the successes listed above to be very relevant to the issues in the challenge. these successes also contribute to stronger ADAO Open Source Development.\n\n   - Regarding funding. this is a new proposal but is relevant to open source efforts within the ADAO Community as well as other open source organizations. and I believe this project will be as successful as the previous ones.", "q2r": 4, "assessor": "z_assessor_2856", "no_vca": 11, "ne": 0, "ng": 6, "nfo": 5, "vca_o": 1}, {"id": 12758, "q0": "The ADAO is a community is an open source community which created many applications/ solutions which are used by DAOs in the Cardano ecosystem.
