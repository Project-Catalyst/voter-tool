When products or services are developed with any input from the platform then the \u2018owners\u2019 can get paid for it. This is an interesting concept and maybe I can share one example myself, usually open source code is reused freely and the original contributors don\u2019t get paid for it but some platforms and blockchains specifically reward devs when their code is reused so this solution might incentivize more people to contribute openly not just in code but also ideas, scientific and social knowledge. For all the same reasons that open source grows very quickly due to ease of access to knowledge and composability, this can turbocharge that process with a monetary incentive and onboard more people into Cardano. How this will be implemented is still rather scarce on details but since the amount of money asked for is still reasonable, we can give it a shot and let the proposer experiment.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The team is currently only one person but has years of experience working as a software engineer so he should be able to build out the first version of his idea and test it out.

The potential added value of this version of a DKG is the BITs basic income and monetization scheme.\n\n I have my doubts that the current monetization scheme brings enough incentive on its own to pull contributors to the Cardano DKG over other alternatives, as it just takes a fee cut for referrals from hiring contributors to the graph and for selling ideas on the graph. \n\nImpact potential can be global because there are no laws or issues that I can come up with that would limit people from contributing from other countries. As usual, the most limiting factor would be what languages can the information be found in. Almost certainly the vast majority of info will be in English.\n\nScaling will depend on how effectively the DKG + BITs system can manage to process and create reliably true SSI\u2019s for people from all parts of the world. It will also depend on incentives being properly defined to be strong enough for people to be drawn to this particular DKG over others.
