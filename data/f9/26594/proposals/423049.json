The idea is to turn a group that exists, called NFT Guild, into a DAO. The group works on the following issue: our blockchain has several interesting NFT projects, but the groups of the respective projects are not connected and therefore their work is not enhanced. To solve the problem of networking, the NFT group \u201cidentifies common problems and needs, coordinates efforts, creates open spaces for discussion\u201d. In practice, this is done through Zoom meetings, which bring the community together around NFT issues. I think the idea is super necessary, our blockchain is third generation and our community, despite being active, is relatively new and can in fact become fragmented if a job is not done to bring the parts together. It is very positive as the group is made up of people who are already quite experienced and engaged in Cardano, as this greatly facilitates the act of identifying solutions for the favorable growth of the NFT ecosystem. However I think some parts of the impact could be better explained. We know that public events take place every week, but a number of points mentioned could be better clarified. For example in: \u201cWe held a general discussion about NFT Guilds operations and activities while receiving information and feedback from the community. This helps us stay close to the real needs and challenges that the NFT ecosystem and community are facing.\u201d How would the community be called/engaged to participate in such events? How are members (representatives) of NFT projects gathered? How is this initial contact established, and how does the group make everyone understand the need and benefit of this idea? What are the topics covered in the meetings? We know that they refer to the NFT ecosystem, but within this general subject, other smaller topics can still be addressed, in-depth. What would these be? Proponents also state that \u201cthe NFT Roundtables have been a great success so far and we may have a strong roster of Roundtable participants who are able to generate a strong impact on the topics discussed\u201d. Who would these strong participants be? If we had names and projects mentioned, it would be much easier to have a solid view of what has been done so far. Talking about the risks, the proponents say that the biggest danger is the lack of community engagement in the NFT Guild solutions, and that they are aware of this; to mitigate the problem they try to get involved with strong projects that can raise awareness: again it would be very beneficial if we knew what these projects are, some examples. Therefore, I think the idea is very good, but the information is passed a little incompletely in some cases, as I mentioned. That said, if we had more general detail, the proposal would certainly receive the maximum score in terms of impact.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "The proposal is indeed viable, however, more detail would still be needed in the parts of the roadmap and explanation of the funding for this topic to be ideal. The project as a whole would last 4 months, and the activities are only scored, but not explained. The meetings that the group holds would be continued (\u201chosting and organizing the weekly NFT Guild community meetings / biweekly NFT Guild roundtable meetings\u201d). Again, it would be nice if we had a breakdown of how these meetings would be done, in pre-production. For example, what would the participants be called, what day and time would it be (would there be a vote for this?), what topics would be addressed in each\u2026 problems and needs (how would this be done? Via discord and telegram channels? Who would be responsible for recording what was searched, and how would this content work in order to solve the problems raised? What would CIPs be? What would be the tools chosen to manage the project, how would the connections so fundamental in the NFT space be built? per month, and this would also facilitate auditability, as I will comment on the topic below.) Financing is also not adequately explained. We discussed what operations, tools, and services would cost $625 a week; it is also not explained why this value was set, why it is needed. We also don't have more information about why the meetings part would cost the same fixed amount of 625 dollars, we would need to know how each person presented in the team part would work, what they would do, what would be the value of their remuneration (how much would their hour cost of work). As with the explanation of the development of the project, it is not so clear why the project would have to cost the total amount requested of 30 thousand dollars. The best part of feasibility is the team presentation, it's just not perfect because we have a lot more information about some than others. For example, we have a lot of details about who Stephen Whitenstall is, we know how he relates and acts in the Cardano ecosystem, but little is known about member Felix Weber. However, good confidence in this team is transmitted from the moment we know that 1) they are already developing this project, even if not funded 2) some team members already participate in other previously funded projects, are already experienced with our technologies, and they also attach ideascale links to those proposals that have some kind of relationship with this one. In summary I think the topic information is good, but it certainly could be improved.", "q1r": 4, "q2": "The proposal is very auditable, the topic is very complete. Speaking of progress, the group's suggestion is that we join the discord channel and that we follow all the progress through the various KPIs they cite, such as the numbers of \"NFT projects following the agreed standard, NFT markets that have implemented the standard, NFT minting tools using the standard, NFT projects implementing the open source tools developed by the NFT Guild\u201d and etc. We have two very well defined things: what to audit and where to audit (Discord, Dework, Site, Twitter and GitHub). So my only suggestions here would be to have a summary of what has been done behind the scenes, that is, the activities of professionals, so that the partial results cited are obtained. How can we find out if each one was doing the tasks they were delegated, it would be positive if at the end of each month an overview of this type of information was provided to the members of our community. Other than that, I believe this part is very well guarded. The ultimate success is also defined in great detail, we know the project will have worked if we have \u201ca well-established NFT guild with an active community server with discussions and events to set standards. A Github site with freely available standards, specifications and best practices for the Cardano NFT space\u201d; a lot of engagement in virtual events/calls and also the maintenance of resources, activities and operations that speak about a healthy NFT ecosystem on our blockchain. The biggest goal is indeed to maintain a well-connected community and can make Cardano increasingly consolidate and become a relevant network for minting active tokens. What could be clearer here would be how this scenario would be proven. Will the authors of the proposal do a survey with those groups/representatives of NFT projects who participate in their calls, in order to understand how the NFT Guild would have helped in the development of their projects? It would be very interesting to hear direct feedback from some members of these teams, reporting on how they were helped by this project, what direction they took from then on and what successes were achieved since then. Really qualitative data. It would also be important for us to understand whether some challenges of the challenge would have been achieved, such as \u201cnumber of communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO authoring tools and amount of ADA coming from DAO transaction fees after implementing the solutions in this challenge\u201d. With that I suggest that the members of this project have a closing meeting, it could be by zoom, open to the community, so that we can understand through direct presentations how success would be perceived in practice. Furthermore, the auditability of the project is very solid.", "q2r": 5, "assessor": "z_assessor_2259", "no_vca": 9, "ne": 7, "ng": 2, "nfo": 0, "vca_o": 2}, {"id": 1453, "q0": "Because the NFT space is so new, discussion, innovation, creativity and discussions around what NFT\u2019s do and can do for us is a lovely idea.

Still, I consider us to be in our infancy when it comes to NFT adoption, both in successful use cases, and number of users. This perfectly validates the rationale for this proposal, its argues that there is currently low effectiveness in the NFT community in Cardano, due to similar initiatives being developed without any coordination between them. To tackle this issue, NFT guild has been developing community events involving key players within the ecosystem, and these meetings serve on one hand as a \"problem sensing\" process, but also as a collaborative process for developing different types of initiatives, whether it be a standard NFT, a jointly proposed proposal by Catalyst, amount others. As a result of this initiative, the proposal to Challenge Setting is currently being considered for selection to the next fund as \"NFT Community & Ecosystem\" as well as another proposal for the challenge \"Dapps, Products and Integrations.\". Evaluating this proposal versus what this challenge seeks, I do not find a direct connection, since the core of this proposal is to maintain the periodic meetings that have been occurring since May of this year, and according to their website, there have already been 4 meetings. However, the team preparing this proposal understands that as a consequence of these meetings, commitments will come out among the participants, which will allow in the first instance to create frameworks to structure and operationalize DAOs in Cardano, which will be available to the community in general. Having said that, I can see an alignment as a way to create platforms for an effective collaboration of different communities, but I would have preferred this to be explicitly described in the key deliverables of this proposal. Considering this, and the potential impact beyond the boundaries of this challenge, I have decided to assign a score of 4.\n", "q0r": 4, "q1": "NFT Guild began as an initiative from the Cardano Foundation, which is now led by the community. The core team of this proposal is composed of profiles that have proven over time their worth within the ecosystem in different areas. The scope of the plan provided only includes the activities planned to be executed in Q3 of this year, and the budget provided is exclusively destined to continue executing the different community meetings with different stakeholders. I would have liked to understand a little better how the team came to determine the amounts requested per type of meeting, as they are only presented at a high level, however, the values requested seem reasonable to me. It is argued that the main risk of the proposal is the low engagement of the community in the participation of events, and an appropriate mitigation countermeasure is proposed. As an element of improvement, I consider that it is necessary to deepen in methods of decision making or governance in this \"nascent\" DAO, since it is very likely that there will be discussions where stakeholders have opposing views or perhaps different priorities, which could be an element that slows down the proliferation of the objectives sought with this initiative.\n", "q1r": 5, "q2": "In this section, sufficient information is provided to strongly agree with this proposal.

It is a considerable problem and there is room for solutions.

Would a single participation in a roundtable or community call already indicate that the member was onboarded?\n\nSeveral relevant metrics were suggested that could also include targets. It would be interesting to assess the impact if the team defined a number of NFT projects and marketplaces that would adopt the standard or tools eventually created by the NFT Guild with the community.\n\nThe team indicated that the project should continue and that there is no interest in creating a business model or model that provides sustainable funding and indicated that theywill request funding from Caatalyst again in the future.", "q0r": 4, "q1": "This project is already under development, community calls have already been held and the videos are available on YouTube where different parts of the community participated, such as Cardano Foundation, Emurgo and NFT project builders from the community.
